YUGOSLAVIA
APPRAISAL OF THE BELGRADE BAR RAILWIAY PROJECT
SUNARY
i.        The Federal Government of Yugoslavia, through the Yugoslav
Investment Bank, has asked the Bank to assist in financing the completion
of the 476 km railway from Belgrade to the port of Bar on the Adriatic
Coast. The project, which would be the third Bank-financed railway project
for Yugoslavia, consists of the construction of the line, and the procure-
ment and installation of signalling, telecommuication and electric traction
equipment. The project also includes the supply of motive power and
rolling stock although Bank financing is not required for this part of the
project, nor for any expenditure prior to 1968. The Federal Government
has undertaken to expand the port facilities at Bar to the extent required
to handle efficiently all traffic including that of the new railway line.
ii        The estimated cost of the project for which the Bank's help
in financing has been requested is US$211 million equivalent, including
contingencies, over the period from January 1, 1968 until completion,
scheduled for the end of 1972. The foreign exchange component is estimated
to be between l1 and 33 percent depending on the results of international
bidding. The cost estimate is based on final engineering, except for
bridges, and actual unit costs experienced on similar projects in Yugoslavia.
The loan amount of US$50 million equivalent, which would be 23.7 percent
of the expenditure from 1968 to 1972, has been selected as the appropriate
Bank contribution to the financing of the project.
iii.      Contracts to be let after January 1, 1968 would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding with the exception of track
laying and buildings which, by their nature, are suitable only for local
procurement. Execution of the project, which is located in the Republics
of Montenegro and Serbia, would be the responsibility of the two Republics
through authority delegated by the Federal Government. Engineering and
construction supervision are within the capability of the Yugoslav Rail-
ways' Organization, which has been entrusted with the work. In addition,
the Railways intend to employ foreign consultants for design and supervision
of certain civil engineering works such as tunnelling and bridge construc-
tion.
iv.       The line will use about 14 Km of an existing line south of
Belgrade; and a total of 90 Km of the line on two sections at each end
has been constructed and is in operation. The remaining 371 km of line
has still to be constructed, though some major works have been started.
The completion of the line will provide an important transportation link
between the developed central region and the coast and also help in the
advancement of the underdeveloped zone of influence; the economic rate of
return is estimated to be about 8-1/2 percent on the investment from
January 1968 until completion.



- ii -
v.        The Railwayst earning position has not been satisfactory.
The disappointing results for 1964 and 1965 were due in the main to
delays by Government in permitting rate adjustments to offset cost
increases. The necessary increases were finally made effective during
the course of 1965. Since then, wages and prices have been rising but
no further increases in rates have been made. It has been agreed that
the Government will in the future take all such action as may be required
to enable the Railways to adjust their rates and fares promptly in
relation to costs and promptly to make them effective; that the Railways
will introduce an increase in rates and fares during the course of 1968
so as to produce additional gross operating revenues of N. Din lJJ million
in 1969 based on agreed estimates of traffic for that year; and that the
Railways will take whatever additional measures may be required, whether
increases in rates or reductions in expenses or both, to earn a return of
at least 3.5 percent in 1970 and at least 6.0 percent in 1972 and there-
after. This would be satisfactory progress toward reaching a sound
financial position.
vi.       The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$500. million to the Yugoslav Investment Bank for a term of 25 years,
including a six year period of grace which corresponds to the construction
period and the first year of operation.



YUGOSLAVIA
APPRAISAL OF THE BELGRADE BAR RAILWAY PROJECT
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Yugoslav Government, through the Yugoslav Investment Bank,
has requested a Bank loan to help finance the completion of a railway
from Belgrade to Bar, a port on the Adriatic Sea. The amount of the
proposed loan has been set at US'$ 50 million equivalent. The Yugoslav
Investment Bank was established in 1956 as the chief instrument of the
Federal Government for providing investment funds for development and
as the main channel for foreign loans. All Bank loans with the exception
of those of 1951 and 1953 have been made to the Yugoslav Investment Bank,
and in this case the proposed loan would cover part of the Federal Govern-
ment's contribution to the cost of the project.
1.02      This would be the third railway loan from the Bank to Yugoslavia
and the fifth in the transportation field.  The first railway loan, US$35
million (361-YU of October 28, 1963) was for the constrUxtion of an
electrified standard gauge line from Sarajevo to Ploce to replace a narrow
gauge line generally on the same alignment.  The new line is now in
operation with diesel traction. The completion of the project was originally
scheduled for the end of 1966 but, due to planning changes, electrification
and signalling works are not yet completed. The new schedule calls for
completion by the end of 1968, which is feasible. The second railway loan,
of US.$70 million (395-YU of December 11, 1965) was for the railway
modernization program. The execution of works for this project is not
proceeding on the original schedule due to protracted tendering procedures
and design modifications. Wgork is now proceeding satisfactorily according
to an amended schedule which calls for completion by the end of 1970.
1.03      There have been two highway projects financed by the Bank in
Yugoslavia. The first project, of US$35 million, (344-YU of June 21,
1963) was to complete the Adriatic Highway and parts of the Central High-
way. The works have been satisfactorily completed and the loan fully
disbursed. The second project, financed by a loan of US$10 million
(485-YU of February 24, 1967), was to complete and improve to modern
standards the highway between Zupanja and Opuzen, linking the Central
Highway with the Adriatic. Contracts for the work were recently awarded.
1.04      This report has been prepared by Messrs. Lubbeke, M¢Cunniff, and
Hughes, members of an appraisal mission in October 1966, and Messrs.
Lipkowitz, Hughes, Spears (FAO), and Von Gontard who appraised development
prospects in the zone of influence in July 1967.

2. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      Yugoslavia is about the same size as the Federal Republic of
Germany or the United Kingdom with an area of 255,804¢ km2. The popu-
lation is much smaller however, some 19.5 million, and is growing at an
annual rate of 1 percent.
2.02      The Gross Social Producti/in 1966 was N.Din 98.5 billion or
about US$7.9 billion equivalent; the rate of growth averaged 8.6 percent
per year from 1953 to 1964. The rapid growth during this period was due
mainly to the expansion of manufacturing industry, while agricultural
output rose much more slowly. The low growth rate of 2.3 percent in
1965 was due to a poor harvest and dislocations resulting from economic
reforms. In 1966 the growth was again 8.6 percent, due mostly to an
18 percent rise in agriculture, the result of unusually favorable weather
and application of additional inputs. GNP per capita, on the basis of
the customary national accounting concept, is estimated to be about US$500.
2.03      Yugoslavia has a federal constitution under which regional and
local governments (republics and communes) have considerable authority.
The organization of the economy is based on workers' self-management
rather than state management of the various enterprises. There has been
a substantial move towards decentralization and the economic reform of
1965 is shifting the main responsibility for investment decisions even
further from the central to local governments and enterprises.
Transportation in Yugoslavia
2.04      Yugoslaviats main communication routes have been determined by
topography and follow a longitudinal axis along the Danube, Sava and
Morava valleys. Mountain barriers have hindered communications between
the central plains and the coast. The recently completed standard gauge
railway between Ploce and Sarajevo, and the projected railway from Belgrade
to Bar, will substantially complete the railway network. The completion
of the road from Zupanja to Opuzen in 1969 and the extension of the
Adriatic Highway to Skopje will add to the highway network.
2.05      The railways are the most important transport mode in Yugoslavia,
accounting for 55 percent of the freight ton-km in 1966 (Table 1), which
was a decline from 68 percent in 1963. In terms of tons carried, there
was an increase from 72 million tons in 1963 to 76 million in 1964, falling
again to 72 million tons in 1966 (Table 2). The causes of this decline are
discussed in paragraph 3.13. Railways are also important in passenger
1/ The Gross Social Product in Yugoslavia is not comparable with the
customary measure of Gross National Product in that Government adminis-
tration and many consumer services are excluded, such as housing. GSP
would be about 70 percent of the GNP if measured by Western Standards.



transport, accounting for 62 percent of the passenger-km in 1964 and
probably about 55 percent today (Table 3). Although the railways percen-
tage share of the number of passengers by all modes of transport decreased
between 1963 and 1966 the numbers actually travelling by rail increased in
this period by 6% (Table 4). Passenger air transport has been growing
rapidly in recent years but is still insignificant (Table 3). Scheduled
air transport is provided by JAT, the national carrier, which not only
serves domestic needs but also most of Europe and points in North Africa.
Air freight is insignificant.
2.06     All forms of transport, particularly highways, have increased
their share of traffic at the expense of the railways, as is common in
many countries. Truck transport has been increasing in recent years by
an average annual rate of over 20 percent, while river transport is
becoming even more important than in the past. Even so, the railways will
remain for many years a vital part of the transport network of Yugoslavia
and will provide the most economical means of conveying many goods,
particularly bulk commodities in full carloads ower relatively long
distances.
2.07     Investment in transportation has been heavy over the last five
years, accounting for 13 percent of expenditures on fixed assets in 1962
and nearly 12 percent in 1965 (Table 5). The main investments during
the past five years have been the construction of the Central Highway,
linking Austria and Greece, the Adriatic Highway from Rijeka to Bar, the
conversion of the Sarajevo-Ploce line to standard gauge, as well as
continuing progress on railway modernization and electrification of main
lines. The Belgrade-Bar railway and continued work on electrification
and modernization of stationary installations and of motive power, and the
continuation of the Adriatic Highway to Skopje will account for most of
the investment in land transport in the next period 1967-1970. Investment
in sea transport will also be larger and is planned to account for 13.4
percent of transport capital expenditure in the period. As a result,
Yugoslavia's merchant fleet will increase from about 1 million to at least
1.4 million gross registered tons.
Transport Co-ordination
2.08     Yugoslavia has made deliberate efforts towards the co-ordination
of policies with respect to transportation rates, taxation and investment
in its recent move towards a market oriented econony.
2.09     The Railway Law stipulates that railway rates must be based on the
operating costs of moving traffic,and with minor exceptions previously
subsidized rates, such as for lignite, fertilizers and passengers, have
been abolished. Road transport firms set their own rates and the conditions
of entry to the industry are liberal. There is a high degree of competition
in transport among public carriers, who also face competition from busi-
nesses carrying their own goods. Danube and Sava river traffic is also
competitive and rates cover ship and port operating costs.



2.10     The policy of the government is to tax road and rail on the
same bases per ton-km. Railways pay taxes related to the value of
motive power, rolling stock and fixed installations (except tunnels and
substructures), while road transport enterprises pay a similar tax on
vehicles and equipment, but not on land occupied for terminals. Road
vehicle license fees are collected, and fuel taxes are paid by all users
of fuel. The end result is that both road and rail enterprises pay
taxes approximating N.Din 0.03 per ton-km.
2.11     Coordination of investment in transport is primarily the
concern of the Federal Government in the course of preparation of economic
development plans. These take into account the rationalization of the
economic structure and major transport investments are planned accordingly.
The main criterion is to provide for transportation needs at the lowest
cost to the economy.
2.12     In spite of these efforts toward  coordination there remain some
imperfections. In order to alleviate the effects of the economic reform
subsidies to railways are provided during a transitional period ending
December 31, 1970. If, for example, costs are higher than freight rates
in 1967, the Federal Government will reimburse 80 per cent of the difference.
The percentage of the subsidy will decline each year until it is eliminated
in 1971. At the present time only the railway enterprises at Skopje and
Titograd are being subsidized in this way and the total sum disbursed is
small for the railway as a whole, but amounted to 63 per cent and 113 per
cent of earned freight revenues for these enterprises, respectively.
2.13     Other subsidies are given to rail and road transport in the
provision of new lines and roads. For example, the major part of the cost
of new railway lines is financed by the Federal Government by outright
grants; no repayment or interest being required , while the Republics
finance the rest. Depreciation is in turn recovered by the enterprises in
their rates and fares but the funds are then used for rehabilitation of
other lines and equipment. New national highways are financed in a similar
manner but the investment is not recovered from road users. When the
basic highway network is completed in 1971 the responsibility for financing
will pass to the Republics. At the present time road users do not fully
cover the costs of road maintenance but the Government increased fuel taxes
in 1967 and is considering an increase in the road tax for heavy vehicles
so that maintenance costs will be fully recovered from users by 1970.
2.14     In spite of the imperfections noted above the Government is aware
of the need for transport coordination, and though highway and railway
construction will probably remain subsidized at the Federal and Republic
levels, the situation is generally improving.



3. THE RAILWAYS
Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      The organization of the Yugoslav Railways is based on the
Yugoslav concept of the workers participating in the management and sharing
in profits. The organization has changed several times in recent years;
the latest change, by the Law on the Organization of the Yugoslav Railways,
became effective on January 1, 1966.  This Law established six Railway
Transport Enterprises, each with responsibilities generally co-extensive
with the republics served: five are consolidated, one each at Belgrade,
Zagreb, Sarajevo, Skopje and Titograd, and one is an association at
Ljubljana, consisting of three regional enterprises in Slovenia. The
Railway Transport Enterprises operate the fixed assets in their area and
the motive power and rolling stock. Rates and fares are established for
each enterprise separately as explained in detail in paragraph 7.04.
3.02      Each Enterprise is managed by a Workerst Council of 20 to 50
members, depending on the size of the Enterprise, a M1anagement Board of 5
to 12 members, and a Director, as lilanager, who is a member of the Board,
but cannot be its Chairman. The 'Workers' Council meets every twro months,
the Board more frequently, as necessary. The Director is nominated and
dismissed by the Republican Executive Council. Only professionally
qualified people are eligible for nomination.
3e03      The Railway Enterprises form the Community of Yugoslav Railways,
which has an Assembly, a Board of Directors, and a General Manager who is
appointed by the Federal Executive Council. The main functions of the
Community are to ensure uniformity of operating standards, to coordinate
train schedules, to set rates for inter-enterprise and international
traffic, to ensure adequate car distribution and to collect statistics.
There are several auxiliary enterprises directly attached to the Community
of Yugoslav Railways.
3.04      The Railways staff is competent.  The management is capable and
the handling of traffic, operations and technical matters is efficient.
3.o5      The number of staff has fluctuated during the last ten years,
because some maintenance and workshop enterprises (now working units) at
one time separated themselves from the Railways, but some of them later
merged again. The performance of the staff in terms of traffic-units and
gross ton-km per employee has improved in recent years (Table 6). The
number of employees per route-km increased slightly, due mainly to extensive
work carried out under the Railway Modernization Program. All performance
figures compare reasonably well with the railways in other European countries
with similar traffic and operating conditions. * Te Railways intend that,
even with traffic increases as estimated, the labor force will be reduced
progressively from 140,951 at the end of 1966 to 121,000 by the end of 1975.
This reduction will result from modernization of signalling, marshalling
yards and traction; from the abandonment of some 2,000 km of low traffic un-
economic lines; and from mechanization and general increases in productivity.
The results would be achieved largely through normal wastage and the laying
off of unskilled and semi-skilled workers.



-6-
The various stages in the reduction of the total force between 1968 and
1975 are show below:
End of Year                Employment
1968                     132,300
1970                     128,800
1971                     124,000
1975                     121,000
The Network
3.06     The Railway system is the main artery connecting the northwest with
the southeast. The network is not extensive compared with other European
countries, Yugoslavia having only 3.6 km of standard gauge line per 100 km2,
compared with Austria 6.5, France 6.9, Hungary 9.3 and Poland 7.6. The
density of the railway system varies from 6.2 km of standard gauge lines
per 100 km2 in Slovenia to 2.8 km in Southern Serbia, and 0.4 km in Montenegro.
3.07     In 1966 the Railways operated 9,437 route km of standard gauge
and 2,1h3 route km of narrow gauge (see Table 7); 733 route km of standard
gauge are double track and 483 route km are electrified with 3,000 V, D.C.
The standard gauge system has expanded continuously since the establishment
of the Railways after the First World War; the total increase is about
2,700 km. The narrowJ gauge system grew by about 1,000 km between World War I
and 1950, but since then decreased by 969 km due to conversion to standard
gauge and abandonment of unremunerative lines. About another 300 km will
be discontinued as a result of the construction of the Belgrade-Bar line,
and studies on closing more lines are under way.
Physical Properties
3.08     Track, structures and buildings are well maintained. About 40
per cent of the standard gauge tracks are laid with rails heavier than
45 kg per m; the main line Jesenice-Ljubljana-Belgrade-Skopje has been
relaid with 49 kg rails. Track relaying of other lines with heavy traffic
is progressing. Ballast, ties, points and crossings on mainlines are in
satisfactory condition.
3.09     Most of the station yards were about 40 years old at the beginning
of the Railway Modernization Program in 1964, which includes the construc-
tion or remodeling of four major marshalling yards at Ljubljana, Zagreb,
Belgrade and Skopje and of two medium size yards at Doboj and Nis. Progress
of construction is satisfactory after initial delays due to changes in
planning. The marshalling yards will be put into operation during 1970
and substantially improve the efficiency of freight transport. Improvement
of other yards and mainline junctions is under way.
3.10     The signalling system on most lines also remained unchanged for
about 40 years; however, substantial modernization has been made in recent
years. About 150 km of automatic block with color light signals was installed
from 1961 to 1963. The installation of modern signalling and automatic block
equipment on a further 1,800 km of mainlines is part of the Nodernization
Program.

3.11      The composition of motive power and rolling stock from 1961
to 1966 is shown in Table 8 and data for 1966 are summarized below.

Freight Car Stock                         63,532     7,706
The motive power and rolling stock is generally well maintained, but a
substantial portion is far beyond its useful economic life. The 1965
percentage of steam locomotives and rolling stock in excess of 35 years
is shown below:
Standard Narrow
Gauge     Gauge
Steam locomotives                             55%       77%
Passenger cars                                31%       88%
Freight cars                                  56%       95%
A breakdown by age groups is shown in Table 9. The number of steam loco-
motives will be reduced during the Railways' 1964-1970 investment program
and the preliminary program 1971-1975 by progressive dieselization and
electrification, and the passenger car position will be improved by the
planned procurement of an adequate number of cars. The number of freight
cars to be procured by 1975 seems sufficient to meet the requirements of
increasing traffic and replacement of overage stock. However, it has been
agreed during negotiations that the Railways will undertake a study of
future freight car requirements, considering (i) the need to replace
obsolete stock, (ii) traffic increases, (iii) improved utilization of
rolling stock due to electrification, new marshalling yards, and increased
efficiency of operations, and (iv) changes in the length of hauls related
to the Sarajevo-Ploce and the Belgrade-Bar lines.  The procurement program
for the years 1971-1975 will be adjusted if this is shown to be necessary,
to ensure that an adequate number of serviceable freight cars will be
available to carry the expected traffic of the Belgrade-Bar line as well
as for traffic increases throughout the system.
3.12      Maintenance and repair facilities are adequate.  Most of the
facilities for maintenance and running repairs of steam locomotives and
some for rolling stock are old and obsolete; they are to be phased out
of service or modernized.



Traffic
3.13      The freight traffic of the railways increased by 22 percent
between 1962 and 1964 but then declined in the following two years by
6.5 percent in spite of a greater volume of traffic being moved by aJJ
forms of transport in Yugoslavia (Tables 2 and 10). The decline in
tonnage continued into 1967, the railways experiencing a 4.1 percent
decline in the first nine months of the year compared with the same
period in 1966. The greatest decreases were in coal, building materials,
cement and wood. This trend reflected the economic reform of mid-1965
when the principle was established that all prices should be based on
costs. As a result, the prices of industrial products were increased by
an average of about 13 percent and of raw materials by about 20 percent.
As inventories were run down the railways were affected more than any
other form of transport. However, during the fourth quarter of 1967
industrial production as a whole in Yugoslavia had generally recovered:
major railway traffics such as ores, metals and chemicals were back to
earlier, higher levels, while the production of building materials and
cement surged well ahead of levels set in any previous year. By September,
coal production was only slightly lower than in the same month of the
previous two years and its rate of growth was rapidly accelerating. The
outlook for the year 1968 is that overall traffic will be higher than that
of 1967 as an upturn in industrial production has begun and is expected
to continue for some time.
3.14      The traffic forecast (Table 11) indicates that coal is expected
to continue as the most important commodity for the railways. Its fore-
cast growth is based on the general expansion of heavy industry in
Yugoslavia, rather than on domestic use. Particularly important in this
respect are the lignite requirements for the production of cement, ferti-
lizers, refined ores and chemicals. The new railway line will help to
lower transport costs for lignite, which will remain a very important
input for basic industry for many years to come. Other major commodities
in the traffic forecasts are cement and building materials. At the present
time most cement plants are unfavorably located in relation to the centers
of demand. In the future it is expected that new construction of industrial
plants, power, and other infrastructure projects and housing will be
major economic activities, which, combined with relocation of plants, will
increase demand for building materials. The production and refining of
ores is also exqpected to be of continuing importance in Yugoslavia. All
these activities are reflected in the traffic forecasts. Coal, ores,
building materials, wood and other basic traffic as forecast in Table 11
cannot economically be shifted to highways. Traffic has been forecast
by commodity at moderate rates of growth, averaging 3.1 percent per year
from 1967 to 1973 when the line will be opened. From 1973 to 1975 growth
will be higher reflecting the opening of the new line before again settling
down to more normal rates.
3.15      It is expected that the average length of haul will increase
from 238 km in 1966 to 241 km in 1967. This is a continuation of a trend
established some years ago when highway transport made inroads into short
haul traffic. The decline in 1967 was temporary, due to the draw down
of local inventory stocks, mainly coal. From 1971 the average haul will
fall slightly due to new oil and cement plants (Table 11).



- 9 -
Although the Belgrade-Bar line will result in shorter hauls for part
of the traffic served, average railway hauls will then increase until
1975, reflecting increased long haul international traffic, the
continued abandonment of short narrow gauge lines, expansion of long
distance agricultural traffic and phosphate rock moving from the ports
to inland plants.
3.16      Passenger traffic has grown considerably over the last ten
years (Tables 3 and 4). A decline was experienced in 1966, continuing
into 1967, reflecting the fare increases of late 1965 when general subsi-
dies ceased. While passenger traffic is not expected to grow substan-
tially some recovery is expected in 1968 and later years and there will
be traffic promoted by the new line in 1973 (Table 12).
3.17      The traffic forecasts supplied by the Yugoslav Railways have
been carefully reviewed and are reasonable.
Operations
3.18      The Railways are well operated although they have difficulties
during peak periods in meeting the traffic demands. The main deficiecmies
which limit the system3sscapacity are: (i) the still predominant steam
traction; (ii) the largely outmoded mechanical signalling and interlocking
installations; and (iii) the obsolescence and insufficient capacity of the
marshalling yards at major traffic centers. Conditions will improve sub-
stantially after completion. f the Railway Modernization Program (paras 3.09
and 3.10).
3.19      Table 6 gives- a summary of operating statiStic8s from 1961 to
1966. It shows that the operating efficiency improved from 1961 to 1965,
but declined slightly in. 1966 due to a decline in traffic.
3.20      Average availability- of motive- pwer declined -slightly in 1966
but is still satisfactory, making allowance for the existence of electric
locomotives and railcars..which are more than 30 years old and the unsatis-
factory design of some of the older dieseL locomotives. Availahility of
paasenger and-freighL.cars.is-satisfactory.
3.21      The utization-of diese4. and electric loooaotives fluctuates
but is- i general satisfactory (Table 6). Tlh average performance of diesel.
locomotives droppad from a high of 428 engine km per engine-day to a still
satisfactory 370 ngine =-per engine-day in 1966, due to 120 diese. shunting
locomotives vitb_ lower. daily mileage being put into operation since 1964.
The utilization of stem -locomotives is- decreasing as the system is diese-
lized and electrified,- The utilization of passenger and freight cara is
satisfactory.

4. THE 1964-1970 AND 1971-1975 RAILIAY INVESTMENT PROGRAMS
4.01.      At the time of the appraisal of the Second Railway Project
in 1964, the Railways had prepared an Investment Program 1964-1970 of
which the Modernization Plan of Mainlines, partly financed from Loan
395-YU, was a part. The program was under consideration by the Federal
Executive Council in 1964, but it was not approved due to the devaluation
of the Dinar, related price increases, and shortage of funds. Investments
in 1964 and 1965 were carried out mainly with the Railways' own funds, and
from budget appropriations authorized by the Government.
4.02       A revised Investment Program, 1964-1970, including the
Modernization Plan, has now been approved by the Government. The actual
expenditures 1964-1966, the estimated expenditures 1967-1970, and the
original and revised Investment Program 1964-1970, are shown in Table 13.
The physical size of the program has been curtailed to cover price
increases. The combined effect of price increases and the devaluation
of the Dinar has been that the reduced program increased in Dinar cost by
9 per cent while its approximate UsX equivalent decreased by 30 per cent.
The Modernization Plan and the provisions for track renewal have not been
curtailed but major reductions have been made particularly in the procure-
ment of motive power and rolling stock(as shown in Table 13). The Rail-
ways intend to offset the effect of these reductions by (i) improving
utilization of existing stock and (ii) keeping obsolete stock in service.
4.03       The Railways have drafted a preliminary Program 1971-1975
under which they intend to procure rolling stock at a higher and more
satisfactory rate.  The matter is further discussed in para. 7.22.
The original and the revised program 1964-1970 and the preliminary
program 1971-1975 are shown in Table 13 and summarized below:

5. THE PROJECT
Description
5.01      The Project is the completion of the standard gauge, single
track electrified line betwfeen Belgrade and Bar (Map 1) comprising
construction works, and the procurement and installation of signalling,
telecommunication and electric traction equipment during the period
from January 1, 1966 to completion, scheduled for the end of 1972.
Included in the Project, but excluded from the cost estimates and Bank
financing is the supply of motive power and rolling stock.
Responsibility for supp4ying this equipmeut-is dealt with in
paragraph 5.15.
5.o2      The project will connect the main railway junction, Belgrade,
with the Adriatic Port of Bar and provide a more direct standard gauge
connection with South Western Serbia and Mlontenegro, replacing the present
circuitous, high cost, narrow gauge lines.
5.03      The Belgrade-Bar line will have a junction at Pozega with the
line to Kraljevo-Nis and Skopje, a rail link to South Eastern Serbia and
Macedonia which will carry considerable traffic to and from the Belgrade-
Bar line. The 32 km section Pozega-Cacak of this link is being con-
verted from narrow to standard gauge. There will be a junction at Priboj
with the narrow gauge line to Sarajevo which is to be retained for some
time. At Titograd there is a branch line to Niksic, recently converted
from narrow to standard gauge, that extends with narrow gauge to
Capljina on the recently completed Sarajevo-Ploce line.
5.04      The total distance from Belgrade to Bar is 476.1 km. The
new line branches from an existing line at Resnik, 14.2 km south of
Belgrade. Thus, from Resnik to Bar is 461.9 km of which the sections
Resnik-Vreoci (37.3 km) and Titograd-Bar (53.0 km) have been in
operation since 1959. This leaves 371.4 km of line from Vreoci to
Titograd to be constructed, including some sections which have been
under construction since 1964. The project includes the final signalling
and telecommunication, and the electric traction installations of the
othenrwise complete sections from Resnik to Vreoci and from Titograd to
Bar. The project "also includes the extension of the telecommunication
installation on the Belgrade-Resnik section, as needed for the Belgrade-
Bar line.
5.05      The alignment has been determined by studies and geological
surveys carried out by the Railways' Engineering Organization. The
final engineering is almost complete and is satisfactory. The line is
largely in mountainous terrain, part of w-rhich is very rugged and
difficult of access, resulting in the need for 353 tunnels, of which
12 are from 2 to 6 ma long, and numerous bridges and viaducts. An
outstanding civil engineering work will be the MIala Rijeka viaduct
which is to span a gorge, 450 m wide and 195 m deep.



- 12 -
5.o6      Design standards are adapted to the mountainous terrain.  The
maximum gradient is 2.5 percent on the descent from Kolasin to Titograd
over a distance of 59 km. Between Valjevo and Kolasin the maximum
gradient is 1.8 percent, and 1.2 percent between Belgrade and Valjevo;
minimum radius will be 300 m, and maximum speed 80 km/h on mountainous
sections and 120 km/h on sections with easier conditions.
5.07      The line will have electric traction with 25,000 V., A.C.
of 50 cycles, the same system as is being installed on the Sarajevo-
Ploce line and the lines Dobova-Zagreb-Belgrade-Skopje and Vrpolje-
Sarajevo. The electrification of the Belgrade-Bar line is justified in
view of (i) the high traffic density in gross ton-km per route-km per
day, (ii) the heavy power consumption in kwh per route km per year and
(iii) the availability of low cost electrie power from nearby hydroelectric
plants.
5.08      Completion of the Belgrade-Bar line will lead in the regions
served to the gradual dismantling of about 300 km of narrow gauge lines.
5.09      Completion of the project and beginning of operations is
scheduled in the following stages:
(i) Vreoci-Valjevo (40.2 km) without electric traction
and final signalling by the end of 1968;
(ii) Resnik-Vreoci-Valjevo-Titovo Uzice (163.8 km) without
electric traction, but with final signalling by the
end of 1970;
(iii) Electric traction between Resnik and Titovo Uzice by
the end of 1972; and
(iv) Titovo Uzice-Titograd-Bar (298.1 km) with electric
traction and final signalling, i.e., the completion
of the whole project, by the end of 1972.
Estimated Cost
5.10      From 1952 to the end of 1965 N. Din 300 million was expended
on the Belgrade-Bar line which would represent US$ 24 million at the
present exchange rate, or a considerably larger-amount if converted at the
exchange rates prevailing at the time. From January 1, 1966 to completion
at the end of 1972 the total estimated costs are N. Din 2,818.5 million
(Us$ 225.5 million equivalent). Estimated expenditure from January 1968
to completion is N. Din 2,637.1 million (US$ 211.0 million equivalent).
A detailed cost estimate and a schedule of expenditures is given in
Table 14. The estimate includes a N. Din 462.6 million (us$ 37.0 million
equivalent) contingencies provision, consisting of 10 percent for possible
increases in quantities and unforeseen items, and 3 percent per annum
for price increases during the period 1968 to 1972.



- 13 -
5.11      The estimate has been prepared by the Railways' Engineering
Organization and is based on final engineering except for some bridges
for which only preliminary designs have been prepared. Unit prices
correspond to those actually paid for construction of the Sarajevo-Ploce
line and other similar projects since early 1966. The estimate is
considered realistic.
5.12      The foreign exchange component will depend on the results of
international competitive bidding. The scope of international competi-
tive bidding for construction works and for supply and installation of
equipment is shown in Table 15. The range of the minimum and maximum
foreign exchange components under various assumptions and a schedule of
foreign exchange expenditure (1968-1972) is shown in Table 16. The mini-
mum foreign exchange component represents the cost of equipment which has
to be imported in any case and the cost of the services of foreign consul-
tants. The maximum foreign exchange component includes in addition to the
minimum component the foreign exchange cost of contracts subject to inter-
national competitive bidding, assuming that foreign contractors would be
successful in bidding (see note in Table 16).
5.13      Estimated expenditures on the project from January 1, 1968 to
completion in 1972 are N.Din 2,637 million, or US$211 million equiva-
lent (see Table 14), of which the proposed loan of US$50 million would
cover 23.7 percent. An estimated disbursement schedule is given in
Table 17. Of the total of US$211 million, US$37.5 million is for works
not suitable for international competitive bidding and US$31.3 million
is for works for which contracts have already been awarded after domestic
competitite bidding (paras 5.20 and 5.21). This leaves a total of
US$$142.2 million available for international competitive bidding (see
Table 15). Of this amount, the estimated minimum and maximum foreign
exchange components would be US$23.8 million and US$70.5 million
(Table 16), or 47 percent and 141 percent, respectively, of the proposed
loan.
Financing of the Project
5.14      According to the Law on Participation of the Federal Government
in Financing the Investment Works for the Completion of the Belgrade-Bar
Railway line, dated July 1966, 85 percent of the total cost of the Project
(without motive power and rolling stock and the extension of the port of
Bar) will be provided by the Federal Government, 8 percent by the Republic
of Serbia and 7 percent by the Republic of Montenegro, the latter two for
investments in their territories. The proposed Bank loan to the Yugoslav
Investment Bank would cover part of the Federal Government's contribution
to the cost of the project. Agreement has been reached during negotiations
that the Federal Government specifically undertakes to make arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank to provide the Investors (see para 5.18) with
any funds that might be needed to meet overruns of the estimated costs.



5.15      The procurement of motive power and rolling stock required for
the operation of the line will be financed from the Railways' own funds.
Part of the rolling stock would become available due to the reduced
transport needs on other lines, but the balance to carry additional
traffic would have to be procured under the Railways' Investment Program
beginning in 1971. Agreement has been reached during negotiations that
the Railways will make available the motive power and rolling stock needed
during al1 stages of construction and on completion when estimated
requirements are 44 electric main line locomotives, 8 diesel shunting
locomotives, 6 light diesel railcar sets, 92 passenger coaches and 2,000
freight cars, having a total estimated cost of US$32 million.
5.16      Extension of the port of Bar to handle the expected transit
traffic will be carried out by the port administration. The port facili-
ties to be added include I1,400 m of berths for general cargo, 930 m for
dry bulk cargo, 1,014 m of passenger berths for Italian ferry and coastal
traffic, as well as silos, open and covered storage space, bulk handling
equipment and cranes. Dredging is also planned. Financing has been
arranged for most of the required investment in the course of the present
Five-Year Plan. The estimated costs of the new facilities to be construc-
ted by 1973 are N. Din 410 million, of which N. Din 310 million will be
financed from funds of the Republic of Montenegro, and N. Din 100 million
from funds of Oil Enterprises for new oil berths. Agreement has been
reached during negotiations that financing of the port extension will be
assured and that the work will be phased to coincide with completion of
the line, so that the required port capacity will be available when the
Belgrade-Bar line begins to operate.
5.17      The loan amount of US$50 million has been selected as the
appropriate Bank contribution to the financing of the Project. It is
proposed that the full amount be provided regardless of the outcome of
the international tendering.
Administration and Execution
5.18      According to the July 1966 Law the Federal Government has trans-
ferred its right and obligations as an Investor to the Republics of Serbia
and Montenegro for the sections of line in their territories. The Railway
Transport Enterprise (RTE) Belgrade is acting as Investor on behalf of
the Republic of Serbia and the RTE Titograd on behalf of the Republic of
Montenegro; they will be responsible for the execution of works. After
completion of the Belgrade-Bar line, 304.8 km of the line in Serbia will
be administered and operated by the RTE Belgrade, and 171.3 km of the
line in Montenegro by the RTE Titograd.
5.19      The design and supervision of works have been entrusted to the
Railwayst Engineering Organization which is competent and has had
extensive experience in such work. In addition, the Investors intend



to employ foreign consultants for the supervision of certain civil
engineering works, in particular for tunnelling and major bridges and
viaducts. An agreement has been reached in negotiations on the extent
of the employment of foreign consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
,.20      Of the 371.4 km from Vreoci to Titograd which remain to be
constructed and/or to be completed, works have already started on several
sections, totalling 107.6 km. They include: (i) sections on which train
operations are planned to begin during 1968-1970; (ii) four tunnels, and
other difficult construction works which each require a construction
period of up to five years, and which would have delayed the entire
project if contracts had not been let before the end of 1966; and
(iii) construction works, located within the water reservoir of the
Potpec hydroelectric power plant, which had to be done before the
filling of the reservoir and completion of the plant in November 1966.
5.21      Contracts for the above works were awarded after domestic
competitive bidding, at a total value of US$45.8 million equivalent.
Minor construction works on 4.1 km of line, construction of buildings,
and track laying are not suitable for international tendering. All
other contracts for earthworks and structures on the remaining 259.7 km
between Valjevo and Titograd, and all contracts for the supply of rails,
points, crossings and accessories, for the supply and installation of
signalling and telecommunication equipment, and for the supply and
installation of electric traction equipment, would be subject to inter-
national competitive bidding from 1968 until completion of the line.
These contracts would be US$142.2 million equivalent or 63.1 percent of
the total cost of the project, including contingencies (Table 15). The
extent of contracts subject to international competitive bidding has
been confirmed in negotiations.
5.22      It is proposed that the loan will be disbursed in the same way
as the loans 361-YU and 395-YU, that is related to the progress at an
agreed percentage of the total expenditures from January 1, 1968 until
completion scheduled for 1972. The estimated disbursement rate is 23.7
percent, and a disbursement schedule is shown in Table 17.

6. EcoNomic JUSTIFICATION v
Economic-Geography of the_Belgrade-Bar Line'lZone of Influence
6.01      The Ljubljana - Belgrade ma3n line divides the railway network
into two parts.   The area north of the main line has a well developed
network and good i.nternational connections with Italy, Austria and Hungary,
and with Bulgaria and Greece (Flap 1).  South of the main line the connec-
tions with the Adriatic do not conveniently serve the traffic originating
to the north and southeast of Belgrade, Belgrade itself, or new traffic
which may be forthcoming from Montenegran and Western Serbian development.
6.02      The area of influence of the project line is potentially rich
in mineral and timber resources.   Sizeable deposits of minerals occur in the
vicinity of the alignment; these will be brought into production primarily for
internal consumption.   Timber of commercial quality is important, the
region having about 11 percent of the forest area of Yugoslavia    (Map 2).
Agriculture is also important though at present it is largely limited to
local consumption because of the lack of transport facilities.    There is
considerable potential for increasing agricultural production including
livestock and early fruit and vegetables if adequate transport facilities
are provided   (Map 3).
6.03      The zone of influence varies with each commodity, being affected
by such factors as costs of transport to market and comparative costs of
production.   For forestry, the zone of influence is greater than for agri-
culture and is estimated to encompass an area which had a population (1965)
of about 1.2 million as compared with about 0.9 million for agriculture,
accounting for between L&½ and 6 percent of the total population of Yugoslavia
(19.5 million in 1965).   Because industrialization is quite limited in the
area, it is not useful to measure the population proportions applicable to
an industrial zone of influence.
6.o4      In all the above cases, the area between Titograd and Bar and
between Vreoci and Belgrade were not included, because the lines on these
areas have been in operation since 1966. Consequently,
traffic which could move within those portions already completed are not
counted in the railway benefits, nor is their sunk cost included in the
investment on which an economic return is calculated.    But these areas
will also benefit from the railway and provide a market for goods produced
within the area of influence.
6.05      The present per capita income of the area to be served by the
Railway is low relative to that of Yugoslavia as a whole, and also low
compared with the per capita income within the republics which it serves.

and of "Agricultural Situation and Prospects in the Zone of Influence"
see Annex B.

In Serbia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, where 8 percent and 5 percent of the
populations respectively are affected, the present per capita incomes
are about 30 percent below the levels for Yugoslavia. In Montenegro,
where over 3/4 of the population wTill be affected, the differential
is only about 10 percent.
6.06     As part of the Five Year Plan, 1966-70, economic development
of the area is to be promoted by better utilization of the region's
natural resources in minerals, wood and agricultural land. The Railway
will serve to reduce the cost of transport both for inputs used in
production and for products shipped out. In mining, it will make possible
the use of lower-grade ores which require proportionately more processing,
thus extending the life of Imown ore deposits and possibly the utilization
of minerals previously considered uneconomic. -These possibilities have
been accorded little or no weight in the traffic projections but should
be recognized as a factor which may cause mission projections to be under-
estimates of actual future traffic, particularly for iron and non-metallics.
6.07     Similarly, for timber, reduced transport costs will have the
effect of widening the economic marketing area and/or increasing the
economic hauling distance for processing. Because some existing timber
mills have unused capacity, such output expansion is especially feasible
in the short run provided that investment in the feeder roads required
further to open the forest resources is forthcoming. It is estimated that
between 1967 and 1973 more than 500 km of additional forest feeder roads,
at a cost of over uS$6.0 million,will be required to ensure a sustained
expansion of forest production. In agriculture, the availability of good
grass lands for livestock grazing with unused carrying capacity is a
favorable factor. Improved transport for these grass lands and for crop
lands will reduce substantially costs of inputs such as fertilizers,
insecticides, etc., and reduce outward transport costs,, especially in
such respects as weight loss for livestock and spoilage for fruits and
fresh vegetables. These benefits will enable growers to tap profitable
seasonal marlkets in large communities like Belgrade or in overseas export
markets.
6.o8     Certain industries will benefit. Cement mills do not now exist
in Montenegro or Bosnia. In Serbia there are two mills at a considerable
distance from the nearest point in the Railway's area of influence. Further-
more, these Serbian mills, though operating in excess of rated capacity in
1966 were unable to supply demand. The projected plants at Kosjeric
(in southwestern Serbia) and Pljevlja (in Montenegro) would have consider-
able transport advantages within the area and even extending into Bosnia.
Certain important export industries, like magnesite refractories and
copper and brass products will gain substantial advantages improving
their competitive position. Existing paper and pulp plants winill also
improve their position both in domestic and foreign markets. On the other
hand certain industrial projects which will generate traffic for the railway
will not be appreciably aided, for example the aluminum enterprise in



- 18 -
Montenegro, since its major raw materials and inputs can already be
transported economically by the parts of the line already completed.
6.0o      The pattern of fuel consumption will change substantially.
At present, petroleum products are used in limited quantities in the area
and are supplied from distant refineries (much of Montenegro is supplied
by coastal imports from Rijeka, then transported by highway into the
interior). Southwestern Serbia is supplied from a refinery several hundred
miles away.  A new refinery at Pancevo, 18 km northeast of Belgrade will,
when completed, provide a less distant and more economical source of supply
of petroleum products when the new railway comes into operation. Regular
availability of fuel oil at lower prices will help industrial operations
and will create a transport demand now latent. As incomes in the area
increase this will likely find expression in increased industrial demands
for fuel oil while better transport facilities on the highway will also
increase demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. The Railway will also widen
the competitive area to be served by the area's coal mines at Pljevlja
and Ivangrad. The combined effect of an increased and more dependable
supply of solid and liquid fuels at lower delivered costs will help exist-
ing industries and may increase the attraction of sites in the area for
new industrial plants.
6.10      Apart from benefits arising from resources development there are
considerable savings in distance to the Adriatic Sea from the major economic
centers. At present, traffic to and from these main centers must move by
extremely circuitous routing, incurring greater movement costs than would
be the case if the Belgrade-Bar line were available. Map 1 shows that the
nearest alternative port is Ploce, and comparable distances are given below:
Distance in km
Main Economic Center              To Ploce     To Bar     Saving
Belgrade                       628         475         153
Zrenjanin                      722         569         153
Nis                            872         531         341
Kraljevo                       823         391         432
Kosovska Mitrovica             950         522         428
Skopje                       1,074         643         431
The building of the line would therefore go a considerable way towards
rationalizing the transport network and reducing costs.
6.11       The building of the Sarajevo-Ploce line was undertaken having
regard to the possibility of the Belgrade-Bar line being completed and
there has been clear demarcation between the areas of influence of both
railways. The Sarajevo-Ploce line does not rely on Belgrade-Bar traffic
for its economic justification.
6.12       The highway network in the area of influence of the railway is
being improved by links between Bar and Skopje, Bar and Belgrade, and



- 19 -
Belgrade to Kosovska Mitrovica. A comparison of vehicle operating costs
in such mountainous territory with railway operating costs and the compo-
sition of the expected railway traffic (mainly low value bulk commodities
and semi-finished products) indicates that the roads will mainly complement
the railway. It is expected that the highways will carry mainly short-haul
traffic for which the railway is unsuitable, and also supply feeder traffic
for the railway.
6.13       In order to handle the diverted and generated traffic, it is
planned to develop the Port of Bar for full operations in 1973. The port
was expected to handle about 600,000 tons in 1967, much of it to and from
the steel plant at Niksic and the industries of Titograd. Expansion of
annual capacity to 6 million tons is planned for 1973, enough to handle
more than the expected traffic.
6.14       The expansion of the port will obviate the need for construction
of additional capacity at Ploce which would be necessary if the line were
not built. Similarly, the Port of Ploce will relieve congested facilities
at Rijeka for the handling of large volumes of planned transit traffic to
and from Rumania and Austria.
Traffic on the Belgrade-Bar Railway
6.15       Traffic on the Belgrade-Bar line in 1973 is expected to be about
8 million tons, including 1.4 million tons which could be carried on
sections already completed even if no further investment were made. This
compares with total system tonnage in 1966 of 71.6 million tons (Table 10)
and a forecast of 85.5 million tons in 1973 (Table 11). A breakdown of
expected traffic on the new line is given below.

6.16      The traffic is expected to include about 4.8 million tons
moving within the area of influence, either newly generated
or diverted from narrow gauge lines or trucks.    Another 2.3 million tons
will be imported or exported via the Port of Bar rather than the best
alternative, the Port of Ploce, and about 0.9 million tons will move through
Bar from or to the area of influence.   One of the largest categories of
traffic expected to move is agricultural produce, accounting for 10 per-
cent of tonnage.   This will consist of a variety of vegetables, fruit and
livestock.   Coal and coke are important, with a 12 percent share of the
traffic, as is phosphate rock which will move from Bar to plants beyond
Belgrade.
6.17      Freight traffic on the new line has been estimated by the Railways
to double in 30 years and passenger traffic to increase by 24 percent.
These growth rates appear reasonable, having regard to the expected growth
of industrial and agricultural production, income and population.    The
annual average growth rate for freight in the first five years of the eco-
nomic life of the project would be 4 percent per annum, falling to about 1.25
percent in the last 5 years.    Passenger growth is expected to be 1 percent
annually in the first five years and 0.3 percent in the last period.    It
has not been possible to forecast individual movements for the line beyond
1973 but overall orders of magnitude based on such growth rates for the
Belgrade-Bar line can be expected to be:

Benefits
6.18      The benefits which will accrue from the project are of several
kinds. They consist largely of savings which will occur from the use of
lower cost transport as well as the inducement of traffic that cannot at
present move because of prohibitive costs or the lack of any transport
outlets.   These, and other benefits, are tabulated below:

(a) Diverted from:

Belgrade-Ploce rail route                  9.72             4.5

(b) Generated, best alternative transport being:

Narrow gauge railways                     20.01             9.4

(b)  Generated, best alternative transport being:
Bus transport                            15.99              7.5
C. Other benefits common to freight and passengers
(a)  Diverted from narrow gauge railways      36.76             17.2
(b)  Electrification of existing sections      1.94              0.9
(c)  Shorter sea transport distance to Bar     5.18              2.4
(d)  Interest savings on working capital       1.71              0.8
213.95           100.0
6.19      The methodology used in the calculation of the benefits shown
above is described in Annex A.   One main point to be emphasized here is
that while about 60 percent of the freight ton kilometers would otherwise
be carried by the Belgrade-Ploce rail route, this traffic will provide less
than 5 percent of the total railuay benefits because such savings per unit
are very small as compared with the savings on diverted truck traffic or on
generated traffic where the best alternatives are truck transport or narrow-
gauge railways.
6.20      The largest class of benefits arises from the diversion of
traffic from trucks to the railway (30 percent).    Muach of this traffic
is now moved over long distances at very high cost.    Anticipated road
improvements will not reduce costs sufficiently to make road competitive
with rail transport for the forecast traffic.    Additional benefits, not
quantified, arise from the provision of all-weather rail transport through



- 22 -
an area subject to snow blockages on the highways.    About 17 percent
of the benefits will come from the diversion of freight and passengers from
the narrow gauge railways which roughly parallel the new line for about
one-third of its length.   The operating costs alone on these lines is
about three times the costs on the new electrified line and the benefits
will be considerable.   Passengers will benefit, transferring from the
relatively high cost and slow buses, accounting for nearly fifteen per-
cent of the benefits.
6.21      Traffic newly generated by the railway will contribute substantial
benefits.   In the absence of the railway the only alternatives would be
relatively high cost road transport, narrow gauge railway lines or the
Belgrade-Ploce railway route, depending on the location and characteristics
of the traffic.   Such generated traffic accounts for N.Din. 45 million in
freight and N.Din. 16 million in passengers shown in the aboye table, or 28
percent of the first full year benefits.
6.22      Sections of the line will be opened for traffic in stages until
completion in 1973. As this occurs the parallel narrow gauge lines in
Western Serbia will be abandoned and much of the traffic will be trans-
ferred.   At the same time traffic which would otherwise move by bus or
truck will be transferred.   These benefits rise from N.Din 26 million
in 1969 to N.Din 97 million in 1972 (Annex A).
6.23      Intangible benefits of a different nature will occur, such as
the progress towards greater national cohesion with the connection of
underdeveloped Montenegro with the richer Republics, the increased safety
and reliability of an all-weather transport route and the saving in time
which will occur for freight and passengers.
6.24      The tangible benefits described above have been projected for
the economic life of the Railway by applying the traffic forecasts
described in paragraph 6.17 above.   l4aintenance costs of the line have
been deducted from these benefits for each year of operation.
6.25      The tangible net benefits thus derived have been measured
against line construction costs, including contingencies,to arrive at
the economic rate of return which is 8½2 percent, calculated from January
1, 1968 to the end of the railway's economic life of 35 years.    If the
benefits and costs are measured from January 1966, the rate of return
would be 7½2 percent.

7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Rates and Fares
7.01      The rate and fare policy of the Railways stems from the Federal
Constitution of 1963 and the Law on the Organization of the Yugoslav
Railways of January 1, 1966.    The Office of Price Controls controls all
rates and fares which are required to cover costs and to make a contributant
to investment needs.   Funds for new lines are provided as grants directly
by the Federal Government and the Governments of the Republics; and these
Governments also provide up to 50 percent of other capital needs.
7.02      An important problem confronting the Railways has been their
inability to increase rates and fares promptly to offset cost increases,
especially higher wages, because of delays in getting government authorization
through the Office of Price Controls.   Government subsidies were necessarily
provided in 1964 and 1965 until passenger fares were belatedly raised in
April 1965, and freight rates in September 1965, by amounts ranging from
32 to 40 percent.   No general rate increases have been effected since then.
7.03      It was expected, during the appraisal of the second railway project
in 1964, that the narrow legal limits within which rates and fares might
vary would be sufficiently widened to permit their timely adjustment in
accordance with changes in costs.   WAhile this expectation was not realized,
legislation is now being considered whereby the railways would be given
greater freedom in fixing rates; and it was agreed during negotiations for
the Belgrade-Bar project that the Government in the future would take such
action as may be required to enable the Railways to adjust their rates and
fares promptly in relation to costs and to make them effective promptly.
7.04      Prior to January 1, 1966 freight rates and passenger fares were
on uniform bases for all of Yugoslavia; the operating revenues were first
pooled and allocated to each enterprise on the basis of a formula designed
to permit each to cover its terminal costs and to distribute the remainder
on the basis of (i) work performed and (ii) differences in train-operating
conditions.   Beginning in 1966, each enterprise undertook to retain its
own earnings, and to establish its own level of rates and fares, based on
its own costs except for the railway transportation enterprises of Skopje
and Titograd.   These two enterprises were permitted to establish their
rates and fares on bases lower than their relatively high costs; but they
were also required to eliminate the divergence between rates and costs by
the end of 1970.   For the Skopje and Titograd enterprises, government
subsidies are provided to meet the resulting deficiency in revenues from
January 1, 1966 to December 31, 1970.



- 24 -
7.05      All carload freight traffic moves at class rates subject to a
uniform national classification. There are now eight groups of commodities,
two less than in 1964 and 1965. The relationship between them ranges from
100 to 50 The relationship is reasonable. Lower than normal rates on
lignite, fertilizer, bauxite ore, coal, firewood, fruits, vegetables and
sea food were eliminated in 1966.  There are two classes of passenger fares,
first class being double second class fares. Reduced passenger fares are
prescribed by the Government for national heroes, partisans, invalids, children
and students, among others; the Government pays the railway enterprises for
the amount of the reduction below normal fares. This payment amounted to
N. Din 45.5 million (US$ 3.6 million) in 1966.
Budgets, Accounts and Auditing
7.06      A separate budget is prepared annually by the Community of
Yugoslav Railways for the entire system, based on separate budgets for each
enterprise and coordinated with an overall working plan which consists of
an estimate of traffic demand and the financial resources, for both capital
and operating purposes, required to meet it. This coordination is completed
after discussions between the Management Board of the Community of Yugoslav
Railways and the Transport Committee of the Federal Assembly, The only
approval required is that of the Federal Secretariat.
7.07      Accounts are kept on a sound basis in accordance with a uniform
system prescribed for all commercial enterprises by the Federal Government.
Some deviation from practices customary in Western Europe occurs principally
because of (a) the decentralized organization, and (b) the periodic
supplemental payments to workers which might be considered to be an
allocation of net income. The accounts of the six enterprises have been
properly consolidated and inter-enterprise duplications have been eliminated.
The supplemental payments to workers, for the purpose of the present analysis,
have been included in operating expenses as "wages and salaries", inasmuch
as the accounts do not separately state the amounts of basic wages and
supplementary payments and the latter are progressively becoming a smaller
proportion of the total wage bill,
7.08      Straight-line depreciation is applied on all assets except land
and permanent way substructures which consist of earthworks, culverts and
everything below the ballast including supporting walls. Depreciation on
permanent way (ballast, rails, etc.), motive power and rolling stock has
been assessed also in some cases on functional bases whereby the rates of
annual depreciation increase in proportion with intensity of use. In 1966,
depreciation charges to operating expenses were 12.8 percent of gross revenues
and accumulated depreciation was 53 percent of the value of gross operating
fixed assets which were revalued in 1954, 1957, 1962 and in 1966, (see
paragraph 7.19). Depreciation allowances are adequate.



7.09      An audit of the accounts of the individual enterprises is made
at least once a year by the Service of Social Accounting, a department
of the National Bank. These enterprises are required to submit quarterly
as well as annual reports to the National Bank which issues a statement
annually, indicating the extent to which, if at all, the accounts have not
been properly kept in accordance with the prescribed uniform regulations,
and ordering remedial action, as required. The statements for 1966 have
been received. It has been agreed that the financial statements of each
of the Railway Transport Enterprises will be certified annually by the
Service of Social Accounting, and that these statements and copies of the
reports pertaining to the certification will be promptly forwarded to the
Bank.
Earnings
7.10      As with the two prior Bank loans for the Railways, the subject
of finances in this report covers the financial experience and prospects
of the six railway transport enterprises (the railway operating units) to
the exclusion of about 70 "a xiltary enterprises" which perform for some
railway enterprises such services as track, car and locomotive repairs,
trucking operations, construction, railway restaurants and holiday resorts,
designing and engineering, etc. Each auxiliary enterprise has a separate
accounting system and many of them serve industry generally as well as the
railways. The use of the accounts of only the six "operating" enterprises
makes the analysis more conservative inasmuch as the net income of the 70,
which amounted to about N. Din 32 million in 1966, is not included. Part
of this net income was derived from non-railway operations.
7.11      The 1963 and 1964 loan documents did not include a specific rate
or revenue agreement. Financial forecasts were given resulting from the

as shown in detail in Table 18. The forecasts and actual achievements in
1964, 1965 and 1966 are summarized below (in N. Din millions):

7.12      The disappointing results in 1964 and 1965 were due in the main
to delays in obtaining government authorization to increase rates and
fares in order to offset higher costs. Had actual payments by Government
in lieu of the withheld rate increases been considered as part of operating
revenue, the operating ratios in 1964 and 1965 would have been 92 and 95,
respectively. As shown above, the actual results in 1966 were also less
favorable than expected; and 1967, based on the first nine-months' experience
when net income, after all fixed charges but before debt repayments, was
actually a loss of N. Din 46 millions, is expected to be less favorable than
1966. This situation requires immediate action to improve earnings and
this matter is discussed in paragraph 7.16.
7.13     Future earnings, as estimated by the Railways and adjusted by the
Bank on the criteria stated in paragraph 7.15 (b), are set forth in detail
in Table 19 and summarized below, in millions of N. Din.

Note 1: Operating expenses include depreciation
and all income payments to workers.
7.14      Operating ratios would improve progressively from 99 in 1967
to 79 in 1975; times interest earned would be no lower than the five times
estimated for 1967 and debt service would remain good, improving progressive-
ly from 5.4 times in 1967. The return on the average net fixed assets would
progressively range upward from 0.2 percent in 1967 to 6.0 percent in 1972
and to 6.6 percent in 1975. The return calculations are related to fixed-
asset data as revalued in 1966.
7.15      The forecast of earnings is based on a number of important
assumptions:
(a) for 1968 and thereafter, the traffic forecasts discussed
in paragraphs 3.14 through 3.16;
(b)  an increase in revenues, through rate and fare adjustments,
equivalent to 3 percent as of December 1, 1968 and an
additional 5 percent as of January 1, 1971;



- 27 -
(c) the labor force reduction discussed in paragraph 3.05;
(d) annual increases in payments to workers of one percent
beginning in 1971 reflecting higher supplementary payments
over and above basic wages which are at constant 1967 levels;
(e)  constant 1967 prices for materials and supplies;
(f) any additional increases in operating costs would be promptly
offset by increases in rates and fares as necessary to achieve
the specified financial objectives.
7.16      The increases in revenues referred to in paragraph 7.15 (b) are
required, on the basis of present estimates, for the Railways to earn an
adequate rate of return on their net operating fixed assets.    To this end,
it has been agreed that the Railways will introduce an increase in rates
and fares during the course of 1968 so as to produce additional gross operat-
ing revenues of N. Din 111 million in 1969 based upon the estimates of 1969
traffic agreed during negotiations (this is approximately equivalent to the
3 percent increase referred to in paragraph 7.15 (b); and that the Railways
will take whatever additional measures may be required, whether increases
in rates or reductions in expenses, to earn 3.5 percent in 1970 and at least
6.0 percent in 1975 and thereafter.
Finances
7.17      The Railways, as all economic dnterprises in Yugoslavia, pay the
Government for the use of fixed assets assigned to them. For industry gene-
rally, the charge is six percent; but the Railways, as other public utility
enterprises, pay 1.7 percent on operating property (excluding land, permanent
way and structures such as tunnels), and six percent on social standard assets,
such as workers' housing.
7.18      Balance sheet data as of December 31, 1964/1966 and as of June 30,
1967 are shown in Table 20.   The ratios of current assets to current liabi-
lities were about 1.5:1.   The liquid ratios (current assets less stores to
current liabilities) were 1.1:1 at the end of each year, and 1.4:1 as of
June 30, 1967. Operating cash as of December 31, 1964 and 1965 was only
seven and four percent, respectively, of annual cash operating expenses
(excluding depreciation). While the liquid ratios and operating cash were
generally inadequate, ten percent of cash operating expenses, which may be
considered adequate, was available on December 31, 1966; and this improved
by June 30, 1967. The debt/equity ratios and debt service coverage have
been good.

7.19      The latest revaluation of the Railwzayst fixed assets in 1966
increased the value by more than 50 percent as shown below:

Net operating fixed assets         6,511   10,100    3,589       55.1
7.20      It has been agreed that the Railways will continue to revalue
their assets from time to time in the future to reflect realistic values.
7.21      The future finances of the Railways are shown in the balance
sheet projections, Table 21, and in the cash flow estimates, Table 22.
The ratio of current assets to current liabilities would remain at about
1.6:1 and the liquid ratio would remain at about 1.3:1 throughout the
period 1967-1975. The debt-equity ratio is estimated to remain good,
ranging from 13/87 in 1967 to 19/81 in 1969 and improving thereafter to
13/87 in 1975.
7.22      The future earnings and finances of the Yugoslav Railway
transport enterprises would improve sufficiently to permit the Railways
to establish a modernization fund beginning in 1971 with a contribution
of about N. Din 122 million in that year. The sum would grow to about
N. Din 667 million by 1975 as shown in Table 21. This amount could
be used for additional motive power, rolling stock and electrification,
among other needs, in the 1971-1975 period.
7.23      The Railways' cash needs and sources of funds, in the period
1968-1973 are set forth in Table 22 and summarized below:

7.24      Internally generated funds would amount to N. Din 13,008 million,
and after covering debt service and working capital requirements of N. Din
1,825 million there would remain some N. Din 11,183 million.    Of this
N. Din 10,543 million would be applied toward capital investments amounting
to N. Din 13,058 million, N. Din 493 million being covered by the second
railway project of 1964 and N. Din 2,022 million by foreign and domestic loans
as well as grants from republic and city governments.    The overrun total
N. Din 640 million, the amount whereby the cash position would be improved
during this period, could be used for the purpose of financing the major part
of the capital investments referred to in paragraph 7.22.    It has been agreed
that the Railways will contribute at least 50 percent of their capital needs
from internally generated funds.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND RECONMDATIONS
8.01      The Belgrade-Bar Railway Project will significantly improve, and
substantially complete, the railway transport network of Yugoslavia and permit
more economical access between the developed central regions and the coast.
It is well planned and technically sound and the cost estimates, which include
adequate allowances for contingencies, are considered to be reliable. The
economic return on the investment is somewhat less than is customary in Bank-
financed projects, but in view of the important contribution of the project to
the integration of the area served by the Railway with the remainder of the
country, the project is considered to be justified.    The Government and the
Investors are well able to execute the project effectively.
8.02      Funds for the project will be provided from budgetary sources, the
largest share to be provided by the Federal Government and the remainder by
the Republics of Montenegro and Serbia.
8.03      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Yugoslav authori-
ties on the following principal issues:
(i) staff reductions (paragraph 3.05);
(ii)  satisfactory arrangements to provide the Investors with any
funds that might be required to meet overruns of the estimated
costs (paragraph 5.14);
(iii)  adjustment of rates and fares in relation to costs (paragraph 7.03);
(iv)  targets for rate of return (paragraph 7.16) and revaluation of
fixed assets (paragraph 7.20); and
(v) contribution to capital needs from internally generated funds
(paragraph 7.24).
8.04      The Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan to the
Yugoslav Investment Bank of US$50 million equivalent for a term of 25 years,
including a grace period of 6 years.

CALCUIATION OF BENEFITS: METHODOLOGY
1.01      The building of the Belgrade-Bar railway will result in substantial
cost reductions for traffic which is diverted to it after its opening
from existing means of transport, which may be either alternative rail-
way routes or highways. Reductions in transport costs, if passed along
to the shippers, can be expected to result in new traffic which could
not move without the railway either because of the total absence of trans-
port or because of prohibitive transport costs. This new business is
generally called generated traffic. The true value of the new traffic
is the value it adds to the national economy, but such calculations
often pose great difficulties such as insufficient data. For this
reason another method of calculating benefits is used (see para 1.07).
1.02      The specific benefits of the Belgrade-Bar railway were given
in para 6.18 of the main report as follows:

1.04 Freight diverted from trucks
The largest single class of benefits results from the diversion
of traffic from trucks to the new railway.    Although the road system will
be greatly improved by 1973 whien the railway will be fully open, road
transport costs will still be high because of the mountainous territory
with its steep grades and many curves.    On the other hand, railway
operating costs will be much lower because, among other things, there
will be 353 tunnels and many bridges and viaducts meaning low grades and
minimum curvature.
Truck operating costs were originally calculated for typical
trucks now operating in the area for long distance transport, i.e. with
a carrying capacity of 22 tons and operating over good and bad roads.
Fuel taxes do not now cover the highway maintenance costs, therefore the
amount allowed for taxes was doubled to take this factor into account.
Construction costs were not allowed for because there is now a network of
roads in the area which will be improved by 1973 whether or not the line
is constructed.   The cost thus obtained was N.Din 0.11 per gross ton-km.
This was checked with three large truck operating enterprises in the
Belgrade-Bar region.   Very detailed accounting figures were obtained
from one of those enterprises and a weighted average for the fleet showed
the cost to be N.Din 0.115 for present operations in the area.    The for-
mer cost was used.
Railway operating costs for the Belgrade-Bar line were cal-
culated by the Yugoslav Railway Ehgineering Organization and agreed by
the Ivssion to be N.Din 0.02015 per gross ton-km.   This excludes line
maintenance costs which are accounted for in other calculations (para.1.12).
The main expenses included are those related to traction, stations and
depreciation of motive power and rolling stock.
The above table illustrates the following steps:
(a) The traffic forecasts for 1973 were estimated by the mission.
(b) The origin and destination points of the traffic, and vehicle
gross operating weights gave the estimate of gross ton-kin,
786 million for trucks and 725 million for the railway.
(c)  The gross ton-km, multiplied by N.Din o.ll for trucks and
N.Din 0.02 for rail gave the costs for the traffic, N.Din 86.4
million for trucks and N.Din 14.51 million for railway.
(d) Because road transport must still be used to carry goods to the
railway (an average distance of 15 km was assumed), as well as
movements from such distant places as Ivangrad and Pljevlja,
additional pickup and delivery costs were added to the rail costs
to give savings of N.Din 64.88 million.

1.05 Freight traffic diverted from Belgrade-Ploce rail route
A great deal of traffic now moves to and from Ploce from south-
eastern Yugoslavia and from regions north of Belgrade by the best alter-
native rail route. By 1973 this will be the fully operational Belgrade-
Sarajevo-Ploce line, If the Belgrade-Bar railway is built, however, it
may be expected to attract this traffic because of lower costs. It will
be seen from the above table that the costs per gross ton-km will be
higher on the new line (because of mountainous terrain) but the kilo-
meters are fewer, resulting in savings of N. Din 9.72 million. In this
instance the savings will be the traction, or movement, costs only as
overhead costs will be the same on each line. The Belgrade-Ploce rail-
way has the capacity to handle the traffic expected to be diverted and so
full savings have been taken as benefits.
1.06 Danube-Ploce river/rail route
Export and import traffic to and from the Belgrade river port
on the Danube wuuld, in the absence of the Belgrade-Bar line, move via
Ploce. Such traffic will consist of manufactured articles such as cars
and other consumer durables, farm and industrial equipment, fertilizers
and foodstuffs.  By 1973 the Danube port will have gained considerably
in importance for international traffic because of new navigational
facilities such as the Iron Gate Dam near Belgrade and the port facilities
in Belgrade are being expanded accordingly. The savings of N. Din 0.34
million have been calculated as the difference between total traction
costs on the Belgrade-Ploce route as compared with the Belgrade-Bar route.
1.07 Freight-generated
At the present time traffic in the zone of influence is not
fully developed because of prohibitive transport costs. Estimates of
traffic which would develop by 1973, if the Belgrade-Bar line were
available, were made by the Mission. The benefits were then measured
by estimating the transport cost savings which could be realized if the
Belgrade-Bar line were used rather than the best alternatives. These
values were then halved to avoid overstating benefits, which could only
be realized when transport cost reductions are reflected in delivered prices.
Traffic which would develop between 1968 and 1973 even without the railway
was regarded as normal rather than generated.
1.08 Passengers diverted and generated bus transport alternative
The assumption was made that automobile and air transport pas-
sengers would not be diverted to the Belgrade-Bar line and so no benefits
were credited to them. The best alternative transport to the line was
assumed to be the road system in the zone of influence, it being also
assumed that passengers would not use the alternative railway route to
the Adriatic from Belgrade to Ploce. (Bar not being a substitute for



ANNEX A
Page 6
Ploce for passengers in the same way as it is for freight.) Based on
considerations of regional income, population and Yugoslav experience
the Mission expects that 15 million railway passenger journeys will be
made in 1973 on the Belgrade-Bar line, (12.2 million diverted from buses
and the remainder from narrow gauge lines) and the average journey will
be 60 km. The difference between the bus and rail costs, multiplied by
the number of passenger-km, gives the total savings. Bus operating costs
are N. Din 0.90 per passenger-km compared with rail costs of N. Din 0.228.
Based on traffic counts it was then assumed that half of the traffic would
have moved by road even without the railway line, and half would be
generated.
1.09 Freight and Passengers - diverted from narrow gauge lines
Actual cost data are available for the narrow gauge lines which
are to be abandoned, and since so many of the costs are common to both
passengers and freight they were treated together. Narrow gauge lines
are three times more expensive to operate than the new line would be
because of large staff requirements and low efficiency. The lines now
carry high volumes of traffic resulting in the large saving of N. Din 36.76
million in 1973.
1.10 Other savings
About 100 km of the Belgrade-Bar line are already in diesel ope-
ration. Wihen the line is completed, but not before, it will be advantageous
to convert this 100 km to electric traction, resulting in savings. Another
saving is in the shorter steaming distance that will be necessary for ships
in taking on or discharging cargo at Bar rather than at Ploce. Based on
the steaming time involved, ships' costs and the quantity of traffic, the
savings are estimated to be N. Din 5.18 million in 1973. These savings
have been applied only to Yugoslav ships in Mediterranean trade. A further
small saving is the reduced interest on capital tied up in transporting
commodities via the Belgrade-Bar rather than the Belgrade-Ploce route.
1.11 Benefits accruing before full opening
The line will be constructed in stages resulting in a gradual
transfer of traffic from roads as well as newly generated. At the same
time the parallel narrow gauge lines will be dismantled and the scrap
materials sold.
1.12 Line Maintenance Costs
From the benefits thus derived line maintenance costs were
deducted to arrive at annual net benefits.



ANNEX A
Page 7
1413 Construction Costs
Construction costs for the line were estimated by the Yugoslav
Railways and checked by the Mission. The Mission thought that a contin-
gency factor should be added to allow for unforeseen circumstances. This
has been included in the calculations* Allowances for possible price
escalation have been excluded from the rate of return calculations, however,
as all benefits and costs have been measured in constant prices.
In order to realize the full benefits of the railway it will be
necessary to complete conversion to standard gauge of a narrow gauge
section from Cacak to Pozega in order that traffic from south-east
Yugoslavia can pass 50 km to the south of Belgrade, Although these costs
are not in the project they have been included in the rate of return cal-
culations as theee benefits could not be obtained if this expenditure
were not made. Similarly, maintenance costs for this section have been
included.
1.14 M?tive Power and Rolling Stock Costs
The railway will require additional motive power and rolling
stock to handle the expected traffic. The capital cost of this can be
treated in two ways, either by treating it in the same way as construction
costs to be measured against the net benefits, or by regarding the costs
as depreciation and included as operating costs. The latter method was
used because depreciation costs are more accurately known from experience
on the Yugoslav railways.
1.15 Port of Bar Costs
The extension of the Port of Bar to handle expected traffic is
included in the project, though the estimated costs of N. Din 410 million
are not to be financed by the Bank. Normally the costs of construction
and operation would be included with the railway costs in order to cal-
culate the rate of return on the entire project.  In this case, however,
such is not necessary. If the railway line is not built the best alter-
native route for export/import traffic would be via the Belgrade/Ploce
route. The Port of Ploce is already congested and would need similar
expansion to Bar to handle the forthcoming traffic, at appraximately the
same cost. This being so, the construction and operating costs of the
alternative ports offset each other and can be left out of the calculations.
1.16      When all net benefits and construction costs were calculated
for each year from January 1, 1968 to the end of the economic life of
the line, 2007, the resulting benefit and cost streams were discounted
to present value, giving a rate of return of 83 percent.

AGRICULTURAL SITUATION AND PROSPECTS
IN THE ZONE OF INFLUENCE
Background
1.01      Agriculture has long occupied an important position in the economy
of the zone of influence. Despite the development of industry following
World War II, it still provides the principal means of occupation and liveli-
hood, with some 60 per cent of a population of 940,000 engaged in agriculture
producing some 30 per con t of the total national income of the region.
1.02      The agricultural zone of influence of the proposed railway line has
been determined as a belt of agricultural area following the planned alignment
of the railway line, varying in width from 30 to 100 km. Its general direc-
tion is from north to south beginning in Vreoci and ending south of Titograd.
The borders of the zone of influence were adjusted to the prevailing conditions
of the mountainous terrain running either along the respective watersheds or
following administrative borders of communes as determined by the market or-
ientation of current agricultural traffic. Detailed adjustments to the border
were made during an extensive field trip which was concluded by an inspection
from the air. (Map 3)
1.03      About one-half of the agricultural zone of influence is agricultural
land comprising approximately one million hectare, of which 26 per cent is arable
land, five per cent orchards and vineyards while the rest is under meadows and
permanent pastures. The terrain is predominantly mountainous with only some
15 percent of the area in river valleys. The soils of the northern region of
the zone of influence are more productive than the remainder. The climate is
mainly continental, with warm summers, cold winters, sufficient precipita-
tion but a seasonal lack of rain during summer in the south. A Mediterranean
climate prevails only from the region around Titograd towards the Adriatic
coast. Basic data on the agricultural zone of influence are given in Table
Be1.
1.04      The major portion of the agricultural land is hilly terrain rising
to 1,200 meters. Extensive meadows and up-land pastures make possible live-
stock raising which besides fruit and potato provides some surplus for the
market. The lower slopes and river valleys are devoted mainly to cereal
production.
1.05      Land tenure and agricultural production falls into two sectors,
social and private. The social sector comprises social estates, farms, agro-
industrial enterprises and general cooperatives and occupies about four per
cent of the agricultural area. This proportion is only about one-third of
the national average. The general cooperatives are important because they
represent the sole source from which private farmers may obtain, on a con-
tractual basis, credit, machinery, inputs, other services and technical advice.



ANNEX B
Page 2
l.O6      The private sector is composed of owner farmers who work the major
portion of the agricultural area and who are largely self-sufficient0 Their
holdings are small and average four to five hectare in size of agricultural
land and are often fragmented.
1.07      Output levels for major crops and livestock products over the years
have remained at or below the overall Yugoslav averages. Yields are largely
governed by climatic effects which account for their fluctuations from year
to year. Crop yield trends in the private sector are shown in the following

1.08       1964 and 1965 were average to relatively poor crop years.  As a
result of general development efforts yield levels have been raised slightly
also in the zone of influence in the past few years. Yields in the social
sector which has to date received the largest part of new inputs are about 80
to 100per centhigher than on private holdings. Crop production levels in
the private sector are similar to those achieved in other South European
countriesp with small holding structure.

Page 3
1.09      Fruit and livestock production show a siitilar pattern of growth
during past years, but yields of milk, meat and wool per animal are lower in
Montenegro than in the northern region of the zone.
1 10      The agricultural zone of influence of the proposed railway line is
self-sufficient in meat, milk products, fruit and vegetables including pota-
toes; it is deficient in cereals, sugar and cattle feed (Table Bo2)o Fruit
(fresh, dried and processed) followed by vegetables and meat represent the
important items of marketable surplus, while foodgrains, maize and animal
feed are the main commodities imported into the region. Some part of the
marketable surplus, in particular fruit, fruit products, meat and potatoes is
exported to Western Europe and Mediterranean countries.
],.&U    The use of fertilizers in the region is estimated to have reached
about 155 kg per hectare of cultivatable area which is approximately 60 kg
below the Yugoslavian average, Fertilizer usage is particularly low in
Montenegro compared with the Serbian region of the zone. Improved varieties
of wheat and maize for general cultivation and high yielding grass-clover
mixtures for meadow melioration and improved planting material for orchard
renewal, have been introduced more widely in the Serbian part of the zone
of influence than in Montenegro. The introduction of well adapted cattle,
pig and sheep breeds from foreign countries and the use of artificial insemin-
ation is also more advanced in Serbia than in Montenegro which still depends
largely on local breeds with low productivity. Agricultural draught power
is mainly supplied by horses and cattle while the tractor density is only
one tractor for each 220 ha of arable land.
Stagnation in Agriculture
1.12       The main routes of communication in Yugoslavia have been conditioned
by the country's terrain. They have followed the easy paths and have avoided
the mountain barriers in Serbia and Montenegro. As a result, the predominantly
mountainous agricultural area of the two republics which falls in the zone of
influence has been relatively isolated from the country's communication system,
except in the northern part near Belgrade. The secondary and other low grade
roads and few narrow gauge lines which predominate in this area of difficult
communication are inadequate to satisfy present needs for agricultural de-
velopment. Access to markets is limited both for supply of inputs and dispo-
sal of agricultural output. As a result, agriculture in the zone of influence
is still backward in comparison with other areas of Yugoslavia. Modern tech-
niques are not uniformly applied; fertilizer use continues to be low and
crop yields are static, The agricultural stagnation, which has been overcome
in other parts of the country, has continued in large areas of the zone of
influence. The region is a deficit area for some basic agricultural produce
despite the fact that agricultural land per capita is higher than the national
average at 1.1 ha and 0.74 ha respectively.
Scope for Development
1.13      A comparison between crop and livestock productinn data in the social
and private sectors shows a large potential for increasing yields on the private



ANNEX B
Page 4
farms which predominate in the zone of influence. This potential can be
tapped by greater use of industrial inputs, in particular fertilizers, farm
machinery, improved seed and animal feed and by raising the productivity of
existing livestock through imported breeding material. There is little scope
for increasing the area under cultivation.
1.14      Urban settlements have grown fast in recent years in the zone of
influence and there has been a steady movement of population from agricultural
to non-agricultural activities. Despite this movement a part of the rural
population is still considered to be underemployed and official opinion is that
further transfer from agriculture would be possible without adversely affecting
agricultural development.
lel5      The general cooperatives which have been established in the area
during recent years appear to be effective institutions through which to
foster the agricultural development. Some enlargement of the areas cultivated
by cooperatives is possible by acquiring land from out-going farmers and ex-
tending cooperatively managed fruit plantations and pastures. An important
contribution to increasing agricultural production could come from extending
the system of contracts between the general cooperatives and the private
sector. This contract system gives to private farmers the opportunity to
buy needed inputs; it provides machinery on loan and promotes better manage-
ment through its extension service. The general cooperatives coordinate the
production of many small units, collecting, processing and marketing their
produce. They are also instrumental in pooling a part of farmers' savings
and could be the main suppliers of necessary farm working capital. General
cooperatives have produced quick results in other parts of the country.
1el6      Other institutional arrangements including agricultural research
and education facilities and a number of well equipped food processing enter-
prises are already established in the area. Their current capacity is
sufficient to support the beginning of an incraased rate of development. The
capacity of one of the larger processing units is at present underutilized,
due to lack of supplies.
1;17      A further incentive to increase agricultural production and to over-
come the inherent stagnation in agriculture would be achieved by improving
the underdeveloped communication system and by providing adequate transport
facilities to markets which now can only be reached at prohibitive cost. Pro-
vision of relatively cheap transport through the proposed Belgrade-Bar rail-
way line is considered essential to stimulate the increased use of agricul-
tural inputs and to promote increased production of fruit and bulk vegetables,
including potatoes, for which growing conditions in the area are very suit-
able. In particular, early vegetables and fruit produced in the southern
region of the zone would be benefited. The market advantage of an early
growing season, which is one to four weeks earlier than in the rest of the
country could then be fully exploited.
1.18       Rural road construction is the responsibility of the local admin-
istration and is undertaken to a varying extent in the majority of communes
within the zone of influence. Minimum plans are generally to have gravelled



ANNEX B
Page 5
access roads by 1970, permitting the passage of a seven ton truck from all
settlements in the area to administrative and marketing centres. Provision
of finance for rural road construction seems to be adequate. Grants and
loans are available from the federation and the respective republics, supple-
ir,ented from the comiiunest own funds and free labor supplied by farmers through
coo-arative effort, Several coamiune officials indicated that investment in
rural road construction would be stepped up and permanent paving of roads
undertaken to facilitate heavier traffic immediately the construction of the
Belgrade-Bar railway line is decided. Current activities and future plans to
improve the access and feeder road system inside the zone of influence appear
to be satisfactory to serve the needs of expected agricultural development.
1.19      Information on the value of investment in the important private
sector in the zone of influence is scanty. Better data is available from the
social sector and it is roughly estimated that this sector absorbs some 60 per
cent of the total agricultural investment available. Investment in the social
sectors is shown in new Dinars per ha of agricultural area in the following
table for Montenegro and Yugoslavia as a whole:
Agricultural investment in the social sector
(new dinars)
Montenegro            Yugoslavia
1961           32.89               72.43
1962           33.20               80.08
1963           30.88               96.89
1964           34.24              U15.75
The level of social sector investment in Montenegro is thus stagnant and very
low in comparison with the overall average hectare investment rate. The main
reasons for this comparatively low investment rate, according to official
opinion, is the remoteness of the area resulting in a lack of viable projects.
Investment performance in the Serbian part of the zone of influence is esti-
mated to have been slightly higher but is also below the country's average.
1.20      The authorities have plans to make up the leeway but sufficient
investment is likely to be provided only when it is assured that the Belgrade-
Bar railwray line comes into operation. Under this condition the Federal
Agricultural Investment Bank, which arranges 95 per cent of the current in-
vestment, would be prepared to make available 530 million new Dinar for each
of two three-year development periods, or on an average 175.70 new Dinar
annually per ha.  This approximately corresponds with the current investment
rate in Vojvodina, which is estimated to grow further during coming years.
1;21      Available resources are to be devoted to farm machinery and equip-
ment and livestock purchases, meadow melioration, orchard rehabilitation,
farm buildings, rural and forestry roads, food processing facilities, slaughter
houses, storage and refrigeration installations plus land melioration and
irrigation mainly in Montenegro. While the planned investment targets for
agriculture in the zone of influence appear to be rather ambitious compared
with past performance, provided appropriate measures are taken, the invest-
ment targets in the agricultural sector seem feasible.



ANNEX B
Page 6
Changes in Agricultural Pattern
1.22      The operation of the proposed Belgrade-Bar railway line and other
improvements of the infrastructure supported by the planned agricultural in-
vestment are expected to bring about changes in the current land use pattern.
The important change which can be expected is the extension and intensifica-
tion of forage, vegetable and fruit production at the expense of other crops,
which are now mainly grown for home consumption. Cereal cultivation with
probable higher yields resulting from better use of inputs is likely to be
retained only when rotational considerations and the equalization of farm
work load during the season require it. The area under cereals is now approx-
imately 170,000 ha in the zone of influence. It can be expected that at least
70,000 ha of this area could be made available for forage, vegetable and
potato cultivation. The healthy climate in hilly regions is well suited to
extend the cultivation of seed potatoes.
1.23      An increase in the area under permanent fruit plantations, mainly
plums, is also feasible by replanting suitable land which is now used as
pasture. By tapping the reserves of such land it appears to be possible to
dauble the present area under orchards from approximately 49,000 to 100,000
ha. A beginning in this direction has already been made through cooperative
effort.
1.24      The tangible increases of expected agricultural output would, however,
come from the intensification of agriculture through the increased use of in-
puts, the improvement of forage cultivation and preservation, improvement of
livestcck and the introduction of better management through extension work.
Expected increase in output
1.25      Considering the agricultural potential, the probable and adequate
investment provisions and the possible changes in the agricultural pattern it
seems likely that the current agricultural gross output could be increased
by 50 per cent by 1973. The marketable surplus needing commercial transporta-
tion over longer distances would more than double. After that period a normal
growth rate of agricultural output similar to other comparable areas could be
expected for the zone of influence.
Fertilizers and other Inputs
1.26      Yugoslavia's fertilizer consumption is moderate compared with that
of neighbouring countries (Tables B.3 and B.4). The planned growth rate in
consumption is in proportion to past performance and it is possible that
the set targets can be reached. It can be expected that fertilizer con-
sumption in the zone of influence will follow a similar trend and it is con-
servatively estimated that by 1973 200,000 tons of fertilizers will be used,
provided rail transport is available. This would represent an increase in
fertilizer usage of some 200 kg over current levels to 350 kg per hectare of
cultivalable land. It compares with an application of 400 kg per hectare
anticipated by the Agricultural Development Plan for Yugoslavia as a whole
at the same period. In estimating future fertilizer consumption account was



ANNEX B
Page 7
taken of farm supplies in plant nutrients coming from animal dung and the
expected high percentage of fodder legumes grown on the arable land and
meliorated meadows, which need less nitrogen than other field crops.
127      The estimation of future animal feed requirements is rendered more
difficult because current average consumption levels of livestock, which
are almost totally confined to the private sector, are not readily available.
The basic feed for pig fattening, which is an important activity in the zone
of influence, is cereals and it is estimated that the major portion, after
satisfying human consumption, of current cereal production is utilized this
way.  Concentrates for cattle fattening and milk production, particularly
protein, are also needed. A rough estimate which includes the current cereal
production minus what is used for human consumption, shows that there is a
shortage of approximately 80,000 tons of animal feed including concentrates
in the zone of influence.  It is likely that the deficit would reach 160,000
tons by 1973 if railway transport with relatively low freight rates were
available.
Agricultural Produce needing Transport
1.28      It has been stated earlier that the marketable surplus of agri-
cultural produce in the zone of influence is expected to more than double
as a result of the impact of the proposed railway line and related develop-
ment efforts, A detailed estimation for the major surplus produce based on
data collected from communes is given in Table B.5. The targets for marketable
commodities are rough estimates, They reflect approximately what could be
produced and are within the possibilities of the agricultural potential in the
zone. Like fertilizers and animal feed it is expected that bulky commodities
such as vegetables including potatoes and the major portion of less perish-
able produce, in particular processed food and meat, would be transported by
rail. On the other hand, early vegetables and fruit which have to reach
markets quickly are likely to take the road. It is difficult to estimate
exactly the distribution of goods between the two major carriers. Consider-
ing the difficult terrain through which roads in the zone of influence run,
as well as the transport work, it is assumed that not more than 50 percent
of the agricultural produce would go by road transport and that the remaining
half would be transported on the proposed Belgrade-Bar railway line.
1.29      The expected development of agriculture would not only generate
traffic for the railway but also improve the earnings from agriculture. The
opportunity to produce competetively more of high value livestock products
and of early vegetable and fruit crops would increase returns from farming
considerably. These possibilities were not considered in the economic pro-
jections of the railway but may be regarded as an important benefit to the
economy of the zone.
