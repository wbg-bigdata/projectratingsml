MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
MADAGASCAR FOR A SOCIAL FUND H PROJECT
1. I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Madagascar for SDR 25.5 million, the
equivalent of US$40.0 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to
finance the Social Fund II Project.
2. Country and Sector Background. Madagascar is a striking example of unfulfilled
economic potential. The country's varied assets include: low-wage and trainable labor;
good soils and climate; a rich eco-system that could attract substantially more tourism; and
low population density (12 million inhabitants on a land area of 587,000 square
kilometers). Yet, past economic policies and demographic growth of nearly 3% a year
have led to two decades of economic decline, during which per capita GDP plummeted by
40%. Agriculture dominates the economy, constituting a third of GDP and 60% of export
earnings, and is the main source of income for 80% of the population. The industrial
sector accounts for only 14% of GDP but is on the verge of change: due to policy reforms
introduced in the mid-to-late 1980s, the sector is becoming increasingly private-owned
and export-oriented. On the political front -- and despite its economic difficulties --
Madagascar has made a successful and peaceful transition from an authoritarian state to a
pluralistic democracy, largely due to the consensus ethics of the Malagasy society.
However, the same search for consensus (this time among members of the ruling coalition)
has delayed the emergence of clear-cut decisions on economic reform.
3. Poverty and Social Conditions. Poverty has been increasing steadily in Madagascar
since the early 1960s.' An estimated 54% of the population was living below the poverty
line in 1993 (using a poverty line reflecting only 90% of the FAO-recommended daily
caloric intake). Rural areas are estimated to account for 92% of the poor. The quality of
basic education and health services has declined sharply: Madagascar is one of the few
countries in the developing world where younger generations are likely to fare worse than
their parents in terms of educational attainment. The infant mortality rate is 107 per 1000
live births in rural areas and 75 in urban areas. Vaccination coverage of children aged 3 to
60 months is 36% which is low even by sub-Saharan African standards. Between 45%
and 49% of children are malnourished (measured as two standard deviations below the
international norms of height or weight for age). Housing conditions are poor, with 53%
of households living in a single room and poor households crowded in at the rate of 6

Madagascar Social Fund II Proiect  Memorandum of the President    Page 2
persons per room. Over 60% of households obtain their water from easily polluted
sources such as lakes, rivers and ponds, and an additional 10% depend on public taps.
4. Government Strategy Addressing Poverty. The Government has long stated that
poverty reduction is a cornerstone of its agenda. Concrete steps recently taken in that
direction include implementation of the ongoing Food Security and Nutrition project,
approved in 1993, and the decision to float the Malagasy Franc (FMG) in May 1995,
aimed at improving the rural terms of trade. Economic policies are also becoming more
liberal. These changes should foster sustainable, poverty-reducing growth in the long run.
Such an outcome requires first and foremost that Madagascar create the conditions for
sustainable growth, by removing constraints to private sector-led development and by
investing in such essential complements as physical infrastructure and human capital.
During this transition, Madagascar's large and growing numbers of poor will require
attention. The Government has requested donor support to establish a modest social
safety net, including labor-intensive works, targeted nutrition programs and support for
workers rendered jobless by public sector restructuring. The proposed project is a part of
these poverty alleviation efforts and draws on the successful experience of the ongoing
project. The Government is also contemplating the extension of the activities of the
existing AGETIPA (Urban Works Development Agency) into municipalities outside
Antananarivo. In addition, the process of reallocating public expenditures in favor of
priority areas has already started in the context of the government's macroeconomic
dialogue with the Bank and IMF.
5. Project Objectives. The proposed project's objectives are to provide transitional
income support and in-kind services and encourage community development initiatives
through partnership with beneficiary communities and NGOs. To that end, the proposed
project seeks to help finance activities that would: create employment; develop health and
education facilities; assist farmers by building farm-to-market roads, protecting land
against soil erosion and developing arable land; and promote private sector activity,
particularly for micro and small enterprises (see Para. 19 and Annex C for summary and
year-by-year quantitative targets, respectively.)
6. Project Description. The proposed project will support the nationwide expansion of
the activities of the I onds d 'Interveltion pouir le D6veIoppement (FID), a social fund
currently engaged in poverty alleviation activities in two of Madagascar's six provinces.
FID was created under the Food Security and Nutrition Project as a means to channel part
of the project's resources to address poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition; it is
expected to run out of funds beginning in 1996. The proposed project is based on the
successful approach of this ongoing project and therefore best described in terms of FID's
purpose, setup and achievements (Box 1). An illustration of a FID subproject is provided
in Box 2. Total project costs are US$45.4 million and have been established on the basis
of the rate of execution achieved by FID to date.



Madaeascar Social Fund II Project     Memorandum of the President                     Page  3
Box 1. The FID approach
Purpose. FID is a social fund which provides grants to local communities for carrying out subprojects aimed at
developing local small infrastructure, micro enterprises and other sustainable income-generating activities. FID also
helps the communities and participating NGOs in preparing and appraising, and eventually executing, subprojects.
Where work is to be contracted out, FID takes charge of bidding and supervision. As demonstrated since its
inception, the fund is an effective mechanism to create employment (in carrying out infrastrunture works), develop
private sector activity and capacity (by providing technical assistance, training and credit to micro-enterprises), and
support social services (through construction, rehabilitation and provision of supplies in the health, education,
water/sanitation and housing sectors).
Operational Features. Significant features of FID funding are as follows:
-- Funding cap per subproject: A maximum of US$50,000 equivalent (US$100,000 for transport infrastructure
subprojects).
-- Criteria for subproject selection: Poorer areas receive priority. All subprojects must demonstrate community
support by incorporating some form of local contribution. Some economic analysis is required for
productive sector subprojects, such as traffic flow analysis in the case of transport infrastructure.
Environmental assessments are also required where relevant (e.g., road projects or those involving
reforestation and erosion control).
--Activities not eligibleforfunding: Recurrent activities or subprojects that: are of an emergency nature; already
receive funding from other sources; have been eliminated from government or local authorities'
investment programs; negatively impact the enviromnent; or are too sophisticated or heavily mechanized.
-- Type of FlDfunding: Grants and "loans" are provided. For income-generating activities, beneficiaries are
required to repay funds provided for equipment and working capital (training would be a grant), with
interest at market rates. Repaid funds flow through FID (to help ensure that repayment takes place)
and back to a conmmunity fund to finance similar activities (also see Para. 8).
Achievements. To date, FID has achieved the following results:
*   over 25 km of roads;
*   facilities to irrigate 1,902 hectares of rice land;
*   1,005 linear meters of bridges and crossings;
*   4,338 square meters of schools and clinics;
*   protection of 469 hectares of agricultural land from erosion;
*   rehabilitation of 28,815 square meters of markets; and
*   creation of 213,000 person-days of temporary employment.
These positive results are due to a combination of factors, some common to many social funds and others representing
an innovative approach. First, subprojects are demand-driven. Second, autonomy from the government leaves
FID) largely unregulated and unencunibered by bureaucratic procedures. FID also relies on strong partnership with
NGOs, recognizing their key role in anti-poverty efforts in Madagascar. Further, subproject ownership is
strengthened through beneficiary involvement at all stages and empowerment of communities, by allowing them
to make their own decisions and putting in place a dynamic management structure capable of quickly respoi.ding to
beneflciary requests. Finally, FID benefits from its emphasis on capacity building (among NGOs, micro-enterprises
and municipal governments) as well as its decentralized structure, which has strengthened management and
implementation of subprojects.

Box 2: A IFID Subproject Improves the Quality of Life in a Remote Area
The province of Toliary is considered among the country's most vulnerable. Yet, a mix of interventions by Ffl)
in this area is making a difference to the lives of ordinary pcople. In one remote sub-region, FID has rehabilitated a
road, opening up a rich agricultural area once poor largely because of lack of access to the market. This road has
also opened up a picturesque lake in the area to some tourism. In the samc area, FID rehabilitated a school using
local materials provided by the community, and the design of the school has won praise from the communitv as it is
sturdy yet simple. In this hot region without electricity, the school's design allows good ventilation and natural light,
unlike the old structure which it replaced. The sub-region has also benefited from micro-irrigation projects.  The
package of interventions by FID has visibly altered the quality of life in this remote comer of Madagascar.
7.   Project Implementation. FID  has had a strong record in implementation -- over 140
subprojects have been financed to date (see summary of project achievements in Box I).
FID's operations are guided  by  an  implementation  manual approved  by  IDA  and  the
Government, covering: (a) subproject selection criteria; (b) model agreements and
contracts; (c) procurement procedures; (d) financial management procedures; and (e)
administrative  procedures.   Subproject proposals, prepared  by  communities  with  the
participation of NGOs, are appraised by regional staff and presented to a Regional
Advisory   Committee   for  comments.                 Implementation   responsibilities,  by   size  of
subproject, are shown in Table 1. Depending on the amount of financing requested,
subprojects are approved either by the Regional Director, Executive Director or Board of
Directors. Contracting is done by FID according to its manual of procedures, prepared in
line with Bank guidelines. Modalities of the credit operations are being reviewed as part
of the overall review of FID's operating procedures, and a revised manual of procedures
will be prepared for the new project (see Para. 13).

8. Annual financial and technical audits will be carried out by external auditors as an
integral part of monitoring and evaluation. In addition, FID will use subproject impact
surveys and beneficiary assessment surveys on an ongoing basis to monitor project impact.
Finally, two external impact evaluations will be carried out: one during the mid-term
review, and the other, one or two years after final subproject commissioning.
9. Project Sustainability.   FID  contributes in several ways to the sustainable
development of poorer communities in Madagascar. It helps build local capacity and
supports subprojects of particular interest to the communities, as reflected in community
contributions of up to 30%.  Furthermore, income-generating activities help build
community funds, which are regenerated regularly by repayments (including interest) from
former recipients of amounts "loaned" for equipment and working capital. FID also
prioritizes rehabilitation over construction, which should hold down incremental recurrent
costs and thus further promote sustainability; indeed, the fund would finance new
infrastructure only where the community commits to its proper maintenance. A Bank-
supported study on municipal financing will, inter alia, examine the possibility of a long-
term financial partnership between local governments and FID in developing local
infrastructure. The study's recommendations on the role of FID will be reflected in
revised project procedures at the mid-term review.
10. With respect to FID's own sustainability, IDA has thus far been its main donor but
other donors (such as France and UNDP) have now expressed interest in financing the
fund. The Government is also committed to a major social safety net program financed
entirely out of its own resources, and is considering using FID for implementing one part
of it. FID's contribution to poverty alleviation in Madagascar is likely to remain important
until policies aimed at growth take effect and the central administration is able to service
the needs of local communities effectively. It is not intended as a permanent institutional
arrangement.
11. Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. As mentioned earlier, the
ongoing Food Security and Nutrition project provides the model for a successful
partnership among NGOs, communities and local authorities. It demonstrates the power
of demand-driven activities focused on the beneficiary community. Critical elements of
success have included: (a) involvement of beneficiaries at all stages; (b) systematic
regional launch workshops involving all stakeholders, from cabinet ministers to poor
farmers; (c) a decisive executive director who recruited competent staff, set them
responsibilities and targets, and allowed them to work independently while monitoring
performance in relation to agreed outcomes; and (d) the organization of FID along
private sector lines, staffed with dynamic and competent managers.  Based on this
experience, few changes in approach are envisaged. Some rural roads have had difficulty
in withstanding the rainy season. The poor quality of such works stems partly from the
fund's mandate to develop untested small businesses and micro-enterprises.  New
construction techniques and methods are being tested in collaboration with the staff of
other projects, to help resolve this problem. There have been other weaknesses, in



Madagascar Social Fund II Project  Memorandum of tlze President   Pape 6
marketing and cash-flow management, faced by subprojects aimed at micro-enterprise
development. Revisions to the manual of procedures will address these concerns, with
guidelines ranging from financial controls to road standards (see Para. 13).
12. Rationale for IDA Involvement. Tackling poverty is a cornerstone of the Bank
Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which was discussed by the Board on July
18 1994. The strategy's overarching objectives are to help the government promote
private sector- and export-led growth, attack poverty directly, improve natural resource
management, build local capacity and improve project implementation. Within its scope,
the proposed project (cited in Para. 29 of the CAS) supports each of these objectives. It
also contains the elements identified in the CAS as important to combating poverty in
Madagascar: labor-intensive growth, particularly in the agricultural and rural infrastructure
sectors; employment generation; and development of human capital. As demonstrated by
the results achieved by FID under the ongoing project, IDA can play a significant catalytic
role in community development efforts targeted at the poor. The proposed project seeks
to extend this role geographically and in scale, while providing an important vehicle for the
increased involvement of NGOs in IDA-financed projects in Madagascar.
13. Agreed Actions. Agreements reached during negotiations include: (a) the articles
of agreement, the by-laws and the manual of procedures of FID, and the Framework
Agreement between the government and the FID will, throughout project implementation,
be acceptable to IDA; (b) the positions of Executive Director, Deputy Executive Director
and Regional Directors of FID will be filled at all times by personnel having qualifications
and experience satisfactory to IDA; and (c) FID will, by June 30, 1996, adopt a revised
manual of procedures to reflect the experience of the ongoing project, on the basis of
studies currently under way.  Conditions for effectiveness include the signing of the
Framework Agreement between the Government and FID.
14. Program of Targeted Interventions (PTI). The proposed project is part of the PTI
as it targets poor people and poor sub-regions through community-based development
activities.
15. Participatory Approach. The proposed project will continue the use of extensive
consultation with NGOs and beneficiary assessment surveys along the lines pioneered
under the ongoing project. Subprojects are reviewed by regional advisory committees,
which include representatives of Government, NGOs and the for-profit private sector.
Special workshops with NGOs are also being organized. In addition, regular beneficiary
assessment surveys will be undertaken as a standard activity of FID.
16. Program Objective Categories. The applicable categories are poverty reduction
and capacity building.
17. Environmental Aspects. The project is rated "C". Some subprojects are expected
to include components for protection of land against erosion, which should have a positive
impact on the environment, others are not expected to have any significant environmental
impact. Subprojects will be subject to environmental impact analysis where applicable.



Madagascar Social Fund II Proiect  Memorandum of the President      Page  7
18. Project Benerits. The overall economic rate of return is expected to be well above
15%. The actual rate of return will depend on the final distribution among different types
of subprojects as FID is demand driven.  Subprojects in transport infrastructure and in
productive infrastructure such as micro-irrigation are required to meet a 15% economic
rate of return threshold. Based on the experience of the ongoing project, such subprojects
are likely to account for 80% of the funding. Financial rates of return of at least 20% are
required for subprojects aimed at income-generating activities or support to the private
sector. On the other hand, environmental and social infrastructure subprojects are not
subject to rate of return criteria. Underlying rates of return on subprojects involving
schools and clinics are expected to be quite high (although not explicitly calculated), as
these structures are to rehabilitated, rather than built.
19. The project seeks to alleviate poverty while building capacity for development
activities among local communities and NGOs. Specifically, the project expects to: (a)
create about 5 million person-days of temporary employment on infrastructure projects;
(b) develop health and education facilities; (c) develop 1,000 kilometers of farm-to-market
roads; (c) provide protection for 16,000 hectares threatened by soil erosion; (d) develop
30,000 hectares of arable land; (e) finance 1,200 contracts with micro and small
enterprises as well as another 200 with artisans and skilled daily workers; and (f) create
approximately 2,700 permanent jobs. These projections are based on the experience to
date of the ongoing project but are tentative, as FID's operations are demand-driven and
estimation of the distribution across subproject types is difficult, particularly for new
regions.
20. Diverse constituencies within the country have begun to recognize FmD's positive
contribution. A Country Projects Progress Review conducted by the Bank in May 1995 in
Madagascar included an innovative session where beneficiary households, communities
and NGOs presented their views of Bank-supported projects. Participants -- including all
senior government officials -- spoke out strongly in favor of the types of subprojects
financed by FID.
21. Experience with social funds has shown that they can also: complement and reinforce
structural adjustment and reform policies; contribute significantly to poverty reduction by
channeling external aid and resources effectively and directly to communities; achieve
substantial NGO and private sector involvement; and promote decentralization by
strengthening the capacity of municipal governments. FID's promising start justifies some
optimism that such results will be obtained in Madagascar. As noted in Box 1, the fund
has already begun to empower communities and thus to accelerate the process of effective
decentralization -- a major objective of the Government -- and to help create capacity
among NGOs and micro and small enterprises to plan, prepare and execute development
projects.
22. Risks. The main risks are that: (a) FID-financed local infrastructure may not be
properly maintained, (b) the quality of infrastructure may be inadequate because of the
weak capacity of small and medium enterprises; and (c) the rapid expansion of project



Madagascar Social Fund 11 Project  Memorandum of the President       Page   8
requiring the latter's contribution to capital costs. The community would also be required
to agree to finance maintenance and any incremental recurrent costs associated with the
initial investment. To help ensure the quality of infrastructure works, FID has started to:
generate lists of qualified enterprises through open competitive bidding; provide training
to enterprises and consulting firms that do not qualify; and retain, for a period of time, a
part of the amounts payable to firms and supervising engineers, as a guarantee of quality.
The risk of politica] interference is more difficult to address, however, a recent attempt to
interfere in the SECALINE project was resolved once senior political figures visited the
beneficiaries and witnessed the positive impact of the project's success on the
Government's image.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
Note on Portfolio and Disbursement Performance
1.   In August 1993, Madagascar completed a two-year process of political transition
from a single party regime to a pluralistic democracy. Implementation and disbursement
of the IDA-financed portfolio, which had been slow during the transition, are now
showing improvement. The formation of the new government was a positive factor in this
regard, although as noted below, there are still some problem areas. With less uncertainty
about ministerial leadership and direction, and in several cases with the selection of
improved project management, a number of projects became more operational. While the
continued poor economic and financial situation in the country had the potential to hamper
portfolio progress, efforts were made during annual public expenditure reviews (PERs) to
ensure adequate counterpart resources for the priority investment program. The April
1994 country portfolio performance review (CPPR) addressed key generic problems
which were affecting the portfolio, and set action plans to speed parliamentary ratification
of projects, to guarantee timely availability of counterpart funds and eliminate roadblocks
to requests for disbursements of IDA funds, to limit procurement delays, and to improve
accounting and audit procedures. The government decided to systematically monitor
portfolio performance, and empowered a department in the Ministry of Economy and
Planning to monitor implementation and report regularly, both to the government and the
Bank. A May 1995 CPPR reviewed the progress achieved and remaining steps to be
taken. It also focused, on a project-by-project basis, on the achievement of results on the
ground and project objectives. This CPPR benefited from the participation of a number of
beneficiaries who reported on their perceptions of how the projects are implemented, how
they are useful, and how they might be improved.
2.    The efforts to improve project implementation are paying off The percentage of
unsatisfactory projects in the portfolio dropped from 27 percent in FY92 to 13 percent in
FY95 as regards implementation progress, and from 27 percent to 17 percent as regards
development objectives. In addition, 22 percent of the portfolio was rated highly
satisfactory in terms of meeting development objectives: the Accounting and
Management Training (Cr. 1661-MAG [closed end-1994]), Economic Management
and Social Action (Cr. 1967-MAG), Agricultural Research (Cr. 2042-MAG),
Agricultural Extension Pilot (Cr. 2150-MAG [closed June 1995]), and Food Security
and Nutrition (Cr. 2474-MAG) Projects. Disbursements for investment projects
increased substantially from US$23 million in FY92 to US$72 million in FY95. This
represented an increase in the disbursement ratio from 7 percent to 20 percent.
3.   Disbursement Lags. It is important to note that even though disbursements have
been reasonably robust, the undisbursed balance has diminished more slowly due to the
strengthening value of the SDR versus the US$, with the consequent effect of over-

reporting disbursement lags. There are also projects which are now performing well, but
which because of initial delays, show significant lags when compared to original
expectations. Two projects have been affected, however, by the overall environment in
the country and continuing uncertainty about policy direction and/or sector strategies and
are suffering disbursement lags:
Due to delayed effectiveness, the Financial Institutions Development Project (Cr.
2497-MAG) is about a year behind schedule. It has also been adversely affected by
management uncertainty in the Central Bank. Technical assistance is being sought to
reinforce coordination. Despite these problems, procurement of key items is
advancing, and significant progress has been made in the dialogue on bank
privatization, with agreement on divestiture and external interim management for two
state banks.
* The Petroleum Sector Reform Project (Cr. 2538-MAG) has been held up by slow
effectiveness and delays in agreeing on the reform agenda in the sector. In line with its
decision to liberalize the sector, the government has recently requested that the
rehabilitation of the refinery and related investments included in the project be deleted,
and this request for restructuring the project is now being processed. The government
has decided to rely on private sector participation for the functioning of the refinery,
which conforms with the main project objective of opening up the petroleum sector to
private participation.
Unlike the above two projects, the Cyclone Emergency Rehabilitation Project (Cr.
2625-MAG) has performed well. Contracts are signed and works are underway.
Disbursements have been lower than expected, however, and attention has been given to
this issue; disbursements started to pick up during the fourth quarter of FY95.
4.    Other Problem Projects. In addition to the above, the FY95 ARPP identified
two other problem projects which will receive special attention:
* As previously reported, agreement has been reached with the government to close the
Forestry Management and Protection Project (Cr. 1878-MAG) a year ahead of
schedule, and steps are being taken to finalize the closing.
*  In accordance with the previously-agreed action plan on the Antananarivo Plain
Development Project (Cr. 2117-MAG), the entities in charge of future operation and
maintenance of the drainage and flood cqntrol and sewerage utilities have been
created, two laws allowing the Government and municipalities to collect taxes to cover
these activities have been prepared and approved by the Government, and are waiting
ratification by the national assembly. These laws will allow the entities to become
financially autonomous. Suspension of disbursements by the key co-financier, due to
payment arrears, is also affecting project implementation, and this issue is being
reviewed.



Madagascar Social Fund II Project  Memorandum of the President  Annex D. Page 17
The FY94 ARPP had specified action plans for two other problem projects: the
Livestock Sector Project (Cr. 2243-MAG), and the Health Sector Improvement
Project (Cr. 2251-MAG). Both underwent mid-term reviews in FY95, and in both cases
sufficient progress was recorded to warrant upgrading to satisfactory ratings. In livestock,
dairy farmer organizations are stronger and more activities can now be transferred to the
private sector; there is also good progress on the privatization of the veterinary profession.
The mid-term review was undertaken with full participation of dairy farmer representatives
and resulted in a decision to undertake a formal priority setting exercise for the subsector,
to be completed by September 1995. In health, the June 1995 mid-term review found
positive developments in creation of an autonomous drug procurement unit, establishment
of a program of community participation and cost recovery in the distribution of drugs,
redeployment of personnel and production of a report on the sector. Project objectives
were redefined to include support to the implementation of the health district policy and
strengthening of institutional support.
5.    While significant progress has been made on portfolio performance, much remains
to be done. The political and economic/financial situation in Madagascar still have the
potential to derail project implementation, and continuing efforts will be made to monitor
closely and follow up the action plans identified during the May 1995 CPPR, both for
remaining generic issues and for individual projects.
