PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF THE
SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Irrigated agriculture has always dominated the economy of Pakistan.
At present, it is practiced on about 30 M ac, accounts for about one-third
of the GDP, employs about one-third of the labor force, and contributes over
90% to total agricultural production. In the recent past, production has
been significantly boosted by the introduction of high yielding varieties of
cereals, mainly wheat and rice, a sizeable increase in fertilizer consumption
and a large increase in the number of private tubewells to augment irrigation
supplies. However, future progress is hampered by increasing waterlogging
and salinization of the soils and by the fact that the existing irrigation
canal system cannot divert more of the abundant kharif (summer) river flows.
ii.       The SCARP VI area comprises the southernmost district of the Punjab
province and extends to about 1.5 M ac cultivable commanded area (CCA). Of
this, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) is already developing Unit 1, 200,000
ac. The project considered in this report consists of Units II, III, IV, and
V, embracing an area of 1.27 M ac. 1/
iii.      The proposed project would lower the groundwater table by tubewells,
control it at levels which would not impede agricultural development and
would prevent soil salinization. In the areas where the groundwater is fresh,
it would be used for irrigation. In the saline groundwater areas, the pumped
water would be conveyed by drains into evaporation ponds in the Cholistan
Desert. The existing canals would be enlarged to use more of the surplus
kharif river flows. The electrification network would be expanded to energize
about 1,180 public tubewells and five effluent pumping stations. Agricultural
credit would be made available to assist farmers in constructing tubewells for
rabi (winter) irrigation in Unit III and for land leveling.
iv.       Total project costs, net of taxes and duties of US$3.6 M, are
estimated at US$166.4 M equivalent. These costs include a foreign exchange
component of US$46.5 M equivalent. The GOP has tentatively secured a grant
of US$15 M equivalent from the UK and a credit of US$8.3 M equivalent from
the Federal Republic of Germany. Together with the proposed IDA credit of
US$70 M equivalent, the grant and credits would finance all the foreign
exchange cost and 39% of the local cost of the project, or 56% of the total
project costs. Project implementation would take six years; the first year
would be spent mainly on final design, procurement of equipment and prepar-
ation of tender documents for civil works.
1/ Throughout this report, the IDA project area is referred to as SCARP VI.



- ii -
v.        The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), a GOP agency,
would be responsible for the construction of the civil works and the procure-
ment of equipment, including components for electrification. The Department
of Agriculture of the Government of Punjab (GOPunjab) would procure and
deploy tractors and scrapers for land leveling and would provide the necessary
laboratory and other facilities to advise on soil reclamation. Refinancing
of 50% of credits given to farmers by commercial banks for on-farm investments
would be made by GOP through the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). A Project
Coordination Committee based in the project area and consisting of represen-
tatives of all the agencies responsible for various aspects of the project and
representatives of the farming community would ensure coordination during
project implementation at the project level. A Project Steering Committee in
Lahore, with members of secretary rank representing the concerned departments
of GOPunjab, would coordinate the work and its related aspects (finance,
administration, etc.) at the policy level.
vi.       A grant from the United Kingdom would finance all earthmoving equip-
ment required for canal remodeling, the full foreign exchange cost and a
proportion of the local costs of the drainage disposal system in Unit V, and
other imported equipment required for project execution. Canal remodeling
works which are not suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB) would
be awarded after local competitive bidding (LCB). Contracts for electrifica-
tion works would be let through by ICB; WAPDA would supply all components which
it would procure through a credit from the Federal Republic of Germany. Land
leveling and private tubewell corstruction would be carried out by local
contractors under contract with the farmers. Construction contracts for
tubewells in Units II and V would be awarded after ICB in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines.
vii.      Main project benefits would come about from a 33% increase in
annual crop production and a 46% increase in the net value added. Production
of grain crops (rice, maize, millets and wheat) would increase from 225,000
tons at present to 519,000 tons at full project development. Seed cotton
would increase from 150,000 tons to 260,000 tons. Some 100,000 farming
families would benefit -- 60% of whom are farmers with land holdings less
than the average of 12.5 ac. The economic rate of return on project invest-
ment would be about 19%.
viii.     The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$70 M equivalent.
The Borrower would be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

APPRAISAL OF THE
SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has requested a credit of US$70 M
equivalent to assist the construction of the Salinity Control and Reclamation
Project (SCARP) VI in the southern Punjab. This would be the third credit by
IDA to assist GOP's program to control salinity and waterlogging in the Indus
Basin. The first project, SCARP Khairpur, was completed in 1971, and has
largely fulfilled its expectations. Implementation of Khairpur II, a tile
drainage project, has only recently begun and cannot as yet be evaluated.
1.02      The present project was identified in the Bank's Indus Special Study
(ISS) Report of 1967. The Feasibility Report of the project was prepared for
the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) of GOP by the Consulting
Engineering firm of Tipton and Kalmbach of the United States in 1968. In 1975,
Sabasun Technical Services, a Pakistani consultant firm, updated the report.
The present report is based on the findings of an Appraisal Mission comprising
Messrs. A. Seager, M. Fireman and C.J. Perry (IDA) and W. Backiewicz, J.B.
Downs and H. Vieilhescaze (Consultants) who visited Pakistan in October/
November 1976.
II. BACKGROUND
The Economy
2.01      Pakistan covers about 197 M ac of which only about 47 M ac or 24%
are cultivable. Of this, about 33 M ac are irrigated, mostly by the Indus
River and its tributaries. Population is around 73 M and increasing at about
3% per annum.
2.02      Following a decade during the 1960s of sustained and rapid economic
growth, Pakistan's economy stagnated during the early 1970s. This was caused
by a variety of factors: in the agricultural sector the impact of the high
yielding varieties introduced in the mid-1960s and the rapid growth of invest-
ment in private tubewells began to fade; in industry, the disruption of the
separation from Bangladesh and the deterioration in terms of trade due pri-
marily to increased oil prices were the main causes of reduced growth. As
a result, per capita income in 1975 was little different from that in 1970
(Rs 1,435). In 1976, there were signs of revival in economic activity, en-
couraged by GOP's action to increase resource mobilization and, in the agri-
cultural sector, to improve prices paid to farmers which, by the early 1970s
had deteriorated relative to both world prices and the internal price of
inputs. The present six-year plan projects substantial annual increases in
agricultural production (4.5%), which would make Pakistan self-sufficient in
wheat and increase exports of cotton and rice sharply. However, a growth



- 2 -
rate of 3% to 4% per annum would appear a more realistic projection. The
technological base to sustain such a rate has existed since the second half of
the 1960s and 3-4% growth could he achieved, given reasonable price incentives
for inputs and outputs and improvrements in the agricultural extension service.
Agriculture and Irrigation in the Indus Basin 1/
2.03      As rainfall on the Indtis Basin plains, especially in the south,
is inadequate for satisfactory crop growth, irrigation from rivers, using the
high monsoonal summer flows, has been a feature of agricultural production
since about 2500 B.C. Since the 1870s, barrages have been constructed ena-
bling year-round irrigation. The surface system, the largest basin system in
the world, was completely controlled by barrages by 1963. The use of ground-
water, where suitable, while always an integral feature of the system, has
developed very rapidly since the early 1960s. At present, some 160,000 tube-
wells are in operation. Storage reservoirs on the Indus at Tarbela (9.-3 M ac-ft
capacity) and Chasma (0.9 M ac-ft) and Mangla (5.4 M ac-ft) on the Jhelum,
augment winter flows. The area aad production of the major crops, almost
entirely a function of water from the rivers, wells and reservoirs, is
approximately as follows:
Wheat {ice (Milled) Cotton (Seed) Sugarcane
Area (M ac)           15.1        3.1             4.6            1.5
Production (M tons)   8.5         2.4             1.9           22.7
Yield (tons/ac)        0.6        0.66            0.45          14.5
Of the major crops, cotton is especially subject to seasonal variations in
yield due to floods and insect pests.
2.04      Drainage, a vital adjunct to irrigation, was not provided on any
scale until the 1960s and therefore the water table has risen in many areas
to levels where it hampers crop pioduction. Also, irrigation water is often
thinly spread, allowing salts to tuild up in the crop root zones. Consequently,
waterlogging and salinization have impeded production in many areas, as the
following figures show:

Review (922a-PAK, 1976).

exclusive: land may be affected by waterlogging, or salinity, or both.
2.05      The Government's Salinity Control and Reclamation Program (SCARP)
was conceived in the late 1950s. Its first project became operational in
1963. To date, more than 8,000 publicly owned tubewells have been installed
in both saline and fresh groundwater areas, mainly to lower the water table
and, where possible, to enable reclamation and increase irrigation. Private
enterprise has installed over 150,000 tubewells in areas where the ground-
water is suitable for irrigation. However, in areas where the groundwater is
saline, and in fresh groundwater areas where the water table is so high that
profitable irrigation cannot take place without first lowering the water table,
little or no private groundwater development has taken place.
Project Formulation
2.06      In many parts of the SCARP VI area, in both the fresh and saline
groundwater zones, the water table is so high that it interferes with profit-
able agriculture. Consequently, fresh water tubewell development, while sub-
stantial, lags behind that of the rest of the Punjab. In addition to the
effects of the high water table, some of the soils have become saline due to
deliberate under-irrigation by farmers. Consequently, in 1967 the ISS report
had established that remedial action would be necessary to lower the water
table, dispose of saline effluent and to provide more irrigation water to
leach the salt-affected soils. A project plan was prepared in 1968. In 1973,
when the Federal Planning Commission prepared its "Proposals for an Accelerated
Program for Salinity and Waterlogging Control", the need for the project was
reaffirmed.

III. THE PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The SCARP VI area is in the Bahawalpur Division of the Punjab.  It
covers about 1.7 M ac, of which 1.47 M ac are canal commanded. It is oblong
in shape: about 25 mi wide and about 100 mi long. It is bounded by the
Cholistan Desert to the east and the Indus River to the west.
3.02      The project area has been divided into five units for development
purposes, according to a combination of irrigation regime and the quality of
underlying groundwater (Map 12601). Unit I, which has fresh groundwater, is
already being developed by WAPDA by installing tubewells which will eventually
be operated and maintained by the Irrigation Department; the groundwater will
be used conjunctively with canal waters. It comprises about 200,000 ac. The
proposed IDA project comprises Units II to V, totalling 1.27 M ac. Of these,
Units IV and V (76,000 ac and 464,000 ac, respectively) are mainly perennially
irrigated by surface systems and underlain by saline groundwater; Units II and
III, 340,000 ac and 390,000 ac respectively, receive non-perennial surface
irrigation and are underlain by fresh groundwater, as shown in the table
below:
Perennially   Seasonally      Total
Irrigated    Irrigated    Irrigated   Groundwater
------------------- ('000 ac CCA) -----------------
Unit II             10            330          340         Fresh
Unit III            -            390           390         Fresh
Unit IV             72              4           76         Saline
Unit V             419            45           464         Saline
Total         501            769         1,270
Climate
3.03      The climate is arid.  Annual rainfall averages under four inches
with most occurring in July and August. There are two main seasons: the
rabi (winter) and the kharif (sumimer). In the rabi (October-March), humi-
dity is low and low temperatures keep monthly pan evaporation below three
inches per month (Annex 1). Frost in December and January is not uncommon.
Generally, cloud cover is slight. In the kharif (April-September), humidity is
higher and temperatures may reach 118°F and rarely drop below 80 0F.  Pan
evaporation is then up to eight inches per month. Wind velocities are
generally low but in the kharif cccasional sand storms occur.
Population
3.04      The population of the project area is approximately 1.4 million; 80%
live in the rural areas, and the total agricultural labor force is estimated
at 300,000. The main towns in the area are Rahimyar Khan (population 74,000),
Khanpur (60,000) and Sadiqabad (55,000).

Farm Size and Land Tenure
3.05      The distribution of farm sizes within the project area is shown
below.
Farm Size           % of Total        % of Total
(ac)                Farms              Area
0    -  2.5             6                 1
2.5  -  7.5            21                 7
7.5  - 12.5            30                20
12.5  - 25              30                32
25   - 50              10                20
over 50                   3                20
Present legislation limits land holdings to 150 ac of irrigated land.  Of the
total cultivated area of the project, 45% is farmed by the owner and 55% by
tenants. However, many farm units, amounting to 25% of the project area,
comprise both operator's own land and land rented or leased. The reason
is as much an effort to augment farm units as to consolidate them. Consequently,
individual landowners may well be lessors and lessees of land. The predominant
tenancy arrangement provides that all taxes and water charges are paid by the
landowner; seasonal input costs, and the crop, are shared equally between
tenant and owner. However, tenants grow fodder entirely for their own use and
in return provide work animals for the farm; the landlord provides housing for
his tenants and credit for inputs.
Soils and Topography
3.06      Soils in the project area are mostly coarse to medium textured, cal-
careous and therefore slightly alkaline, low in organic matter and nitrogen,
low to moderately low in phosphorous and well supplied with potash. Most of
the soils are quite permeable, well aggregated and non-erosive, have moderate
water holding capacities and are resistant to alkali hazards. In short, the
project area soils are as good and have as high a development potential as any
in Pakistan. Except along the edge of the Cholistan Desert where there are
sand dunes, the land is relatively flat. Its slopes are of the order of 1 in
5,000, towards the south/southeast along the course of the Indus River and
towards the Cholistan Desert. Natural drainageways are ill-defined and in-
adequate. Soil salinity and alkali problems, and waterlogging exacerbated by
irrigation for the last five decades, now affect a considerable proportion of
the project area (Annex 2).
Salinity and Alkalinity
3.07      On the basis of a soil survey comprising approximately 11,000
samples, it is evident that approximately 350,000 ac is sufficiently saline
to affect crop growth. Some 160,000 ac of this area, also require alkali
reclamation. The remainder would require only leaching with about 2 ft



- 6 -
of water for complete restoration of productivity. The alkali soils would
require chemical amendment (up to 5 tons/ac of gypsum), followed by leaching
with 2 ft of water to make them economically productive (Annex 2). All recla-
mation works would depend on effective control of the water table.
Waterlogging and Drainage
3.08      The water table is at c, ft or less under 10% of the project area,
and between 5 and 10 ft under a further 50Z - a considerably higher level
than in most of the Province. The high water table impairs crop growth and
contributes to soil salinization.
Irrigation
3.09      For several centuries the project area was irrigated by inundation
canals that tapped the high flows of the river during the kharif. Rabi crop-
ping was supported either by residual moisture from kharif inundations or by
open wells. Most of the 18,000 dug vells date from this period; some 9,000
are still in use. In 1930, the whole project area came under controlled canal
irrigation from the Panjnad Barrage, commanded by the Panjnad canal (CCA 1.35 M
ac) and the Abbasia canal (CCA 154,000 ac). About one-third of the total area
is perennially irrigated.
3.10      The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 between India and Pakistan reserved
the total flows of the Indus Basin's three eastern rivers (the Ravi, Beas
and Sutlej) for India. HistoricaLly, most of the project area's water supply
was provided by the Sutlej. Therefore, under the Indus Basin Project (IBP)
replacement works, the Taunsa-Paninad Link Canal connecting the Indus and the
Jhelum, was constructed. It has a capacity of up to 12,000 cusecs. Since
kharif flows in the Indus are sufficient, supplies in the Panjnad River (as the
joint Jhelum-Sutlej River is called) can, in most years, be augmented to supply
the projected needs of the SCARP 1V area at the Panjnad Barrage.
3.11      Areas with fresh groundwater (Units II and III) were designed for
kharif canal irrigation only (non-perennial). The rabi supplies were to come
from wells. Between 1932 and 1976, over 5,000 tubewells were installed in the
project area, about 4,600 since 1'l65 and 1,300 since 1974. Most tubewells are
around 1 cusec capacity. The tubewells in non-perennial areas are mostly used
when the canals do not run; the few tubewells in the perennial areas (Units IV
& V) are used conjunctively with canal waters. All but about 1% of the tube-
wells are privately owned and operated. The dug wells that are still opera-
tional are mostly run by Persian uheels.
3.12      The canal system is operated and maintained by the Irrigation De-
partment (ID) of the Ministry of Public Works and Irrigation of GOPunjab.
Water allocation to individual farmers is supervised by the patwari (an offi-
cial of the Irrigation Department) who is supposed to ensure that each farmer
takes water for the number of hours to which his landholding and cropping
pattern entitle him. There is a water charge for each irrigated acre; the
rate varies from crop to crop (para 5.13). Watercourse channels (which carry



- 7 -
water to the farms from the ID's canals) are maintained collectively by all
the landowners served. The standard of maintenance is highly variable and
in general less than optimal.
Agricultural Production
3.13      The principal cash crops are cotton in the kharif, wheat in the rabi
and sugarcane which is perennial, occupying in all some 70% of the total
cropped area. Other important crops are rabi and kharif fodder for the work
and milch animals (18-19%), rice and millets in the kharif, and pulses and
oilseeds in the rabi (7-8%). The balance (3-5%) is taken up by orchards,
vegetables and miscellaneous crops. While the cotton and wheat area is showing
a slight increase over time in some localities, there is substitution by
millets, rice and pulses in areas where waterlogging and salinity are on the
increase.
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.14      Agricultural Extension is under the control of the Extra-Assistant
Director of Agriculture (EADA) in Rahimyar Khan, who reports to a Deputy
Director (DDA) in Bahawalpur. He has 20 Agricultural Officers (AO) to whom
84 Field Assistants (FAs) report. There are 147 foreman-laborers (beldars)
who handle sprayers and pesticides and assist farmers with spraying (mostly
cotton and orchards). An agronomist and a plant protection specialist provide
technical support to the field staff. A statistical section collects relevant
information on production trends and crop yields.
3.15      The extension service suffers from lack of staff housing and trans-
port, as well as a shortage of extension materials. Further, it has inadequate
research backing. This is to be corrected, however, under an extension and
research project for the Punjab, which IDA is currently appraising.
3.16      The Agricultural Engineering Section of the Agriculture Department
assists with physical land reclamation through land leveling and gives advice
and assistance with private tubewell design and installation.
Agricultural Credit
3.17      Short- and medium-term agricultural credit is primarily provided
by the 103 branches of the five nationalized commercial banks: the National
Bank of Pakistan (NBP), Habib Bank Ltd. (HBL), United Bank Ltd. (UBL), Muslim
Commercial Bank Ltd., (MCB) and Allied Bank Ltd. (ABL). They entered into
agricultural lending operations in 1972 under the GOP-sponsored agricultural
small loans scheme. Interest rates are 12%. Due to decentralization of
sanctioning power, loans are processed fairly quickly.
Primary Processing
3.18      Cotton ginning and cottonseed pressing are major industries with
sufficient installed capacity in the 29 ginneries and 17 screw-type expeller
plants to handle more than the already substantial cotton crop. The cotton
ginning industry was nationalized at the beginning of the 1976-77 season.



-8-
3.19      Flour and pulse milling and rice husking are small-scale industries,
widely scattered in villages and provide for needs of rural populations. The
urban centers mainly receive flour and rice from plants outside the project
area.
Storage
3.20      The project area produces surplus wheat which is procured by the
Government, and also small surpluses of other crops in good years. In 1975
and 1976, when production levels were high, storage facilities were inadequate,
and the Government had to store in unsuitable buildings and even in the open,
under tarpaulins. There is a clear need for additional storage facilities, and
requirements are to be the subject of a study funded by the Canadian Interna-
tional Development Agency (CIDA). Terms of reference for the study will be
jointly defined by CIDA and the Bank Group.
Agricultural Inputs
3.21      Fertilizers are in adequate supply and are available from about 100
privately operated sales points within the project area. Pesticides are sold
by the agricultural extension services and by dealers appointed by the major
pesticide distributors. Commercial seed supplies are of poor quality and
farmers tend to keep their own whenever feasible. The IDA-financed seeds
project (Cr. 620-PAK) is expected to provide certified cotton, wheat and rice
seeds for sale within the next few years.
Transport and Communications
3.22      Road and rail communica:ions in the project area are adequate.  The
double track Karachi-Khanewal-Lahore railway line traverses its full length.
A branch line from Khanpur extends to Chachran, on the Indus. Sections of
the Karachi-Peshawar national higlhway and other major metaled roads, all
in good repair, total about 400 m:. The extensive unmetaled village road
network is constantly being upgracled. Agricultural commodities are moved
to the primary and secondary markets by road, in trucks, oxcarts or on
camels. Exports to other parts of Pakistan, mainly of wheat and ginned
cotton, go by rail.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The project works and supporting services would:
(a) lower and control the groundwater table at levels which would
facilitate agricultural development and would prevent soil
salinization;



-9-
(b) provide increased surface water deliveries, mainly in the
kharif when there is surplus water in the rivers, to give
adequate supplies for good irrigation management practices
and higher cropping intensity;
(c) provide safe disposal of saline groundwater;
(d) provide additional rabi irrigation to non-perennial areas
by increased exploitation of fresh groundwater in the
public and private sectors; and
(e) level and reclaim land which is saline and uncultivated.
Project Components
4.02      Unit I is already being developed by WAPDA.  In Units II to V, the
project would have the following major components:
In all Units:
(a) the irrigation canals would be remodeled and new water-
courses constructed, to convey the increased supplies
needed for more intensive and adequate kharif irrigation;
(b) equipment, technical assistance and credit would be made
available to farmers for coarse and fine land leveling,
estimated to be required on about 100,000 ac;
(c) gypsum would be provided to enable the reclamation of approxi-
mately 40,000 ac of alkaline land;
In addition, the following would be carried out in individual Units:
(d) in Unit II, (seasonally irrigated, fresh groundwater):
(i) the construction of about 800 public tubewells, ranging
in size from 2 to 3 cusecs, with a total capacity of
about 2,000 cusecs for rabi irrigation and conjunctive
use with the canals in kharif to control the water table;
(ii) the construction of 135 public tubewells of 3 cusec
capacity and appurtenant works to enable surplus water
to be discharged into canals for use downstream.
(e) in Unit III (seasonally irrigated, fresh groundwater), pro-
vision of credit and technical advice to farmers for the
installation of about 2,300 private tubewells (1/2 - 1-1/2
cusec) for rabi irrigation;
(f) in Unit IV, where the groundwater is saline but is at a safe
depth for the time being, only the works shown under (a) (b)
and (c), above, are required.



- 10 -
(g) in Unit V (perennially irrigated, saline groundwater):
(i)  construction of 2'O public tubewells of 3 cusec
capacity to drain about 300,000 ac and to
stabilize the groundwater level at an average
of about 7-8 ft (the remaining 163,000 ac of
Unit V have lower groundwater levels at present);
(ii) construction of a drainage disposal system for the
saline effluent which would be taken into five eva-
poration ponds to be built in the Cholistan Desert;
(h) construction of an electrification network to energize all
public tubewells in Units II and V and five pumping stations
on the drainage system in the Cholistan Desert;
Provisions would also be made for:
(i) increasing the availabiLity of credit through the nationalized
commercial banks for private tubewells and land leveling;
(j) engaging consultants to assist WAPDA in the final design and
in the supervision of construction of the project, to prepare
operating manuals and o'>ganize the monitoring of project
benefits;
(k) procuring vehicles and i!quipment necessary for project
execution aitd subsequent management; communications and
mini-computer equipment for improved operation of the exist-
ing and proposed irrigaiion and drainage works in the whole
Panjnad Barrage command:
(1) providing equipment and vehicles for an existing soils
laboratory enabling it to expand its activities to advise
on, and monitor the progress of, saline and alkali soil
reclamation;
(m)  procuring surveying instruments as an aid to the systematic
planning and execution cf land leveling; and
(n) consultant services to assist WAPDA in the final design
of new projects, including those identified under the
ongoing preparation of a Revised Action Plan, which is
financed by UNDP, and for which the Bank is the
executing agency.
4.03      Details of the groundwater situation are described in Annex 3.  The
major project civil works are described in Annex 4 and summarized below.
4.04      Canal remodeling, including the construction of new watercourses,
will be necessary to provide additional water in the kharif, first for recla-
mation of saline and alkali land bi leaching and later to meet the needs of



- ii -
expected higher kharif cropping intensities. The new and remodeled
watercourses would be built to the same standard as required under GOPunjab's
On-Farm Development Project currently being undertaken jointly with USAID.
Water made available at peak irrigation requirement would be increased from
the present 1 cusec per 100-130 ac irrigated to about 1 cusec per 75 ac.
Allowing for the anticipated pumping regime of the Unit II tubewells, the
peak flow in the Panjnad and Abbasia canals would have to be increased to
13,000 cusecs and to 1,250 cusecs respectively. These higher flows would
require that the branch canals, distributaries, minors and structures be
enlarged and some additional parallel minors constructed. Watercourses which
are at present carrying in excess of 1-1/2 cusecs would not be enlarged since
water management becomes increasingly difficult and inefficient at higher
delivery rates. Instead, additional watercourses would be built.
4.05      Land Levelirg would be carried out by contractors and farmers on
approximately 100,000 ac which is now saline and therefore out of cultivation.
This land would need leveling before it could be effectively leached and,
subsequently, cropped. Leveling to the standards of the ongoing Precision
Land Leveling Project (PLLP) is estimated to cost about Rs 1,000 per ac. The
task would be aided by the provision of suitable agricultural tractors and
scrapers and by training and equipping staff in the Agricultural Engineering
Section to help farmers organize the work efficiently and on a technically
sound basis (para 4.17 and Annex 5). Credit would be made available to
support this work (para 4.14).
4.06      Land Reclamation using gypsum to combat alkalinity would be needed
on about 160,000 ac. Such work would only be effective after the drainage,
provided under the project, is installed. Consequently, it is expected that
during the implementation time of this project only about 40,000 ac would be
ready for reclamation by these means. Properly prepared for marketing and
distributed in bulk, the gypsum should cost about Rs 200 per ton at retail
sales points; about 5 tons per ac would be required. This technique has not
been previously used in Pakistan and much work is required to develop ways
of efficiently working gypsum deposits, preparing the material in a form
suitable for farm use and establishing suitable means of transport and dis-
tribution. Given the need for development work and the possibility of
initially high costs, the gypsum required during project implementation would
be a project cost. Agreement was reached during negotiations with GOPunjab
that: (i) by June 30, 1978, it would have prepared and discussed with IDA
plans, and a related implementation schedule, to ensure supplies of gypsum
to project area farmers, and (ii) annually, during the project implementation
period, it would discuss with IDA the price to be paid by farmers for gypsum
and any subsidy to be granted to its users.
4.07      In Unit II fresh groundwater development would be in the public
sector. This is justified and necessary because a major source of high
grotndwater levels is excessive leakage from the major canals passing through
the area (estimated to be about 365,000 ac-ft/yr at present). Canal lining
would be difficult and expensive since the main canals are perennial and



- 12 -
would have to be by-passed during lining. The recharge to the aquifer in the
area under full project development is expected to be around 965,000 ac-ft per
annum, which would be developed approximately as follows:
Tubewell Capacity (cusecs)            No.
Irrigation           (        2.0                           286
wells               (        2.5                           160
(       3.0                           350
Export wells                  3.0                           135
Total           -                            931
The water from the irrigation wells would be discharged directly into the
watercourses and would be used vainly in the rabi when surface supplies are
not available. The annual utilization factor would be about 47% or 4,150
hours per well. The 135 export tubewells of 3 cusec capacity would pump
exclusively to lift water into the canal system, to be conveyed to Unit V.
These wells would operate at 70% utilization or about 6,150 hours a year.
4.08      In Unit III, the groundwater would be developed in the private sector.
The groundwater level in this Unit is stable under the present canal regime
and operating pattern of the approximately 2,000 private tubewells already in
the area, which abstract an estimated 200,000 ac-ft per annum. At full project
development, a further 440,000 a2-ft per annum would be abstracted, mainly
during the rabi, by more intense operation of the existing wells and installa-
tion of about 2,270 additional private wells. The increased abstraction
would be made possible primarily by the increased recharge during kharif
following canal remodeling.  Prizate rather than public development is appro-
priate in Unit III because it is technically feasible, many farmers can
afford it, and scarce public funds are more beneficially allocated to Units
II, IV, and V where development Ls only feasible in the public sector. In
Unit III, private development is already substantial and conditions are
favorable for further progress, given adequate technical and financial
support which would be provided under the project (para 4.14).
4.09      In Unit IV, the groundwater is now at a safe depth.  The available
groundwater models show that the Unit is receiving most of its inflows from
Unit I, where the water table at present is very high. When development of
this Unit is completed in 1978 and the water table appropriately lowered
(para 3.02) the models show that the underground inflow to most of Unit IV
will cease. Thus, the drainable surplus will disappear by the underground
flow into the Cholistan Desert (Annex 3). Therefore, works under the present
project would be confined to those described under paras 4.04 to 4.06.
4.10      Saline Water Drainage in Unit V would be effected by about 250
tubewells of 3 cusec capacity. To remove the drainable surplus and stabilize
the water table, an annual pumpage of 380,000 ac-ft would be required, giving



- 13 -
a well operating factor of about 70% or 6,150 hours per annum. To maximize
water table control, the wells would be placed on a triangular grid as far
as possible, each draining approximately 1,200 ac. The pumps, motors and the
screens would be of materials that withstand the chemical action of saline
water.
4.11      Saline Effluent Disposal would be through drainage canals into five
evaporation ponds in the Cholistan Desert. Annual evaporation is expected
to be about 80" as against 100" of fresh water. The amount to be evaporated
would be about 380,000 ac-ft (para 4.10). Therefore, the total area of the
ponds would be about 57,000 ac.
4.12      Pumping stations would be provided to lift the water from the drain-
age canals into the evaporating ponds. Each station would have four 24-inch
axial flow pumps of 38 cusec capacity, having a 10-ft lifting head; one pump
would serve as a standby.
4.13      Electrification would be provided to all tubewells in Units II and V
and to the five effluent pumping stations. Works required would include the
erection of approximately 1,120 mi of 11 kV, 55 mi of 66 kV and 24 mi of 132 kV
lines and six grid stations. The network lines constructed for electrifying
tubewells and pumping stations would also contribute to the ongoing village
electrification program. No specific provision would be made for electrifica-
tion of private tubewells in Unit III, most of which would be powered by diesel
engines, though an estimated 10% would have access to existing electricity
supplies. Provision of electricity to the many small, private tubewells would
be expensive, involving a very dense distribution network.
4.14      Credit would be provided to farmers under the project to support
land leveling (para 4.05) and private tubewell development (para 4.08).
In each case, farmers would provide at least 25% of the investment from their
own resources and be eligible for a six-year loan at 12% to cover the remainder
from participating commercial banks (CBs). The CBs would, in turn, be able
to refinance half of their advances from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The
GOP would provide funds to SBP from the proposed credit to cover SBP's refinanc-
ing. The SBP would charge CBs 6%, and GOP would charge SBP 5%. These interest
rate spreads are satisfactory (Annex 6).
4.15      The GOP at present provides a grant of Rs 8,000 to farmers installing
a private tubewell. The grant is restricted to farmers (or groups of farmers)
owning at least 25 ac of land. This discriminates against smaller farmers and
discourages the use of small 1/4 to 1/2 cusec tubewells which have been suc-
cessful under similar conditions in other countries. While a subsidy for
tubewells does not appear necessary on financial grounds and would be reviewed
(para 5.16) under the project, a first step would be to remove the existing
discrimination. Accordingly, assurances have been obtained from GOP that
insofar as GOP continued to subsidize the investment costs of private tube-
wells, grants would be made available to project area farmers irrespective
of the size of landholdings.
4.16      Consultants would be engaged to advise and assist WAPDA in prepar-
ing the final design of the project, to prepare procurement and contract



- 14 -
documents as well as to supervise construction. They would also develop the
computer model to optimize operation of the entire Panjnad Barrage irrigation
system. An estimated 310 man-morths of consultants would be required for this
over a six-year period, at an estimated total cos-, including overheads,
travel, and reimbursable expenses of US$9,600 per man-month (Annex 7). In
addition, finance would be providad under the project to assist WAPDA in
the final design of other projects. Following the completion of the ongoing
Master Planning Project financed by UNDP in 1978, and meanwhile based on
existing plans for high priority orojects, these services would be used to
ensure a pipeline of well preparel projects consistent with an integrated
overall development plan.
4.17      Vehicles would be proviled to the executing agency -- WAPDA -- to
be passed on to the operating ageicy when WAPDA withdraws one year after
project completion. Specialized !quipment would include a mini-computer which
would program the operation of tht whole canal system, including pumpage in
Unit II, to control the groundwatetr.  The soils laboratory at Bahawalpur would
require additional equipment and :ransport to be effective in the soils recla-
mation program. The agricultural engineering section would be provided with
40 tractors of 65-75 hp, with sui::ably scaled scrapers and chisel plows for
fine land leveling and deep ripping of areas where a hard pan prevents root
penetration and drainage. Survey equipment, for use by the agricultural
engineer and his staff to mark oul. fields for fine leveling, would be provided
(Annex 8). The project would als( finance the purchase and installation of
two center-pivot sprinkler system .-, estimated to cost Rs 1.1 M, for trials in
the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. The units would be installed
on land where the topography is rlIling so that land leveling for surface
irrigation is prohibitively expenmiive, and high value crops would be grown on
a trial basis by the Provincial Departments of Agriculture.
4.18      The Agricultural Extension service would be improved under a sepa-
rate project for strengthening agricultural extension and research in Punjab
which is now under appraisal (pare 3.15).
4.19      Grain Storage facilities for wheat procured by the Government are
inadequate and need augmenting (para 3.20).  However, a solution can best be
found within an all-Pakistan framEwork. The Canadian International Develop-
ment Agency (CIDA) are shortly commencing a study of the situation. Terms
of reference have been discussed with IDA; the study itself is expected to
be completed in 1978. Assurances hiave been obtained from GOP that by June 30,
1979 an all-Pakistan plan on how GOP proposes to improve grain storage prob-
lems, including proposals satisfactory to IDA for storing grain produced
in the project area, would be presented to IDA, and by July 1, 1980, it would
commence implementation of such a elan in the SCARP VI area.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
4.20      Present irrigation supplies are not sufficient for the existing
cropping patterns adopted by farme-s (Annex 9). The consequent under-
irrigation contributes in part to :he low yields and the salinization
of soils. In the future, kharif wtter requirements under the project would



- 15 -
be higher than at present; the remodeling of the canal system would enable
them to be met from surplus river flows. Future rabi water requirements of
the design cropping pattern for the perennial areas will in part have to be
met from storage. In an average year about 355,000 ac-ft would be required
to supplement historic, post-IBP rabi flows at the Panjnad Barrage. Assur-
ances have been obtained from GOPunjab that they would provide the future
water requirements of Units IV and V.
4.21      The design and operating plan of the Panjnad Barrage system calls
for closure of the non-perennial canals (in Units II and III) from November
to March, inclusive. During the past few years. however, the canals have
been allowed to run until late November and some-Lia - again in January.
This was possible because in recent years there were more than average
flows in the rivers. However, in average years there is no such excess
during the rabi season. Extending the period of surface irrigation in Unit
III has two effects: firstly, existing private tubewells need to pump less,
while recharge to the aquifer is increased - thus increasing the likelihood
of waterlogging, and secondly the incentive to install more private tubewells
is reduced. Since there are other canal commands where the extra deliveries
could be equally productive, including ones where there is no scope for pri-
vate groundwater development, it would be desirable to maximize the incenti.er
for private development and control of the groundwater in Unit III by enforc-
ing the traditional canal closure date of October 31. Accordingly, assurances
have been obtained from GOPunjab that, by October 31, 1980, no surface water
would be provided to Unit III from about October 31 to about March 31.
4.22      The quality of the river water is good and with proper irrigation
practices no ill ef ei.ts to the soil should result. The groundwater in Units
II and III is also of good quality and suitable for irrigation.
Implementation Schedule
4.23      The overall expected implementation period of the project would be
six years. The first year would be spent mainly in final design, procurement
of equipment and vehicles, preparation of tender documents for civil works
and in promotional efforts for the private tubewell program in Unit III. The
major physical works would start in the second year and be completed by the
end of the sixth year (Annex 10).
4.24      Comprehensive schedules for construction, implementation and budget
requirements are to be prepared annually by all concerned agencies for review
and coordination by WAPDA (NZ). Assurances have been obtained from GOP and
WAPDA that adequate and timely funds would be provided for project implementa-
tion, according to estimates prepared by General Manager WAPDA (NZ). Assurances
have also been obtained from WAPDA that the annual implementation schedule,
together with budgetary estimates for the coming financial year, would be
submitted to IDA by March 31st of each year of implementation.

Project Costs
4.25      Total project costs would be about US$170.0 M equivalent (including
taxes and duties of US$3.6 M) of which the foreign exchange component would be
US$46.5 M or 27% of the total. Tubewell costs are based on recent experience
in Pakistan. The cost of canal remodeling, the excavation of drains and the
construction of the evaporation ponds are based on the preliminary designs and
estimates, and on the costs of similar work recently carried out in Pakistan.
Consultant costs are based on US$9,600 per man-month including local and
foreign travel, recruitment and housing costs. An overall physical contingency
of 12% is included; canal remodeling and drainage disposal works carry 15%
physical contingency. Price escalation has been calculated according to Bank
projections for inflation of 9%/yr up to 1980 and 8%/yr thereafter for local
costs, and 8%, 7.5% and 7% for 1978, 1979 and 1980-83, respectively for foreign
costs. Taking account of the schedule of expenditure, overall price escalation
would be 36%. A summary of cost estimates is given below, and details are shown
in Annex 11. O&M costs, which would be financed by WAPDA during project con-
struction, are estimated at US$11.9 M equivalent, including price escalation.

Financing
4.26      The proposed IDA credit of US$70 M together with a credit under
terms similar to IDA's, of DM 20 M (US$8.3 M equivalent) from the Federal
Republic of Germany through the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) and
a grant of US$15 H equivalent from the United Kingdom, would finance 56% of
total project costs, excluding taxes and duties, and cover the full foreign
exchange costs of the project and approximately 39% of the local costs (page
17 and Annex 11). Other funds required for the project would be provided by
GOP, as a loan to GOPunjab (US$62.5 M equivalent); commercial banks (US$8.5 M
equivalent), and farmers' own resources (US$5.7 M equivalent). The fulfill-
ment by the Borrower, GOPunjab and WAPDA of all conditions of effectiveness of
the grant from the UK and the credit from West Germany would be a condition of
credit effectiveness.
Procurement
4.27      Project components to be financed by IDA include canal remodeling,
Unit II and Unit V tubewells, electrification works, on-farm development, the
provision of gypsum for land reclamation, and consultant services. Canal
remodeling (costing an estimated US$28.2 M equivalent including contingencies)
would be scattered over a large area and would have to be phased with seasonal
agricultural activities and could not be so contractually packaged as to be
likely to be attractive to international contractors. Work scheduling would
depend on agricultural seasons; consequently, this component is not suitable
for international competitive bidding (ICB). Therefore, contracts would be
let through local competitive bidding (LCB). Tubewell construction in Units
II and V, estimated to cost the equivalent of US$17.8 M and US$9.4 M respec-
tively, would be through ICB in which Pakistani firms would have a 7-1/2%
preference. Similar procedures would be used for construction of the elec-
trification system (costing US$26.8 M equivalent). Consultants (costing US$6.4
M equivalent) would be selected in line with IDA guidelines (para 5.08).
Gypsum (US$6.6 M) would be obtained through LCB from suitable local contractors
(likely to be fertilizer manufacturers and/or distributors) who would supply it
according to prescribed specifications, in bulk, at the dealers' sales point.
4.28      The KfW would finance the foreign exchange cost of imported and
locally manufactured electrification components (estimated to cost US$11.8 M
equivalent) procured through its own international competitive bidding pro-
cedures. These components would be supplied to the contractors constructing
the electrification system.
4.29      The UK grant would finance equipment needed for canal remodeling
and other construction purposes (US$7.8 M equivalent). Such equipment would
be procured from UK suppliers. The UK would also finance the foreign exchange
components and part of the local costs of the drainage disposal system and
evaporating ponds (US$27.8 M equivalent) with procurement according to its own
procedures.



- 20 -
4.30      On-farm investments by farmers (US$24.5 M equivalent) comprise
private tubewells in Unit III ancL land leveling. Farmers would have freedom
of choice in procuring the goods and services involved.
4.31      Land required for the project (US$2.9 M equivalent) would be pro-
cured by GOPunjab for WAPDA.
Disbursements
4.32      Disbursements of the proposed IDA and KfW credits and UK grant
would be made as follows:
IDA Credit
(a) 50% of net credits to farmers made by participating com-
mercial banks for on-farm investments including private
tubewells and land leveling;
(b) 100% of expenditures for approved consultant services;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported goods,
or 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for goods
manufactured locally, or 50% of expenditures for other
goods procured locally;
(d) 100% of the foreign expenditures and 50% of the local
expenditures on canal remodeling, Unit II and Unit V
tubewells, and electrification works.
KfW (Germany) Credit
(e) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported and domestically
manufactured electrical components and equipment;
United Kingdom Grant
(f) 100% of the foreign exc!iange costs of the canal re-
modeling equipment;
(g)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of the drainage works
and 30% of the local costs.
(h)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of transport, leveling
equipment, mini-compute:.
4.33      Some US$10.9 M equivalent (12%) of the credits and grant would be
unallocated and reserved for contingencies. Disbursements against credits
extended to farmers for on-farm investments would be made against certified
statements of expenditure submitted by GOP and based on the documentation
which would be held by GOP for review by Supervision Missions. All other
disbursements would be made against full documentation. It is expected



- 21 -
that disbursements would be completed by June 30, 1984, six months after
project completion. A schedule of estimated disbursements and proposed credit
allocation is given in Annex 11. Any amounts not used by the project would be
cancelled unless, subject to IDA concurrence, other suitable project related
expenditures are identified.
Accounts and Audit
4.34      Project accounts would be maintained separately, and in a readily
identifiable form. This would enable them to be audited separately from
WAPDA's overall accounts by an independent external auditor thereby ensuring
their timely availability. Accordingly, assurances have been obtained from
GOP that: (i) separate accounts would be established and maintained for
project expenditures by the Project Director; (ii) these accounts would be
audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA; (iii) accounts
of loans by the CBs to farmers under this project would be recorded separately
and audited annually and consolidated by SBP, and (iv) copies of all the
project accounts and SBP consolidated accounts for project related items
would be sent to IDA not later than six months after the end of each financial
year.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Implementation
5.01      Civil Works.  In this project, as in all other SCARPs, WAPDA would
be the agency responsible for project civil works, including canal remodeling
(where necessary, including water courses), public tubewells, electrification,
drains, pumping stations and evaporation ponds. WAPDA would be responsible
also for the procurement of equipment and vehicles required under the project.
The General Manager (GM) of WAPDA Northern Zone (NZ) would have overall
responsibility for the final design and construction of the civil works.
The Director (Planning), WAPDA (NZ), in Lahore, under the GM (NZ), would
carry out the final design. A project construction unit (also under GM (NZ)),
headed by a Project Director would be established and made responsible for the
construction. The Unit, based in Rahimyar Khan, would have four divisions--
Irrigation, Drainage, Mechanical and Electrical, and Agriculture and Monitoring
(Annex 12).
5.02      On-Farm Investments comprise private tubewells in Unit III, land
leveling on about 100,000 ac and soil amelioration with gypsum on about
40,000 ac. Private tubewells would be installed by several contractors, in-
cluding the Agricultural Engineering Section of the Agricultural Department
which operates in Rahimyar Khan and the nearby Bahawalpur, Multan and Sukkur
Districts. These contractors have capabilities to sink between 800 and
1,000 wells a year.



- 22 -
5.03      Land leveling would be planned and supervised by trained surveyors
from the Agricultural Engineering Section, who would mark out the fields and
check the completed work. The surveyors would be trained by PLLP to the same
standard of proficiency as their own staff. An assurance has been obtained
from GOPunjab that it would provice the necessary training to, and approve the
post of, at least six additional surveyors in the Agricultural Engineering
Section by December 31, 1978, to enable them to plan and supervise precision
land leveling in the SCARP VI area.
5.04      The actual leveling would be carried out either by the Department
of Agriculture or by private contractors according to farmer choice. Assur-
ances have been obtained from GOPunjab that the Department of Agriculture
bulldozer strength in the Rahimyar Khan District would be maintained at least
at the present level of 25 operating units while the demand for their services
exists, and the tractors provided to the Department under the project would
at all times give priority to land leveling work.
5.05      After leveling and bunding, an estimated 160,000 ac would require
reclamation with gypsum. However, it is estimated that only about 40,000 ac
would be reclaimed during the project implementation period of six years.
Gypsum requirements would be determined by the soils laboratory in Bahawalpur,
which is attached to the Agricultural Research Station. The laboratory would
be expanded under the project to do the required analyses (Annex 2). Staff
attached to it would identify the problem in the field and provide the neces-
sary advice. An assurance has beea obtained from GOPunjab that the soils
laboratory at Bahawalpur would be expanded and staffed to provide adequate
technical support for the soil reclamation works to be carried out both during
the project implementation period mnd thereafter, until all necessary reclama-
tion works have been completed in the project area.
Agricultural Supporting Services
5.06      Agricultural extension would be the responsibility of the Punjab
Department of Agriculture. An IDA project to improve extension services
is currently being appraised, and wiould include the SCARP VI area.
5.07      Fertilizer production, oni stream or planned, is adequate for the
whole of Pakistan until the late 1980s. The present distribution system
and its planned expansion is also adequate to meet increased demands. Suffi-
cient quantities of high quality seeds will soon become available under an
ongoing IDA project (Cr. 620-PAK). Because of the increased area under cotton,
and the increase in demand resulting from an improved extension service, pest
control activities would have to be stepped up considerably (Annex 13).
Assurances have been obtained from GOPunjab that it would ensure the supply
of suitable pesticides and sprayers to meet the increasing demands of project
area farmers.
Consultants
5.08      WAPDA would appoint consultants to help with the final design of the
project as well as to supervise corLstruction. The consulting group would



- 23 -
include specialists in irrigation, drainage, land reclamation, agriculture
power, geo-hydrology and tubewell development. Up to six man-months would be
devoted to assist GOPunjab with a study directed towards devising a system of
water charges more appropriate to present and future needs than that used at
present (para 5.16). The estimated requirement for consultants required for
SCARP VI would be 310 man-months (Annex 7). The consultants working directly
on the project would have the full-time support of WAPDA and Irrigation
Department staff, including that of WAPDA's power wing. They would prepare
operating and maintenance manuals for the project works including specifica-
tion of maintenance standards and allowable deterioration for public tubewells.
In particular, they would define precisely the degree of deterioration per-
missible in any well before rebuilding or replacement becomes necessary. The
appointment of the consultants required for final design of SCARP VI would be
a condition of credit effectiveness.
Coordination of Works
5.09      As is the normal practice for the implementation of projects in
Pakistan, and in order to synchronize the efforts of all concerned, two coor-
dinating committees would be created: a Project Coordination Committee (PCC)
based in the project area in Rahimyar Khan and a Project Steering Committee
(PSC) in Lahore. The PCC would be chaired by the Commissioner, Bahawalpur
with the Project Director appointed as Vice Chairman. Its members would
include but not be confined to Director (Planning) of WAPDA (NZ), the Deputy
Commissioner of the Rahimyar Khan District, Superintending Engineer of the
Irrigation Department in charge of the Panjnad Barrage and Command, Deputy
Director of Agriculture of Rahimyar Khan District, the District Superintending
Engineer of WAPDA's Power Wing, representatives of the CBs giving credit to
farmers in the project area, and representatives of the farming community in
the area. It would meet regularly and deal with problems and difficulties
arising from project coordination and implementation.
5.10      The PSC would be chaired by GOPunjab's Additional Chief Secretary
of Planning and Development. Its members would be the Secretary of Agricul-
ture (GOPunjab), Secretary of Irrigation (GOPunjab), Commissioner of Bahawalpur
Division, WAPDA General Manager (NZ), and WAPDA General Manager - Power Wing.
Both the PCC and PSC would have the power to coopt additional members as
appropriate. The establishment of the PCC and PSC would be a condition of
credit effectiveness.
Operation and Maintenance
5.11      WAPDA would be responsible for operating project works for at least
one year after completion of all components and for attending to all problems
arising during this period. After the trial year, and if overall project
performance is satisfactory, the project would be transferred to the Punjab
Irrigation Department. Total project operating and maintenance costs, includ-
ing replacements are estimated to cost an average of about Rs 70 M/yr at



- 24 -
present prices (Annex 4). Assurances have been obtained from WAPDA and
GOPunjab that they would make adequate and timely budgetary provisions
to cover these costs and provide adequate staff levels to satisfactorily
operate and maintain the project facilities.
5.12      For accurate assessment of project benefits, cropping and produc-
tion data are required regularly. At present, the Department of Agriculture
collects crop area and yield data on a sample basis; the Revenue and Irriga-
tion Departments compile information on total cropped areas, but not yield.
Private tubewell development is at present recorded by the Department of
Agriculture. Under the project, such information would be collated by WAPDA's
Central Monitoring Organization (CMO) which would then be in a position to fill
any perceived gaps in data gathering. Assurances have been obtained from WAPDA
that CMO would conduct a benchmark survey and update it every two years, to
record changes in crop productioa brought about by the project.
Cost Recovery
5.13      Direct recovery of con3truction and operating and maintenance costs
of irrigation and drainage projects in Pakistan is partially effected through
Provincial water charges. In Punjab, water charges vary between crops, and a
farmer's liability is calculated as the area he has under each crop multiplied
by the respective rate for the crop.  Though rates vary substantially, (e.g.
fodder rate = Rs 6.40/ac, orchard rate = Rs 33.60/ac), in all cases charges
form an insignificant proportion of the value of crops per acre, and hence
have virtually no effect on the mix of crops that is grown.
5.14      According to budget statistics, water charges form only about 2.5%
of the national tax income, but provide about 30% of tax revenues directly
collected by the Provincial gove^-nments. Expenditures on O&M alone account
for about 40% of direct Provincial revenues, and need to be increased if
satisfactory standards of maintenance are to be achieved. Consequently,
present water charges are inadequate to cover O&M costs, let alone the
recovery of construction costs.
5.15      There is a pressing need to increase national tax income in Pak-
istan, not only to meet irrigation and drainage system costs but to better
maintain and to improve the whole spectrum of Government infrastructure and
services. Farm budget analyses and estimates of the value of water to farmers
made in the appraisal of this project indicate that substantially increased
water charges or increased taxat:ion could be borne by project beneficiaries.
However, the appropriate level and structure of water charges cannot be
treated satisfactorily on a project specific basis, since the irrigation
and drainage system in the Province is highly integrated and interdependent
between areas. In addition, issues of equity arise between farmers having
different quality land, farmers situated in different canal commands and the
location of land on the watercourse (land near the "head" of the watercourse
receives much better supplies than that near the "tail"). Also, any examina-
tion of water charges must take Lnto account other agricultural taxes.



25 -
These include, for example, a system of taxing agricultural products which
now contributes Rs 2.7 billion/year, or between 15 and 20% of total national
revenues from tax. About half as much again is paid indirectly by farmers in
the form of a transfer to wheat consumers due to wheat procurement prices that
are kept artificially low. In the project area, for example, export taxes
alone on the incremental production of cotton generated by investments in
SCARP VI would amount to Rs 74 million annually which would more than cover
project O&M costs. In devising means to increase revenues from agriculture,
particular attention would need to be given to maintaining incentives to
farmers and introducing a progressive tax structure.
5.16      During negotiations, terms of reference for a study (Annex 14) were
discussed, and agreement was reached on its timing and scope. The principal
elements in the review would be:
Part I
-    Operation and maintenance of the Provincial irrigation and
drainage system - the costs of effective O&M and the extent
to which these should be met by irrigation water users
through direct water charges;
-    Public savings - the extent to which Government should cap-
ture part of the increases in net benefits generated by new
investments in irrigation for funding future investment in
agriculture and elsewhere and to what extent this should
be through direct water charges;
Part II
-    Level of overall agricultural taxation - the appropriate-
ness of this level and its structure in relation to in-
come distribution and the appropriateness of the share
contributed by direct water charges.
Without prejudging the results of the study, an increase in water charges
would appear feasible and desirable; it could be made progressive and thus
would have a positive effect on income distribution, would be preferable to
an increase in taxes on output from the economic efficiency viewpoint, and
would accrue directly to GOPunjab. If this conclusion were supported, the
study should recommend:
-    differentials between different farm sizes, types of
irrigation, farm locations on the watercourse and
between SCARP and non-SCARP areas;
-    systems of imposition and collection of water charges.
Assurances were obtained from GOP that it would carry out a study, under
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, on the structure and level of



- 26 -
agricultural pricing and taxatior with particular reference to water charges;
the study would be furnished to IDA for discussion by September 30, 1979.
Assurances were obtained from GOE'unjab that, after consultation with GOP and
IDA, it would introduce revisions to the structure and level of water charges,
taking into account the conclusions of the study, by July 1, 1980. Unless,
based on the recommendations of the study, GOP, GOPunjab and IDA otherwise
agree, Punjab would, not later than July 1, 1980, July 1, 1985 and July 1,
1990 raise the level of water charges in Punjab in three stages so that by
July 1, 1990, either (i) water charges in Punjab are sufficient to recover
the full cost of O&M plus a reasonable proportion of the capital cost of the
Province's irrigtion and drainage facilities, or (ii) water charges in the
Project area are sufficient to recover the full cost of O&M plus a reasonable
proportion of the capital costs of the project area's irrigation and drainage
facilities. Assurances were further obtained from GOPunjab that water charges
in each Unit of the project would, within one year after completion of works
in that Unit, be raised to the maximum permissible rate under prevailing
legislation. If project area water charges are increased to cover project
O&M, direct project rent recovery from water charges would amount to about
23%, and indirect recovery, principally from the tax on cotton, would amount
to a further 34% (Annex 17).
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES AND FARM INCOME
Future Cropping Patterns and Yields
6.01      Project works would ena,le higher cropping intensities to be
achieved mainly in cotton, wheat, sugarcane and orchards. It is estimated
that with the project overall cropping intensities would rise, in Units II
and III, from the present 99% and 101% to 135% and 126%, respectively, and
in Units IV and V from 99% and 107% to 125% and 128%. In the perennial units
(IV and V), the balance between Iharif and rabi cropping intensities would
be approximately maintained. In che non-perennial Units (II and III), where
subtantial rabi supplies would be available for the first time, the propor-
tion of rabi crops in the total cropped area would increase.
6.02      Without the project, berause of the rising water table and soil
salinization, there would be an i:crease in the kharif rice acreage in Units
II and V and a more than correspoading decrease in the cotton area, because
of the higher irrigation requireme3nts of rice. In the rabi, wheat would de-
crease, and pulses and oilseeds, both of which can tolerate a higher water
table, would increase. Land use of areas remaining in cultivation would be
intensified to compensate for land that would have to be abandoned. Even-
tually, however, waterlogging and salinity would reach such levels that by
about 1990 it would no longer be possible to maintain present crop acreages.
6.03      The figures below show i:he expected aggregate trend in yields and
crop areas. Full details of expected yields, inputs and cropping patterns
by project Unit are given in AnneLes 15 and 16.

Market Prospects
6.04      The market for the crops produced in the area is reliable and
well developed. The area is well served by local roads and is on the main
Karachi-Lahore railroad (para 3.22). In good crop years, large quantities
of wheat are shipped to deficit areas in Pakistan, and this will continue
for the foreseeable future. Two sugar mills are at present operating in
the area. They, and the overall high demand for gur, ensure a ready market
for sugarcane. Adequate local facilities exist to process the expected in-
crease in cotton production which is in demand for both domestic and export
use.
Prices
6.05      Prices used in the economic analysis for internationally traded
crops and inputs are primarily based on Bank projections for world market
prices for 1985. Adjustments have been made to allow for transport and pro-
cessing costs, and to reflect the historic differences between world prices
and prices paid or received by Pakistan. These differences arise from qual-
ity differences and international transport costs. For non-traded commodi-
ties, economic prices are based on prevailing and projected financial prices,
adjusted by the average ratio of financial to economic prices for traded
agricultural commodities. All economic prices are computed using an exchange
rate of US$1=Rs 9.9 (Annex 17).
6.06      Financial prices are based on prevailing market prices adjusted for
transport costs to farm gate prices. The comprehensive structure of Govern-
ment controls, taxes and subsidies results in substantial differences between
financial and economic prices. In recent years, these differences have been
reduced due to increased domestic prices and decreased world price. Future
financial prices are projected on the assumption that the present ratios will
persist. Linear Programming analysis indicates that water availability is the main



- 28 -
constraint on present production, and, given increased supplies, prevailing
financial prices provide adequate incentives to increase production.
Farm Incomes
6.07      Estimated net farm incomes for owner-operated farms from crops, in-
cluding wage income from off-farm work in agriculture and assuming the exist-
ing levels of water rates are raised to recover O&M costs, are shown below:
Net Farm Income by Farm Size
(Rs)
---- 5 ac             ---- 12.5 ac ----       ---- 25 ac -----
P      W       i'      P      W        W      P       W       W
Unit II        2,800  2,725   6,720  6,895  7,738  16,925  12,085  14,305  30,610
Unit III       2,900  3,175   6,395  7,095  9,095  15,085  11,875  16,005  27,085
Units IV & V  2,970  3,065   6,545  7,305  8,315  15,815  12,600  13,750  28,260
P = Present, W   Future without project (1990), W = Future with project (1990)
6.08      Most sharecropped farms are in the 7.5-12.5 ac class.  Farm income
in cash for such farms is rather less than half that for an owner operated
farm. However, tenants receive free housing, fodder for their animals and
often some basic food ration.
6.09      Off-farm employment as hired labor in agriculture contributes
one-third of total income for 5 ac farms. Data were not available to esti-
mate other income to farm households which, allowing for income from live-
stock, is probably substantial.
6.10      With the project, farm incomes are expected to double.  For the
small farms (5 ac), off-farm employment would provide a higher absolute in-
come but a smaller proportion of total income (about one quarter) than at
present. Tenants' income would increase slightly more in relative terms,
because any increases in water charges would be borne by the landlords.
6.11      Without the project, overall farm incomes would rise only slightly,
but the increased supply of labor due to population growth would result in
reduced demands for hired labor, increased competition for available employ-
ment and hence a reduction in income from this source to the smaller farmers.



- 29 -
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Anticipated Overall Effects
7.01      The land resources in the SCARP VI area are underutilized due to
deteriorating soil conditions and inadequate irrigation supplies. The project
would relieve these deficiencies, which in turn would substantially increase
agricultural production and increase employment opportunities in agriculture
and related processing industries.
Production Benefits
7.02      The estimated incremental production increases at full project
development, ten years after project completion, would amount annually to
230,000 tons of foodgrains, 87,000 tons of seed cotton and 12,000 tons of oil-
seeds. After deducting the increased costs of production and inputs, the net
contribution to the economy would be Rs 460 million per year.
Employment Effects
7.03      Increased demand for labor would result primarily from increased
cropping intensities and higher labor inputs per croped acre. The labor
demand would increase from the present 31 M man-days per year to 50 M man-days
at full project development. Secondary effects in the agricultural processing
industries due to increased production, and in other industries due to higher
farm incomes, would also be substantial. The main supply of labor for this
increased demand would come from the smaller farms.
Income Distribution
7.04      The main determinant of income distribution would be, as at present,
the distribution of land ownership, which is skewed in favor of larger hold-
ings (40% of the land area is owned by 13% of the farmers). An inadequate
agricultural environment is the main constraint on all farmers in the area,
however, and it is impracticable to release this constraint selectively.
Thus the main justification for this project is the effect on overall agri-
cultural production. The smaller and poorer farmers in the project area would
also benefit due to the sharp increase in employment opportunities for which
they would be the main source of labor. In the case of sharecroppers, any
increase in water rates would be borne by the landlords, so that tenants would
share in the benefits of the project but not in the costs.
Economic Evaluation
7.05      The project has been evaluated as a complete package and by individ-
ual Units (Annex 18). The analysis by Unit is only indicative for two main
reasons.  Firstly, there are interdependencies between Units (e.g. drainage
water from Unit II provides irrigation for Unit V; lowering the water table in



- 30 -
Unit I also helps maintain the witer balance in Unit IV), and secondly, there
are economies of scale in canal remodeling, so that once remodeling is under-
taken the marginal cost of providling a further increment of capacity is much
less than the average cost.
7.06      Attributing costs on a pro rata basis of the area served by each
category of expenditures gives rates of return as follows:
Unit II               19%
Unit III              25%
Unit IV               30%
Unit V                13%
Total Project               19%
Application of gypsum to reclaim alkali-affected land, which would be under-
taken on a pilot scale in the project, has not been evaluated and its benefits
are not taken into account in the above. The primary reason for this compo-
nent is to test and develop the techniques which should have wide applicabil-
ity in the country as a whole. The main effect of this project component
would be on individual farms that have substantial alkali problems. At the
project level, the area of land involved is small (about 3% of the project
area), and thus is insignificant in the overall economics.
Project Risk
7.07      The project would entail no special risks other than those normally
associated with irrigation projects. Projected yields are conservative and
benefits depend mainly on increases in cropped area. Linear programming
analysis shows that water availability is the primary present constraint on
cropped area, and the project wou:Ld substantially relieve this constraint.
The rate of return of the project under various adverse assumptions is shown
below:
(a)  Benefit realization delayed two years:                 15%
(b)  Cost increase of 20%                                   16%
(c)  Benefit decrease of 20%                                16%
(d)  Combination of (b) and (c)                             12%
An IDA agricultural extension project is under appraisal for SCARP VI and
other areas in Punjab. This extension project would improve farm practices
and increase the use of farm inputs. Consequently, it should improve upon
the yields estimated for this project (Annex 15).

taking into account the conclusions of the study referred
to in para 8.01(c) by July 1, 1980. Unless, based on the
conclusions and recommendations of the study, the Borrower,
Punjab and IDA shall otherwise agree, Punjab would, not
later than July 1, 1980, July 1, 1985 and July 1, 1990 raise
water charges in three stages so that by July 1, 1990 either:
(i) water charges in Punjab are sufficient to recover all
operating and maintenance costs plus a reasonable proportion
of investment costs of drainage and irrigation facilities in
the Province, or (ii) water charges in the SCARP VI area
are sufficient to recover all operating and maintenance
costs plus a reasonable proportion of the capital costs
of irrigation and drainage facilities located in the
Project area (para 5.16); and
(j) water charges in each Unit of the project would within
one year after completion of works in that Unit, be
raised to the maximum permissible rate under prevailing
legislation (para 5.16).
8.05      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) all conditions applicable to GOP, GOPunjab and WAPDA for
the effectiveness of the grant from the UK and the credit
from the Federal Republic of Germany had been fulfilled
(para 4.26);
(b) consultants for the final design of SCARP VI had been
appointed under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA
(para 5.08); and
(c) the Project Coordination Committee and the Project Steering
Committee had been established (para 5.10).
8.06      With the above assurances received, and the conditions of effective-
ness met, the project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$70 M. The Borrower
would be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Soils and Drainage
A.   Soils
Surveys and Classification
1.        The soils of the project area were surveyed on a semi-detailed
scale and sampled for analysis on a one-mile grid in the mid-1960s by the
former Water and Soil Investigation Division (WASID) of WAPDA. In accord-
ance with the contemporary requirements for project planning, the soils were
grouped into five mapping units, according to texture between a depth of
about 6 to 72 inches. These five groups were designed primarily to delineate
presumed differences in drainability, considered to be the most important
soil-related constraint that would prevent the attainment of full crop pro-
duction potential. The grouping did not endeavor to portray existing or
future problem areas. Fortunately, areas showing soil problems were closely
approximated by parts of the culturable area designated as salt-affected
(saline and/or alkali) or waterlogged, or both. Special checks and field
inspections by the appraisal mission indicate that the original WASID data
provide a good indication of the extent of adverse soil conditions. Whereas
the WASID soil classification system was not according to present standards,
sufficient data were available to enable a reasonable assessment of the more
important soil constraints.
Soil Characteristics
2.        The soils of the project area were formed almost entirely from
relatively homogeneous alluvium deposited by the Indus River system. Floods,
winds, changes in the course of rivers and moving sand dunes have created
mixed patterns of deposition, but relatively few significantly different
types of soils have been formed. The principal soil forming factors: rain-
fall, wind, temperature, relief, erosion, vegetation, time and man's activi-
ties, have modified the original alluvium only slightly; the soils are
immature and lack well-defined profile characteristics.
3.        In general, the soils are mostly coarse to medium in texture; light
to dark brown in color, slightly to moderately calcareous and therefore
moderately alkaline in reaction; low in organic matter and nitrogen, low to
moderately low in phosphorus and well supplied with potash. The clay com-
plexes consist mainly of illitic and amorphous materials; cation exchange
and water retention capacities are moderate; infiltration and permeability
rates are moderate to high; and the soils are well drained where outlets
exist and could be easily drained by providing appropriate facilities.
35



ANNEX 2
Page 2
They are well aggregated and easily cultivated. Calcium sulphate (gypsum)
occurs in large areas; the resistance to alkali hazards is high, and most of
the salt-affected lands are relatively easy to reclaim.
4.        More specifically, about a third of the soils are very coarse to
slightly coarse (dune sands to sandy loams). The coarse soils are permeable,
easily drained, easily cultivated, less fertile and have relatively low
water-retention capacities; therefore, they are best suited for producing
deeper rooted crops or crops with moderate to low water requirements. About
a sixth of the soils are fairly fine-textured (clay loans and silty clay loams)
with high water-retention capacities and relatively high inherent fertility;
however, they are somewhat difficult to cultivate, have relatively low
infiltration and permeability rates and restricted internal drainage. As a
result, a high percentage of these soils are salt-affected (saline and/or
alkali) and waterlogged. They can be successfully farmed by following careful
soil and water management practices, and are best suited for rice, wheat,
cotton and fodder crops. About 50% of the project area has medium textured
soils (loams and silt loamns) with moderate infiltration and permeability
rates, generally favorable internal drainage characteristics and moderately
high moisture-retention capacities. They are suitable for most crops but
are subject to salinity hazards where the drainage facilities are not adequate.
Soil Constraints
5.        The significant soil-related constraints are therefore fertility,
texture, drainage, salinity and alkali.
(a) Fertility is seldom listed as a soil constraint since,
almost without exception, crops must be fertilized
regardless of inherent soil fertility. Because most
of the project soils a-re relatively coarse and have
been subjected to flooding and high temperatures, they
are deficient in organ:Lc matter and in nitrogen, quite
low in phosphorus, probably relatively low in other
essential elements such as sulphur and zinc but ade-
quately supplied with potash.
(b)  Soil texture is a constraint wherever sands and loamy
sands, which comprise about 18% of the project soils,
are found. These soils have low water holding capacity.
Except where water supplies are plentiful or the ground-
water level is high, coarse soils are best suited for
deep rooted and drought resistant crops. High crop
yields require careful water management, frequent
irrigation, particularly in warm weather, and frequent
fertilizer applications. Severe salinity problems do
not occur because of their high infiltration rates.
Most of the severe salinity is associated with medium
and fine textures.  In the project area, only 0.03%            36



ANNEX 2
Page 3
of the soils are clays; these have associated infiltra-
tion and permeability problems and are at present salt-
affected.
(c) Drainage. Plant growth and therefore crop yields are
depressed where the groundwater table impinges on the
root zone. Soil saturation impairs the circulation of
air, prevents nitrification and the decay of organic
matter, damage structure and tilth, hinders cultivation,
cools the soil and thereby delays seed germination.
Most importantly, a high watertable impedes or even
prevents leaching and accelerates the upward movement
of soluble salts and their accumulation in the root zone.
This contributes to, or can even cause, salinity and alkali
problems.
(d) Salinity and alkali. Primarily inadequate subsurface
drainage and, to some extent, insufficient and incor-
rectly administered irrigation have resulted in the
development of saline and alkali soil conditions.
Laboratory data collected by WASID in the course of
its survey of the area (para 1), the local "Thur
Girdawari" of the Irrigation Department 1/ and a check
made by the Consultant provide information on the extent
of salinity and alkali in the project area. These basic
concepts are discussed in some detail below. Before
discussing these values and their present and potential
impact on crop production, it is useful to define the
terms: saline and alkali soils.
Salinity and Alkali Soil Conditions - definitions and criteria
6.        Saline soils are defined as those that contain sufficient soluble
salts in the root zone to suppress the growth of most crop plants. A saline
soil, according to the U.S. Salinity Laboratory and most other authorities,
has a saturation extract conductivity (ECe) of 4 millimhos per cm or more
and an exchangeable sodium-percentage (ESP) of less than 15. Alkali soils
contain sufficient exchangeable sodium -- by common definition 15% or more -
seriously to impair the physical properties of the soil, especially the
permeability of air and water -- and therefore interferes with the development
of most crops. Alkali soils are commonly highly alkaline in reaction (pH of
soil paste is 8.5 or more) but they do not contain harmful amounts of salts.
Saline-alkali soils contain excessive quantities of soluble salts and ex-
changeable sodium as defined above, but are not necessarily highly alkaline.
It is important to note that critical salinity levels have been determined
1/   A survey based on visual evidence, conducted last in 1972/73, concluded
that 18.2% of the land in SCARP VI was "Thur", i.e., salt-affected.
37



ANNEX 2
Page 4
under conditions where crop variety, seed quality, insect, disease and weed
control were not limiting crop growth, and, in particular, soil and water
management and fertilization was also optimized. Little reliable information
is available on the precise relationships between different salinity levels
and associated crop yields when aay of the foregoing factors are sub-optimal,
which is the usual state of affairs in the less highly developed agricultural
communities, including Pakistan. Nevertheless it is certain that, because of
the lower level of inputs and management practices in the agriculturally still
developing countries, the deleterious effects of given levels of salinity on
current crop yields, when compared with unaffected areas, are not nearly as
great as indicated in salt tolera-ace tables which were compiled, usually,
under highly developed farming conditions. Similarly, as regards critical
alkali levels, soils with ESP values at or slightly above 15 may not have
deteriorated sufficiently to affect crops if the soil is coarse textured or
well aggregated, if the clays are illitic, amorphous or kaolinitic in char-
acter, or if the high sodium soil layer is at some depth in the profite
(generally more than three feet).
7.        Since field trips and an aerial survey of the project area appeared
to have borne out the foregoing observations, the WASID data were reviewed
and reclassified according to standards considered more appropriate under
the prevailing farming conditions in the area.  Table 1 shows the results
of the comparison.  As expected, the more realistic use of an ECe value of
about five for the coarser soils and six for the finer, to delineate salinity,
indicated that only 25% to 30% of the soils were sufficiently saline to
affect crop growth and therefore :In need of reclamation. Furthermore, con-
sideration of the role of the predominant clay complex (illitic and amorphous),
depth to the "alkali layer", texture and/or soil permeability, and in parti-
cular, the presence of an appreciable amount of gypsum in or above soil layers
containing excess exchangeable sodlium, resulted in the conclusion that only
10% of these soils (instead of 42%) are "truly alkali". During the data
review, another 6% or 7% was placed in a questionable group either because of
marginal exchangeable sodium percentages, permeability or gypsum content; *it
is assumed that about half of these would eventually require reclamation. It
is therefore concluded that about 13% of the project area (165,000 ac) would
require alkali reclamation for satisfactory crop growth. Since most of the
"probably alkali" soils are also saline (i.e., most of the problem soils are
saline-alkali), not more than about 25% of the project soils would require
either leaching to remove excess salinity, or a chemical amendment, such as
gypsum, coupled with leaching, to remove excess exchangeable sodium. Ob-
viously reclamation is possible orLly if drainage facilities are adequate.
B.   Drainage
8.        In most of the project area, the relief is flat, natural drainage-
ways ill-defined and inadequate. Under present water distribution and manage-
ment practices, drainage problems exist where the water table lies within
five feet of land surface, and problems may develop where the water table is
within 10 ft. In both cases, in addition to the direct effects on crop
38



ANNEX 2
Page 5
growth, upward movement of groundwater by capillarity contributes appreciably
to existing or potential salinity problems. The areas with a water table
within five feet of the surface require drainage to sustain or improve pres-
ent productivity and as a prerequisite to efficient use of the additional
irrigation supplies that would be made available by the project. Control
of subsurface drainage does not necessarily require lowering and maintaining
the water table at depths of 10 ft or more. With adequate water applica-
tions to ensure leaching of salts from the root zone and a pattern of
groundwater use or disposal that provides for elimination of a portion of
the leachate, successful irrigation can be practiced when the water table
is at a depth of five feet or less.
9.        Approximately 60% of the project area had the water table at less
than 10 ft in 1960 and 1974 when it was surveyed (and presumably also in
1977), but only about 10% at five feet or less. Thus, under present condi-
tions, groundwater levels appear to be more or less at equilibrium.
Conclusions and Recommendations
10.       Soil Survey and Classification.  Although the land classification
system used in the project area was deficient by modern standards, the
intensity of the soil inspections, the accuracy of the group separations,
reasonable characterization of the more important soil constraints (texture,
drainage, salinity and alkali) and the amount of supporting laboratory data
provide an adequate basis for project implementation purposes. Since soil
surveys have not been in sufficient detail to provide the information needed
for reclamation of saline and alkali soils, this study and farmer recommenda-
tions arising therefrom will be provided under the project.
11.       Salinity and Alkali.  As indicated (para 7), about 25% of the proj-
ect area (approximately 320,000 ac) require reclamation to permit profitable
crop production. About half of these soils require only leaching to remove
excess salinity; half would require the addition of gypsum, coupled with
leaching to remove excess exchangeable sodium (i.e., alkali). The gypsum
requirement will average about five tons 1/ per acre, and the water required
for leaching of saline and/or alkali soils will average about two acre-feet.
Both kinds of problem soils should first be leveled and bunded. Gypsum should
be incorporated into the soils as deeply as possible (6 to 12 inches or more)
and the field then leached until a minimum of two feet of water has passed
through. The saline areas require leaching only. Crops can be grown during
the leaching process in both cases but the fertilizer requirements will be
higher than normal, particularly after leaching, and it may be necessary to
apply zinc (usually as zinc sulphate) at a rate of 40 pounds per acre to the
alkali soils to obtain reasonably good crop growth.
1/   This refers to 100% pure and not to "mine-run", gypsum, which usually
contains a high proportion of worthless material. The gypsum should
be pulverized so that about 80% will pass a 40 mesh sieve.
39



ANNEX 2
Page 6
12.       The only requirements for reclamation are:  (1) willingness on the
part of the farmer to make the attempt; (2) availability of water for leaching,
and, (3) an adequate drainage system so that the saline effluent can be dis-
posed. Thus, most of the strict:ly saline soils could be reclaimed two or three
years after suitable drainage facilities have been provided. However, alkali
reclamation is much more costly and slower. Suitably prepared gypsum, and
competent advice must be readily available to the farmers. Considering all
factors, it is estimated that not over 40,000 of the estimated 160,000 ac
of alkali soils in the project area will be reclaimed during the project
construction period.
13.       The reclamation of alkali soils would have to be monitored and its
progress controlled by a soils laboratory equipped for the task. Such a lab-
oratory would also check leaching requirements and monitor the betterment
process, on saline soils. The soils laboratory now in Bahawalpur (Annex 13)
would have to be supplied with suitable additional equipment to fulfill this
task. Such equipment would include conductivity bridges, pH meters, a flame
photometer, shakers and sieves; also soil sampling tools and equipment to
test soil permeability. Estimated costs are given in Annex 6, "Survey and
Laboratory Equipment."
14.       Drainage.  Provision for drainage will restore waterlogged land to
full productivity, permit the application of full irrigation supplies to land
that is now under-irrigated because of drainage problems and allow the recla-
mation of a large acreage of severely salt-affected land. It is estimated
that about 100,000 ac of land are now waterlogged, an equal or larger area
cannot be more intensively cropped because of incipient waterlogging, and
perhaps another 200,000 ac could be reclaimed and made available for profit-
able cropping by provision for adequate drainage facilities.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Groundwater: Recharge, Quality and Levels
A.   Present Situation
1.        The Aquifer.  The pro-ject area is on an alluvial complex of recent
age, deposited by the ancestral rivers of the Indus drainage system. The
alluvium consists predominantly of coarse clastic sediments and is saturated
with water, often to within a few feet of the ground surface, thus consti-
tuting an extensive aquifer.
2.        The thickness of the alluvium is not known accurately, but it is
thought to exceed 1,500 ft in places and is known to be more than 400 ft
everywhere in the project area. The bulk of the alluvium consists of fairly
well sorted fine to medium sand. Silty sands and silts are common; clays
are generally rare. Layers of gravel-like carbonate concentrations (kankar)
of irregular size are found scattered in the subsoil.
3.        The nature and properties of the alluvium have been studied by
means of approximately 100 boreholes and test wells, including pumping
tests and piezometers associatecl with some of them. The distribution of
the various lithologies is not uniform. Clays and silts are common at
shallow depths, particularly in the southeast of the area, where the upper-
most deposits may be related to the smaller old Hakra River, rather than one
of the major tributaries of the Indus system. Nevertheless, even in that
area, sands predominate below seme 50 ft depth.
4.        The hydraulic properties of the aquifer are available from the nine
pumping tests carried out by WASID (Table 1). Results show that the calcu-
lated transmission and storage parameters of the aquifer fall within a satis-
factory and narrow range. Vertical permeabilities of the water table zone are
high, despite the occurrence of clay and kankar layers.
5.        Groundwater Quality distribution in the area (as in the rest of the
Indus alluvial system) is complex. In broad terms, there is a wide trough of
fresh water parallel to the river, a transitional belt, 4 km wide, running
more or less along the main railway line, and a saline water zone to the
southwest, towards the Cholistar Desert. In terms of the development units,
Units II and III are underlain mainly by fresh groundwater and Units IV and
V by saline groundwater. There is considerable variation in groundwater
quality for all areas: patches of poor quality water occur in fresh ground-
water areas and some water of reasonable quality is found in the saline zone.
42



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Table 2 shows this variation clearly. The overall quality of fresh ground-
water in Units II and III, particularly as regards conjunctive use with the
very high quality river supplies, is satisfactory; however, in Units IV and
V the water quality is generally not suitable for irrigation.
6.        Groundwater Levels in the project area have been monitored since
1928 (i.e. four years before the Panjnad Headworks were constructed), using
a network of 155 shallow observation wells. Some of them have been installed
only recently and a few are not functioning properly, nevertheless the data
give a fairly clear idea of changes in the water table since the introduc-
tion of controlled irrigation. The Panjnad Main Line now runs along a topo-
graphic high, which was previously used by a series of inundation channels.
The leakage had produced a high water table in a portion of the area long
before 1932. Further to the southeast, in the present perennial area, where
the inundation supplies were much smaller and less reliable, the water table
was much lower. The whole system was probably in equilibrium, with the main
outflow being subsurface drainage towards the southeast. The construction
of the Panjnad Headworks and its associated canal system resulted in water
table rise until a new equilibrium was achieved by subsurface outflows towards
the Cholistan Desert or the adjacent Gudu Command, evaporation and evapo-
transpiration from the higher water tables and by groundwater abstractions
from open wells and tubewells.
7.        In almost all areas, the water table appears once again to be in
balance, and has not changed significantly since about 1960. The main outflow
is thought to be evaporation or evapotranspiration from the water table except
in Unit III, where, on average, the water table is deeper than 10 ft below
ground level, and the recharge from drainable surplus is balanced mainly by
well abstractions and subsurface outflow. The position of the water table
and its variation in recent years is summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The water-
logging problem is not severe under the present irrigation regime. Overall,
14% of the total Abbasia and Panjnad Command has the water table within five
feet of the ground surface. In about half the total area the water table is
between five and ten feet and in the rest deeper than 10 ft. With reason-
able agricultural management, water tables more than five feet in depth
should have little or no adverse effect on field crop production (Annex 2).
Groundwater Balance
8.        Subsurface inflow was computed using the Darcy equation with the
following parameters:
Average lateral permeability    =    0.0015 ft/sec
Effective aquifer thickness      =    400 ft
Aquifer width                     =    12.3 mile4
Average hydraulic gradient       =    4.5 x 10
An estimate based on these figures is an inflow of 12,700 ac-ft per annum.
This contribution is mainly down valley, via Unit I. In terms of the project
area of this appraisal the gains are in Units II and IV. It is considered that
43



ANNEX 3
Page 3
this subsurface inflow will be reduced to negligible proportion by the im-
plementation of a tubewell pumping scheme at present under construction in
Unit I.
9.        Seepage from Rivers.  Total seepage from the rivers to the aquifers
of the Northern Indus Plains has been estimated at about 2.0 MAF per annum.
This is assumed to be constant per unit length of river bank and would there-
fore give the following recharge to the project area:
Unit II           0.0417 MAF/annum
Unit III          0.0493 MAF/annum
Unit IV           0
Unit V            0
10.       Seepage from Canals.  The conveyance losses have been estimated as
follows for main canals and branches:
QA     =     0.0133xLxQ 0.5625
Where QA     =      losses in a reach in cusecs
Q      =     discharge in the reach in cusecs
L      =     length of the reach in thousands of feet
Of these losses, 10% are taken as evaporation and 90% as seepage losses,
i.e. aquifer replenishment. Ia distributaries including minors, the total
losses are taken as 15% of supplies at head, of which 80% is seepage.
11.       The total losses from canals and distributaries come to about 35%
of diversions at the Panjnad Headworks, about 15% of which is lost to the
system by evaporation and non-beneficial evapotranspiration. Thus, recharge
to the aquifer is about 30% of headworks diversions.
12.       The areawise distriblition of this recharge is not uniform as more
main and branch canals pass through Units I and II than elsewhere.   Using
available data, the recharge i3 distributed as follows: (Unit I is included
for completeness):
Unit I           21% of the total
Unit II          31% of the total
Unit III         20% of the total
Unit IV           5% of the total
Unit V           23% of the total
13.       Losses from Watercou:rses and Irrigated Fields.  The losses from
watercourses are taken as 10% of the deliveries at the watercourse head,
half of which is assumed to reach the water table and half is wasted by
evaporation. Deep percolation from irrigated fields is taken as 20% of
supplies delivered at the heads of watercourses, a figure supported by all
available reports.  Thus, the total losses from watercourses and irrigated
44



ANNEX 3
Page 4
fields are estimated to be 30% of deliveries at watercourses head. The
contribution to recharge from these sources is taken as 25% of deliveries
at watercourse head, which is equivalent to 16.25% of diversions at the
Panjnad Headworks for water from that source.
14.       Rainfall Percolation, based on the annual median value of rainfall
of two inches, is distributed as follows:
Unit II           0.0240 MAF
Unit III          0.0282 MAF
Unit IV           0.0039 MAF
Unit V            0.0252 MAF
15.       Subsurface Outflow was computed as for the inflow, using the follow-
ing parameters:
aquifer width                    11.8 miles
average hydraulic gradient        5.2x10
and permeability and effective aquifer depth as before. The calculated out-
flow is 14,000 AF per annum.
16.       Abstractions by Wells:  The present estimated groundwater abstrac-
tions by tubewells and open wells are as follows:
1974-75
Type of Wells/Unit      II         III        IV          V         Total
-------------------ac -ft -----------------------

Public Tubewells      35,843       6,990        -         -         42,833
Private Tubewells   142,018    195,577    3,348        41,415      382,358
Total           267,863    267,952    3,496       50,657     589,868
It is estimated that of the total of approximately 0.6 MAF of pumpage, some
25% or 0.15 MAF per annum is returned to the aquifer as seepage.
17.       Evaporation and Evapotranspiration from the groundwater table are
taken as the major outflow components of the balance equation. However, as
they cannot be measured and are difficult to estimate, they generally are
calculated by difference. Evaporative losses included are either evaporated
directly from the water table or transpired by vegetation with roots near the
water table. Of these, direct evaporation is the major component.
18.       Because of differences in depth to water table and variation in soil
types, evaporation losses can be estimated only roughly. However, the estimates
obtained by difference must be checked to make sure that they are reasonable.
Table 5 gives a groundwater balance with such estimates of water table evapora-
tion. Converting these figures to depth of water evaporated and percentage of
potential "open water" evaporation gives the following (Unit I is included
for comparison):

/a   Open water evaporation is taken as 6 feet.
The highest evaporation is in Unit I where the water table is nearest to
the surface, and lowest evaporation is in Unit III where the water table
is deepest. The calculated evaporative losses in Units III, IV and V are
probably high because the method ignores subsurface drainage which may be
considerable in these cases. Ir Unit IV in particular, there is a steep
water table gradient towards the Cholistan Desert, and subsurface outflow
is probably responsible for the relatively large calculated evaporative
loss. In Unit III also, there miight be a significant amount of subsurface
outflow to the southwest, towards Gudu Command.
B. PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
The General Setting
19.       The proposed developments would control the water table in areas
which need subsurface drainage now or in the near future, and exploit the
groundwater resource for additional irrigation supplies, where the quality
is satisfactory. The estimated groundwater recharge by Unit at full develop-
ment is expected to be as follows:

The figures show inflows from surface sources only and do not include any
recirculation components from irrigation with groundwater.  Also the subsur-
face inflows and outflows to eachl unit are ignored.

Unit-Wise Development Criteria
20.       Unit II is a fresh groundwater area and some parts of it suffer
from waterlogging. Recently, some 44,000 acres of the commanded area had the
water table at less than five feet from ground level. Much of the severe
waterlogging occurs close to Panjnad Main Line and other major canals. In
addition to the subsurface drainage problems, part of the area (close to
the main Panjnad-Khanpur Road) is a topographic low, which is subject to
frequent flooding by spill water from the river, canals and rainstorms.
21.       Because the canals conveying supplies to Units III and V pass through
Unit II and have high seepage losses, the drainable surplus is particularly
high. Since groundwater levels are mostly above the canal bottoms, seepage
would increase if lowered. Calculations have shown that if all the kharif
irrigation requirements were supplied from surface sources, the drainable
surplus would be greater than the rabi water demand for the design inten-
sities and it would be necessary to export groundwater from the area to
maintain a satisfactory groundwater level.
22.       Because of the complex interrelationships between groundwater irri-
gation and drainage in this Unit, it is proposed that development be based on
public tubewells. Most of these would pump directly into watercourses for
local use. Some would intercept seepage from the major sources of waterlog-
ging and dispose of it into a convenient canal for export. A few of the
wells might have to serve both purposes; if so they would be provided with a
dual disposal system.
23.       The groundwater balance would be maintained as shown:
Inflows (MAF per annum)
1.  Seepage from Rivers                                  0.042
2.  Seepage from Canals                                  0.552 /a
3.  Seepage from Watercourses and Irrigated Fields       0.154
4.  Percolation from Rainfall                            0.024

Total                                           0.965
/a   This figure includes an estimated increase in canal seepage
caused by installation of wells along leaky canals.
/b   It is assumed that the output from existing private wells will
reduce to about half of its present value.
47



ANNEX 3

24.       The peak demand for the tubewell water for local irrigation is
estimated at about 2,000 cusecs constant flow in October and early November.
Assuming, pro rata that about 9% of this will be supplied by private wells,
tubewells are required to produce 1,820 cusecs. The highest operating factor
that could be maintained for about 45 days is considered to be 90%. Thus,
the installed capacity requirerment for the public wells is at least 2,022
cusecs, distributed as follows to suit the pattern of watercourse locations
and sizes:
Capacity          No.
(cusecs)
2.0             286
2.5              160
3.0             350
The overall annual operating factor of these wells on the basis of the irri-
gation demand for tubewell water is 0.48 or about 4,150 hours per year.
25.       Additional capacity will be required to cope with the more serious
cases of canal seepage; the grcundwater would be exported via the irrigation
canal system. Some 400 cusecs of pumpage capacity would be required, involv-
ing 135 tubewells of three cusec capacity each, pumping about 70% of the time.
26.       Unit III is a fresh groundwater area which does not need subsurface
drainage. Data for depth to water table show that none of the area has the
water table at five feet or less and in only 12% of the area is the water
table less than 10 feet from the ground surface.  Furthermore, it appears that
groundwater levels are stable under existing conditions, due probably to sub-
surface outflow rather than evaporation. Even with increased canal supplies,
a rapid rise in water tables to dangerous levels is unlikely as at the proposed
cropping intensities (at full development) the drainable surplus would be
balanced by rabi irrigation demand. Thus, the area seems ideal for private
well development. The local farmers appear to have recognized this and there
are substantially more private tubewells in Unit III than any other part of
the project area.
27.       The water balance at full development is estimated below:
48

2.  Abstractions by Future Private Tubewells              0.275
Total                                            0.637
As can be seen, there is an apparent imbalance of 0.127 MAF per annum, with
the calculated drainable surplus exceeding the proposed pumpage.  However, a
difference of this magnitude is most unlikely to lead to a rise in water ta!)1-
as the calculated undrained surplus under existing conditions is considerably
larger than this, and yet the water table appears to be stable and at accept-
able depths.
28.       Under the project, tubewell operation in the kharif would virtually
cease as the present irrigation deficit would be met by increased canal sup-
plies; thereafter wells will be used almost entirely for rabi irrigation.
29.       Estimated pumpage of existing wells in the future is based on their
installed capacity, but with demands calculated on the basis of a cropping
pattern compatible with the planned development. The estimated peak demand
is some 3,300 cusecs constant flow in late October. Assuming that private
wells would be operated at a high operating factor (say, 18 hours/day or
0.75) for a short time (15 days), overall annual operating factors would be
about 20%.
30.       The installed capacity of existing wells is estimated to be 2,500
cusecs. Therefore, an additional capacity of about 1,900 cusecs is required
to meet the peak demand. For the purpose of cost estimates, tubewells to be
installed are assumed to be as follows:
49

31.       Unit IV is a small saLine groundwater area, located on the edge of
Unit I, next to the desert fringe. It has some waterlogging problems along
its boundary with Unit I, but the water table falls off very rapidly towards
the desert where there is obviously considerable drainage by subsurface out-
flow. The waterlogging problem at the boundary with Unit I will be greatly
improved by the tubewell drainage system that is presently being constructed.
Therefore, no drainage works fo:r Unit IV are proposed. There are a few pri-
vate wells in the area, probablv producing water of marginal quality. These
should continue to operate. The groundwater balance under full development
is given below:
Inflows (MAF per annum)
1.  Seepage from Canals                                 0.082
2.  Seepage from Watercourses and Irrigated Fields    0.071
3.  Percolation from Rainfall                           0.004
Total                                     0.157
Outflows (MAF per annum)

2.  Evaporation and Su.bsurface Outflow                 0.154
Total                                     0.157
Unit V is a saline groundwater area, though some moderate and good quality
water may be found at its south-eastern boundary and in small, isolated
pockets elsewhere. The topographic low, mentioned under Unit II, stretches
into Unit V to the southeast of Rahimyar Khan and Sadiqabad. On account of
this, part of the area suffers from severe waterlogging with some 82,000 acres
having the water table at less than 5 feet from ground surface and is subject
to periodic flooding by river or canal overspill and rainstorm water. Also,
data show that in June 1974, 712 of the area had the water table at between
5 and 10 feet from ground level. Thus, part of the area needs subsurface
drainage now. Furthermore, since it is proposed to increase canal supplies,
the waterlogging problem would increase unless preventive measures are taken.
It is estimated that some 300,OCO acres (about 52% of the CCA) should be pro-
vided with drainage wells.
50



ANNEX 3
Page 10
32.       The upper parts of the aquifer in Unit V contain a high proportion
of clayey material, which in this area would not impede drainage by tubewells,
since the material is permeable (Annex 2, and Table 1). This conclusion is
supported by the absence of perched water tables in the area.
33.       The drainage requirement for the 300,000 acres would be met by 250
drainage wells, each of 3 cusec capacity operating at a factor of 0.7 (or
6,132 hours per year), installed on (or as near as practicable to) a triangular
grid. To be left out of this drainage scheme is the desert fringe, which ap-
parently is drained to some extent by subsurface outflow towards the desert,
and the area adjacent to the Gudu Command where the water table is reasonably
deep. The groundwater balance in the area under full development conditions
is shown below.

PAKISTAN
SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Project Works
A. Canal Remodeling
Design Criteria
1.        Annex 9 develops the water requirements at the barrage for each of
the project units. Units II, III and V get their surface supplies via the
Panjnad Canal; Unit IV from the Abbasia Canal. Unit I, which is part of the
SCARP VI area but not of the project under consideration, derives its surface
supplies from both main canals. The pumpage generated within that unit is
all reused, therefore its water requirement is only of concern for canal
remodeling insofar as it makes demands on the main canals.
2.        Table 1 converts the diversion requirements shown in Annex 9 into
flow figures required to provide the water. The flow figures required for
Unit I have been taken from the appropriate planning report as approved by
GOP for execution. No allowance has been made for future requirements of an
extension project approved under the name Abbasia Flood Channel (AFC) Proj-
ect because the original design of the Abbasia Canal and its headworks made
allowances for the expected need of the AFC area.
3.        Table 2 compares the salient features of the proposed requirements
of the canals with those of the original design and the present operating
conditions. It shows that while the maximum discharge in the Panjnad main
canal has to be increased by 38Z and that of the Abbasia by 18%, the ratio
between maximum and minimum discharge would actually narrow considerably,
thereby easing operating problems. Since the Panjnad main canal serves
seasonal and perennial areas, a further narrowing of the discharge ratio is
not practicable.
Remodeling Design and Works
4.        In designing the remodeled system, note will have to be taken of
the fact that many of the original design cross sections have changed, partly
through siltation and partly through scouring brought about by excessive dis-
charges being forced into some of the canals. Consequently, a detailed survey
of all main and branch canals would be required before the final quantities
of earthwork to be carried out can be accurately established. Sample designs,
based on actual surveys, have been made; the extent of the necessary works,
which may require minor adjustment in the light of the eventually adopted
design cropping pattern (Annex 15) are listed below:
57



ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        Intake Structures.  The intake capacity of both the main canal gates
at the headworks is adequate to accevt the required discharges.
6.        The Paninad Canal Command.
(a)  The Panjnad main canal would have to be strengthened and the
freeboard increased for safety.
(b) The Minchin branch canal wll continue at its present dis-
charge rate but with a rediced command area. Some of its
right bank distributaries 41ll receive water from two new
feeder canals. Their comb.ned length would be about 30 mi
(32 canal miles of 5000 ft .
(c)  The Rahimyar Khan Branch wuuld be similarly remodelled with
two new feeders on its right bank. Their combined length
would be about 24 miles (2; canal miles).
(d) The Sadiq Branch would be supported by one parallel canal
which would originate from the same regulator as the Sadiq
Branch. It would be 48 miles long (51 canal mi).
(e) The Dallas branch, which al present provides most of the
water to Unit III will require minor modification and
strengthening; the structuies would appear to be adequate.
7.        Sections that would, after remodelling, have still to convey more
water than at present would be able to do so after deepening and the strength-
ening of their banks. The structures would be able to pass the additional dis-
charge with only minor modifications.
8.        The Abbasia Command.  The capacity of the top reach of the canal,
which is perennial, would have to be augmented by a parallel canal, about 25
mi (26.5 canal mi) long. The rest of the system would be remodelled, as re-
quired by deepening and strengthening the canals; the structures are adequate.
9.        In summary, the following works require to be done on the canal
system:
Additional          Deepening and Strengthening
Parallel Canals                 Major Canals
m/c.m.                        m/c.m.
Panjnad Command       102/107                       215/227
Abbasia Command       25/26.5                     16.5/17.4
Note:  m    =  mile (5,280 ft)
c.m. = canal mile (5,000 ft)
58



ANNEX 4
Page 3
10.       The total length of subordinate canals, with a carrying capacity
between 800 cusecs and 10 cusecs, averaging about 180 cusecs, is about 1,240
mi. Based on sample surveys, it is estimated that about half the total length
would require some remodelling, the other half, once restored to its design
dimensions and strength, would require no additional work.
New Watercourse Commands
11.       To enable the more efficient utilization of the additional water,
it would not be prudent to increase the flow of any existing watercourse
channel above 1.5 cusecs. Therefore, new modules would have to be built and
new watercourse commands established; these would not exceed the area that, at
peak discharge, requires more than 1 cusec. It is estimated that up to 1,500
new modules would have to be built, about 1,000 of the old modules altered and
about 1,100 miles of new watercourse channels constructed.
Irrigation System Operation
12.       The Problem.  Under project conditions, operation of the irrigation
system will become more complex than before, because instead of the kharif
irrigation supplies coming only from diversions, large amounts will come from
groundwater abstraction within the project area (Annex 9). Therefore, opera-
tions will be a combination of barrage diversions, fresh groundwater use with-
in Unit II and export of fresh groundwater to Unit V. A small "desk top" type
digital computer by the Panjnad Barrage would be necessary to coordinate
operations.
13.       Computer Operations.  The computer would be used to:
(a) predict demand at the Barrage; and
(b)  provide operating instructions for surface and groundwater
irrigation supplies.
Input data to the computer which would be run each day would consist of
constant and varying inputs. Constant inputs would be:
(a)  losses expressed as percentage of discharges;
(b)  irrigation control structure characteristics and maximum
discharge capacity;
(c)  individual canal conveyance capacities and maximum allow-
able flow ratios to maintain regime;
(d)  recharge expressed as percentages of canal flows and field
losses;
(e)  depth to groundwater limitations;
(f)  tubewell pump characteristics and limitations.                59



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Variable inputs would consist cf:
(a) rainfall in past 24 hours by canal command;
(b) crops being grown by minor canal command;
(c) canal discharges measured in the past 24 hours.
14.       Computer Outputs.  The computer would print out the following:
(a) demand at barrage;
(b) discharges required in main, branch, distributary and minor
canals;
(c) gate openings required at all major irrigation control structures;
(d) escape operation;
(e) FGW well operation (watercourse wells);
(f)  FGW well operation (export wells);
(g) SGW well operation; aad
(h) evaporation pond pump settings.
Cost Estimates
15.       Investment Costs.  De: ived largely from sample surveys of relatively
short canal sections, and from i:he extent of anticipated work outlined in
paras 6-10 above, it is estimated that the total cost of canal remodelling,
inclusive of constructing the modules and the new watercourse channels, would
be Rs 180 X, including an indirect foreign exchange component for fuel, oil
and lubricants, of Rs 13.5 M. P'rovision is also made for purchase of remodel-
ing equipment estimated to cost Rs 40 M (foreign exchange component Rs 32 M).
The computer would cost about Rs 200,000, all of it in foreign exchange.
16.       Operation and Maintenance. Despite the remodelling, it is not ex-
pected that the 0 and M costs oif the remodelled canal system will be signifi-
cantly higher than at present. More efficient system operation would reduce
maintenance costs per mile of canal, besides markedly contributing to in-
creasing irrigation efficiencies. Consequently, it is assumed that 0 and M
costs of the remodelled system will be the same per acre CCA as at present,
i.e. Rs 20, or Rs 25.4 M per annum for the project area.
Construction Methods
17.       Since much of the remcdelling would be done while the canals are
flowing, the most suitable machine would be a dragline. The construction of
parallel canals and the remodelling of seasonal branches would be done by
scrapers, bulldozers or hand labor assisted by donkeys.                        60



ANNEX 4
Page 5
18.       Canal remodelling should be scheduled to fit in with the requirements
of the Irrigation Department and the farmers which are subject to variation at
short notice, and also involves question of access and the disposal of spoil.
These complications preclude the use of international contractors, and remodel-
ling works would therefore be carried out after local competitive bidding.
19.       The successful bidders might need to augment their fleet of equip-
ment by importing new machinery or spares. In anticipation of this, the local
and foreign cost estimates are as follows:

B. Well Field Design, Well Construction and Operating Costs
Introduction
21.       Under the project there would be four types of tubewells:  in Unit
V, 3 cusec wells pumping water that would be taken to evaporation ponds; in
Unit II, 3 cusec wells pumping water into the irrigation canals; also in Unit
II, wells of 2 to 3 cusec discharge, pumping into water courses and in Unit
III, wells of 1/2 to 1-1/2 cusec discharge, pumping into field channels
for use by the well owner or owner group.
The Drainage Wells
22.       The aim of the salt water tubewells is to reduce and maintain the
watertable at a maximum possible elevation consistent with not impeding crop
yields or imposing the use of special farming techniques (Annex 2). Such
uniformity is best achieved by a well-field layout as nearly as possible on
a triangular grid system. Therefore, consistent with topography and the lay-
out of the drainage disposal network, there would be one well per 1,200 ac
61



ANNEX 4
Page 6
of CCA, i.e., the approximate distance between the wells would be 2 mi.
Totall number of wells would be 25:).
23.       Casings and well screen!3 would -be made of fiberglass, which would
resist corrosion and incrustation. The turbine pumps and drive shaft would
be of material that would resist iorrosion, such as stainless steel. Unit
cost of the components is given ii Table 3. The cost of one well, inclusive
of civil works for connecting to the main disposal system, would be Rs 208,000
(Table 4). Total cost of this coaponent would be Rs 52 million, inclusive of
foreign exchange of Rs 36 million,
Fresh Water Export Wells
24.        In Unit II, 135 3 cusec wells would be required to export water
which would be surplus to irrigat::.on requirements. These wells would be
situated in depressions where the groundwater levels at present are high and
are likely always to be so and along the main canals from which there is un-
avoidable heavy seepage to the war:ertable. The wells would return water into
the major canals for export into unit V, where it would be used for irrigation.
The wells would be operating throughout the year.
25,       Design of these wells would be the same as that of the drainage
wells: casings and screens would be of fiberglass, the pumps would be turbine
pumps. However, the material of vhich the pumps and drive shafts would be
made need not be corrosion resistcnt, which reduces the overall cost of the
wells to Rs 141,000, inclusive of the disposal works (Table 5). Cost of this
component would be Rs 19 million, inclusive of a foreign exchange component
of Rs 7.9 million.
The Irrigation Wells
26.       Rabi crop water requirenents (Annex 9) make it necessary to install
a pumping capacity of approximately 2,100 cusecs. A preliminary assessment
of tubewell numbers and sites concluded that their distribution as to size
would be as follows:
No.       Capacity       Operation
(hr/year)
286         2.(      )      4,150
100         2.'      )
350         3.C      )      (48%)
27.       These wells would be at or very near the module and discharge directly
into the watercourse. Water distribution would be in the same manner, and ac-
cording to the same rotation (warabundi) as for surface flows. The exact number
in each size class would therefore depend on the final number of watercourses
in the Unit after remodelling, and on the size distribution of the watercourse
modules. The wells would be used also in the kharif, conjunctively with the
62



ANNEX 4
Page 7
canals, to provide peak crop water requirements that are beyond the capacities
of the canals to deliver.
28.       Tubewell design, as before, would be of the submersible turbine
type, using the same materials and specifications as described for the sweet-
water export wells (para 25). The expected cost of each kind is given in
Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8. This component of the project would cost Rs 124.2
million, with a foreign exchange component of Rs 49.1 million.
Summary of Project Well Costs
29.       The following list summarizes expected expenditure on publicly
operated tubewells, inclusive of channelling the water into the trunk dis-
posal system, but excluding electrification:
Local Costs    Foreign Exchange   Total
Drainage Wells            15.5              36.5            52.0
Fresh-water Export
Wells                   11.1               7.9            19.0
Irrigation Wells          57.3              40.4            97.7
Total               84.9              84.8           168.7
Private Tubewells
30.       In Unit III, the groundwater would be exploited by private enter-
prise, sinking wells to irrigate either individual holdings or the farms and
fields of farmers who jointly install and operate a well. Since surface water
supplies would be augmented through canal remodelling to supply the needs of
the design cropping pattern, it is unlikely that these private wells would be
used to any extent during the kharif. The ones to be installed under the
project, together with the already installed capacity of 2,500 cusecs, would
meet the requirements of the design cropping pattern for the rabi. The new
wells, like the existing ones, are likely to be installed along the field
channels or the main watercourse channel but would serve an area smaller than
a complete watercourse command.
31.       The private wells would be on the surface or in a pit not exceeding
7-8 ft in depth. Screens and casings would be of PVC, coir or brass, depend-
ing on water quality. The pumps would be centrifugal, non-submersible and be
driven either by an electric motor, or more likely, at least initially, by
a diesel engine. Cost estimates are given in Tables 8 to 16. In all cases,
it was assumed that the power unit is commensurate with the load imposed on
it. At present, the engines or motors are grossly oversized, leading to
unwarrantably high capital and, in case of diesel engines, operating costs.
32.       The numbers likely to be installed will depend on the kind and number
of farmers deciding to make the investment and any estimation is likely to be
highly tentative. However, to arrive at an approximate figure, the following
assumptions were made:

/a   Including Rs 10,000 per well connection charge; half local
costs, half F.E.
Operation and Maintenance Costs
33.       Unit II.  The economic price of electricity which would cover the
full operational cost of the supply system is estimated at Rs 0.30 per kWh.
On the basis of the estimated operating factors, and assuming that operating
costs other than fuel amount to Rs 5,000 per year, the annual cost of oper-
ating wells in Unit II amounts to Rs 23.37 M. Spare parts and major over-
hauls are assumed to cost the equivalent of half the pump and motor every ten
years, (Rs 28.31 M total), and complete replacement would be required every
20 years.  Annual annual O&M cost thus amounts to Rs 33.2 M.
34.       Unit III.  Annual operating costs for private wells have been cal-
culated assuming a seven-year Life for the well and a ten-year life for the
engine. The economic cost of diesel fuel is assumed to be Rs 6.50, and
maintenance costs are taken as Rs 1,500 per annum for diesel wells and Rs 750
per annum for electric. At fuLl development, assuming the well size distri-
bution shown in para 32, annua:L O&M costs amount to Rs 8.9 M.
35.       The older, less efficient wells which are expected to pump more
water in rabi - primarily due to earlier closure of the canals - will require
additional O&M expenditures amounting to a maximum of Rs 7.2 M, which would
decline to Rs 2.2 M per annum as these are replaced by newer, more efficient
wells.
36.       Unit V.  Fuel, operal:ing and maintenance costs of the drainage
wells in Unit V are expected to cost Rs 6.67 M per annum. It is expected
that the corrosive operating ernvironment will necessitate major overhauls,
costing Rs 6.02 million every five years and complete replacement will be
required every 20 years.

C. Saline Effluent Disposal
The Problem and Development Alternatives
37.       Saline effluent from the tubewells in Unit V could be discharged
into the irrigation network or into the Indus, or taken completely out of the
system, thereby establishing a net export of salts.
38.       Available information would suggest that for several years effluent
salinities would be considerably in excess of what can safely be put back into
the irrigation system, even under the best conceivable water and soil manage-
ment. Disposal into the river during the rabi would increase the overall
salinity of irrigation water so much that downstream farmers would have a
legitimate complaint. Therefore, the best way of disposal appears to be to
take the effluent altogether out of the irrigated area.
39.       The Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) which would discharge into the
sea and would collect runoff from freak storms and saline effluent from the
whole Indus Left Bank area in the Sind, is at present under construction.
Plans are to extend it, eventually, to the boundary of the project area.
Therefore, the LBOD could eventually be used to convey the saline effluent
into the sea and thereby ensure that more salt leaves the project area than
would enter it.
40.       The LBOD, a very costly project, however, is unlikely to reach the
northern Sind in less than two or three decades, and therefore an interim
method of saline water disposal is required. The best alternative appears to
be the construction of a series of evaporation ponds in the Cholistan Desert,
adjoining the project area. The ponds would be outside areas at present en-
visaged for irrigation, such as the Abbasia Flood Channel area and the pro-
posed extension of the command of the Kandera distributary.
Drain Design and Construction
41.       To avoid excessive seepage and consequent recycling by the drainage
wells, water levels in drains would be kept below ground level wherever pos-
sible. While high-level drains would give command of the evaporation ponds,
such a design would result in considerable seepage and damage to adjoining
agricultural land if the canals were unlined, or, alternatively, it would be
necessary to line on a large scale. In any case, some stretches would have to
be lined, e.g. in sandy soils or where the drains cross depressions and would
therefore have command of the surrounding land, but as the land slopes to the
southeast, such stretches are likely to be short. The drains would empty into
five evaporation ponds by means of low-lift pumping stations. When the LBOD
reaches the project area, the drains would bypass the pumping stations and be
directly connected to it.
65



ANNEX 4
Page 10
The Evaporation Ponds
42.       It is expected that five evaporation ponds will have to be con-
structed. The ponds would be formed by closing the gaps between the sand
dunes with earth fill. The fill would be taken from nearby clay pans to
minimize seepage losses. The ponds would have interconnecting overflow
spillways; the lowermost pond would discharge into the Thar Desert. The
surface area of the ponds was calculated from the amount of drainage effluent
that they would receive and the likely rate of evaporation. Annex 3 shows
the drainable surplus to be about 380,000 ac-ft. Evaporation of fresh water
in the desert near SCARP VI has been recorded to be 100" per annum. It is
estimated that the saturated brine which will eventually fill the ponds would
evaporate at the rate of 80" per annum.  Therefore, the ponds have to be of
minimum surface area of 380,000: 6.67 = 57,000 ac; a safety margin is provided
by seepage from the ponds.
Operation and Maintenance Problems
43.       Drifting Sands.  Examination of aerial photographs taken in 1953
and 1976 show very little wind-induced movement of the dunes. This is
corroborated by the low recorded annual wind velocities. However, small
sand drifts are to be found across infrequently used tracks, and quite vio-
lent, albeit short duration, saaldstorms do occur. Thus, drifting sand
is likely to encroach into draiais (as it does into some irrigation canals
and watercourses) and would have to be cleaned out periodically as part of
the maintenance operation.  Some sand would no doubt blow into the ponds,
but this is not likely to be a serious hazard.
44.       Sediment picked up from the drains would also contribute to the
filling of the ponds, but owing to the flat gradients, minimal amounts are
expected to reach the ponds froti this source.
45.       Salt deposits would crystallize through evaporation.  Some of this
salt will undoubtedly be commercially exploited, as is done with similar
deposits and effervescences elsewhere in the irrigated area. However, the
ponds size given in para 42 would be large enough to accommodate all deposits
for more than 100 years, and the LBOD will reach the project area long before
then.
46.       Aquatic Vegetation will not grow in the ponds after a few years
because of the extremely high salinity of any standing water. However, based
on experience in the nearby SCARP Khairpur project, some of the drain sections,
where the water contains less than 4,000 ppm of dissolved solids, may be
affected by aquatic weeds. Control would be partly by manual labor, partly
by establishing an operating regime that would enable sections of the drains
to dry out completely for a few weeks, which would kill most vegetation and
allow the comparatively cheap removal of the desiccated remains.
66

Design and Costs of the System
47.       The drainage canals.  There would be five main drains leading into
the desert, distributed so that each would have a discharge of 100-110 cusecs.
The total length of drains, including main and branch lines, but excluding
the short channels that would connect individual wells to the system,
would be about 530 miles. The cost, based on current contract rates, is
estimated at Rs 159.6 M, with a foreign exchange component of Rs 20.6 M.
48.       The pumping stations would each consist of four axial flow low
lift pumps of 24" diameter each capable of pumping 38 cusecs through a lift
of 10 feet. This would include one standby pump at each station. Costs
are estimated as follows:
F.E.     Local      Total
------- (Rs '000)- --
20 pumps, CIF                     5,380                  5,380

Total                        6,568        445       7,013
49.       Total cost of the saline effluent disposal system would therefore
be as follows:
F.E.     Local      Total
--__--- (Rs M) -------
Surface drains and ponds            20.6      139.0      159.6

Total                          27.2      139.4      166.6
Additional Investigations Required
50.       While the system layout and design studies carried out to date are
sufficient to estimate costs, detailed survey work will be required to locate
precisely the ponds and the main, subsidiary and branch drains on the ground.
67



ANNEX 4
Page 12
Detailed design of the drains would be done in conjunction with the design of
the drainage well field and would take into consideration the demands made on
it if, after an estimated 10 to 15 years, drainage wells would have to be
installed in the remaining 150.,000 ac of Unit V. The gathering and collating
of all necessary information would be one of the Consultants' major tasks
(Annex 7).
Surface Drainage
51.       It should be noted that the drainage system described is for subsoil
drainage only.  The project area is however subject to occasional surface
flooding from above-normal rainifall, and from the failure of river protection
works. Surface drainage could be accommodated by using small local drainage
systems to collect water which could be pumped into a canal.
Operation and Maintenance Costsi
52.       Pump Replacement Costs.  The pumps are expected to require major
overhaul every five years and complete replacement every 20 years. The five-
yearly replacements are estimated to amount to 12.5% of the capital cost of
the pumps. Hence, replacement costs would be as follows (in Rs '000):
Year 5      -         672
Year 10       -        672
Year 15       -        672
Year 20       -      5,723
Year 25       -        672
Year 30       -        672
53.       Energy Costs.  Overall pump efficiency would be 65%.  With an aver-
age estimated lift of 10 ft the energy required would be as follows:
52 ft  x 62.4 lbs x 10 ft x    1 sec       x 0.746 kw x 365 days x 74
s         ft3            550 ft lb hp           hp       year
- 3,892,446 kWh/year.
The cost of electricity per kWh has been taken as Rs 0.3 per kWh. The cost
of pumping into evaporation ponds will therefore be about Rs 1.2 M/yr.
54.       Other 0 & M Costs are those associated with staffing, transport,
housing and repair facilities, and include routine maintenance of the
drainage system. The estimated costs are tabulated below.

D. Electricity Distribution Network
The Present Situation
56.       The project area is flanked by two large power stations, one in
Multan and another at Gudu with a generating capacity of 260 and 430 MW,
respectively. Both feed into the 132 kV national grid line, which passes
through the area. There is at present insufficient capacity to abstract
power due to the limited distribution network. Network density is greater
north and west of the railway line, in Units II and III, than to the south
and east, in Units IV and V. However, nowhere is extent and capacity of
the distribution network adequate to meet the demands that will be imposed
by the project.
69



ANNEX 4
Page 14
Project Works and Costs
57.       Under the project, additional power consumption would be around
23 MW, the provision of which should present no problem from the national
grid, which is soon to receive substantial additional supplies from the
Tarbela generators. Power lines would have to be provided to Units II and
V for the public tubewells and the effluent pumping stations. No works
demanding electric power are contemplated in Unit IV and it is not proposed
to provide any additional infrastructure in Unit III. Private wells, in that
Unit, if electrified, would be energized under WAPDA's ongoing expansion
program.
58.       Table 16 outlines the works necessary to energize all publicly
operated wells. There is a physical contingency element in the extent of
the 11 KV lines, as the exact location of the wells and the pumping stations,
and consequently, the exact length of the line leading to them, will only
be known after detailed design. However, the bill of quantities and the
costs are unlikely to differ subatantially from the estimates.
59.       The table estimates total project electrification costs to be
Rs 249 M. While the whole of this sum would have to be committed by GOP,
the project is only to be chargeil with 60% of it, the rest being attributable
to rural electrification.
60.       Pakistan has a well developed heavy electrical industry; neverthe-
less some components, essential Eor complete network construction, are not
manufactured locally. However, all raw materials are imported. Consequently,
the foreign exchange component oE electrification costs inclusive of engineer-
ing and construction would be about 30%, free of all duties and taxes.
Project Execution
61.       All materials, with the exception of 11 kV poles, would be procured
by WAPDA through international competitive bidding, in which Pakistani firms
would have a 15% advantage, or one equal to duties and taxes, whichever is
lower. Installation would be contracted through local competitive bidding,
in which foreign-based firms may participate. It would be of utmost importance
to ensure that the electrification works are completed at the same time as the
installation of tubevells and putmping stations. The bill of quantities on
which ICB would be invited would be drawn up with the assistance of the
Consultants and WAPDA's power wing.

64.       The resulting schedule of O&M expenditures, excluding private
tubewell, averages about Rs 70 M/yr after full development (Table 16). The
schedule for tubewell overhaul and replacement includes allowance for the
initial pattern of installation.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Land Leveling and Reclamation
Introduction
1.        Basin irrigation has been traditional in Pakistan since prehistoric
times. The fact that land to le so irrigated has to be leveled, preferably
to a zero slope, is well recogrized. Therefore, individual irrigation units
are regularly leveled as part cf land preparation for all the major crops.
2.        When new land is brought into cultivation, either to increase the
irrigated area, or replace salinized land, a great deal of time and effort is
spent on levelling.
3.        Under project conditions, with increasing water supplies, it will
be possible to bring into cultivation land defined as "culturable waste"
(irrigable land, not cultivated for the last three years or more) as well as
"current fallow" (land cultivated within the last three years). Further, to
increase irrigation efficiencies and to enable farmers to irrigate more land
with their share of river or well water without deliberately underirrigating
and thereby causing salinization, fine leveling must be speeded up.
Physical Land Reclamation
4.        For the last 20 years or more, land potentially commandable by
surface irrigation but not cultivated for a long time, if ever, was being
roughly leveled by bulldozers, to be finished off by the farmers' own efforts
and equipment (para 6). For this purpose, the Agricultural Engineering Divi-
sion maintains a fleet of 30 crawler tractors with bulldozer blades. As
many of them are old, the average number that are operational at any one time
is reported to be around 25. They work for cash, at a subsidized rate.
(Rs 85/hr for the larger tractors and Rs 55/hr for the smaller ones, instead
of a more realistic figure, inclusive of overheads, of around double). There
is only limited borrowing from the banks by the farmers for this purpose. The
waiting list for tractor services is about six months.
5.        It is doubtful whether the most efficient method, even for coarse
leveling, is with bulldozers onLy. In other countries a combination of
bulldozers and scrapers is used, but this has never taken on in Pakistan.
However, as the farmers usually aim to create relatively small irrigation
units (typically one acre fields, divided into four sections) the scrapers,
while more efficient than bulldozers, have a relatively small advantage,
88

further reduced by the experience of using bulldozers. It is planned to
augment the bulldozer fleet from the 400 units shortly to be imported under
bilateral aid. This will reduce considerably the present six-months from
request of services to execution. Further, under the project, credit would
be readily available to pay for tractor hire (Annex 6) and therefore it
is expected that coarse land leveling will proceed at a rate corresponding
to the need to bring fallow land and culturable waste into cultivation in
line with increasing water supplies.
Fine Leveling
6.        Fine leveling of fields already in cultivation, or following
physical reclamation, is traditionally done with ox-drawn scraperboards.
A relatively recent introduction is an ingenious local adaptation of the
multipurpose blade, hitched behind 35-40 hp agricultural tractors, origi-
nally designed for grading. Both methods are used as a routine land prep-
aration measure for wheat, cotton and sugarcane. The land is ploughed and
then the soil moved from spots judged, or remembered from previous cropping,
to be high, into similarly identified low spots. Land leveling for rice is
either done in a similar way or after flooding, using a heavy timber baulk
as a float. If leveling is done on dry land, the accuracy of the work is
not known until the fields are irrigated. Any unevenness then identified is
usually remedied in a subsequent year, because there is neither time, nor
water, to let the land dry, re-level and flood it again prior to planting.
7.        A task increasingly undertaken for greater working efficiency,
usually with agricultural tractors but sometimes also with oxen, is to
enlarge the small irrigation units.
Land Development Under the Project
8.        The benefits of leveling.  Culturable waste cannot be irrigated
unless leveled; additional water would be made available under the project
to expand the cropped area and therefore the development of culturable waste
is essential. Experience in completed projects shows that if the farmers
are assured of water for reclamation and subsequent cropping, they will
readily undertake the task; it was noted that even with slowly increasing
water supplies demand for bulldozer-type leveling is far in excess of
capacity. Therefore, there would appear to be little doubt that even an
augmented bulldozer fleet would be fully committed for several years to
come.
9.        Fine leveling shows less spectacular benefits, but they are
nonetheless readily demonstrable. The following table shows some of the
results obtained by the USAID -sponsored Precision Land Leveling Project
(PLLP) in the Sind, on wheat in the 1975-76 season.

PLLP report that their measurements of water required to irrigate leveled vs.
unleveled fields were incomplete but are satisfied that water savings are
substantial. Their contention of yield increase and water saving is corrob-
orated, as noted, by fine levelLng being part of farming tradition. There-
fore, there is a strong case to speed up the operation and put it on a more
scientific basis. Using the technology developed by PLLP, it is proposed
to supply 40 65-75 hp four-whee.L tractors, with scrapers and chisel plows.
These units would be able to speed up the work of the bulldozers and so com-
plete the leveling process more rapidly. The result would be a reduction in
the time required to reach full production on newly reclaimed land. This
would be particularly important where leaching is required, with or without
the application of gypsum (Annex 2 and para 13). The same units would of
course be available to farmers who have no need for bulldozers and only
require hired equipment for enlarging and/or fine leveling their fields.
10.       In addition to the mechanical equipment, it is proposed to augment
the staff of the agricultural engineer with trained surveyors who would mark
out the fields before work star1s and check the completed job. This would
benefit the farmers in two ways;
(a) before hiring equipmentt or engaging contractors, they
would have a more exact idea of the task involved,
through being advised of the quantities of earth to
be moved and have a definite plan according to which
to move the earth, inntead of eye estimates and recol-
lections of past unevenness;
(b)  on completing the job, the surveyors would check its
accuracy; there would be no need for trial flooding,
and therefore it would be possible to correct mistakes
without delay.
Annex 6 shows the local investment costs in equipment and additional
transport needs for land leveling and reclamation.
11.       Further, it is proposed to provide US$3.8 m as part of the medium-
term agricultural credit component (Annex 6) to enable farmers to borrow
from the commercial banks (CBs) for land leveling. It is expected that
some 100,000 ac of culturable waste and fallow land would be leveled during
the life of the project; costs aLre estimated to be around Rs 1,000 per ac.
90



ANNEX 5
Page 4
The farmer, from his own resources -- or by the use of his own equipment and
labor -- would provide the equivalent of 25% of the cost. Half of the re-
mainder would be provided by the CBs' own resources.
12.       The assumption in deriving the credit requirements was that all
farmers will borrow 75% of the costs of leveling not cultivated lands.
While it is expected that the simpler and streamlined formalities of obtain-
ing credit under the project would encourage more applicants than in the past,
and that their number would be further enhanced when it becomes known that
the waiting time is less than six months, the sum indicated might still not
be fully used for financing the leveling of fallow and culturable waste. It
is expected however that any unutilized balance would be taken up by farmers
wanting to rent the wheel tractors and equipment for fine leveling land already
in cultivation and by others who have soils which would benefit from periodic
deep chisel plowing.
13.       Soil Amendments.  As noted in Annex 2, some 12%-13% of the proj-
ect area, or about 160,000 ac, would require the application of up to five
tons of gypsum to restore the potential productivity of the soil. However,
the benefits would only be temporary if the gypsum were to be incorporated
in the soil before the water table is established at a safe depth and there
is enough irrigation water available to irrigate the reclaimed lands at
least once a year. Consequently, it is expected that significant demands
for gypsum would not arise until the third or fourth year after the begin-
ning of the project. Therefore, the area that would in fact receive it
before the project is completed is unlikely to exceed 40,000 ac. It is esti-
mated that five tons per ac would be required which, with appropriate pro-
cessing, would cost Rs 200 per ton at the sales point. Consequently, the
gypsum to be applied would cost Rs 40 M. As the technique, at least on such
a scale, is new to Pakistan, the supply of gypsum at the sales point would
be a project component. The farmer, however, would be expected to use his
own transport and labor to collect and spread it, according to the technical
advice given by staff of the Bahawalpur soils laboratory (Annex 13).

PAKISTAN
SALINITY CONTROL. AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Agricultural Credit
The Present Situation
1.        Background.  Institutional lending for seasonal inputs and invest-
ments on the farm was, until thIe end of 1972, the responsibility of the
cooperative banks and the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP).
Both were experiencing difficulties due to scarce resources, unsound credit
policy and poor administration. This latter led to poor loan recoveries,
a deteriorating financial position and general slowing down in operations as
preoccupation with these issues developed. Recent GOP action, including the
establishment of a Federal Bank for Cooperatives, has improved the situation
somewhat, and these institutions should provide 50% of lending to the sector
during the 1976-81 plan period (Table 1).
2.        Commercial Bank Involvement in Agricultural Credit.  In parallel
with GOP efforts to improve the operations of the cooperative and ADBP agen-
cies, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) drew up a scheme in November 1972 to
involve commercial banks in short and medium term agricultural credit. Des-
pite the new demands for expertise which this made on the commercial banks,
they have vigorously expanded operations in the sector. Total disbursements
rose from Rs 69 million in 1972/73 to Rs 710 million in 1975/76 - 17% over the
target. Lending data for the five scheduled banks involved (National Bank
of Pakistan (NBP), Habib Bank Ltd (HBL), United Bank Ltd (UBL), Muslim Com-
mercial Bank (MCB) and Allied Bank Limited (ABL) are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
3.        The commercial banks will be used as the credit channel for IDA
funds provided for farm level investments in the tubewells, land levelling
and soil improvement under the present project.
4.        Commercial Bank Activities in the Project Area.  In Rahimyar Khan
District, agricultural credit disbursements for 1975/76 represented about 12%
of loans of all kinds for NBP, MICB and ABL and 46% and 69%, respectively, for
HB and UBL (Table 4).
5.        While about 60% of MCB and ABL agricultural loans are development
oriented, the other banks mostly finance inputs, mainly fertilizers. Among
development loans, borrowing for tubewells (maintenance, replacement, or new
installation) predominates although tractors and bullocks represent a signi-
ficant proportion. Loans for land levelling are negligible. Production loans
(below Rs 2,000) go mainly to small-size farmers while loans for expensive
equipment or machinery (from Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 and above (Table 5)) go
to the big landowners.
92



ANNEX 6
Page 2
6.        Distribution and Staffing of Branches.  The commercial banks have
markedly increased the number of their branch offices in the rural areas. At
present, they have 5,668 branches and offices of which 2,044 are in rural areas,
and 103 in the project area. In addition to its own commercial branches, NBP
has an independent network of 64 Basic Credit Units (BCU) dealing exclusively
with supervised agricultural credits.  These BCUs are mainly grouped around
Lahore (Punjab), and Peshawar (NWFP).  The headquarters of the Agricultural
Project Department, which operates the BCUs, are in Lahore.
7.        As the banks got more deeply involved in lending for agriculture,
they augmented their staff with agricultural graduates, trained specially in
the agricultural credit business. There are 11 such officers in the project
area.
8.        Terms and Conditions of Lending.  The banks pay the supplier of
inputs, the contractor who carried out the works or the dealer who supplied
the equipment. The borrower must contribute from 10% to 25% of the invest-
ment. The amount lent must be less than 80% of the value of the land securing
the loan. This value is determined from the Passbook on the basis of 60 times
the number of produce index units (PIU) published under the authority of the
Land Commission for the province.
9.        Production loans usually have to be repaid at the end of the crop
season; at most, they can be extended for 12 months. Development loans (tube-
well, tractors, land-leveling, on-farm permanent improvements) have to be re-
paid within five years. Such repayments are made through semi-annual or an-
nual installments. The rate of interest is 12% for short- and medium-term
loans, i.e. 3% above the SBP discounting rate (9%). All banks are charging
a 1% to 3% penalty for late repayment.
10.       Loans are secured by two guarantors (up to Rs 2,000) or by mortgage
on land under the passbook system. This was established under the Loans for
Agricultural Purposes Rules 1973. Banks may also take a lien on growing crops
or on equipment financed by the credit granted. For crops and machinery, this
document is a simple agreement signed by the lending bank and the loanee, in
which, inter alia, the borrower binds himself not to dispose of the item
hypothecated without the consent of the bank. For tubewells, the borrower
also binds himself not to transport the pumping equipment elsewhere.
11.       The sanctioning of agricultural loans has been accelerated through
decentralization of responsibility. Most production loans (inputs) up to
Rs 5,000, are within the sanctioning power of local branch managers. Devel-
opment loans, ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 for land leveling and bullocks
and to Rs 25,000 (tubewells) are within the sanctioning power of the local or
Zonal Branch Manager. Loans between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000, Rs 25,000 (MCB)
or Rs 50,000 (UBL) are approved by the Zonal or Regional Branch Manager. The
Karachi Head Office has to approve loans in excess of these amounts. Com-
pletion of the lending procedure seldom exceeds ten days. Loans for tractors,
the procurement of which sometimes requires lengthy formalities, and since the
cost exceeds Rs 50,000, have to be approved by the Bank's Head Office. The
full procedure in some cases requires more than one month.
93



ANNEX 6
Page 3
12.       Evidence of short- or medium-term loans is the Demand Promissory
Note (DPN) signed by the borrower and, where required, by guarantors; the
loan agreement between the bank and the borrower, or if required, the deed
of hypothecation.
13.       Loan Recovery.  The maturity date of loans or installments coincides
with the harvest of kharif and rabi crops financed. A notice is sent or
delivered to the borrower one month before the stipulated expiration date.
In case of default, after due warning the Revenue Department recovers under
powers vested in it by the law on agricultural credit.
14.       The Banks' records are not kept in a manner that enables an easy
determination of the loan recovery rate. In Rahimyar Khan District, it
would, however, appear from commercial branches' statements that the rate
of collection for short-term loans range from 70% (UBL) to 83% (NBP). For
the NBP's supervised Agricultural Credit Program (not yet extended to the
project area), the rate of recovery for production loans as of October 31,
1976 was 98% for loans disbursed up to 1973, between 92% and 94% for loans
disbursed from 1974 to 1975 and 72% for loans disbursed during the winter
(rabi) 1975/76. For medium-term loans, the rate given by NBP Headquarters
was 85%. Losses and bad debts arising out of agricultural lending are 50%
underwritten by SBP. However, the procedures at present set out for such
claims are so involved and time consuming that no bank has yet availed it-
self of this facility.
Financial Position of the Commercial Banks
15.       Table 6 shows that the five nationalized banks are in a satisfactory
financial position. They have substantial liquid assets despite significant
investments in Government securities, trustee securities, and debentures
guaranteed by the Government. PIofits are increasing.
16.       Commercial banks are subject to annual SBP administrative, technical
and financial inspection. In adcLition, their monthly and quarterly returns
are submitted to the Control Division of SBP, and each bank is audited by a
firm of auditors of international, standards.
II. Commercial Banks as IDA Credit Participating Agencies
17.       Operating Procedures.  Each participating CB would have a "SCARP VI
Agricultural Credit" account opened in SBP books. The IDA credit proceeds re-
lated to SCARP VI Agriculture Credit components (tubewells, land-leveling, soil
improvement) would be transferred from the GOP account to the "SCARP VI Project"
account in SBP books and, from this latter account, passed on to the credit
of the participating bank "SCARP VI Agricultural Credit" account as reimburse-
ment of loans pre-financed.
94



ANNEX 6
Page 4
18.      ITstaliments of mediidi- :e;rm loans collected by the bank would be
transfe-red to a "SCARP VI Agrieultltral Credit Revolving Account" opened in
SBP books, and usec for financing new loans along with IDA and bank comple-
mentar-- sh3res as necessary.  The participating banks' share would be 50% of
loans ie'quired, after using the balance of the revolving account. They would
bear the full credit risk. Such significant bank involvement in financing
would be an assurance that applicants' repayment capacity would be carefully
appraised and loan recovery actively pursued.
19.       Interest Rates.  The GOP would charge SBP an interest of 5%, repre-
senting the service charge paid to IDA. The SBP would charge commercial
banks 6%. This corresponds to the average cost of resources of commercial
banks.
20.       Project Agricultural Credit Components.  The project would provide
credit facilities to farmers for: (a) installation of tubewells in fresh
groundwater areas (Unit III); and (b) for land leveling. Credit would be for
medium-term (3-5 years).
21.       The Project Director would administer the project account opened in
SBP books and, with SBP assistance, would keep permanent control of the "SCARP
VI Agricultural Credit" account opened for each participating bank (through
which IDA credit share in medium-term loans would pass). He would also keep
control of "SCARP VI Agricultural Credit Revolving Accounts" to ensure that
this account is adequately used by banks.
22.       All documents justifying the bank's application for IDA disbursement
with or without utilization of the revolving account would be scrutinized by
the Project Director. Accredited representatives of the commercial banks, who
would be members of the Project Coordinating Committee, would assist the Project
Director in credit supervision.
23.       Terms and Conditions of Loans.  The first installment would fall due
at the end of the next rabi season when loans are disbursed during the kharif
period, or the end of the next kharif season when loans are disbursed during
the rabi period.
24.       An interest of 12% per annum would be charged.  A penalty of 2%
would be levied when installments are paid more than two months after the
date on which they are due. No loan would be made to tenants or sharecroppers
except where the landowner guarantees the loan, jointly and separately. In
such particular case, landowner and sharecroppers would also share equally
in the repayment of loan installments.
25.       For tubewells, prospective borrowers would have to justify, through
a certificate from an accredited laboratory, that the water is fit for irri-
gation and that the pumping output meets the irrigation requirements of the
cultivated area and planned cropping intensity. To comply with the latter
criteria, small land owners would be encouraged to form groups covering the
95



ANNEX 6
Page 5
optimum acreage. Group members would be jointly and severally responsible
for the repayment of the loan and a charge would be taken on the land owned
by each. An agreement would be signed by all group participants stipulating:
(a) the joint liability in the loan repayment;
(b) the rules for contributing to operation and maintenance
expenditures;
(c)  on what basis each nember would share in the repayment
of annual loan installments;
(d)  the members' turn aid timing in water use; and
(e)  on what basis and bI whom, the association would be
administered;
(f) in case of liquidation, what would be the members'
share in the outstaading debt.
26.       For land leveling, no down payment would be required from appli-
cants who own less than 12 ac and only 10% from farmers who own 12 to 25 ac.
Loans for land leveling to small farmers (less than 12 ac) would be charged
10% interest per annum instead of 12%. The substantial spread between the
IDA service charge (0.75%) and the interest paid by the ultimate borrower
(12%) would easily absorb the bonus of 2% granted to small farmers. This
would be in accordance with reocommendations of the Bankers Conference (Novem-
ber 1976) that small farmers ihould pay a lower interest than big farmers.
The disbursement of loans wou>d be subject to a certificate from the Agri-
cultural Engineering Departmenit certifying that leveling has been completed
to the specified standard.
27.       Lending Procedure.  Participating banks would continue following
the present lending procedure.. However, the loan application form would be
standardized and would state mhe farm plan and the farm budget before and
after investment. An estimate of equipment or works to be financed would be
attached to the application a3ong with a recommendation from a technical
supporting department. The loan appraisal would focus more on the need for
investment and the applicant's repayment capacity based on the farm plan and
farm budget than on formal securities.
28.       Payment for goods or services would be made directly to the supplier
or the contractor after the branch manager has been given: (a) a detailed
statement showing the final cost of works or equipment and the down-payments
made by the farmer; (b) a rec.ipt signed by the latter and the branch agri-
cultural credit officer certifying that tubewell installation has been com-
pleted satisfactorily; and (c) for land leveling, the document referred to
in para 26.
29.       Payment for works such as well digging, masonry or land leveling
and partial disbursements, when claimed by contractors, would be made
96



ANNEX 6
Page 6
according to the progress of the works and upon recommendation of the branch
field officer who supervises the work. The final disbursement, however, would
require the documents mentioned in para 28 (b) and (c).
30.       Technical Staffing.  There are not enough agricultural credit tech-
nicians to cope adequately with the increase in lending volume expected under
the project. Habib Bank and Muslim Commercial Bank have about one specialist
for five branches; the others have only one in the district and ABL has none
(Table 4). For ABL, the general controller in the Regional Office in Bahawal-
pur supervises the branch managers in the project area when dealing with agri-
cultural credit applications.
31.       Records.  Participating banks would have to keep separate accounts
for loans made under the SCARP VI Project Agricultural Credit. These would
be kept in such a manner that a clear picture could be had at all times of
overdues, interest payments and principal sums recovered.
32.       The banks' charts of account would be reviewed so as to open for
each branch in the project area a medium-term loan account subdivided into
three principal accounts: "Loans not yet due", "Loans overdue", and "Loans
under legal action". Each of these three principal accounts would be sub-
divided into two sub-accounts; "Tubewell" and "Land leveling." These sub-
accounts when related to the principal account "Loans not yet due" would be
subdivided into "Loans 1978" account, "Loans 1979" account, "Loans 1980".
Sub-accounts related to the principal account "Loans overdue" and "Loans under
legal action" would be subdivided into "Installments 1979" account, "Install-
ments 1980" account, etc.
Credit Requirement and Financing
33.       Credits would be provided for financing for up to five years (a)
the procurement and installation of 1,000-1/2 cusec, 1,000 1 cusec and 287
1-1/2 cusec tubewells in the freshwater areas; and (b) the leveling of about
100,000 ac.
34.       The tubewells are estimated to cost Rs 60.4 M.  Land leveling cost
per acre is estimated at Rs 1,000, or a total cost of Rs 100 M. The total
would thus be about Rs 160.4 M plus contingencies.
35.       This component of the project has been estimated at the most pes-
simistic assumption on repayments, i.e. that none of the farmer repayment
installments will be available for relending. On this assumption, the pro-
ject would have to finance Rs 82.5 M. However, it will be readily apparent
to the project auditors from the required records (para 31) how repayments
become available. There would therefore be a clear record whether the lending
rates can be increased or whether funds from the farmer credit category would
be available for reallocation to other project components.

PAKISTAN
SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Consulting Services
General
1.        The WAPDA (NZ), who would be the executing agency for SCARP VI,
would be assisted by a consulting firm (hereinafter referred to as Consul-
tants) in the detailed planning, design and execution of the project.
However, to provide the maximtm amount of training and continuity, the
Consultants would be principally advisors.
2.        The Consultants wou]d advise and supervise the work of WAPDA person-
nel, be it planning, design or field supervision of construction work. The
WAPDA staff may be, and for mzitters connected with the surface irrigation
system preferably should be, cn secondment from the Irrigation Department,
so as to ensure maximum contirnuity after WAPDA withdraws from the project.
3.   Consultant services woulcl, in addition, be provided to support prepara-
tion of high priority projects identified under the Indus Basin Planning
project. The objectives of the Planning Project include identification,
in the form of a Revised Action Plan of high priority projects for early
implementation. Such projects are in various stages of preparation, and
most need further work to fintlize preliminary designs so that appraisal
can take place, and for revisions in design to incorporate necessary changes
identified during the planning exercise.
Services Required
4.        For the detailed design of SCARP VI, it is expected that the total
cumulative time for which expertise and skills not available within Government
services would be required is a total of about 310 man-months. This would be
divided as follows:
(a) Civil Engineer/Team Leader:
He would have overall responsibility for the working
of the group. He should have extensive experience
in irrigation and drainage works construction, and
in managing and executing large projects. He would
be required for 72 vronths.
104



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(b) Irrigation Engineer:
He would be responsible for the design of the remodelled
canal system and the design and construction of the new
watercourses. The selection, design and implementation
of works in the pilot areas for matters other than land
leveling would be his responsibility. His services would
be required for 60 months.
(c) Geohydrologist/Groundwater Engineer:
His first task would be to set up a groundwater model
(in which he would be assisted by a Computer Programmer,
see below) to test the characteristics of the aquifer
against past records and predict its behavior under proj-
ect conditions. He would identify and develop the neces-
sary inputs for the Tyson-Weber polygonal model, and
establish whether and when, under full implementation
water regime, and drainage works would have to be extended
to the remaining 250,000 ac of Unit IV and V.  He would
advise on the design and layout of the tubewell field
and the details of the wells under the different
conditions. His services would be required for 48 months.
(d) Drainage Engineer:
He would assist with the design of the saline effluent
disposal system, the pumping stations and the evaporation
ponds. His first tasks would be to oversee the surveys
necessary and to accurately locate them. It is expected
that his service would be required for 24 months.
(e) Economist/Agricultural Economist:
He would set up studies to ascertain the present status
of the business of representative sample farmers and
continue to monitor and update their progress as the
project advances. He would maintain contact with all
sections of the Department of Agriculture who are in-
volved in the implementation of the project. He would
assist in the training of the staff of the CBs in
appraising loans to farmers for tubewells, leveling and
gypsum. He would assist CMO to organize annual and sea-
sonal data collection to enable project benefit monitor-
ing to be done effectively. His services would be
required for 24 months.
105



ANNEX 7
Page 3
(f) Agriculturist:
He would work with the extension and research services
to develop suitable cropping patterns applicable under
project conditions and also to determine the cultural
pratices, including selection of varieties, fertilizer
and pesticide application, desirable degree and kind of
farm mechanization that would optimize production and
farm profits. His servLces would be required for a
total of 24 months divided into two or three periods,
during which changes in soil and water relations would
become manifest and enable him to adjust his recommen-
dations accordingly.
5.        In addition to the discLplines mentioned above, all of which would
be required either continuously or in two or three relatively long periods,
there would be a need for short-term visits to keep a watching brief, and
provide guidance, for other disciplines. Foreseeably, such would be the
services of a soil scientist and alkali reclamation specialist, hydrologist,
electrical engineer specializing Ln transmission lines, switchgear and trans-
formers, and a computer programmer. It is estimated that for these disciplines
an aggregate of 24 man-months be required. There should be a contingency
allocation for a further 24 man-months, making a total consultant time of
310 man-months.
Consultants' Work Program for SCAILP VI Detailed Design
6.        The Consultant would inn.tially work within WAPDA's Project Planning
Directorate in Lahore. The engineers who will eventually be assigned to the
Project Director, SCARP VI for overseeing project construction would also work
with the Project Planning Directorate and transfer to the field before actual
work starts. The Consultants would similarly transfer their operation to the
project area as the design work is completed.  About 1-1/2 years after arrival
practically all the work would be on site.
7.        The preparation of Operation Manuals for each of the project com-
ponents would be a major part of the Consultants' work.
Consultant Allocation for Preparation of Subsequent
High Priority Projects
8.        The final list of projects to be prepared for early implementation
will depend on the recommendations of the UNDP Revised Action Program, ex-
pected in late 1978.

Costs
9.        It is expected that the consulting firm for detailed design of
SCARP VI would be internationally recruited. Therefore, inclusive of company
overheads and supervision, it is expected that costs would be about US$7,000
per man-month at present prices. Air travel, local housing and mobilization
costs are extra. The budget is expected to be as follows:
US$ '000

Total                                         2,982
10.       To enable final preparation of high priority projects, expendi-
tures of up to US$2 M would be financed by IDA to support necessary con-
sultant activities.

Water Demand, Supply and Quality
Water Demand
1.        Crop water requirements of the design cropping pattern have been
calculated using the modified Penman approach. U.S. Weather Bureau Class A
pan evaporation figures were extrapolated from nearby weather stations and
half-monthly crop factors were developed from the appropriate curves. The
requirements were calculated inclusive of water requirements for land pre-
paration and, where appropriate, due allowance was made for soil moisture
depletion. Table 1 shows the spread of planting times and the K-curves used;
Table 2 gives the K-curves, Table 3 (16 pages) the crop water requirements. 1/
Table 4 is a summary of Table 3; Table 5 shows the cropping patterns adopted
for the development units; Table 6, 7, 8 and 9 water requirements for the
separate units and Table 10 the total project water requirements. Crop
water requirements are calculated in milimeters and the totals are expressed
in million cubic meters. It will be noted that no allowance was made for
rainfall, which is very low on the average (Annex 1) and also there may
be several consecutive years without rain.
2.        All figures in the foregoing tables refer to consumptive use
requirements, without any allowance for conveyance or percolation losses.
These have been determined as follows (Annex 3):
Watercourse channel losses: 10% of deliveries at module.
Infiltration losses in the field: 20% of deliveries at module.
3.        To arrive at requirements at the barrage, it was assumed that
losses between barrage and watercourse head amount to 35% (Annex 3). There-
fore, water use efficiency between barrage diversion and consumptive use is
45.5%. Table 11 shows water requirements per planning unit, at watercourse
head and also at diversion; for easier comparison with published data, they
are converted to acre-feet.
4.        Requirements shown at the barrage in Table 11 take into account
the pumpage of fresh water in Units II and III. Unit III pumpage is con-
fined to the rabi and is assumed to cover the needs of the crops. In
Unit II however, 135 wells of three cusec capacity and 70% annual utiliza-
tion are assumed to be pumping about 17,000 ac-ft per month, for export
to Unit V.
1/   The crop calendars after which Table 3 was drawn up are shown in
Annex 15.                                                              109



ANNEX 9
Page 2
5.        Diversions necessary for the kharif requirements of Unit II are
partly met in months of peak demand by using the irrigation wells in that
unit (Annex 3) to supplement surface supplies. Through an iterative process
of calculation, it was found that the combined monthly flow rate of the wells,
as shown in Table 12, would maintain the water balance in Unit II in the kharif
by deducting pumpage by the irrigation wells from requirements at the module
and allowing, as before, a 65% delivery efficiency for the balance between
barrage and module.  There are no diversion requirements in the rabi, since
in Unit II all water would comne from the irrigation wells within the unit.
6.        In Unit V, diversion requirements were calculated based on require-
ments at the module, less that portion of the 17,000 ac-ft monthly export
pumpage from Unit II arriving at the modules, which is assumed to be 75% of
the pumpage or say 12,800 ac-ft per month. The final column of Table 11
shows the half-monthly requirements, in acre-feet, at the barrage.
Water Supply
7.        Table 13 shows montiLy availabilities at the Panjnad Barrage, com-
pares them with surface water demand as shown by monthly diversion require-
ments and shows monthly and total deficiencies. Availabilities at the
barrage are the mean historic post--IBP flows.
8.        Supplies available Erom pumpage of groundwater, and suitable for
irrigation, are shown in detail in Annex 3, as are recharge and groundwater
balance calculations. In Unit II, in addition of the kharif supplies used
to supplement surface flows, and the year-round supplies provided for use
elsewhere by the drainage wel.Ls, the irrigation wells are designed to meet
full water requirements at the module for the rabi. In Unit III the same
assumption is made, although actual pumpage may be slightly lower than shown,
since, unlike in Unit II, the privately owned tubewells are likely to be
nearer the fields they are expected to serve and therefore actual conveyance
losses -- and possibly even f:Leld losses, due to more efficient control and
utilization -- may well be lower.
Water Quality
9.        The quality of river water has been studied over many years and
found to be very high (Table L4). No risk of damage to the soil exists,
given minimum standards of irrigation techniques and at least one heavy irri-
gation each year.
10.       Groundwater quality in the project area has also been extensively
studied, and it has been concluded that, as a general rule, wells in Unit II
and III are likely to yield waiter suitable for irrigation. Table 15 gives
the analysis from a total of 1,129 wells and concludes that, according to
the criteria explained in Annex 2, and in view of the fact that excellent
110



ANNEX 9
Page 3
river water is available in the kharif with which to leach any accumulation of
salts almost every year, at least 95% of the wells yield water suitable for
irrigation without mixing.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RFC  M^ATT)N PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Organization and Management
General
1.        The proposed organization chart at the project level is shown in
Figure 1. The officer in charg. would be the Project Director, who would be
of Chief Engineer rank. He would control five technical sections, each headed
by an officer of Superintending Engineer rank or equivalent. The sections,
and their subdivisions, would b] as follows:
(a)  Irrigation:  with sub3ections in charge of canal remodel-
ing and new watercourse design, the siting and design of
tubewells in Unit II; design of tubewells in Unit V, de-
sign and advice to farmers on private wells in Unit III.
(b)  Drainage:  with subse:tions in charge of siting of saline
drainage wells and ap urtenant works to connect them with
the trunk drainage sy ;tem; design and construction super-
vision of the evapora-ion ponds and pumping stations;
(c)  Electrification:  witl subsections for the power lines;
and substations and connections of all public wells and
pumping stations. Tho section would also assist with
electrification of groups of private wells in Unit III.
(d) Mechanical: concerne&i with maintenance and all repair
work of public well equipment and the pumping stations;
the maintenance of al: project vehicles and to ensure
proper inventory control and ordering of spare parts.
(e)  Agriculture and Monit(ring would be headed by an agri-
cultural economist wilh subsections to provide WAPDA's
Central Monitoring Orianization with data to report on
progress. He and his staff would maintain liaison with
agricultural extensioiT and research, and the agricultural
engineering service oT' progress with land leveling,
applications for and :nstallation of private wells and
progress on advising larmers how to exploit project
benefits; with the paiticipating CBs on how loan appli-
cations for wells are encouraged, processed and the work
executed.
146



ANNEX 12
Page 2
The electrification subdivision would report to the Superintending Engineer,
Power Wing, WAPDA, based in Rahimyar Khan but would be expected to maintain
close liaison with the Project Director on the phasing and progress of his
work.
The Implementation Period
2.        During project implementation, the PD and all his staff would be
WAPDA officials, even though, for the sake of continuity, it would be bene-
ficial if many could be seconded from GOPunjab line departments and continue
in their post after GOPunjab takes over the project. The PD, a substantive
Chief Engineer, would report to the General Manager, Northern Zone, and would
also have frequent technical contacts with the Project Director (Planning).
The Post-Implementation Period
3.        After project completion and at least one year's successful opera-
tion, the operation of the project, in accordance with accepted GOP procedures,
would be handed over to GOPunjab's Irrigation Department. The PD would then
be an Additional Chief Engineer, reporting to the Secretary for Irrigation
GOPunjab through the Chief Engineer, Bahawalpur Irrigation Circle. The Agri-
cultural Officer would be seconded from the Department of Agriculture. Matters
pertaining to the supply and distribution of electric power to project units
would become the routine duty of WAPDA's organization based in Rahimyar Khan
(Figure 2).
The Project Committees
4.        There would be two coordinating committees:  a Project Coordination
Committee in Rahimyar Khan, and a Project Steering Committee in Lahore.
(a) The Project Coordination Committee would be headed by
the Deputy Commissioner of the district and the PD
would be its executive officer. Members would be the
Chief Engineer, Irrigation, the Director of Agriculture,
and the district Superintending Engineer for WAPDA's
power wing. The farming community would be represented
by one or two leading farmers from each of the project
units. The Unit III representative would be selected
from tubewell owners.
The CBs, participating in the credit scheme for wells, land leveling and
reclamation, would also be represented. The committee would have powers to
co-opt anybody who they consider would help their deliberations. They would
meet, during project implementation, at least six times a year, to be advised
of progress and to be able to offer advice on overcoming problems other than
technical in nature. After the project is completed, fewer meetings may
suffice.
147



ANNEX 12
Page 3
(b)  The Project Steering Committee would be chaired by the
Additional Chief Secretary, Planning and Development.
Members would be the Secretary for Agriculture, Secretary
for Irrigation and the Divisional Commissioner for Bahawalpur
Division. GOP would be represented by WAPDA's GM (NZ) and
the GM Power Wing. The CBs would be represented by one
or more of the General Managers of the participating
commercial banks. All rmembers may be accompanied by
their field officers and the Committee as such may co-
opt additional members.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Agricultural Supporting Services
A. Extension
I.   The Present Situation
Organization
1.        The agricultural extension service is built up according to adminis-
trative boundaries, the same as other departments. One Field Assistant (FA)
is posted to each Union Council, - the smallest administrative unit of the
1960s, now existing mainly as units of internal security and agricultural de-
velopment. There are 84 Union Councils in the canal irrigated parts of
Rahimyar Khan district.
2.        The Union Councils are grouped into four tehsils, with 18 to 24
Union Councils in each. At each tehsil headquarters there are four Agricul-
tural Officers (AO) who report to the Extra Assistant Director of Agriculture
(EADA) stationed in Rahimyar Khan.
3.        The EADA is assisted by technical and administrative staff officers.
His Assistant Plant Protection Officer (APPO) acts as a Subject Matter
Specialist, is actively involved in training programs for the AOs and FAs and
controls, through them, 147 special skilled laborers (beldars) attached to
the FAs. The beldars administer the pesticide stores, do minor repair and
maintenance work on the sprayers, demonstrate the use of equipment and pesti-
cides and supervise spraying operations by the farmers. There is an AO
(Technical) who is an agronomist and supports the tehsil AOs on all agronomic
matters relating to the more common crops.
4.        The Assistant Statistical Officer (ASO) is responsible for compil-
ing, bi-annually, the crop and other statistics for the district. Aided by
four statistical investigators in the tehsils and 19 reporting FAs, he
collects crop information three times a season, and other data, like the
number of tubewells and tractors and implements annually. Crop information
is recorded in statistically selected sample villages.
5.        The EADA also administers a Cotton Maximization Scheme, under
which a fifth AO is posted to each tehsil. The job descriptions for
special cotton staff and the regular extension staff are the same. They
are placed so as to enable the geographic area of each staff member to be
made smaller, thereby aiming at increasing their effectiveness.
151



ANNEX 13
Page 2
6.        The Agricultural EngLneering Unit is a service organization provid-
ing facilities and equipment for coarse land leveling with bulldozers (Annex
5), and for drilling tubewells. It administers the tubewell subsidy scheme
in consultation with the Deputy Commissioner, the District and the Tehsil
Councils.  Staff consists of bulldozer drivers and mechanics, supervisory
staff for the land leveling work and supervisors who train workers operating
the tubewell drilling rigs (foc which labor is provided by the farmers).
The organization sells well casings and, occasionally, engines.
7.        Market Control.  The main markets are managed by an Assistant
Director (Economics and Marketing). His staff record movement of goods
through the markets and publisi every week the prices of the major traded
commodities.
8.        The EADA reports to a Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) in
Bahawalpur, who is in charge of the entire division. The Agricultural Engi-
neer reports to a Deputy Director of Agricultural Engineering, the Assistant
Director (Economics and Marketing) to a DDA (Economics and Marketing) both
in Bahawalpur. The Deputy Directors report to their respective Directors of
Agriculture (DA) (Extension) and DA (Economics and Marketing) based in Lahore,
and the Director of Agricultural Engineering in Lyallpur. This latter also
directs the Precision Land Leveling Project (PLLP) (Annex 5).
9.        The three Directors and two others, in charge of disciplines not
affecting the project area, report to the Director-General (DG) of Agriculture
in Lahore who is the technical and administrative head of all agricultural
activities except research (Figure 1).
10.       The Integrated Rural Development Project (IRDP) was started in 1972.
Its basic concept is to post technicians of several disciplines into marakhaz
(the plural of markhaz, a rural development unit) where, under the guidance of
the markhaz office they would concentrate on such tasks that are an agreed
priority, at any given time. The markhaz area is usually about half a tehsil
and corresponds to the boundaries of the Union Councils it includes. The
project is headed by a Director, based in Lahore. In Rahimyar Khan district,
only one Union Council is invclved. They have their own agricultural exten-
sion staff. A graduate carries out the functions of the FA. However, other
activities prevent full-time effort on agricultural extension. As for his
opposite numbers in the regular extension service, his principal contact with
farmers is through some appropriate ramification of plant protection: either
supervising spraying or arranging for it to be done. The regular Extension
Service also maintain their normal establishment in the area.
Working Conditions and Methods
11.       The FAs are expectecL to reside in the villages within the Union
Council of their posting. No Government quarters are provided, and no
housing allowance is payable. Rented accommodation is not easily available
152



ANNEX 13
Page 3
in the villages and therefore most of the FAs reside, rent free, in quarters
provided by the large landlords of the area. This tends to limit their
field of activities as the landlords who house them expect to have first call
on their services. Similar arrangements are made for the beldars and some
of the AOs,
12.       Transport facilities are inadequate.  The FAs are given a traveling
and a daily allowance which is meant to cover the upkeep of bicycles and out-
of-pocket expenses. AOs share 4 WD vehicles which are approaching the end of
their useful life and are in short supply. The EADA's office is also short of
transport. Staff are therefore forced to travel by public conveyance or hired
horse-drawn traps.
13.       The extension staff's main effort is plant protection.  Records
show that during the kharif two-thirds, and during the rabi one-third of the
FAs -- and, at all times, all of the beldars -- time is spent either in iden-
tifying pest problems, actually spraying or being present in the field where
spraying is taking place. The Department's guidelines do not readily allow
the use of their sprayers, and the pesticides they sell, without close con-
trol aimed to avoid accidental poisoning. Thus, time not actually spent on
spraying tends to be spent in awaiting requests, and therefore other extension
activities receive even less attention from the FAs than their time alloca-
tion would suggest. Consequently, farmer contacts for purposes other than
plant protection are mainly with the AOs who consequently have some 60-70,000
ac, comprising over 5,000 farms, to service: a virtually impossible task even
if transport were unrestricted.
Staff Training
14.       The AO's, from whose ranks EADAs and above are eventually selected,
are trained in Agricultural Universities, the oldest of which is in Lyallpur
in the central Punjab. There is a FA training establishment in Rahimyar
Khan designed to meet the needs of the southern Punjab. It runs a two-year
course; entry qualifications are "matriculate" standard, attainable after
a total of 12 years' schooling.
15.       In-service training courses are run twice a year, before each of
the main crop seasons. They are run separately for Divisional, District
and Tehsil staff. The divisional seminars are conducted by staff from the
Punjab Agricultural Research Station and the Agricultural University of
Lyallpur. The district-level training is done by divisional staff with
some outside assistance; tehsil-level training is conducted by district
and divisional staff only. Leading farmers are invited to participate in
district and tehsil training courses.
153



ANNEX 13
Page 4
Present Plans to Strengthen the Service
16.       Plans ready for implementation consist of the following measures:
-    double the number of FAs. to have two in each Union Council;
-    put an EADA in charge of the tehsils and a DDA in charge of
the district;
-    post a DA (Extension) to Multan, to take charge of Bahawalpur
and Multan Divisions (instead of one DA for the whole Punjab);
-    provide loans for the AOs to purchase motorcycles and make
budgetary provisions to Enable the payment of an equitable
allowance for their use;
With extra FAs, the FA-farmer ratio would be about 1:1,200.
17.       Notable deficiencies of the plan are:
-    no provision for rural housing, either for construction or
the payment of a housing allowance to meet the cost of rented
accommodation;
-    no provision of specialist staff at tehsil level and the
introduction of other disciplines, especially water manage-
ment;
-    no change of working methods, either to designate staff
solely for plant protection operations or to develop a
closer management system 'hat would enable better train-
ing of farmers in the use of pesticides.
II.  Agricultural Extension Under the Project
18.       While a strengthened and closely controlled and supervised agricul-
tural extension service is a vital prerequisite to attaining full production
potential from the project works, it:s establishment and support is not a
project component. A province-wide extension and research project is sched-
uled for appraisal by IDA in 1977 which would include Rahimyar Khan district.
B. Research
Agricultural Research Institutes
19.       Agricultural Research in the Punjab is controlled by a Director-
General for Agriculture (Research). The Directors of the major institutes
report to him. Of these, the Punjab Agricultural Research Institute (PARI)
154



ANNEX 13
Page 5
does most of the work relevant to the project area. The basic investigations
on wheat, sugarcane, pulses, and for the time being also oilseeds, is centered
there. Maize, sorghum and pearl millet research is done in Yusufwala, in
Sahiwal district. A specialist station dealing with oil crops is shortly to
take over the Khanpur research station, in the project area. Adaptive research
(investigations into the local suitability of the crop varieties released by
PARI) is done in Bahawalpur, which does a certain amount of varietal selection
work of its own. More adaptive research is needed on problems specific to the
project area, such as the overlap in the wheat/cotton seasons (Annex 14,
para 13).
20.       The Bahawalpur station has sections for cereals, cotton, tobacco
and sugarcane; for plant pathology, and enthomology; and for horticulture,
dealing mainly with mangoes and citrus, the region's principal fruit crops.
The achievements, recent past and imminent future varietal releases are
discussed under the separate crops (Annex 14). A soils chemistry section
conducts fertility trials on the station and in farmers' fields. They have
an analytical laboratory that undertakes the testing of farmers' soil samples
and advises on fertilizer rates.
21.       A notable advance will be the launching of the oil crops research
station. In the past, trials have been conducted in Rahimyar Khan district
on sunflowers which were agronomically promising, but the project was sus-
pended before marketing and processing problems could be overcome. It would
appear that not only the traditional Brassica oilseeds, but also sunflowers,
safflower and groundnuts could become important crops in the area, alleviat-
ing the country's vegetable oil shortage and better utilizing land and water
under project conditions.
C. Credit
The Present Situation
22.       Prior to 1973, short, medium and long-term institutional agricul-
tural credits were the sole responsibility of the cooperative banks and,
mostly the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP). Inadequate
organization, scarce resources, and questionable lending policies have caused
ADBP to concentrate on arrears recovery and not on expanding lending.   Steps
to remedy these weaknesses are under way. Since 1973, the five nationalized
commercial banks (CBs) i.e. National Bank of Pakistan Ltd. (NBP), Habib Bank
Ltd. (HBL), United Bank Ltd. (UBL), Muslim Commercial Bank Ltd., (MCB) and
Allied Bank Ltd. (ABL) have been actively engaged in agricultural finance
(about 50% of all institutional credit) under the agricultural small loans
scheme drawn up by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
155



ANNEX 13
Page 6
23.       The CBs have 103 branches in the Project area.  They report, through
their zonal or principal office in Rahimyar Khan or Bahawalpur, to their Head
Office in Karachi where a special department deals with agricultural lending
policy and statistics.  Bank branches are sufficiently staffed for commercial
lending business, but for agricuLtural credit operations they do not have
sufficient staff.
24.       The CBs now provide short-term facilities for purchasing production
inputs, particularly fertilizers and medium-term loans (three to five years)
primarily for tractors, tubewell3, bullocks and, in a small way only, for land
leveling. The rate of interest for all loans is 12% p.a. Lending concepts
and procedures are satisfactory, and the rate of recovery acceptable. The
banks are controlled by SBP and aiudited by firms operating to international
standards.
II. Development Under the Project
25.       Under the project, banks would make medium-term loans for installa-
tion of private tubewells, land leveling and procurement of gypsum for land
reclamation. Technical departmer,t and laboratories would assist bank branches
in the evaluation of loan applications (Annex 6). The CBs would be expected
to strengthen their technical staff to cope efficiently with the expanding
credit activity. HBL and MCB branches already have, respectively, six and
three trained agricultural credit. officers (ACO); the others have none or one
only. The requirement would be at least one ACO for each of the four (tehsils)
of the district.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Draft Terms of Reference for Study of
Agricultural Pricing and Water Charges
Introduction
1.        The study will be the responsiblity of the Government of
Pakistan and will be carried out by a Government study group with the
assistance of consultants, under the general guidance of a Coordinating
Committee headed by the Secretary, Federal Planning Division. The Committee
will include the Federal Secretaries of Finance, Agriculture, and Water
and Power; the Additional Chief Secretaries, Planning and Development, of
the four provinces; and a representative of the Master Planning Division,
WAPDA.
2.        The study will comprise two parts; (i) a study of water charges;
and (ii) a study of the general level and structure of agricultural pricing
and taxation, including water charges. A draft of Part I of the Study (water
charges) will be completed by June 1978, and a draft of the whole Study by
December 1978. Background notes for the study are attached.
Part I of Study
3.        The purpose of Part I of the study will be to make recommendations
on the appropriate level, structure and design of water charges, taking into
account the current and capital cost of providing water to the farmers, the
effect of water charges on farmer incentives, the encouragement of efficient
water use, income distribution and general revenue considerations.
4.        In reaching its recommendations, the study should review:
(1) The current systems of #ater charges, their history and
objectives;
(2)  The role and contribution of water charges to the provincial
and federal budgets in relation to: (a) the level and
adequacy of expenditure3 on O&M of irrigation and drainage
works; (b) expenditures on capital investments in irrigation
and drainage development; (c) other expenditures and subsi-
dies to the agriculturaL sector; and (d) other taxes on
agriculture;
(3)  The effectiveness of waLer charges in encouraging the         158
efficient use of water by the farmer;



ANNEX 14
Page 2
(4) The effect of water charges on the incentives to farmers
to increase crop production;
(5) The income distribution impact of water charges as they
affect farmers with different size holdings and in dif-
ferent positions on the watercourse, and under different
tenurial arrangements.
5.        Taking into account 1-5 above, the study will evaluate:
(a) the economic functions of water rates as: (i) an allocative
device in ensuring efficient water use and optimal cropping
patterns, (ii) a benefit tax on the increased income/land
values of farmers receiving water, and (iii) a source of
revenue;
(b) alternative systems (including relative collection costs)
of imposing water charges which will fulfill the functions
listed in (a) above;
(c) appropriate principles for determining water charges,
including the desirabiity and feasibility of differentials
between crops, seasons, SCARP and non-SCARP areas, farm
size, farm locations, water delivery costs, etc; and
(d) appropriate methods of linking water charges (or their
proposed replacement) to inflation and, as necessary,
to the increased budgetary expenditures resulting from
new projects, including the interval at which such ad-
justments should be made.
Part II of the Study
6.        The purpose of Part II of the Study will be to recommend an optimal
level and structure of agricultural pricing and taxation, including water
charges, consistent with the Government's revenue needs, adequate incentives
to farmers, efficiency in resource allocation, and equity and progressivity
in the system. The study should indicate the relative role of different
instruments, including water charges, in achieving these various objectives.
The findings and recommendations of Part I of the study should be taken
into account in framing recommendations under Part II.
7.        The study should review:

(2) The impact of existing taxation and pricing policies in
relation to:
(M)  the structure of input and output prices facing
farmers and returns from agriculture;
(ii) allocation of resources between crops within the
agriculture sector and between agriculture and
other sectors;

(iv) the incidence of existing taxes and pricing on
agriculture, their equity and progressivity and
effects on income dlstribution.
(3)  Alternative revenue and expenditure tools to attain given
objectives (e.g., removing subsidies on inputs and controls
on output prices to enable domestic prices to reflect world
prices more closely in order to improve resource allocation,
taking into account dometstic production costs, desirable
income levels and con8uwers' purchasing power; ways of
making the agricultural income tax more progressive by
linking it to size of holdings/productivity of land; the
appropriate relationships between alternative instruments,
in particular the extent to which water charges can
supplement other taxes, etc.).
8.        In light of items 1-3 above, the study should evaluate:
(i)  the optimal level and structure of overall agricultural
pricing and taxation that is desirable taking into
account the need for raising Government revenues,
equitable income distribution, maintaining incentives
to farmers and improved resource allocation, and
(ii) the reliance which should be placed on alternative pric-
ing and taxation instruments, including the role of
water charges in suth a package, taking into account
changes in input and output prices and taxes resulting
from a revised structure of taxation.

BACKGROUND NOTES
Part I of Study
9.        Water charges in Pakistan are imposed under the Canal and Drainage
Act of 1873, as amended. They are assessed and collected by the Provincial
Irrigation Departments and form a direct means of charging the beneficiaries
of the irrigation and drainage works for services and facilities provided by
the Federal and Provincial Governments. The revenue raised accrues directly
to the Provincial Governments, and is an important component (about 30%) of
direct tax revenue to the provinces.
10.       The Canal and Drainage Act is an authorization to collect water
charges, but the system of collection and level of charges is a Provincial
matter and is not uniform throughout the country.
11.       Water charges have two distinct functions:
(i) as a source of direct general revenue to the Government
to support its expenditures on the services it provides
in both the agricultural and other sectors; and
(ii) as an allocative device to ensure that the services pro-
vided are efficiently utilized.
12.       These factors are embodied in existing legislation which refers
to the right of the Government to recover the costs of services provided,
to differentiate between charges on various crops on the basis of their
value and the amount of water needed to grow them and to tax the actual
or potential rent accruing to landowners and farmers due to the higher
value of irrigated land.
13.       Water charges in Punjab are currently levied on the basis of area
cropped and crops grown. Per acre water charge rates vary between crops from
Rs 6.40 for fodder to Rs 33.60 for orchards. Except under special circum-
stances, water deliveries are fixed on the basis of area: thus (legal) pay-
ments do not affect the volume of water delivered, although those receiving
more water will, if their cropping intensity is higher, pay more.
14.       In Sind, water charges are combined with other land taxes, and
are related to the assessed productivity of the land. Again, no link exists
between price and quantity.
15.       Water charges on assessed land values and crop areas as a direct
source of revenue are at present significant from the Provincial point of
view (constituting about 30% of direct revenues) but relatively unimportant
on a national scale. Provincial recoveries, however, are less than expen-
ditures on operating and maintaining the system--and these expenditures
161



ANNEX 14
Page 5
are already inadequate--and thus col.tribute nothing to the substantial
past and ongoing capital expenditures on infrastructure. In addition,
the severe budgetary pressures facing Pakistan require rapid and sub-
stantial mobilization of resources.
16.       Water charges as an allocative device appear at present to
be completely ineffective. The quantity of water received is not depen-
dent on the (legal) payments made, and thus the price at the margin is
zero. The marginal value, on the other hand, is often very high. The
apparent wastage and inefficient management of water appears in part to
stem from inadequate farmer-knowledge of the relevant techniques. If
water charges are to be effective as an allocative device, they would
apparently require: (a) very substEntial increases to bring them to a
level at which farmers are aware of the cost of using water; (b) improve-
ments in delivery of water to make it demand oriented and to ensure
reliable and timely delivery of water, and (c) educating farmers in the
techniques of good water management. In the longer run, such changes
would have profoundly beneficial effects.
17.       As a tax on beneficiaries, water charges are at present low.
While the value of water at critical periods may exceed Rs 200/ac-ft,
the average cost to the farmer is less than 10% of this. While average
and marginal costs are not strictly comparable, it is clear that the
benefits of irrigation are substantially in excess of the price paid
by the farmers.  The value of these benefits might be measured by the
relative values of irrigated and unirrigated land.
Part II of Study
18.       The level and structure of water charges in Pakistan cannot be
determined independently of agricultural pricing policy and other taxes and
levies on agriculture. There are several such taxes and levies in existence
at present, e.g., export duties, excise duties, an agricultural income tax,
as well as indirect taxing of agriculture through Government monopoly trad-
ing, lower than world-market prices for agricultural products, etc.
19.       In determining an appropriate level and structure of agricultural
pricing and taxation, general economic and social considerations must be
taken into account. There is a pressing need in Pakistan to raise additional
domestic resources for financing development programs in agriculture and
other sectors. At the same time, in devising means of raising additional
revenues, due regard must be given to equiity and progressivity of the system
to bring about a better distribution of income as well as the provision of
adequate incentives to farmers. The level of taxation of agriculture in
relation to other sectors of the economy and its effects on incentives and
resource allocation within the agricuilture sector and between sectors must
be considered. The existence of a complex system of agricultural taxes,
input subsidies, Government monopoly trading and price-setting arrangements
complicates such an evaluation.

20.       A recent World Bank study indicates that subsidies to farmers
are equal to about one fourth of the taxes paid by them, and that in addition
much "taxation" takes place via price distortions (lower than world market
prices), resulting in adverse terms of trade to agriculture vis-a-vis manu-
facturing. Whether such taxes and price distortions place too heavy a burden
on agriculture, whether more incentives in favor of agriculture are desirable,
and what changes are required in the mix of existing levies on agriculture,
needs to be explored.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Present and Future C:opping Patterns and Production
Present Production
1.        The present and future cropping patterns are shown in Table 1;
crop areas, yields and production iTi Tables 2 and 3. The ratio of kharif to
rabi crops at present is as follows:
Units             II          III             IV          V
Seascnal                   Perennial
canal waters
Kharif/rabi  1.2 to 1      1.3 to 1       1 to 1.15    1 to 1.18
Thus, at present there is a slight edge of kharif over rabi crops in the
seasonally canal irrigated areas and the reverse in the perennial areas,
although far less than anticipated in the original designs.
2.        The tables also show that an average of 64% of all cropped land
is in wheat, cotton and sugarcane. They account for practically all the
disposable income of the farmer.
3.        The present overall cropping pattern, and particularly the total area
of fodder crops, has been remarkably constant for several years, indicating
that fodder production is in balance with the requirements of the work and
milch animals in the area. Work aninal numbers relate more to the number of
farming families than to the work output expected from them: all but culti-
vators having very small holdings ow:1 one pair of oxen, notwithstanding the
fact that one pair can readily cope with the work requirements of 15-20 acres.
Ownership of oxen is necessary to enible potential sharecroppers to obtain
land (sharecroppers not owning work animals are only rarely accepted by land-
owners) and for small landowners and leaseholders to participate in the tra-
ditional system whereby a number of ox teams move from farm to farm, in
turn to plow, level and plant the lands of the participants. Therefore,
the present fodder production maintains more working animals than the cropping
pattern requires, even though it may not be sufficient to provide all the
extra food demanded if the animals haive to work longer hours and have less
time to forage in stubble-fields.

4.        Tables 1 and 2 also show the situ!tion expected around 1990 if proj-
ect works are not implemented. In Uni,cs II and V, the area of the major cash
crops would diminish owing to increasing waterlogging and/or salinization,
and the area of the crops gi-ing a lower per acre return, but also having a
greater tolerance to adverse conditions (pulses, millets rice) would ill-
crease.  Overall, yields on the remaining land are not D-fected to improve
in Units II and V, but would rise in Units III and Y1, cwing to generally
improving techniques.
Future With the Project
5.        The expected cropping pattern.  Under project conditions water sup-
plies would be increased, waterlogging and salinization controlled, thereby
making extra land available for cultivation and enabling overall higher
cropping intensities. The ratio of cash to fodder crops would improve in
favor of the cash crops. The area under fodder crops would remain r.uch as
at present, and may even decrease slightly in areas where cash crops with a
substantial component of usable by-products (sugarcane tops, wheat straw)
would increase. Such extra fodder would be sufficient to provide the rations
needed for the longer and harder work required from the oxen. Table 1 shows
the expected cropping pattern in percentages of the CCA and Figures 1 to 4
demonstrates graphically how the crops fit into the agricultural year.
6.        In Unit III, the main increase in cropping intensities would occur
in the rabi, when evapo-transpiration is lower and therefore the crops pro-
duced per hour of well operation are of higher value. There would be an
increase in the wheat, oilseed and sugarcane area. In the other units where
the kharif canal deliveries would be increased, the present ratio of kharif
and rabi crops would substantially remain, although, as noted, the area of
fodder would decline.
7.        The expected production.  Although the agricultural extension ser-
vice would be upgraded either under an IDA project at present being prepared
or otherwise, and to standards acceptable to IDA, this factor has not been
taken into consideration in estimating future yields and production. Crop
yields under project conditions were estimated to increase mainly because
of more irrigation water and better drainage, and only marginally as a
result of a better agricultural extension service.
8.        Wheat.  Since the large-scale introduction of the high-yielding
dwarf varieties in the mid-1960s, there have been several new releases of
reselected seed stocks, varieties since developed and also fresh importations
from Mexico. As at present, there is no organized seed trade and varietal
165



ANNEX 15
Page 3
maintenance program, there is large-scale mixing of varieties, not only of
the dwarfs but also of the earlier, high baking quality but lower yielding
ones with the dwarfs; samples examined in the market and in Government stores
have confirmed this. With the deve:opment envisaged under the IDA-sponsored
seeds project (620-PAK), it is expected that pure and reliable planting mater-
ial will be available in quantities commensurate with increasing demands.
9.        There is a sufficient diversity of varieties to meet conditions
likely to be encountered in the pro4ect area. The main criterion is time
of planting, which can start on kharif fallows in late October and must
necessarily continue, after cotton, into the second half of December.
Plantings after the beginning of December tend to give lower yields than
November plantings; the difference is diminished, but not overcome, by
selecting suitable varieties. The reason for the yield reduction is that
rising temperatures bring about ripening by around mid-April, irrespective
of planting time and the yield is related to the growing period. Therefore,
only the more sophisticated farmers will plant wheat late and balance poten-
tially lower yields with increased revenue due to higher cropping intensities.
10.       Rust resistance in Pakistan, as elsewhere, is a dynamic process
and requires constant breeding and reselection to keep ahead of the mutants
of rust. This aspect of wheat breeding is well under control.
11.       Yields vary greatly.  Many of the better farmers report averages
over 35 md/ac (1.3 tons/ac), while the average reported yield is 14.5 md/ac
(0.5 tons/ac). Many authorities consider this an under-reporting and estimate
irrigated dwarf wheat yields at 20 md/ac (0.7 tons/ac). Projecting yields by
around 1990 to average 24 md/ac (0.9 tons/ac) would therefore appear feasible,
given the currently planned seed development program and without a sub-
stantially improved extension service.
12.       Cotton is the major kharif crop and the district has for long been
one of the foremost cotton-growing areas of the north Indus plain. The dis-
trict is designated an American (hir3utum) cotton area. All the varieties
are of medium staple length, the original variety release descriptions vary-
ing between 15/16" and 1-1/16". Still the most prominent is the reselection
and updating of the old 13/26, under the name of Bahawalpur Selection or BS1.
The last picking of this variety is Ln mid-December, making it almost impos-
sible to follow with wheat (para 9). Emphasis is on varieties that finish
their growing cycle earlier and are also less branching and bushy than BLI.
Such a selection is 149 F. AC 147, an older, medium-duration variety is also
grown, although according to the cot-on zoning regulations, it should be grown
only in Multan district.
13.       The principal agronomic andl genetic problem with cotton is that all
the germplasm in the present varieties is to some extent heat sensitive and
the plants do not flower until temperatures drop from their July-August peaks
of around 120 F. Therefore, planting before mid-June does not bring about
166



ANNEX 15
Page 4
earlier flowering; the prolonged flowering period inherent in the varieties
makes at least three pickings economical, thereby delaying the time the crop
can be uprooted. Consequently, until a new series of varieties are developed
and released, cotton after wheat enables maximum yields to be obtained from
both crops, but if wheat is to be planted after cotton, then either cotton
yields suffer through a lost picking or wheat yields are reduced by late
planting.
14.       Cotton suffers mainly from jassids, mites and, above all, the pink
bollworm. Pest control is inadequate, mainly because there are not enough
sprayers and routinely used spares, such as washers and nozzles. Therefore,
yields are a function of the more or less uncontrolled trends of the insect
cycles and are further held down by inadequate plant populations, due partly
to low seed rates compounded by the use of bollworm-infested planting mater-
ial. The yield range is between 10 and 15 md/ac (0.4 to 0.6 tons/ac) but the
potential is around 25-30 md/ac (0.9-1.1 tons/ac) with the existing varieties
and good, well known agronomic practices. Therefore, expected average yields
of around 18 md/ac (0.7 tons/ac) by about 1990 would appear reasonable.
15.       Sugarcane is of increasing importance.  There are two sugarmills in
the district and there is a flourishing jaggery (gur) industry. The crop grows
well and varieties that can tolerate the low December-January temperatures
have been evolved. With proper fertilization and pest control, two ratoon
crops are feasible but usually the combined effect of root borers and potash
deficiency induces farmers to take only one ratoon. The crop is planted in
March-April. The sugarmills open in November and first crush the ratoon
crop; plant crops are normally harvested from January onwards.
16.       As fertile seeds are not produced in the area, all breeding work
is done in a high-elevation station in the Himalayan foothills. But field
trials and adaptive research is carried out in Bahawalpur and also on the
sugarmill farms in the project area. The COL 54 is a popular, older variety;
BL4 and BL90 are more recent, somewhat higher yielding selections.
17.       Yields vary greatly.  Crops, estimated to produce between 200 and
1,000 md/ac (7.4 to 37 tons/ac) were seen in adjoining fields. Average yields
are reported to be about 375 md/ac (14 tons/ac) but there is no obvious rea-
son why an average of 510 md/ac (19 tons/ac) should not be readily attainable
with the project.
18.       The principal pests affecting the crop are stem and root borers,
both relatively easy to control. The sugarmills assist the extension service
actively in promoting spraying and the application of granular pesticides.
19.       Rice is an important crop only in the southwestern corner of the
project area, although small pockets, mostly for domestic consumption are
grown everywhere. The variety grown commercially is IR6, a high-yielding
dwarf. For domestic use, a Basmati (scented) variety is popular, the project
area being the southern limit of its ecological range. Average yields of
167



ANNEX 15
Page 5
IR6 were reported at around 20 md/ac (0.7 tons/ac) but yields in excess of
this were frequent. Under project conditions, an average of 27 md/ac (1.0
tons/ac) should be readily attainable.
20.       The crop is attacked by stem borers.  Zinc deficiency, increasingly
identified, is however easily controllable.
21.       Sorghum and pearl millet (jowar and bajra) are minor grain crops
and are principally planted for fodder, i.e. more closely than desirable
for maximum grain yield. Almost no varieties of higher yielding grain
types have been released and there is no hybrid seed development program.
Grain yields are only about 7-8 md/ac (0.25-0.3 tons/ac) and unlikely to
increase until there is a new approach to a grain variety or hybrid produc-
tion program. As apart from rice, millets are the only possible food crops
in the kharif, and before controlled barrage irrigation were of major impor-
tance, it does not seem unlikely that a fresh look at agricultural develop-
ment, especially if combined with a livestock and feed industry, will put
new emphasis on millet production. In this case, new genetic material is
available to bring about a rapid increase in yields.
22.       Maize is not at present an important crop.  Several earlier attempts
to popularize it in the southern Pinjab produced only short-lived results.
When wheat is plentiful, maize is of smaller dietary importance even than
the millets and is mainly used green as a vegetable. Hybrids and synthetic
varieties that would boost yields have been developed and are in limited
use, but being a minor crop, receive less than optimum attention and the
potential is only rarely realized. Under project conditions, the estimated
yield would be 20 md/ac (0.74 tons/ac) for the few farmers who would grow
the crop commercially.
23.       Pulse crops of importance are the chickpea in the rabi and the
cluster bean (guara) in the kharif, although the latter is in the project
area more frequently as a fodder c:_op. Chickpea yields are low, the atten-
tion paid to the crop minimal and yields are likely to advance only slowly
from their present low level of 6 mld/ac (0.22 tons/ac).
24.       The rabi fodder crop is t:he Egyptian clover (berseem) and, to a
lesser extent, lucerne. The varieties available are good and the expected
yield of 410 md/ac (15 tons/ac) is easily attainable.
25.       Orchard crops in the area are mango and citrus.  There are some
excellent grafted mango varieties t:hat yield well. Orchards are usually
sold to contractors who harvest ana, market the crop; prices attained are
around Rs 3,000 to 5,000/ha. CitrtLs orchards fetch around 1,000 to 3,000/ha
depending on kind and productivity.
26.       With the expected improvement in the extension service, yields
would, overall, increase considerably above the levels assumed for the
economic analysis of this project. The expected yields, with an improved
extension service in addition to the project works, would be as follows:

Agricultural Inputs and Crop Budgets
Agricultural Data
1.        Tables 1 to 4 show the agricultural, data on yields, cropping patterns
and fertilizer requirements for the project Units in the present, future with-
out and future with project situations. Tables 5 to 12 show crop enterprise
budgets for these projections, based on financial and economic prices developed
in Annex 16.
2.        Tables 13 to 16 show the labor and draft power requirements for each
crop by month (per ha). In Units II and V, future without project labor and
draft power requirements (per crop, per ha) are expected to be the same as at
present.
3.        Total project labor and draft power requirements are shown in Tables
17 and 18, and the estimated economic cost of labor in Table 19.
4.        The economic value of production for each Unit and the project as a
whole is shown in Tables 20-24. Table 25 shows the estimated economic value
of production if the extension project is introduced.

ANNEX 17

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Prices. Incomes and Farm Budgets
Economic Prices
1.        The prices used in the economic analysis are based primarily on
world market prices, but adjustments have been made to reflect:
(a) historical relationships between world prices and
actual cif or fob prices for Pakistan;
(b) transport and processing costs.
For crops which are not traded, economic prices are based on local financial
prices adjusted by the ratio of economic prices to financial prices for
traded crops. Derivation of prices is described below.
Cotton
2.        The economic price for cotton is based on the three main products
derived from seed cotton, namely lint, oil and cake. Processing ratios for
current technology in Pakistan are approximtely:
Lint    33
Oil      7
Cake    55
Waste    5
Exports of cotton lint from Pakistan have historically fetched only 72% of
average world prices.  On this basis, the 1976 price is Rs 12,770/ton (58U/lb),
compared to an average world price of 80/lb. The estimated economic price
for cotton seed oil allowing for transportation cost is Rs 5,780/ton and the
price of cake is Rs 1,340/ton. The economic price for cotton seed (excluding
domestic transportation handling and processing costs) is thus Rs 5,355/ton.
Costs of domestic transportation are estimated at Rs 100/ton of seed cotton.
Processing costs are estimated to be Rs 380/ton of seed cotton for ginning and
baling, and Rs 100/ton of seed (Rs 65/ton of seed cotton) for subsequent
processing into oil and cake. The present net economic price of cotton is
therefore Rs 4,810/ton. The 1985 prices based on Bank projections (adjusted for
quality and international transport) for lint, cotton seed oil and cake are
Rs 10,200, Rs 5,024 and Rs 2,460/ton, respectively. With similar assumptions to
those described above concerning processing ratios and costs, the future
economic price of seed cotton is calculated to be Rs 4,525/ton.
203



ANNEX 17
Page 2
Wheat
3.        Wheat is currently imported into Pakistan.  The cif cost of wheat
(excluding PL 480) has historica:Lly averaged 95% of world prices, thus the
present (1976) border price is Rs 1,390/ton. The project is situated in a
surplus area which exports wheat elsewhere in Pakistan. The pattern of
internal movements is such that production of more wheat in the project area
will save the transport costs from Karachi to Rahimyar Khan of the imported
alternative. These costs, based on rail freight charges are estimated at
Rs 50/ton. Farm-to-market transport costs are Rs 30/ton. Thus, the economic
price of wheat is estimated at Rs 1,410/ton. In the future, Pakistan should
become self sufficient in wheat, and thus the 1985 price is estimated as
above, except that the freight costs from Karachi are excluded, giving a
price of Rs 1,590/ton.
Rice
4.        Coarse rice exports frcm Pakistan have historically fetched only
68% of average world prices -- reflecting transport costs and quality dif-
ferences. Based on 1976 prices, the fob price for rice is therefore Rs
1,740/ton. Transport costs from Rahimyar Khan to the port are estimated at
Rs 50/ton of rice, and farm-to-market transport costs average Rs 30/ton of
paddy. Milling costs are estimated at Rs 50/ton of rice. Assuming a milling
ratio of three units of paddy to two units of rice, gives a present economic
price of paddy of Rs 1,055/ton. The 1985 price on similar assumptions is
estimated at Rs 1,520/ton.
Oilseeds
5.        Prices paid by Pakistan for imports of brassica oilseeds have his-
torically averaged 92% of world prices. Assuming transport and handling costs
for imports of Rs 50/ton and transport costs of Rs 30/ton for local produce
(based on commission charged by handling agents), the economic price of
oilseed is estimated at Rs 1,920/ton at present, and Rs 2,520/ton in 1985.
Maize and Millets
6.        These crops are neither imported nor exported, and internally are
wheat-substitutes. The types of grain produced are not strictly comparable
with the World-traded types, being local varieties suited to local tastes.
This is reflected in the domestic price structure, with maize and millets
having the same (and occasionally higher) prices than wheat. To allow for
this, the economic price of these grains is set equal to that of wheat.
Sugarcane
7.        Sugar is no longer imported into Pakistan.  The economic price of
cane based on the world price, an assumed extraction ratio of 9% and transport
handling and milling costs of Rs L,620/ton of sugar (Rs 145/ton of cane)
is estimated at Rs 140/ton at present, and Rs 220/ton in 1985.
204



ANNEX 17

Fodder
8.        Given the heavy dependence on animal draft power and the prevalence
of milk animals, fodder is an important and valuable crop -- indeed, around
towns it is an important cash crop. In addition to crops grown specifically
for fodder, several other crops also produce significant quantities of fodder
material. All fodder produce is valued at market prices, plus a 30% premium
to reflect the difference between prevailing market prices for crops and world
prices in general.
Vegetables, Orchards, etc.
9.        A large variety of crops fall into this category, and estimated
values have been used for the analysis.
Financial Prices
10.       Financial prices are based on recent market prices in the project
area, adjusted for transport costs to farmgate prices.
Future Prices
11.       The present disparities between financial and economic prices are
expected to continue except in the case of oilseeds, where domestic prices
have recently increased rapidly to levels above world averages, but are
expected to stabilize in the future near to the economic price. For the
major crops, this is a conservative assumption for the purposes of computing
future farm incomes, since the internal prices of some crops have recently
been allowed to move closer to economic prices. However, further increases
would reduce income to GOP, especially from the taxes on cotton and rice,
and would probably necessitate a balancing increase in some other agricultural
tax. Prices used in the analysis are shown in Table 1.
Incomes
12.       Representative farm budgets for 5, 12.5 and 25 ac farms are shown
in Table 3 for present, future-without and future-with-project situations.
These are based on the cropping patterns shown in Table 2, and the crop
budgets developed in Annex 15.
13.       Income from off-farm work has been computed by calculating the
available labor per 100 ha CCA in each farm size category (based on census
data on household sizes and farm size distribution), assuming a maximum of
25 man-days/month/worker are available.

14.       Based on present labor demand estimates, the surplus/deficit of
labor by farm size and month (per 100 ha CCA) can be calculated -- for
example, in May, the labor requirement for 12.5 -- 25 ac farms is 450 man-
days per 100 ha CCA (labor required is 15 days/ha, and this farm category
covers 30% of CCA, i.e. 30 ha). Availability of labor on this category is
407 man-days, therefore, there is a hiring requirement of 43 man-days. This
calculation, repeated for each farm size shows:
(1) The total hiring requirEment for the larger farms;
(2) The labor surplus from the smaller farms.
On the basis of the actual financial wage rate by month, the total payment
to hired workers is calculated (hiring requirement x wage rate). Dividing
this value by the available surplus labor gives the "probable" income of an
available worker, which can then be distributed back over the labor surplus
farms, pro-rated by their surplus availability, to get an estimate of farm
income from hiring out labor by farm size per 100 ha CCA.
15.       To convert this to income per farm, the number of farms (in each size
class) per 100 ha CCA is computed, and hence the income per farm can be found.
Results for present and future-with-project (assuming a 30% increase in work-
force) are shown in Table 4.
16.       Without the project, the labor force would increase much more
rapidly than demand, with the resuLt that less hired labor would be required,
and there would be more competitio-a for available employment. The result
is very sensitive to the assumptionis made about migration to the urban areas,
and it has therefore been assumed in the farm budgets that both the income
to and expenditures on hired labor would fall by 20% without the project.
17.       The farm budgets for Uni-: III show estimated income and costs if
the farmer purchases water from a private tubewell. To estimate the rate
of return on a private tubewell, cr-op budgets and cropping patterns were
projected for a farm having no access to tubewell water and a farm with a
206



ANNEX 17
Page 5
tubewell (Table 5). The incremental value of production is Rs 350 per ac,
and incremental water requirement is 14" at the crop (20" at the well). The
average value of rabi water is therefore estimated at Rs 300 per ac-ft
at the crop, or Rs 200 per ac-ft at the well. In economic prices, cor-
responding values are Rs 400 per ac-ft at the crop, Rs 280 at the well.
The rate of return on a tubewell depends on the size of the holding. Since
water is sold for approximately Rs 100 per ac-ft, but is worth double
this on the land, the income to the owner depends on the relative amounts
sold and used on the land.
18.       The cost to the farmer of a I cusec diesel tubewell is Rs 32,000.
Of this, he pays Rs 8,000 down, and loan repayments of Rs 6,700 per year
for 5 years, plus annual O&M cost of Rs 6,600.
19.       The well is expected to need replacement after seven years, when
the pump and motor will have a residual value of about Rs 4,000. Costs
can therefore be summarized as follows:
Year    Capital & Repayment /a          O&M       Total

/a   Excluding any subsidies.
The well is expected to pump about 150 ac-ft per year. Per acre requirements
(at the well) are 1.7 ac-ft in rabi. As estimated above, the owner receives
an extra Rs 200 for each ac-ft (at the well) used on his own land and Rs 100
per ac-ft for water he sells.
Income for various farm sizes is estimated below:

Cost Recovery
20.       Water charges in Punjab at present vary from crop to crop.  Rates
for the main crops are:
crop                         Rs/ac
Cotton                       16.8
Wheat                        10.4
Rice                         14.4
Sugarcane                    31.2
21.       On the basis of present water rates and cropping patterns, col-
lections average Rs 6/ac in the non-perennial Units (II and III) and Rs 12/ac
in perennial units (total recoveries: Rs 10.9 M/yr).
22.       The expected schedule of expenditures for operation, maintenance
and replacements of the project workcs are described in Annex 4. At full
development, the direct 0 & M costs amount to Rs 31 M/yr (excluding Unit III
private tubewells) (in addition to O) & M expenditures on the existing works
amounting to Rs 25 M/yr). The discounted (at 10%) net present cost of the
total expenditures amounts to Rs 965 M, excluding the cost of the Drainage
Works (see para 25).
23.       Recoveries from beneficiaries are expected to remain at the present
levels until one year after the completion of project works, thus the annuity
required to recover full investment and 0 & M costs at 10% discount rate is
calculated assuming recoveries to run from Year Seven to Year 30, and amounts
to approximately Rs 215 M/yr including Rs 25 M/yr to operate the existing
system.
24.       It is proposed that a stucLy of water charges and other agricultural
taxes will be carried out. As a minimum, however, it is expected that water
rates in the province will be approximately doubled.  Since SCARP areas    208



ANNEX 17
Page 7
traditionally pay double the rates in non-SCARP areas, per acre recoveries
(allowing for increased cropping intensity) in the project area would increase
fivefold, and average Rs 62/ac in all Units except Unit III where they would be
Rs 31/ac. Total recoveries would thus amount to Rs 67 M/yr in the SCARP VI
area, which would cover about 31% of the annualized total project costs,
including all 0 & M costs. Province-wide, however, revenues would produce a
substantial surplus (estimated at present prices to be 30% of current invest-
ment levels) over and above 0 & M costs.
25.       As has been the practice in previous SCARP projects, the recovery
of the capital cost of the drainage works would be spread over the entire
irrigated area of Punjab. Full cost recovery, at 10% interest over 30 years,
would amount to about Rs 1/ac CCA/yr.
26.       A large portion of the capital costs of the proposed irrigation
works would be automatically recovered under the existing taxes on agricul-
tural production. Most important of these in the SCARP VI area is the 25%
ad valorem tax on exported cotton (which accounts for about 75% of all cotton
production). The incremental income from the project beneficiaries to the
Government from this tax is estimated at Rs 74 M per year.
27.       Additional revenue would also come from the excise tax on sugar
and the implicit tax on rice exports. The tax on sugar is primarily a tax
on consumers since it is used to maintain the price of sugar above the
world price (while the price of cane is slightly below the world price),
and is to some extent avoided by processing the cane into gur at the farm
level. The tax on rice has only a limited effect in this area, where
relatively little is grown. Thus, the income to Government from the tax on
cotton alone is used as a conservative estimate of the total incremental
income from taxation.
28.       The estimated revenue of Rs 74 M per annum would be sufficient to
repay a further 34% of the irrigation investment, operation and maintenance
expenditures in the proposed project over 30 years at 10% interest.
Project Rent
29.       Table 3 shows project rent by farm size and project Unit after due
allowance for the riskiness of crop production, the cost of family labor and
a management fee to the farm operator. The rent recovery is calculated on
the basis of incremental water charges divided by the project rent. In the
case of Unit II, where private tubewells would be replaced by public tubewells,
the without-project payment for purchases of private tubewell water is treated
as an input cost. In Unit III where, under the project, private tubewells
would increase in number, the incremental cost of purchasing water from these
wells is included as part of the rent recovery.
30.       Recovery of rent varies from Unit to Unit, and increases substantially
with farm size. Average recoveries amount to about 23%.

SALINITY CONTROL AND RECLAMATION PROJECT (SCARP) VI
Economic Analysis
1.        Based on the economic prices derived in Annex 16, the rate of return
of the project has been calculated under the following assumptions:
(a) Benefits. Only the direct economic incremental value
of production is included in the rate of return. Other
effects are discussed below (para 11).
(b) Crop production values are based on the yields and input
levels set out in Annex 14.
(c) Labor costs are assumed to vary according to demand, with
a minimum price set at Rs 5/day (compared to the financial
minimum of Rs 8/day) and a maximum price set at Rs 12/day
(financial equivalent Rs 18 day) (see Annex 15, Table 19).
The average price, weighted by month to take account of
variations in demand, is Rs 6.92 at present and Rs 7.81
with the project (Annex 15, Table 23). Construction
labor has been valued at market prices.
(d) An exchange rate equal to the official rate of exchange.
2.        Also included in costs is the opportunity cost of the increased
diversions from storage which the project area would receive, estimated on
the basis of the analysis in Annex 16. This analysis shows that the average
economic value of water at the crop is Rs 400 per ac-ft on otherwise
unirrigated land. In estimating the opportunity cost of increased storage
diversions, 75% of this figure has been used since:
(a) use of the water on already irrigated land will have a lower
marginal value;
(b) the figure of Rs 400 makes no allowance for incremental
investments or O&M expenditures which would be needed to
use the water elsewhere.
3.        The value of the extra diversions is thus computed as:
Diversion (AF) x Delivery Efficiency x 300 Rs/AF
or 355,000 x .45 x 300 = Rs 47.9 M per year.
217



ANNEX 18

4.        Development Phasing.  Berefits directly attributable to project
works will be realized rapidly. Yield increases would result primarily from
the elimination of underirrigating, and increases in cropping intensity would
also occur relatively quickly due to the extra water supplies available.
The build-up of projected benefits is also related to the project implemen-
tation schedule for each Unit.
5.        Unit II canal remodeling, which would provide the main source of
benefits in kharif would be completed in Year Four, while tubewell instal-
lation (which provides most of the rabi benefits) would be spread over Years
Two, Three and Four. While benefits from canal remodeling accrue only after
the works are completed, the tubeweLls provide partial benefits during the
installation period. Kharif and rabi benefits are therefore considered
separately.  Without the project, i: is assumed that production would rise
steadily and slowly to the values shown over a period of 15 years. With the
project, it is assumed that, after mn area receives improved kharif or rabi
water supplies, production in that season reaches 90% of future with project
levels after six years, and thereafter improves slowly to the full with
project level of production. Table I shows the incremental benefits which
would result from the project on the above assumption. It should be noted
that rabi benefits are prorated to begin accruing in Years Three, Four and
Five to reflect the phasing of tubewell installations, while kharif benefits
for the whole Unit begin in Year Five, as shown below.

6.        Unit III.  The analysis of Unit III is very similar to the above,
since project implementation follows the same pattern and benefits again
depend on canal remodeling in kharif and tubewell installation in rabi,
which in this case begin immediately. Projected build-up of benefits is shown
below.

7.        Unit IV and V.  Analysis of these Units is simpler, since project
benefits in both seasons stem primarily from improved canal supplies. In
Unit IV, infrastructural improvements would be completed during Year Six,
and the resulting benefits are projected below.

8.         Economic Rate of Return.  Based on the incremental investment,
operating and maintenance costs an.1 the above projeted benefits, which are
summarized in Table 1. The economLc rate of return of the project is esti-
mated to be 19% over a 30 year perLod.

9.        Sensitivity Analysis.  The sensitivity of the rate of return to
alternative assumptions is as follows:
(a) Project investments made according to schedule, but
benefits delayed by 2 years: rate of return 15%.
(b) All costs increased by 20%: rate of return 16%.
(c) All benefit decreased by 20%: rate of return 16%.
(d) Combination of b and c: rate of return 12%.
(e) Extension project introduced in project area: rate
of return in excess of 30%.
Public versus Private Development of Unit III
10.       It would be possible to develop Unit III by public sector tubewells.
Assuming good maintenance and management, agricultural benefits would be the
same as projected for the private development case. Investment costs, however,
would be higher by approximately Rs 170 million, and, despite a saving of
about Rs 10 M per year in O&M, the overall project rate of return would fall
to 17%.
Project Benefits not Included in Economic Analysis
11.       The foregoing analysis is based only on investment costs and incre-
mental production. Additional benefits include:
(a) Increases in economic activity and employment in agricultural
processing industries.
(b) Increases in other forms of employment due to increased farm
incomes in the area.
