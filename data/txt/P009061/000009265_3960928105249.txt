MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
FOR A SEWERAGE PROJECT OF THE
ANKARA MUNICIPALITY IN THE REPUPLIC OF TURKEY
1.       The following report on a proposed loan of US$173.0 million equivalent to
the Ankara Water Supply and Sewerage Administration, ASKI, is submittt.J for
approval. The proposed loan would be for a term of seventeen years, including five
years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance
a sewerage project. A parallel financing mixed credit totalling DM 174.5 million
(US$91.9 million equivalent) is to be provided by the Federal Republic of Germany
through the Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KfW).
2.       Background.  The proposed project is for the Greater Ankara Metropolitan
Area, Turkey's second largest, with a population of 2.6 million growing 3.4% per
year. Ankara is a cultural, commercial, and financial center as well as the
national capital, and has important medium scale and light industry, ranking third
in industrial employment among the Country's metropolitan areas. Most of Ankara is
supplied by piped water, but in many districts sewerage is lacking or
unsatisfactory, and there is no sewage treatn.ent. Many of the water courses in and
through the City are open sewers, including the Ankara River, and many stormwater
drains also carry sewage and are subject to overflows, at times causing
contaminated flooding.
3.       Works to meet future growth in water needs are under construction, but
solutions to major sewerage deficiencies have been held up because of limited
finances. The proposed project addresses present sewerage deficiencies and
projected new sewerage needs, and consists of sewage collection and treatment
facilities, drainage facilities, sewerage operational and maintenance equipment,
and technical assistance and training. Ankara's water supply and sewerage
authority, ASKI, would be the Project's implementing agency and owner and the
Bank's borrower.
4.       Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the Project are to provide
facilities to: (i) eliminate the discharge of untreated sewage to the Ankara River
and its tributaries flowing through Ankara; (ii) extend sewerage to unserved
persons and improve the present sewerage; (iii) reduce flooding during heavy
rainstorms. The sewerage and drainage would enclose otherwise open flows through
the City, and thereby eliminate health hazards, odors, and flooding, particularly
flooding now occurring from time to time with sewage-contaminated stormwater.
5.       Project Description.  The Project would include:  construction of new
network sewers; replacement of parts of the existing sewerage system; construction
of five major collector sewers (102.7 km total length) and two major interceptors
(33.6 km total length); construction of a biological treatment plant to treat the
full flow of sewage from the City; construction of major stormwater drains (46.0
km); provision of operation and maintenance vehicles and equipment; and technical
assistance and training to strengthen ASKI institutionally, particularly ASKI's
capabilities for operation and maintenance of sewerage and drainage systems.
6.       The cost of the Project is estimated at US$556.8 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$256.4 million equivalent (46%). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in

Schodule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Gro,p operations in Turkey are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  Maps also
are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8088-TU dated November 30, 1989 is
being distributed separately.
7.       Rationale tor World Bank Involvement.  With the proposed loan, the Bank
would continue it8 strategy of supporting:  decentralization of sector development
responsibilities; establishment of strong local sector authorities; improvement of
local resource mobilization and cost recovery, thereby obtaining reduction of local
dependence on central government resources; implementation of least cost
solutions; provision of affordable water and sewerage service to low income
customers; and protection of the environment against pollution from industrial
wastewater and domes.ic sewage.  The Bank has followed this approach successfully
in projects in Istanbul and in Izmir. It is the success of the water and sewerage
authority, ISKI, established in 1981 in Istanbul in connection with financing from
the Bank, that led to the establishment of ASKI and similar organizations in Izmir
and Adana. ISKI is demonstrating both the value of using a separate, autonomous
organization to develop and operate city water and sewerage systems, and the
potential of the municipality to self-finance the bulk of its investment
requirements in the sector. Of particular importance in the case of Bank support
for Ankara are: (i) the encouragement of local resource mobilization for the
Project's local currency requirements, which it is believed would be addressed to
the extent needed only if sufficient foreign currency would be available; (ii) the
Bank's influence on the quality of the Project's design and implementation; and
(iii) the Bank's influence on implementation timeliness by assisting the
authorities toward expeditious action.
8.       Agreements Reached.
(a) The proposed loan of US$173.0 million equivalent would finance an
estimated 31 percent of the cost of the Project. It is intended that
a KfW mixed credit for US$91.9 million equivalent would finance the
cost of the mechanical and electrical equipment for the sewage
treatment plant and the detailed engineering design of the plant. It
has been agreed that the allocation by the German Government of the
mixed credit funds (expected by January 1990) is to be a condition of
Loan Agreement Effectiveness of the proposed World Bank loan, and
that the subsequent effectiveness of the KfW financing agreement by
December 31, 1990, or the arrangement of alternative financing
satisfactory to the Bank by that date, is to be a condition of the
loan;
(b) It has been agreed that the signing of appropriate local agreements
for the provision of sewerage and sewage treatment services by ASKI
to outlying districts included in the Project is to be a condition of
disbursement from the proposed loan of funds for constructing sewers
in those districts;
(c) It has been agreed that ASKI will produce funds from internal sources
enabling it to self-finance no less than 45% of its annual investment
expenditure in 1990 and 1991, and 60% in 1992 and each year
thereafter;
(d) It has been agreed that before May 1 and November 1 of each year,
ASKI will review whether it would meet its agreed self financing
levels, and that if the review should indicate that ASKI would not



- 3 -
meet the agreed levels, ASKI will promptly take measures enabling it
to meet the levels;
(e) It has been agreed that ASKI will reduce its accounts receivable to
no more than the equivalent of two months of current billings by
December 31, 1990;
(f) It has been agreed that ASKI will obtain the agreement of the
Government and the Bank prior to contracting any debt in excess of
the total cumulative amount of US$5 million equivalent, other than
the intended KfW credit for the Project's sewage treatment facility,
untis the completion of the Project.
9.       Justification.  The Project would provide, at least cost, first-time
sewerage for approximately 850,000 people; it would rehabilitate or replace
existing sewerage for 500,000; and it would provide means to treat the City's
sewage, which at present flows exposed through parts of the City in tributary
streams to the Ankara River and in the River itself. The sewerage would enclose
the otherwise open flows, and, together with the treatment facility, would thereby
eliminate healtht hazards, odors, and other pollution-related problems in the City
and along the Ankara River to the west outside the City. All inhabited areas would
be provided with sewerage except for inaccessible squatter areas, which are
relatively small, on the steepest hillsides. Without the facilities, and given the
increasing population densities, increases in the incidence of disease and
deterioration in other aspects of living conditions would occur.
10.      In addition, the Project would provide storm-water drainage facilities to
reduce and in most cases eliminate the possibility of flooding from otherwise
storm-loaded creeks and sewers which can present health hazards from sewage
contamination as well as the threat of physical damage and loss of life due to
drowning (as has occurred from time to time in areas of low lying housing). This
would be done by constructing new drainage works and by improving existing ones,
and by eliminating present sewage discharges into existing works constructed only
for drainage purposes and therefore inappropriate as carriers of simultaneous flows
of both types. The Project also would result in future cost savings through better
maintenance made possible through provision of manholes on existing sewers,
maintenance equipment and technical assistance and training. Also, financial
strengthening of ASKI through revenue increases would reduce reliance on outside
sources for financing future investments; and managemernt strengthening and training
would increase operating efficiency.
11.      Risks.  The only important risk for the Project is the possib- .ity that
significant delay in implementation might occur at some time because of a lack of
local currency resulting from insufficient adjustment of tariffs t, compensate for
inflation. ASKI already has brought its tariffs to a level which is adequate for
the balance of 1989, and as previously mentioned, ASKI has agreed to procedures
designed to resolve in advance any need for future tariff adjustment.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
