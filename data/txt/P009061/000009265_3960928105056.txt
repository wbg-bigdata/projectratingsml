REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ANKARA SEWERAGE PROJECT
Loan and Projeet SummaM
Borrower:           Ankara Water Supply and Sewerage Administration (ASKI).
Guarantor:          Republic of Turkey.
Loan Amount:        US$173 million equivalent.
Terms:              Seventeen years, including 5 years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project             The main objectives of the project are to provide
Description:        facilities to:  (i) eliminate the discharge of untreated
sewage to the Ankara River and its tributaries flowing
through Ankara; (ii) extend sewerage to unserved persons
and improve the present sewerage; (iii) reduce flooding in
p"rts of the city that flood during heavy rainstorms. The
sewerage and drainage would enclose otherwise open flows
through the city, and thereby eliminate health hazards,
odors, and flooding (including flooding now occurring from
time to time with sewage-contaminated stormwater). The
Project includes sewage collection and treatment
components; drainage; and technical assistance and training
for ASKI, the autonomous water and sewerage authority of
Ankara.
Beneficiaries       The beneficiaries would be:  (a) approximately 850,06O
and Risks:          persons in and around Ankara (of which 500,000 low income)
who would receive sewerage service as a result of the
Project; (b) an additional 500,000 persons (of which
300,000 low income) already connected to sewers who would
receive improved service; (c) all residents of and visitors
to Ankara wlho would no longer encounter the polluted
environment found today. Also, the cleaning up of the
Ankara River would make possible the use of its water by
farmers outside the City, as had been done in the past up
to about 20 years ago. By the end of the project
implementation period (planned for end 1996), approximately
93% of the City's population would be sewered, virtually
everyone but persons, usually very low income persons,
living on steep hillsides in squatter ("gecekondu") areas
which are inaccessible for sewerage. Actions initiated to
minimize risks and ensure successful implementation of the
Project include the identification of and agreement to
correct design deficiencies in ongoing works; and the
increasing of tariffs to enable self-financing by ASKI of
the local currency requirements of its investment program
including the proposed project.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
AYKARA SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The proposed project is for the Greater Ankara Metropolitan Area,
the Country's second largest, with a population of 2.6 million growing 3.42
per year.  Ankara is a cultural, commercial, t.  financial center as well
as the national capital, and has important medium scale and light industry,
ranking third in industrial employment among tt2 Country's metropolitan
areas.
1.02     Most of the area is supplied by piped water, but in many
districts, sewe:cage is lacking or unsatisfactory, and there is no sewage
treatment. Many of the water courses are open sewers, and many drainage
works carry sewage and are subject to overflows, at times causing
contaminated flooding.
1.03     Works to meet future growth in water needs are under construction,
but solutions to major sewerage deficiencies have been held up because of
limited finances. The proposed project addresses present sewerage
deficiencies and projected new sewerage needs.
1.04     The Project consists of sewage collection and treatment
facilities, drainage facilities, sewerage operational and maintenance
equipment, and technical assistance and training. Ankara's water supply
and sewerage authority, ASKI, would be the Project's implementing agency
and owner and the Bank's borrower.
1.05     Detailed preparation of the pxoject began following an April 1988
request of the Government for an advance cf US$1.5 million equivalent from
the Bank's Project Preparation Facility. The field appraisal of the
Project was completed July 6, 1989.
II. SECTORAL CONTEXT
Country Background
2.01     The population of Turkey at the end of 1987 was 54 million, with
53S living in urban areas. Population growth averaged 2.52 per annum
during 1980-85 (42 for urban areas and 0.92 for rural areas). The overall
growth rate is expected to decrease gradually, and the population by the
year 2000 to reach about 67 million. Movement from rural to urban areas is
expected to continue and to constitute a major cause of growing demand for
water and sewerage services in urban areas.

Statistics.
2.03     Approximately 80% of the Country's urban population in 1983 was
served by piped water to residences, but in many cities including the three
largest, widespread pressure drops and cutoffs were being, and still are,
experienced from time to time because of source and distribution
limitations. Less than two thirds of the national total amount of water
produced arrived at residences and was registered in sales, but it is
believed that a significant unregistered quantity was consumed through
illegal connections and malfunctioning meters. Average daily per capita
consumption (registered) was 122 liters, including users of all types, of
which it is estimated that household consumption on average amounted to
approximately 85 liters.
2.04     Consumption at this level ordinarily is sufficient for health
requirements. Below average quantities and low pressures which occur,
however, increase disease risk, particularly when low pressure allows
infiltration of contaminated groundwater into water distribution pipes
through openings which normally are points of outward leakage.



- 3 -
2.05     Approximately 562 of the urban population had at least some type
of sewer pipe connection to their residences, but this must be interpreted
with the understanding that many such pipes, or the street sewers to which
some of them are connected, discharge into nearby creeks and open drainage
channels, and that sewage treatment plants were, and still are, virtually
non-existent. This remains the same today except in the case of IstanbuL
where rapid progress has been made in recent years, and is continuing, in
constructing up-to-date collection, treatment, and disposal works, and in
Izmir where similar effort is beginning.
2.06     Average 1988 water and sewerage served population percentages in
Ankara exceed the 1983 national averages, reflecting the national capital's
high living standard (on average). The relatively low citywide household
consumption average, is a combination of low values from the approximately
50% of the population who live in poor and unplanned ("gecekondu") areas,
with the higher values enjoyed by the other 502
Future Urban Demand for Water and Sewerage
2.07     It is estimated that approximately six million of the Country's
present urban population of 30 million do not have piped water; 13 million
do not have adequate sewerage; and most except those living in Istanbul,
Izmir, and Ankara neither have, nor soon plan to have, sewage treatment
facilities for their communities. In addition, the urban population is
expected to increase to about 42 million by the year 2000, and with
continued rapid economic development and increasing living standards, most
new city persons as well as those not adequately served at present will
require expansion of public water, sewerage, and sewage treatment and
disposal systems. It is estimated that water production for urban areas
will have to increase to 3.5 billion m3/year by the year 2000 (compared to
1.4 billion m3/year in 1983), and that corresponding increases in water
treatment and distribution facilities will be needed together with
proportionately greater increases in sewerage, and sewage treatment and
disposal facilities.
Future Investment in the Sector
2.08     Although current national and local budget tightening are
affecting investment in the water and sewerage sector along with other
areas of public investment, it is expected that the sector will continue
receiving priority emphasis so that present deficiencies will be eliminated
and increasing proportions of the growing urban population will be served.
The increasing degree of self-financing being achieved in the sector in
economically strong, larger municipalities is expected to be a major
contributing factor to future investment emphasis in the larger
municipalities, and also in smaller communities. Furthermore,
with the substantial reduction being achieved in the need for Government
budgetary support for the sector in the larger municipalities, the limited
budgetary resources which are available may then be concentrated by the
Government on the smallest communities still needing it.



- 4 -
2.09     It is estimated that the capital cost of new and upgraded urban
water, sewerage, and sewage treatment and disposal facilities in the
Country during the 1990's could be approximately US$8.5 billion equivalent
(in 1988 prices).

Sewerage Investment 1990-2000

Total                                                         8,550
In making the estimate, it was assumed that the level of residential piped
water service would be increased to 90% of the urban population on average,
that the average quantity of water sold would increase to 160 liters per
capita per day (compared to the 1983 figure of 122); that 752 of the urban
population would have a sewer connection (compared to 56% in 1983); and
that 502 of the urban sewage would be treated (compared to 0% in 1983).
Most of the sewage treatment facilities would be located in Istanbul,
Ankara, and Izmir, which are projected to have approximately 39% of the
total urban population by the year 2000, and which cities would account for
about one half of the ten-year sector investment total.
Sector Orga-ization
2.10     With the exception of certain major water source operations, the
provision of public water supply and sewerage services in Turkey is a
responsibility of municipalities and village councils. Local financial
resources and technical capabilities, however, have not been sufficient to
support system development except recently in the cases of Istanbul, Izmir,
and Ankara. Planning, design, and construction of new systems, therefore,
have been, and are being carried out virtually entirely by three central
government organizations, except for projects in the mentioned largest
municipalities. The State Hydraulic Works (DSI) under the Ministry of
Public Works is responsible for national water resources management, major
water source development and operation, and water supply development for
the larger towns, excluding the largest municipalities. The Iller Bank
(IB, meaning Bank of the Provinces), a semi-autonomous Government
corporation, is responsible for water supply development for towns with a
population of less than 500,000, and for major sewerage development in all
urban areas except Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. The General Directorate of



Rural Services (GDRS) under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Village Affairs (MAFRA) is responsible for rural water supply programs,
through its Rural Water Supply Department (RWS) and Research and Planning
Department.
2.11     In all but the largest municipalities, responsibility for
municipal water and sewerage operations is embedded within operating
departments which carry out a variety of other functions as well (e.g.,
transportation, gas service). The first of the large municipality
exceptions is Istanbul. In 1981, the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage
General Directorate (ISKI) was created by Law No. 2560 (approved November
20, 1981 and amended by Law No. 3009, May 23, 1984) as an autonomous entity
responsible for the planning, design, construction, operation and
maintenance of all water supply and sewerage facilities in Greater
Istanbul. This was intended also to strengthen the sector's organization,
and to enable an increasing share of the sector's investment for Istanbul
to be financed with internally generated funds. The experience has been
successful (para. 2.17), and Law No. 3305 of June 5, 1986 authorized the
establishment of similar organizations in Izmir, Ankara, and Adana. Also,
national legislation in 1981 defined Greater Municipal Areas, by which
administrative responsibilities and organizations for water supply and
sewerage services of many smaller municipalities could be taken over by a
nearby large urban center. In the case of Istanbul, 24 water supply
organizations were merged into ISKI.
2.12     The ISKI-type water supply and sewerage organizations of Izmir,
Ankara. and Adana now are established and functioning successfully, and
those of Izmir and Adana are receiving major lending support from the Bank
as is ISKI in Istanbul (paras. 2.18 to 2.21). It is expected that the ISKI
organizational model, in due course, will be adopted by other cities seeing
potential benefits in taking greater responsibility locally for their
investment needs in the sector.
Constraints to Development
2.13     Funds for development in the sector in most cities have been and
continue to be insufficient, in part because of the lack of recognition by
local administrations of the potential for local resource mobilization
within the sector through charges to customers. With the exception of the
largest municipalities, virtually all local authorities look to the Central
Government as the primary and usually the only source for obtaining needed
water and seiarage works. The charges for water and sewerage services in
such localities typically cover no more than cash operating expenses at
best; and, thus, they generate few or no funds which could be applied to
expanding service and improving the quality of service. This and
limitations on Central Government funds are one of the sector's most
serious constraints.
2.14     The largest municipalities' demonstrations of ability to charge
and collect amounts close to long run marginal costs of their water and
sewerage services should be persuasive, eventually, to other municipalities
to attempt to do the same. With a-rerage charges at such levels, the
largest municipalities have means of self-financing their investments in
the sector so that they may fully serve their citizene by the late 1990's.



-6-
2.15     A second constraint, which is related to funding limitations, is
the practice of overprogramming and overcontracting by the sector's
national agencies. Iller Bank and the DSI are compelled under widespread
political pressure to program more projects for municipalities, and to
award more contracts, than can be efficiently carried out within overall
funding limitations. This causes significant economic losses through:
(i) inefficiency due to work slowdowns and stopping and restarting after
periods of inactivity because of insufficient funds; and (ii) the tying up
of capital in delayed, unfinished work. Although the problem is recognized
by the authorities, prospects for improvement appear so far to be poor.
2.16     The lack of local technical and administrative capability for
development in the sector increasingly will become a third important
constraint. Local authorities who in the past relied on the sector's two
national agencies for sector planning and project administration (as well
as funding) will have to build local capability as they take over
responsibilities for their development needs in the sector. Valuable
assistance in building capability should be available to local authorities
from the two national agencies, the national technical universities, local
consulting firms, and the water and sewerage administrations of the largest
municipalities which already have made the change from reliance on the
Central Government to self-reliance.
Previous World Bank Involvement in the Sector
2.17     The Bank made a US$37 million loan to the Government in 1972 for
the Istanbul Water Supply Project (Loan 844-TU), which was completed in
1981. The Project included expansions of water treatment, transmission,
pumping and distribution systems for the Istanbul metropolitan area. The
Project Performance Audit Report (No. 4853, issued in 1983), concluded that
the main project objectives were achieved; water production was increased
to the levels anticipated at the time of appraisal, and a reorganization of
the sector was achieved through the creation of the Istanbul Water Supply
and Sewerage General Directorate (ISKI). In 1982, a loan of US$88.1
million was made by the Bank for the Istanbul Sewerage Project (Loan
2159-TU) to improve sewerage and sewage disposal facilities, and to
increase the proportion of the City's population to be served by sewerage.
Project works implementation has been satisfactory, and 99% of the loan had
been disbursed as of February 1989. The Project is eliminating discharges
into the Golden Horn and Sea of Marmara amounting to about 30 percent of
Istanbul's wastewater, and an industrial pollution control program has been
put into operation.
2.18     Loan 2888-TU of US$218 million equivalent was approved in December
1987 for US$570 million equivalent of additional water supply, sewerage,
and sewage treatment works for Istanbul. All of the Project's major
sewerage and sewage treatment facilities have been designed, and
construction contracts so far awarded amount to approximately 252 of the
estimated total cost of the Project.
2.19     Loan 2818-TU of US$184 million was approved in May 1987 for a
water and sewerage project for Izmir (estimated total cost of US$522
million). An authority, IZSU, similar to ISKI, was established to



implement the Project and manage water and sewerage operations. All of the
Project's major works except the water treatment plant have finished
designs, and equipment supply and works construction contracts awarded to
date amount to approximately 34% of the estimated total cost of the Project.
2.20     ISKI and IZSU began experiencing severe financial difficulties
during 1988 because their tariffs were not being adjusted to meet rising
costs during a period of inflation exceeding 702 annually, and, in ISKI's
case, because difficulties were experienced in billing and collection                 r
operations during a transition from the use by ISKI of a contract service
company for these operations to a system established within the ISKI
organization. ISKI's billing problems now are largely solved, its
collections are improving, and it increased its tariffs approximately 70?
on average in December 1988 and 50% on average in June 1989. Its average
tariff now is slightly more than its long run marginal cost. ISZU's tariff
average increased approximately 110% effective July 1989, to a level of
about 90% of its long run marginal cost. IZSU is, however, facing
increasing difficulty in implementing the Izmir Project because of delay in
the provision of funds committed to the Project by the Izmir Municipality.
Also, components of the Project being implemented for IZSU by the Iller
Bank and DSI have been delayed by Government funding limitations.
2.21     An Engineering Loan of US$9.2 million for water supply and
sewerage studies for the Cukurova Region (Loan 2537-TU), was made in 1985.
Thi.t was followed in May 1987 by Loan 2819-TU of US$120 million for a
municipal infrastructure project for the Cukurova Region (estimated cost of
US$467 million), 47 percent of which is for water and sewerage. An
authority similar to ISKI has been established for the largesc city
involved, Adana, and operationally autonomous water departments are being
established in four other towns in the Region. The Cukurova Project also
aimed to build up the capacity of Iller Bank as a financial intermediary,
and to that end established a unit within Iller Bank to appraise and
monitor municipal infrastructure works in the Cukurova Area. The Project
is having a slow start, and at present is under review by the Government
and the Bank regarding possibilities for improving its administrative
arrangements and modifying various components. Total World Bank lending
under the ongoing loans for the urban sector in Turkey including water
supply and sanitation is US$522 million.
Justification for World Bank Lending
2.22     The first of the three main elements of the Bank's lending
strategy for the sector in Turkey is to support the Government's objectives
of:  (i) reducing inadequacies in water and sewerage infrastructure in the
most cost-effective way possible, while also enabling the provision of
affordable services to low income consumers; and (ii) protecting the
environment against pollution from domestic and industrial wastes. The
second element of the strategy is to support the Government's policies for
sector decentralization, local resource mobilization, and cost recovery,
through assistance to autonomous water and sewerage organizations in
municipalities which have strong self-financing potential, including,
eventually, in medium-size cities. The third element of the strategy is to
support the Government's objective of providing critically needed water and



sewerage facilities in coastal locations which are important for the
Country's tourism industry and for regional environmental interests.
Lending for the proposed project is justified for reasons one and two
above, and is of partict¶lar importance because of Ankara being the national
capital and Country's second largest city.
III. THE BORROWER
Introduction
3.01     The proposed borrower, implementing agency, and operating
organization for the Project is the Ankara Water and Sewerage
Administration (ASKI) of the Ankara Metropolitan Municipality. ASKI was
formed by combining water supply and sewerage staff and assets from
existing service organ_zations within the Greater Municipal Area into a
separate, autonomous, administratively self-sufficient organization
authorized by Law No. 3305 of June 5, 1986, anti defined by Law No. 2560
approved November 20, 1981, which was amended by Law No. 3009, May 23, 1984
(para. 2.11).
3.02     ASKI is responsible for the development and operation of all
public water supply and sewerage for the metropolitan area eYcept its water
sources outside the area which are developed and in some cases operated by
DSI. ASKI receives water from surface reservoirs and well fields with a
yield of approximately 780,000 m3 per day. In 1988, it distributed water
through 430,000 connections to approximately 2.2 million persons in an area
totalling about 185 km2, and handled the collection of sewage from 365,000
connections.
Organization and Staffing
3.03     ASKI is administered by:
(i)    a General Assembly consisting of the Metropolitan Municipal
Council;
(ii)   a six-member Board of Directors, with the Mayor as
Chairman, which reports to the General Assembly; and
(iii) a General Director who is the Board's Vice Chairman and the
chief executive officer responsible for day-to-day
operations.
The General Director is supported by three Assistant Gencral Directors:
one for Operations (all water supply and sewerage, including electrical and
mechanical operations); one for Planning and Construction; and one for
Finance and Administration. He also has a staff of advisors and small,
specialized departments (e.g., Legal Department; Annex 1).
3.04     The General Assembly approves ASKI's investment plans and annual
budgets, staffing, tariffs and borrowings. The Board of Directors approves
operating principles and regulations, matters to be submitted for final



- 9 -
approval by the General Assembly, and appointments of senior officials and
staff other than the General Director and Assistant General Directors. The
General Director is appointed by the Central Government (Ministry of
Interior) upon nomination by the Mayor. The Assistant General Directors
and Department Heads are nominated by the General Director and approved by
the Mayor of Ankara. Board Members, the General Director, and the
Assistants are required under the ASKI Law to have professional
qualifications and experience in their fields.
3.05     ASKI's 2,910 employees include 93 management and senior advisory
staff, 167 engineers and technicians, 248 accounting and commercial
operations staff, 549 other office workers, and 1,853 unskilled and
semi-skilled service and maintenance workers. The total number of
employees gives ratios of approximately 6.8 employees per 1,000 water
connections (one employee for every 768 persons served), and 8.0 employees
per 1,000 sewerage connections. (ASKI also provides a cesspit emptying
service to households not connected to the sewerage system.) These ratios
are satisfactory for organizations of this type. Staffing plans are
prepared annually, and recruitment procedures are satisfactory. Staff
turnover is low.
Training
3.06     ASKI conducts on the job training for its employees in operations,
maintenance, and administrative functions. Responsibility fcr planning and
administration of training is decentralized to each ASKI department except
for overseas and other external training administered centrally by ASKI's
senior management through the Personnel Department. ASKI also is receiving
training assistance by means of "twinning" with the Stuttgart Water Company
sponsored by the German Government through the KfW. Selected ASKI staff
are sent to Stuttgart on training work assignments, and Stuttgart
specialists visit Ankara to support ASKI.
3.07     ASKI considers its training activities for the most part to be
satisfactory, but the subject is undergoing detailed analysis and
evaluation by specialist consultants engaged with Kuwait Fund financing
(para. 4.05). The consultants are to provide by late 1989 their report and
recommendations for an expanded program of training, which program could be
suitable for financing in part from the proposed loan from the Bank (para.
5.19).
Accounting and Auditing
3.08     ASKI maintains accounts which are separate from those of the
Ankara Metropolitan Municipality, and which in part are oriented
commercially. Accounting operations have been computerized since 1987, but
manual accounting is running in parallel while experience with the new
system is building. Important deficiencies in the accounts are the lack of
fixed asset registers (currently being developed), the lack of fixed asset
accounts for sewerage and drainage facilities constructed prior to ASKI's
formation in 1987, and the lack of fixed asset revaluation accounts
reflecting inflation, which has been and continues to be high, rendering
the original value accounts for fixed assets virtually useless for purposes
of financial management.



- 10 -
3.09     ASKI recently obtained a review and recommendations by consultants
on its accounting and financial reporting, which confirm the above pcints
and also identify other deficiencies and advisable corrective measures,
including appropriate training. The consultant concluded in addition that
implementation of the improvements would not be possible without expansion
of ASKI's computing/data processing capabilities, although this particular
aspect was not analyzed in detail. ASKI has agreed to correct by December
31, 1990 identified deficiencies in its accounting and financial reporting,
including the revaluation of its assets, and provisions have been made in
the project and financing plan for related technical assistance, training,
and computer capacity expansion (para. 5.18).
3.10     ASKI's accounts and financial statements are audited by its
internal auditor, whose report is submitted to ASKI's General Assembly, the
Metropolitan Municipal Council. The accounts and financial statements are
reviewed also, together with the report of the internal auditor, by the
Account Examination Commission of the Metropolitan Municipality, the
Municipality's independent auditing authority, which reports its findings
to the Municipal Council.  The most recent report of the internal auditor
concluded that ASKI's 1987 financial statements are consistent with ASKI's
1987 accounts and that the accounts were correctly maintained.  The report
of the Account Examination Commission indicates that the Commission accepts
key figures presented in the 1987 financial statements, although the
Commission does not include an auditor's statement of opinion ir its
report. The combination of the two reports does not cover the full audit
scope and detail normally requested by the Bank, but it is considered by
the appraisal to be sufficient to recommend acceptance by the Bank for the
purpose of initiating lending with a new borrower.
3.11     Notwithstanding the conclusion above that the existing audit
reports may be relied upon by the Bank at this time, ASKI has agreed to
obtain independent audits in the future, beginning with the 1989 accounts
and financial statements, according to the standards normally requested by
the Bank of its borrowers.
Billing and Collection
3.12     ASKI's sales are metered and billed every two months.  The billing
is computerized and satisfactory. Collection from residential, commercial,
and industrial customers is strictly administered with good results.
Collection from municipal and Central Government agencies, schools,
hospitals, and other public organizations is, however, a serious problem,
accounting for the bulk of ASKI's overdue receivables. ASKI has agreed to
reduce its receivables during 1990 to the equivalent of two months of
billings (para. 6.06), and the Government has stated that it will follow up
so that the objective will be achieved.
Industrial Wastewater Management
3.13     ASKI is responsible for monitoring and control of industrial
liquid waste discharges within Ankara according to the ASKI establishment
law, the national environmental law, and the law and recently approved
regulations of the Ankara Municipality. The latter are patterned on
monitoring and control regulations of Istanbul and Izmir which have been
considered satisfactory.



- 11 -
3.14     The regulations require registration by firms; sampling and
analysis of discharges; construction by a firm (or firms) of a treatment
facility where necessary to reduce pollutants to required standards
(generally to concentrations equal to or less than domestic waste), or, as
an alternative, payment of concentration-related and volume-related
surcharges to ASKI if standards are not to be met; and imposition of fines
and shutdown of operation in cases of certain highly toxic pollutants if
untreated.  ASKI has a newly obtained testing laboratory and is beginning
testing (para. 5.31).  After accumulating appropriate data on the wastes in
question, ASKI will finalize standards to be applied, and its regulations
will come fully into effect. ASKI has agreed to put into effect and begin
to implement by December 31, 1990 regulations and standards acceptable to
the Bank.
Insurance
3.15     ASKI has agreed to maintain appropriate insurance against fire,
other forms of damage, theft, and potential liabilities; and to require its
suppliers and contractors to obtain adequate insurance for assets of the
proposed project, and against risks related to its implementation.
IV. PROJECT AREA, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND
Project Area
4.01     The project area, the area of the Greater Municipality of Ankara
and surrounding districts, is in and around the valleys of four major
creeks and the Ankara River into which the creeks drain. The area has a
relatively mild climate and an annual average rainfall of 350 mm; and
severe weather conditions occur rarely. Average temperatures in the
coldest and warmest months are -0.2°C (January) and 23.2°C (July). As the
city grew, its development progressed onto surrounding hillsides, with the
present developed area of 19,840 ha extending from 785 m elevation to 1,280
m above sea level. The large variation in ground level causes problems in
the distribution of water and in the collection and disposal of rainwater
and sewage, and heavy thunderstorms sometimes result in damage.
4.02     The main residential and commercial areas are generally classified
either as planned areas (these include many residential and most commercial
areas) or unplanned, usually squatter/low income residential areas called
gecekondu (literally built overnight) areas. The latter make up
approximately 56 per cent of the City's residential/commercial area.
Further expansion of gecekondu areas is now largely prevented by Government
and municipal regulation. Recent development has been mainly in areas
designated as new development areas, in the form of multi-story apartments
usually built by co-operatives. Land availability is not a constraint to
planned development in the area, and residential developments both within
and nearby beyond the present city boundary are occupying about 600 new ha
per annum.



- 12 -
Existing and Planned Water Supply Facilities
4.03     Ankara's present water supply is from various groundwater sources
and four surface systems (Table 4.1).  An extensive distribution network
supplies about 93 per cent of the City's population. Most large industries
have their own supply source, usually groundwater. With the programs being
carried out to reduce wastage and leakage (paras 4.04, 4.05), the present
sources are capable of meeting year 2000 demand (257 million cu.m/annum).
A program of source development was prepared in 1985 by consultants (SUIS
Project Eng'neering and Consulting Ltd. Co.) for DSI. Table 4.1,
summarizes the consultants' 1985 proposals. A chart of water supply source
capacity and water demand is at Annex 3. With the indicated capacities,
the provision of adequate sewerage in the Ankara area would not be
constrained by the water system.

4.04     Work to expand and improve ASKI'S water distribution is being
carried out supported in part with financing by the KfW, Kuwait Fund and
European Resettlement Fund, and is presently scheduled to be completed by
1993. Leakage from water pipes and consumer connections is high, not only
due to the hilly terrain of the city resulting in high and fluctuating water
pressure, but because of the past use of steel pipes whose corrosion
protection was poor. Of the approximately 4,300 km of water distribution
pipelines and 440,000 consumer connections, some 2,300 km of pipeline and
80,000 service connections will be replaced under the program. Also, to



- 13 -
reduce high pressure in pipes (and hence bursts and leakage), it is intended
that the existing distribution network of 17 separate zones will be further
sub-divided into 34 zones supplied by 25 pumping stations (13 existing) and
53 distribution storage reservoirs (34 existing).
4.05     The pipe replacement program started in 1986 and is to be completed
in 1992. Also, technical assistance is being provided to ASKI through the
program in scheduling and control of construction, and in pipelaying
practices. In addition, under Kuwait Fund financing, consultants were engaged
in August 1988 to study: (i) future extension of the water distribution
network; and (ii) the organization of ASKI. With respect to the distribution
network, the consultants will review and update existing studies, and they
also will prepare detailed designs and carry out a comprehensive leakage
reduction program including related training of ASKI staff. For their study
of ASKI's organization, the consultants will review ASKI's institutional
capability and prepare a plan for strengthening ASKI (including training).
The consultant's studies are to be completed during the first quarter of
1990; design work and training will continue to 1992.
4.06     Unaccounted-for water in transmission and distribution of the total
amount produced at the sources is estimated to be about 42 per cent.
Restoration of 24-hour supply to most of the distribution svstem in 1988,
with the consequent increase in pressure duration, has resulted in increases
in leakage; this is being corrected gradually by the program of replacement
of defective pipes and consumer connections (para 4.04).   Leakage reduction
is expected after the detection and repair program gets under way, and the
distribution system is re-zoned to reduce pressures (paras 4.04, 4.05). By
1995, the unaccounted for water percentage is expected to be approximately 30
per cent.
Existing Sewerage and Drainage
4.07     It is estimated that 79 per cent of the population of Ankara is
served by some form of piped sewerage, but there is a lack of information,
particularly with respect to older sewers. Only separate sewerage and
drainage systems (i.e., foul and storm sewage conveyed in separate pipes) are
understood to have been constructed since 1969, but prior to that date,
combined sewers were installed in about 2,290 ha of the planned area of the
city. During heavy rainfall, the combined sewers overflow, causing
contaminated water to flow in the streets. Also, separate sewers constructed
in 256 ha during the late 1940s which serve the main commercial area of
Ankara are now overloaded.
4.08     Over 992 of the planned areas and 60% of the Gecekondu areas are
provided with sewers. About 40% of the gecekondu properties rely on septic
tanks. The quality of the sewers in the gecekondu areas is shown to be poor
by the many problems that occur. Most gecekondu sewers were laid by the
local residents using pipes supplied by the Municipality. Most were laid
without plans, and they often block and overflow. There are few manholes,
and maintenance is almost impossible.

4.09     None of the City's sewage is treated, and the majority of the sewers
discharge into the nearest water course or large, and in many cases open,
drain. All of the sewage reaches and flows openly in the Ankara River.
During dry weather, the flow in water courses in the area is mainly raw
sewage. During summer, the sewage causes significant odor, and fly and
mosquito problems, particularly in gecekondu areas.
4.10     For a city of Ankara's size, there is relatively little heavy
industry and industrial pollution. Water use by heavy industry in 1985 is
estimated to have been about 150,000 persons equivalent. There is,
nevertheless, a need for pre-treatment of effluent from a few industrial
plants. Industrial waste guidelines approved by the city in January 1989
provide the legal basis for ASK! to ensure that industries carry out
appropriate treatment before discharge of their wastes (para. 5.31).
4.11     Stormwater in built up areas of the City is taken care of mainly by
using streets as drains, and by providing collectors to channel flows from
streets to creeks and the Ankara River. The creeks accommodate most storms,
as DSI has upgraded their flow capacity to carry the theoretical peak
100-year storm. Most flooding that occurs is the result of rainwater runoff
from hill-sides before the water has reached the creeks.
4.12     Solid waste is collected satisfactorily and does not cause a problem
with respect to blocking sewers and drains.
Future Demand for Sewerage
4.13     Planning for the amounts and sizes of sewers and for the sewage
treatment facility to be installed by ASKI is based on estimates of
population growth, future per capita use of water (including commercial and
small industry use), large industry water use, the return factor (fraction of
water used which enters the sewers), an allowance for infiltration of
groundwater into the sewers, and the objectives set by ASKI for the districts
and percentages of the population which it intends to be able to serve. With
the projected population growth and plans for serving additional areas and
increasing percentages of the population, 140,000 new sewer connections and
912 km. of new network sewers are to be installed by the end of 1996 in the
proposed project. The volume of sewage to be treated, on average, by the end
of the year 2002, the capacity target date for the sewage treatment works to
be constructed in the project, is 8.9m3/sec. assuming that 882
of the water consumed by users having sewer connections flows into those
connections.



- 15 -
4.14     Total Population Growth.  Ankara's population grew from 1927 to 1975
at 6.0 percent per annum on average, from 1975 to 1980 at 2.3 percent, and
from 1980 to 1985 at 4.0 percent. In 1984-85, the Middle East Technical
University (METU) I' made a projection of future growth of the Greater
Ankara area and population, taking into account increases in land values and
saturation densities, givin- the population figures shown in the table
below. This projection has been used in making the sewage flow estimates for
the proposed project.

4.15     Districts and Population to be Served.  The present Metropolitan
Municipal boundary encompasses 70 Census districts. The METU projection was
for these 70 districts plus 29 surrounding districts in which most of the
growth of the Greater Ankara population is occurring and is expected to
continue to occ'-r. Of the 29 surrounding districts, it is not desirable to
include in the Project two which are not within the catchment area of the
proposed sewage treatment plant and two which are outside the entire catchment
area of the Ankara River.  For the 25 other outside districts, present value
analyses of the alternatives of connecting the sewerage system in each
district to the Ankara sewerage system, and of constructing localized
collection systems and treatment plants, show that connection to the Ankara
system would be the least cost. The Project, therefore, is based mainly on
development of sewerage in the 70 districts within the existing political
boundary, but with sizing of the collector and interceptor sewers to carry the
sevage flows from all 95 districts through the year 2025, by which time the
overall population growth rate is projected to have slowed to below 1.5% per
year and the population within the municipal boundary will have levelled off.

Also, it is planned by ASKI that with the Project, ASKI will provide sewers
connected to the ASKI system for eight of the 25 outlying districts in 1992,
and for another six in 1995. It is recommended that the signing of
appropriate local agreements for the provision of sewerage and sewage
treatment services by ASKI to the outlying districts included in the Project
should be a condition of disbursement from the proposed loan of funds for
constructing sewers in these districts.

4.16     Of the population within the Ankara political boundary (ASKI's
present service area), 932 are supplied with piped potable water by ASKI, and
this percentage is projected to increase to 972 by 1996. Under the Project,
the percentage of the population in the gecekondu areas to be provided with a
piped sewerage connection would be increased from 602 to 87 percent by 1996.
In addition, the unsatisfactory situation that exists with respect to
problems in the present served gecekondu areas would be reduced by the
Project through: (i) provision of manholes for maintenance; and (ii)
replacing about 25X of the existing sewers. The sewered percentage of 99% of
the 1.37 million population in the planned areas at present will remain
unchanged during the project period, but sewer replacements are to be made in
approximately 152 of the network sewers in the areas, and an additional 14%
will be benefitted by the separation of the at present combined sewers.
4.17     Roof drainage from most properties discharges onto the ground
adjacent to the property. This rainwater is in part absorbed by the ground,
and in part diverted to the nearest street. A particular problem in Ankara
is that many apartment buildings have the lowest unit built below the 'evel
of the street, and these units are at risk of flooding during thunderstorms.
As many of these apartments are in combined sewer areas (para 4.06), backups
of floodwater into them may contain raw sewage. About 18% of the present
city population resides in the 2,290 ha. of the City's planned area where
combined sewers will be replaced by separate sewers under the Project.
4.18     Flooding in Ankara is localised, but many residents of the City
suffer economic losses due to flooding. The losses vary depending on the
severity of the flood, from minor losses such as delays in travel, to major
losses from damage to property and sometimes loss of life.

4.19     Projected Per Capita Use of Water.  Per capita daily water
consumption in Ankara based on metered water sales of 118 liters excluding
well water use by major industries, is estimated to have averaged 124 liters
in 1988. Projections for future water consumption in the City have been made
taking into account trends and projections for the two other major cities,
Istanbul and Izmir, as shown below, and the fact that Ankara's use until
recently was suppressed due to source constraints. It is projected that by
the year 2025, the average use will reach 245 1/cd. This projection has been
used in sizing sewerage components of the proposed project.
Water Demand (1/cd)         Average Annual

a/ Includes 23 1/cd of well water for heavy industry.
4.20     The increase in Ankara would take place as part of the general trend
of improvement of living standards. The projection allows for projected
tariff increases (para 6.05), which would not be expected to have an
appreciable effect on demand because of the modest proportions of household
incomes which would be devoted to the services in question. It should be
noted, however, that in making financial and affordability analyses for the
Project, the possibility has been considered also that there might be little
or no further increase in per capita water demand (para 7.10).
V. THE PROJECT
Background
5.01     A water supply, sewerage, and drainage master plan for Ankara was
prepared in 1969 by a consortium of consultants, Camp (U.S.), Harris (U.S.),
and Mesara (Turkey).  The sewerage and drainage parts of the plan %ere
undated by BMB - United Engineering Office Ltd. (Turkey) in 1979, a.Ad the
water sources part in 1985 (para 4.03) by the SUIS Project Engineering and
Consulting Ltd. (Turkey). Progress has been made and is continuing on
implementing water supply improvements (paras 4.03 to 4.05). Ongoing and
planned investments in the water system during 1989-93 are expected to total
approximately US$335 million equiivalent, an average of US$67 million per
year. Also, following the 1979 updating of the master plan, small portions
of the sewage and drainage collector works and 6.0 km of the major
interceptor sewer (para 5.11) were constructed under the administration of
the Iller Bank; and DSI made improvements to major creeks in the city.



- 18 -
5.02     Most of the construction of the street network sewers and drainage
for new development areas has been carried out without consistent standards.
For some developments, public agencies financed and administered the
construction according to the standards of each, while for other
developments, private developers have provided sewers and drains. Few
records exist of the sewers and drains that have been laid. Mapping of
existing sewers and drains would therefore be carried out ear:y in the
proposed project.
5.03     In February 1988, the Government indicated to the Bank that the
provision of sewerage and drainage systems for Ankara had been given high
priority. The Government requested that the Bank begin working with ASKI
toward the possibility of providing Bank financing, and detailed preparation
of the proposed project began following an April 1988 request of the
Government for an advance of US$1.5 million equivalent from the Bank's
Project Preparation Facility.
5.04     A joint venture of Lavalin/CH2M Hill/Temel (L/C/T) consultants
(Canadian/ US/local) was employed in September 1988 to update the 1969/1979
master plan. At the same time, the KfW, which plans to finance the supply
and installation of electrical and mechanical equipment for the sewage
treatment pLAnt, financed the preparation of a pre-feasibility study of the
treatment plant by consultants, GKW Consult/Su Yapi (Germany/Turkey).  The
L/C/T joint venture consultants submitted a draft final report in December
1988 and a revised draft in March 1989. The GKW/Su Yapi report and
recommendations on the sewage treatment plant were submitted in April 1989.
As a result of the recommondations of these reports combined with existing
plans tor the water systet, ASKI's total investment program for 1989-96 has
been increased to approxi. tely US$990 million equivalent, including the
proposed project total of US$556.8 million equivalent (para. 5.20).
Project Obiectives
5.05     The main objectives of the Project are to provide new facilities and
to rehabilitate existing ones to bring about environmental improvements and
reduce health hazards in the Greater Ankara area by:
(i)    eliminating the dischargc of untreated sewage to the Ankara
River and its tributari4s;
(ii)    extending sewerage service to approximately 850,000 persons and
improving the present sewerage service to approximately 500,000
persons (of which approximately 500,000 and 300,000,
respectively, are low income persons); and
(iii)    reducing flooding in parts of the City that flood during heavy
rainstorms.
In addition, technical assistance and training would be providec to ASKI to
strengthen the institution's capability to carry out its expanding operations.

Rationale for World Bank Support for the Project
5.06     With the proposed loan, the Bank would continue its support for
decentralization of sector development responsibilities; establishment of
strong local sector authorities; improvement of local resource mobilization
and cost recovery, and thereby obtaining reeaction of lIcal dependence on
central government resources; implementation of least cost solutions;
provision of affordable sewerage service to low income customers; and
protection of the environment against pollution from industrial wastes and
domestic sewage. The Bank has been carrying out this approach successfully in
projects in Istanbul and in Izmir. It is the success of the water and
sewerage authority, ISKI, established in 1981 in Istanbul in connection with
financing from the Bank, that led to the establishment of ASKI and similar
organizations in Izmir and Adana. ISK1 is demonstrating both the value of
using a separate, autonomous organization to develop and operate city water
and sewerage systems, and the potential of the municipality to self-finance
the bulk of its investment requirements in the sector. Of particular
importance in the case of Bank support for Ankara are: (i) the encouragement
of local resource mobilization for the Project's local currency requirements,
which it is believed would be addressed to the extent needed only if
sufficient foreign currency would be available; (ii) the Bank's influence on
the quality of the Project's design and implementation; and (iii) the Bank's
influence on implementation timeliness by assisting the authorities toward
expeditious action.
Project Description
5.07     The components of the Project are outlined below and indicated on
IBRD Maps Nos. 21862, 21876 and 21905.
A. Sewage Collection
(i)    Construction of network sewers (0.2 - 0.5 m. dia) for:  new
development areas within the existing city boundary (593.4 km
length); new development areas outside of the boundary (169.3 km
length); existing gecekondu areas (318.2 km of new sewers and
342.7 km of replacement sewers); change of the existing combined
system to a separate system (377.7 km length); and replacement
of parts of the existing system in planned areas (178.7 km
length). In addition about 7,100 new manholes would be
provided, and 2,700 manholes would be reconstructed.
(ii)    Construction of five major collector sewers (102.7 km length;
0.5-2.0 m. dia) and two pumping stations to pump sewage from the
outlying areas of Golbasi (0.25 cu m/sec. pumping capacity) and
Yenikent (0.18 cu. m/sec. pumping capacity); and
(iii)    Construction of two major interceptors comprising the Southern
Interceptor (27.0 km length; 2.4-4.0 m dia) and the Northern
interceptor (6.6 km length; 0.5-1.4 m dia).



- 20 -
B. Sewage Treatment
(i)    Construction of tanks for grit removal, the initial step of the
treatment process;
(ii)    Acquisition of land for the treatment plant (130-135 ha).
(iii)    Construction of a biological sewage treatment plant to treat a
flow of up to 17.8 cu.m./sec., twice the projected average dry
weather flow in the year 2002. Using the activated sludge
treatment process, the plant would comprise tanks and equipment
for primary sedimentation, aeration, settling, and sludge
digestion. Following sludge digestion, the sludge would be
concentrated in drying beds.
C. Drainage
(i)    Construction of collector drains (41.0 km of 0.5-2.0 dia
pipelines and 4.8 km of 2 m x 2m box culverts).
D. Other
Mi)    1 to 1,000 scale digital (computerized) mapping of ASKI's
service area and sewage treatment plant site, including data
collection and recording of the existing sewerage and drainage
systems;
(ii)    acquisition of operation and maintenance vehicles and equipment,
including equipment for television inspection of sewers; and
(iii)    technical assistance and training to strengthen the
Institutional capabilities of ASKI, including its capabilities
for operation and maintenance of sewerage and drainage systems.
5.08     Sewerage - The network and collecter sewers of the Project would
provide capacity to meet sewage flows thr-ough the year 2025. For reasons of
accessibility for cleaning, the diameter of the network sewers is to be at
least 0.2m; approximately 80 percent of the network sewers are this diameter.
A present value analysis of alternatives for sizing and staging the larger
network and collector sewers has shown that there is no advantage in staging
their construction.
5.09     The network sewers included would: (i) meet the need for such sewers
for new development areas through 1996 comprising 2,910 ha. within the present
city boundary and 830 ha. outside the boundary; (ii) expand sewerage coverage
by 2,270 ha. in existing gecekondu areas and hence increase the population
served in the areas from 60 percent in 1988 to 87 percent in 1996; (iii)
provide a separate system in the 2,290 ha of the urban area presently served
by a combined sewerage/drainage system; and (iv) replace defective existing
sewers in about 25% (1,680 ha) of the gecekondu areas presently served, and
about 15% (880 ha) of the planned areas. Also, there would be improvements to
existing network sewers through provision of 7,100 manholes in gecekondu
areas, reconstruction of about 2,700 manholes in planned areas, and relief to
the presently overloaded system serving the central business district by
laying an additional collector (1.0 km of 0.8m dia).



- 21 -
5.10     The planned collector sewers have been sized to ensure that the
sewage flows from the network sewers will be conveyed safely to the two major
interceptor sewers. Six major collectors would be constructed: Incesu
(1.2-2.0 m dia); Hatip (1.0-2.0 m dia); Baglum (1.0-1.8 m dia); Macun (0.5-0.7m
dia); Yenibent/Saray (0.5-1.0m dia). Also, 14 smaller collectors (0.5-0.9m
dia) would be constructed. Pumping stations on the Incesu and Ova Creek
collectors would pump sewage from the Golbasi and baray/Yenikent areas.
5.11     Two major interceptors, both to be located adjacent to and parallel
to the Ankara River, are to be provided to convey the sewage from the
collectors to the sewage treatment plant. Of the two interceptors, the one
south of the Ankara River will carry most of the flow and will have a length
of 33.0 km. Iller Bank awarded a contract in 1983 for construction of 14.0 km
of 3.0 m dia pipeline of this interceptor, but only 6.0 km have been
constructed because of funding limits. There are defects in the construction
requiring corrections which will be carried out by ASKI. Even with the
corrections, however, the 6.0 km section will be capable of carrying only year
2005 flows. The balance of the 1983 contract for the 8.0 km of interceptor
remaining to be constructed has been cancelled. The purpose of the Northern
Interceptor is to avoid the need for six crossings of the Ankara River by
collector sewers that would require frequent, costly maintenance.
5.12     Based on a present value analysis of alternatives, the least cost
arrangement of the interceptors would be:

Total  =       33.0 km
Northern Interceptor         6.6 km          0.5-1.4m       2025
Additional parallel sections will have to be added to expand the middle
section of the Southern Interceptor in the year 2005, and the urban area
section in the year 2010. This has been determined to be the least cost
solution as compared to building the full 2025-year capacity now.
5.13.    Sewage Treatment:  To minimize pumping near to or at the end of the
Southern Interceptor, 11.0 km of the Interceptor ending at the treatment plant
would be a pressurized inverted syphon. In order to reduce operational
problems in the pressurized section, preliminary treatment of the sewage
comprising bar screens and grit tanks sized to meet 2010 flows would be
provided before the section.



- 22 -
5.14     The sewage treatment plant would consist of a conventional activated
sludge secondary treatment system to produce a high quality effluent at BOD
and suspended solids standards of 30 mg per liter. The plant would have a
capacity to treat the projected year 2002 average dry weather flow of 8.9 cu m
per sec and peak flow of 17.8 cu m per sec. The GKW Consult/Su Yapi analysis
of alternative treatment processes including aerated waste stabilization ponds
and trickling filters, determined the activated sludge treatment process to be
the best technical and least cost choice. The plant would be close to
self-sufficient in meeting its energy requirements through generation of power
by sludge digestion. Effluent from the plant is to be discharged to the
Ankara River, and the sewage sludge, after digestion and settling, will be a
suitable soil conditioner and is to be made available to farmers. The River
will again contain oxygenated water and will be able to support aquatic life,
and will be usable for limited irrigation (i.e., for trees and foods to be
consumed cooked). The Sakarya River into which the Ankara River flows, and
the Sariyar Reservoir into which the Sakarya flows, will again become usable
for unrestricted irrigation.
5.15     Drainage - The drainage works to be provided in the Project would
supplement existing drains and reduce the chance of flooding during heavy
rainstorms (the flooding threshold would be reached with peak storms at a
frequency of 2 years in residential and low value commercial areas, and 5
years in high value industrial and commercial areas). The works are to be for
high priority areas, and comprise 41.0 km of 0.5-2.0 dia pipelines and 4.8 km
of 2.Om X 2.Om box culverts.
5.16     Other - Computerized mapping at a scale 1:1,000 of Ankara, the
outlying areas to be sewered under the Project, and the sewage treatment plant
area would be carried out under the Project. Sewers and drains would be
located and plotted on the maps in a computerized, digital format that allows
easy retrieval and updating of data.
5.17     Engineering consultants would assist ASKI in the detailed  design and
construction supervision of the project works (para 5.24).
5.18     Operation and maintenance  equipment would be provided to enable ASKI
to efficiently monitor, operate and maintain its sewerage and drainage
systems. Some of the equipment is required now to replace worn out equipment,
and the purchase of other equipment will be scheduled later as needs increase
with the expansion of the ASKI system. Expansion of computer equipment will
be included. A list of the equipment is in Annex 4.
5.19     Training of ASKI staff will be obtained under the design and
construction supervision contracts, and the equipment contracts. In addition,
the Project includes technical assistance and training to strengthen ASKI in
billing and collection, management controls and systems, and contract
administration.
Project Cost
5.20     The Project's cost is estimated at $556.8 million equivalent
(excluding interest during construction); the estimated foreign currency
portion is US$256.4 million equivalent (46% of the total). ASKI must pay a



- 23 -
ten percent value added tax on its purchases other than land, and estimated
value added tax totalling US$50.4 million equivalent is included. No
allowance for duties and import taxes is included in the estimated cost
because ASKI is exempt. The estimated costs of engineering include US$0.50
million already spent under the World Bank PPF advance provided to ASKI
through the Government to obtain consultant assistance in preparing the
project (para 5.03). Professional man-months of consulting services other
than those for the sewage treatment plant, which are to be financed by the
KfW, are estimated at 1,800 man-months, of which approximately 772 would be
local consultants. The price estimates used in making the cost estimates have
been obtained from existing contracts for similar works in Turkey, and from
data and quotations from contractors and suppliers.
5.21     The cost estimate is summarized in Table 5.1.  Base costs are in
January 1, 1989 prices. The total amount includes physical contingencies of
US$69.2 million (15 percent of base costs for equipment, materials and civil
works) and price contingencies of $55.0 million (about 11 percent of the base
cost plus physical contingencies. The assumed annual rates of inflation of US
dollar prices are 8.4% for 1989, 0.2% for 1990, 1.71 for 1991, 2.2% for 1992,
3.5% for 1993, 5.4X for 1994, and 5.51 for 1995 and 1996. A further breakdown
of costs is presented in Annex 6. More detailed figures are in the Project
File.

5.22     The proposed loan of US$173.0 million equivalent would finance an
estimated 31 percent of the cost of the Project. It is intended that parallel
financing in the form of a KfW mixed credit ror US$91.9 million equivalent
would finance the cost of the mechanical and electrical equipment for the
sewage treatment plant and the detailed engineering design of the plant
(para. 6.03). It has been agreed by ASKI that the allocation by the German
Government of the mixed credit funds (expected by January 1990) is to be a
condition of Loan Agreement Effectiveness of the proposed World Bank loan, and
that the subsequent effectiveness of the KfW financing agreement by December
31, 1990, or the arrangement of alternative financing satisfactory to the Bank
by that date, is to be a condition of the loan. The balance of the Project's
cost, estimated at US$291.9 million, would be financed from charges to
customers. The proposed project financing sources and amounts are summarized
below.

Prolect Implementation
5.23     The Project will be managed by a Project Implementation Unit headed
by a Director who at present is the Director of ASKI's Planning Department for
Sewerage (Annex 1). The Project would be the only responsibility of the
Director. The Project Implementation Unit will have qualified staff, and the
Director is experienced. ASKI plans to obtain engineer specialists from local
consulting firms to assist working within the Unit. It is estimated that
about 180 man-months of specialist consultant services will be required during
1990-95.
5.24     Design, provision of assistance in evaluation of bids, and
construction supervision of the sewerage, sewage treatment, drainage and
maintenance equipment components of the Project would be carried out by
consultants. Consultants would be selected according to the Bank's Guidelines
for the detailed design of the sewerage system and drainage works, and
according to KfW procedures for the sewage treatment plant. These or other
consultants, in due course, would be engaged to supervise the construction.
For the mapping, including the collection and recording of data on existing
sewers and drains (para 5.16), firms will be invited to submit proposals in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, and it is expected that work will
commence during the first quarter of 1990. Preparation of terms of reference,
proposal evaluation, and award of contracts for consultant services and
technical assistance and tr&ining would be carried out by the Project
Implementation Unit.
5.25     The Project Implementation Unit would also have responsibility for
monitoring project expenditures, preparirg requests for loan disbursements,



- 25 -
and preparing reports on progress, in addition to its responsibilities for
overall project management and coordination.
5.26     It is anticipated that the project work  and equipment supply
contracts would be implemented through 19 contracts (Annex 8). Recruitment of
the consultants for the detailed design of the sewerage components of the
Project is under way and should be completed during early 1990. Contracts for
the supply of sewer pipes and the first of the network sewer contracts should
be awarded within the third quarter of 1990. Final designs of the collectors,
pumping stations and interceptors should be completed by end 1990. The design
of 752 of the network sewers will be completed by the end of 1991, and the
remaining network design will be carried out up to 1996 in phase with
expansion of the urban area. Consultants for the detailed design of the
sewage treatment plant would be recruited under KfW procedures by late 1989 or
early 1990. The design should be completed by the end of 1990. Terms of
reference for technical assistance and training will be prepared by late 1990
based on the resilts of a consultant's review and analysis of the
institutional capabilities of ASKI (para 4.05). The planned Project
completion date is December 31, 1996. The project implementation schedule is
at Annex 7.
Land Acquisition
5.27     ASKI has begun the process leading to expropriation of the 130-135
ha. of land need for the sewage treatment facility (para 5.14). The site is
located beside and along approximately 2 km of the Ankara River, starting at a
point 11 km beyond and downstream from the present western boundary of the
City. The site is uninhabited farmland.
5.28     ASKI's Board of Directors has requested that the Governor of Ankara
Province make the required decision for the expropriation process that the
land is needed in the public interest for a sewage treatment facility. The
Governor's decision is expected during 1989, following which an official
assessmert of prices is to be made by a committee to be appointed by the
Governor. The prices would be the opening basis for the acquisition, and are
expected to be set during 1989.
5.29     Under the expropriation law, ASKI would then deposit funds according
to the assessment prices into accounts for the landowners, at which point ASKI
could take possession of the land. It is understood, however, that in
practice, ASKI would take possession only after the landowner accepted the
funds, or after any court dispute over the matter would be resolved in ASKI's
favor. ASKI anticipates that the prices to be determined by the assessment
committee would not be accepted by some or perhaps any of the landowners, and
that a court settlement which would become necessary would award substantially
higher prices. For this reason, it has been assumed in the cost estimates and
financing plan for the oroject that ASKI ultimately will be required to pay
US$20,000 equivalent per hectare, even though it is understood that comparable
land, but on a smaller scale, recently was sold for less than US$10,000
equivalent per hectare.
Industrial Wastewater
5.30     Industrial wastewater discharges in Ankara are not large for a city
of its size, representing the equivalent of 150,000 persons, about 62 of the



- 26 -
present population. It is projected that by the year 2025, wastewater from
industries will increase to the equivalent of 460,000 persons, then about
9 percent of the projected total sewer flow. None of the 14 major industrial
firms in the area now carry out full treatment of their wastewater. In order
not to have a damaging effect on the sewage treatment process, four of the
industrial plants would need to pretreat for various toxic substances before
discharge to ASKI sewers.
5.31     To enable ASKI to control industrial discharges, the City in January
1989 approved regulations for the control of discharges to ASKI's sewers
(paras. 3.13 and 3.14). A division for monitoring sewage discharges has been
established in the Planning Department. Under KfW financing, equipment for a
monitoring laboratory has been provided, and laboratory staff are being
trained by consultants.
Maintenance
5.32     ASKI carries out sewer maintenance with work crews organized
according to five geographic areas within the Greater Municipality. At
present, the number of crews is insufficient, and the majority of the
personnel need additional training. In addition, the crews lack modern
equipment, and most existing sewers in the gecekondu areas do not have
sufficient manholes to permit periodic inspection and preventive maintenance.
The crews conduct maintenance (mainly debris removal and repair of breakage)
in about half of the city, but it is done inefficiently because of the
training and equipment limitations, and is carried out usually in response to
emergencies.
5.33     ASKI's recruitment and training are now emphasizing strengthening
maintenance staff. The proposed Project will support up to date maintenance
training and the provision of maintenance equipment. The Project also
includes the mapping of presently unmapped as well as all new sewers and
drains (para. 5.16), and the provision of adequate numbers of manholes on all
existing sewers (para. 5.09). As these features are being introduced,
increased preventive maintenance will be carried out, eventually extending to
the entire sewerage and drainage systems. Regular inspections of large
diameter sewers by means of remote control television units will be made, and
for all sewers, preventive flushing and cleaning out will be undertaken.
Proiect Related Training
5.34     ASKI has a training division within the Personnel Department.  Some
training of ASKI junior staff is carried out by the division. Training of
senior staff has been largely through secondment to experienced water supply
organizations outside Turkey. To date, most training has been on an ad-hoc
basis. The only systematic training has been by a training unit of
consultants under KfW financing for junior staff in pipelaying and leakage
detection.
5.35     The need for the introduction of programs of systematic training for
all levels of staff is recognized by ASKI. Consequently the terms of
reference of the consultants provided under Kuwait financing (para 4.05)
include the task of designing of a training program for ASKI. The design
should be completed by mid 1990. A provision is included in the proposed loan
to assist in financing the training program.

Procurement
5.36     Procurement arrangements are stunmarized in Table 5.3.  An estimated
US$6.7 million equivalent of goods would be procured through internationai
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines.
US$94.4 million equivalent of goods financed by the KfW would be procured
through KfW bidding procedures. The remainder would be US$0.5 million
equivalent of low cost items of operation and maintenance equipment to be
procured through international and local shopping for contracts not to exceed
US$150,000 equivalent. An estimated US$373.9 million equivalent of the civil
works would be for the main sewage collectors and drainage and network sewers
to be procured through ICB in accordance with World Bank Guidelines. An
estimated additional US$44.9 million equivalent of sewage treatment plant
civil works financed by ASKI would be procured through local procedures-
An estimated US$2.5 million equivalent of new manholes and rehabilitated
manholes in existing sewers would be procured through LCB-'. The use of LCB
is considered to be appropriate because of the lack of interest of foreign
contractors in contracts such as these because of inability to underbid
Turkish contractors. Consultants for design, construction supervision, and
technical assistance are being/would be engaged in accordance with the World
Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, and with KfW procedures.

Local procurement procedures used by ASKI and LCB procedures used
throughout Turkey are generally consistent with the need for economy and
efficiency in the execution of the proposed Project. There are, however,
a few LCB procedures which are inconsistent with the Procurement
Guidelines of the World Bank, and there are others which require
clarification. The Government and ASKI agreed during Loan Negotiations
on the changes needed to make the procedures acceptable to the Bank.

5.37     KfW financing of US$91.9 million equivalent would be provided based
on estimates totalling this avAount for foreign currency costs for the sup_ly
and installation of electrical and mechanical equipment (US$94.4 million
including VAT) for the sewage treatment plant, and the cost of consultants for
the design and construction supervision for the plant (US$6.7 million
including VAT). The equipment suppliers and the consultants would be German.
The equipment suppliers would be selected through competitive bidding
according to KfW procedures.
5.38     Contracts with an estimated aggregate value of UJS$6.7 million for the
supply of sewer maintenance equipment are likely to be won by foreign
manufacturers since these items are not presently manufactured in Turkey.
Contracts for items of equipment with an estimated aggregate value of US$0.5
million are expected to be won by local manufacturers. Qualifying local
manufacturers would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of
the CIF price or the prevailing import duty, whichever is less. Civil works
contracts with an estimated value of US$373.9 million equivalent are likely to
be won in ICB by local contractors who, in recent years, have been difficult
to underbid in Turkey. Consulting contracts with an estimated total value of
US$28.5 million equivalent (including an estimated US$6.7 million equivalent
for the KfW-financed consultants for the sewage treatment plant) are expected
to be won by foreign consultants in joint ventures with local consultants.
The remaining US$2.6 million is the estimated cost of the land for the sewage
treatment plant.

5.39     Tender documents and proposed awards for goods having an estimated
contract value of more than Us$500,000 equivalent and for civil works having
an estimated value of more than US$1,000,000 equivalent would be subject to
prior review by the Bank. Contracts for lesser amounts would be subject to



- 29 -
ex-post review. These limits would result in prior review of contracts
representing about 95 percent of the procurement total amount to be financed
by the proposed loan.
Disbursements
5.40     Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made for:
(a)    38 percent of expenditures for sewerage civil works;
(b)    100 percent of foreign expenditures and exfactory local
expenditures, and 65 percent of other local expenditures, for
goods; and
(c)    100 percent for consultants and overseas training.
5.41     Withdrawal applications would be supported by standard documentation
with the exception of applications in cases of local currency expenditures for
contracts valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent, which will be submitted
on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE). Use of the SOE procedure is
justified based on the appraisal mission's evaluation of ASKI's accounting and
administrative procedures, which were found to be satisfactory. The agreement
of ASKI will be sought during Loan Negotiations that the SOE accounts would be
audited annually by an independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank, and would
be submitted to the Bank with the report on the audit at the time of
submission of the audit reports on ASKI's annual financial statements.
5.42     A Special Account would be opened for ASKI at the Central Bank of
Turkey with an initial deposit of US$10.0 million from the proposed loan
(approximately four months of estimated disbursements, on average, during
1991-94 when planned annual disbursements will range from US$27 million
equivalent to US$33 million equivalent; see Annex 13). ASKI would make
withdrawals for the Project from the Account based upon appropriate
documentation. When disbursements from the Account would total about
one-third of the initial deposit, ASKI would apply to the Bank for
replenishment of the Account. The agreement of ASKI will be sought during
Loan Negotiations to the Special Account being audited and also that the
report on the audit would be sent to the Bank together with the audit reports
mentioned above.
5.43     The proposed allocation of loan proceeds is shown in Annex 9.  The
loan Closing Date would be December 31, 1998 based on ai estimated
disbursement period of 9 years, the period for general investment type loans
in Turkey.
5.44     ASKI agreed during Loan Negotiations to submit to the Bank
semi-annual reports (due February 28 and August 31) on the progress of project
implementation during the preceding semesters ending December 31 and June 30,
respectively. The reports would measure performance against the procurement
and implementation schedules (Annexes 7 and 8), and the monitoring indicators
(Annex 11). Also, ASKI's agreed that it would submit a Project Completion
Report to the Bank six months after the Loan Closing Date.

VI. FINANCE
Past Performance and Current Financial Position
6.01     ASKI had good financial results in 1987 because of tariff
increases during the year and the preceeding two years which exceeded
inflaLion, and because of diaciplined billing and collection from household
and business customers. ASKI self-financed 30% of its 1987 investment
exper,diture, which was substantial and growing, given the financing which
ASKI had obtained from the KfW and other sources for foreign currency
costs and some local currency costs for expansion of the water distribution
system. During 1988, however, ASKI's tariffs were not adjusted despite
increasing operating costs (with general inflation of 70%), resulting in a
real terms decline in cash generation, and contributing in part to a
reduction in investment expenditure.
6.02     On January 1, 1989, ASKI put into effect tariff increases of
approximately 502 in nominal terms as a step in restoring, and toward later
expanding in real terms, its cash generation for the increased
self-financing envisaged in connection with the proposed project (paras.
6.05 and 6.06). On June 1, 1989, the tariffs were again increased, their
averaqe becoming TL 1,532/m3 (compared to the January-May average of TL
954/m ), at which nominal level it is intended by ASKI that they should
remain through the rest of the year (paragraph 6.07). With these actions,
and given that ASKI's debt is relatively low (D/E ratio of 38:62) and in
part on concessional terms, ASKI is well positioned to begin carrying out
its role financially for the project. Although, its receivables are high,
approximately five months equivalent of current billings, the bulk of these
are due from Government and other public agency customers which the
Government should require, in connection with the project, to begin paying
promptly to ASKI (paragraph 6.06).
Financing Plan
6.03     ASKI's 1989-96 financial requirements consist of: (a) funds for
works already being constructed, principally water distribution works
financed in part by credits from the KfW; (b) funds for the proposed
project; (c) funds for other new works, principally further expansion of
the water system; (d) debt service; and (e) increases in working capital.
The proposed financing plan calls for obtaining approximately 72% of the
estimated US$1,542 million equivalent needed through charges to customers,
and for the balance of the funds to be borrowed; 112 of the total would be
the proposed loan of US$173.0 million equivalent from the World Bank, and
6% would be the proposed mixed credit for the Project from the KfW. The
proposed KfW credit for the project would be a Financial Cooperation Credit
of DM 110 million at 22 interest, 10-year grace, and 30-year term; and a
Financial Credit of DM 64.5 million at 8% interest, no grace period, and
10-year term. The plan may be summarized as follows (annual figures are
presented in Annex 13):

a/  The source breakdown for the estimated project cost of US$556.8 million
equivalent is: $173.0 million, World Bank (31.02); $91.9 million, KfW
(16.5%); and $291.9 million, revenue from sales and customer contributions
(52.5%).
b/ It is likely that part of this amount will be used for as yet unidentified
investment after 1993; if this should not happen, tariffs could then be
reduced.
c/ Two existing and two new KfW credits, a loan from the European
Resettlement Fund, and a loan from the Kuwait Fund, each for water
distribution expansion.
6.04     As indicated in Table 6.1, ASKI's "Other Borrowing" is expected to
provide approximately US$162 million equivalent during the period, which
includes am unts of US$40 million equivalent from existing KfW credits, US$20
million equivalent from the European Resettlement Fund, US$21 million
equivalent from the Kuwait Fund, and US$28 million equivalent from expected
new credits from the KfW for further expansion of the water system. ASKI has
expressed interest in obtaining a simiiar amount of local currency financing,
but has not yet determined whether this is feasible (para. 6.08). The
existing KfW financing consists of mixed credits in approximately 54b
conceseional/462 "commercial" proportions: the concessional part at 2b
interest, 10-year grace, 30-year term, and the "commercial" part at a
commercial, variable rate of interest, no grace, and 10-year term.

Future Finances
6.05     Because of uncertainty about the impact on water consumption per
capita of ASKI's recent tariff increases and possible future increases, ASKI's
financial requirements have been analyzed under varying assumptions regarding
consumption per capita and timing of the impleffentation of the proposed
project. Results of the analysis are presented for two cases: (i) a case
selected to show how ASKI might adjust to a halt in per capita consumption
growth combined with strong objection by customers to further tariff increases
in real terms; and (ii) the case of the financing plan indicated above (paras.
6.03 and 6.04). The latter reflects ASKI's 1990-96 implementation plan for
the Project compared to 1990-98 stretched implementation in the case
illustrating an adjustment to lower than expected sales volumes and greater
than expected resistance to tariff increase.
6.06     The revenue projection beyond i989 in the 1990-96 financing plan is
based on assumptions that: (a) ASKI's tariffs would be adjusted periodically
for inflation to maintain their value in real terms in re'lation to July 1989;
(b) in addition, each January 1990, 1991, and 1992, the tariffs would be
adjusted by 14% in real terms; and (c) by December 31, 1990 and thereafter,
ASKI's accounts receivable would be the equivalent of two months of billings
(Annexes 12, 13, and 14). These adjustments would produce an average tariff
of US$1.18 /m3 equivalent (VAT included) by 1992 (TL 2,495/m3 in July 1989
TL), which leve'- would be maintained in real terms thereafter, and would
enable ASKI to self-finance the balance of its requirements not covered by the
existing and proposed foreign loans and credits indicated in Table 6.1. If
ASKI should, however, face a prolonged period of flat sales per capita and
greater than expected resistance to tariff increase, then by extending the
project implementation over an additional two years, real terms tariff
increases of only 9S would be needed in 1990, 1991, and 1992. This would
result in an average tariff of US$1.03/m3 in 1992 (TL 2,185/m3 in July
1989 TL). Affordability of the tariffs is discussed in paragraphs 7.08-7.10.
6.07     ASKI's annua. self-financing ratios under either of these cases
(i.e., the percentage of the annual investment total financed with cash
generated from customers, including their contributions, after covering cash
operating expenses and debt service) would average close to 552 during
1990-93, and would be no less than 43% in any year. ASKI has therefore agreed
to achieve self-finsncing of at least 452 of its annual investment expenditure
in 1990 and 1991, and 60% in 1992 and each year thereafter. ASKI has agreed
also that it will reduce its accounts receivable to the equivalent of two
months of billings by December 31, 1990. The reduction can be achieved by
prompt payment to ASKI of outstanding ASKI bills to Government and other
public agency customers. The Government has stated that it will follow up so
that the objective will be achieved.
6.08     Although ASKI is prepared to self-finance its investments at the
agreed levels, it would prefer to obtain local financing for a portion of its
local currency requirements if that could be shown to be advantageous and the
Bank would agree. Possibilities being considered by ASKI for obtaining
additional local funds include ASKI bond issues and contributions of
municipality finids generated through real estate sales and rents. Details are
being developed by ASKI, but it is too early to estimate amounts which might
be obtained. ASKI has agreed that it would only undertake additional



- 33 -
borrowing in excess of the total cumulative amount or US$5 million equivalent
sub4ect to agreement of the Government and the Bank. In addition, ASKI has
statad that 4ts desired use of local financing, at most, would be limited to
amounts needed during each year so that tariffs would not require increases in
real terms. It is estimated that if ASKI should obtain sufficient local funds
from outside sources to permit it to limit further tariff increases only to
compensation for inflation, ASKI then would self-finance its investments at no
less than 35% annually during the project implementation period.
Tariff Structure
6.09     As mentioned earlier (para 6.02), ASKI's tariffs were increased 602r
on average in June 1989 to the following amounts:
Table 6.2: ASK! Tariffs (VAT not included)
Percentage of
Tariff           Total Consumption
Residences:                               (TL/m3 )
- from 0 to 5m3/month               247.5               25.6
- from 5 to 10m3/month              825                 15.4
- above lO'/month                1,650                  9.7
Other Customers                             2,400                 49.3a_
Weighted Average                            1,532                100.0
-/  Approximately one-third industrial/commercial, two-thirds Government and
other public institutions.
The rates apply equally to customers receiving water service only and
customers receiving both water and sewerage service. Customers receiving both
services, therefore, are subsidized by the water-only customers, although many
of the latter are benefitted by sewerage even though not connected to and
using it themselves. Significant subsidization is provided to residentSil
customers by commercial, industrial, and governmental customers, with the
greatest benefit going to lower quantity, mainly low income, consumers. As
may be seen in Table 6.2, the lower quantity consumers are charged much less
than the overall average tariff, and as is explained later (para 7.07), much
less than the long run marginal cost of their services.
6.10     ASKI also applies a variety of charges, fees, and penalties covering
repair and maintenance services, emptying of septic tanks, and reconnecting
after cutoff for non-payment of bills. In addition, ASKI soon will begin
applying special industrial waste surcharges in cases of high concentration
wastes (para. 3.14).
Financial Reporting
6.11     ASKI has agreed:  (i) to provide to the Bank by May I and November 1
each year two-year financial reports forecasting as early as possible



- 34 -
significant variations from planned expenditures and financial objectives so
that, if necessarv. appropriate corrective action may be taken; and (ii) to
take appropriate corrective action if the forecasts should indicate that ASKI
would not meet its financial objectives.
VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND RISKS
Project Benefits
7.01     The Project would provide first-time sewerage for approximately
850,000 people; it would rehabilitate or replace existing sewerage for
500,000; and it would provide means to treat the City's sewage, which at
present, flows exposed through parts of the City in tributary streams to the
Ankara River and in the River itself (paras. 5.08 to 5.14).
7.02     The sewerage would enclose the otherwise open flows, and, together
with the treatment facility, would thereby eliminate health hazards, odors,
and other pollution-related problems in the City and along the Ankara River to
the west outside the City. All inhabited areas would be provided with
sewerage except for inaccessible squatter areas, which are relatively small,
on the steepest hillsides. Without the facilities, and given the increasing
population densities, increases in the incidence of disease and deterioration
in other aspects of living conditions would occur.
7.03     In a,ddition, the Project would provide storm-water drainage
facilities to reduce and in most cases eliminate the possibility of flooding
from otherwise storm-loaded creeks and sewers which can present health
hazards from sewage contamination as well as the threat of physical damage and
loss of life due to drowning (as has occurred from time to time in areas of
low lying housing). This would be done by constructing new drainage works and
by improving existing ones, and by eliminating present sewage discharges into
existing works constructed only for drainage purposes and therefore
inappropriate as carriers of simultaneous flows of both types.
7.04     The Project also would result in future cost savings through better
maintenance made possible through provision of manholes on existing sewers,
maintenance equipment and technical assistance and training.
Rate of Return
7.05     Projected revenue attributed to sewerage and drainage operations has
been used as a benefit measure in calculating an internal rate of return for
the intended sewerage, sewage treatment, and drainage investment on the basis
of the 1990-96 project implementation plan. The figures used are the
difference between projections of combined water, sewerage and drainage
revenue, and an attribution of revenue for water only calculated at the
marginal cost of water (Annex 15). This difference is considered,
accordingly, to be the portion of the combined revenue which may be attributed
to sewerage and drainage.
7.06     The combined revenue through 1993 has been determined according to
each year's local currency financing requirement for the year's total
investwent in water, sewerage, and drainage (as in Annexes 12 and 13). The
amounts beyond 1993 have been projected at marginal cost rates, which are



- 35 -
lower than the preceding years' rates, but are larger than needed to satisfy
the projected financing requirements in those years. For the determination of
the marginal cost of watet, it has been estimated that without the planned
water investment, which includes rehabilitation works, the water sales volume
would decline at a rate of 3% per year through 1997 du:, to increasing leakage.
7.07     The resultant internal rate of return is 11X, which, being an
internal financial rate is very likely less that the "in principle" economic
rate. It is considered impractical to quantify the project benefits (e.g.,
health and health-related benefits, and aesthetic benefits) and calculate an
economic return.
Affordability
7.08     It is estimated that Ankara household incomes averaged approximately
US$270 equivalent per month in 1988, with an estimated distribution as
follows:
Average Monthly Income
Household Income Groups                      (US$ Equivalent)
Lowest  20%                                      70
20  to 402                                    115
40% to 60%                                     160
601 to 80%                                     255
Highest 20%                                     750
Average                                         270
Since, according to the 1985 census, the average of the number of persons per
Ankara household is 4.3, and since, on average, there are approximately five
persons per ASKI connection, it is assumed that averages of customer incomes
at ASKI connections are no less than the above figures.
7.09      In the financial projections for ASKI, the tariff average is
projected to reach its highest value in real terms by 1992, which, depending
o.i the timing assumed for the implementation of the proposed project, would be
approximately TL 2,185/mi3 (US$1.03) or TL 2,495/m3 (US$1.18) (para.
6.06). It is assumed that the tariff structure underlying the projected
averages would be the same as today's structure, expanded to the following
amounts:
1992 Charge in TL per m3 (VAT included)W'
Customer Categories                 Low Alternative-'        High Alternative
Residences:      0-5m3/month          355        ( .17)           405      ( .19)
5-10m3/month        1,175        (.55)         1,340       ( .63)
lO+m3/month       2,355        (1.11)         2,690       (1.27)
Other Customers                     3,420        (1.61)         3,905       (1.85)
Overall Average                     2,185        (1.03)         2,495      (1.18)
a/  Figures in parentheses are US$ equivalents.
b/ The Low Alternative assumes project implementation is completed in 1998;
the High Alternati-e assumes 1996.



- 36 -
These amounts would result in monthly charges in the range of US$2-8 for most
residential customers, but charges could reach the range of US$25-50 and more
in cases of high quantity/high income customers.
7.10     In the case of a five-person customer with income of US$70 equivalent
per month (i.e., the average of the lowest income group, well below the
poverty threshold), consumption of 7.5m3 per month (50 liters per capita per
day, an adequate minimal amount) would cost US$2.25-2.80 equivalent
approximately 3-4% of the monthly income. This is more than double what such
customers pay today, but nevertheless could, by most developing country
standards, be considered affordable. In the case of a five-person customer
with an income of US$115 per month, the average of the next to lowest group,
consumption of 11.2m3/month (75 liters per capita per day, close to the
present residential average) could be paid with approximately 5% of the
income, which could be considered to be the upper limit of afforddbility.
There should, of course, be no question of affordability of the projected
rates to customers in higher income groups (the upper 60X).
Poverty Impact
7.11     It is estimated that about 35% of the Greater Ankara population at
presenit live in households with monthly incomes below the poverty threshold
(household income of US$120 equivalent); and that, ae a first approximation,
this proportion will continue through the project period because of
offsetting, within overall averages, of increasing incomes of continuing
residents by incomes of recent immigrants to the city, most of which, on
average, would begin working in the city in relatively low paid employment.
With this percentage, it is estimated also, therefore, that by end 1996, the
planned end of the project period, some 950,000 persons will be iiving below
the poverty threshold; and it is this group which at present suffers most from
inadequate sewerage.
7.12     The greatest benefits of the project will be obtained by about
800,000 of the above group who will receive first-time sewerage or
rehabilitation/upgrading of present substandard sewerage. (The balance of
about 150,000 persons would be those who live on steep hillsides inaccessible
to service, as mentioned in para 7.02). Substantial reductions in incidence
of disease should be expected, particularly among children. Also, in addition
to this and other direct improvements in the group's quality of life, there
would be the positive effect on income for persons realizing greater
productivity and earnings as a result of their avoidance of disease.
Environmental Impact
7.13     The project's environmental impact would be favorable in every
respect but the need to use the 130-135 ha. of agricultural land outside the
city for the sewage treatment facility. Open flows of sewage and
sewage-contaminated overflows of stormwater in the city would be eliminated,
thereby eliminating related health (including insect) problems, odors, and
other detrimental effects. In addition, water in the Ankara River, the
Sakarya River, and the Sariyar Reservoir below the City would become usable
for irrigation.



- 37 -
Risks
7.14     It is believed that the only significant risk for the project is the
possibility that significant delay in implementation could occur at some time
because of a lack of local currency resulting from insufficient adjustment of
tariffs to compensate for inflation. As previously mentioned, ASKI has agreed
to procedures designed to focus attention well in advance on any need for
tariff adjustment (para 6.09).
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
(a) The allocation by the German Government of the KfW mixed credit
funds for the sewage treatment plant is to be a Condition of
Effectiveness of the Loan Agreement for the proposed loan from
the Bank, and the subsequent effectiveness of the KfW financing
agreement by December 31, 1990, or the arrangement of
alternative financing satisfactory to the Bank by that date, is
to be a condition of the loan (para. 5.22);
(b) The signing of appropriate local agreements for the provision of
sewerage and sewage treatment services by ASKI to outlying
districts included in the Project is to be a condition of
disbursement from the proposed loan of funds for constructing
sewers in those districts (para 4.15);
Cc) ASKI will put into effect and begin to implement industrial
waste management regulations acceptable to the Bank by
December 31, 1990 (para. 3.14);
(d) ASKI will produce funds from internal sources enabling it to
self-finance no less than 45S of its annual investment
expenditure in 1990 and 1991, and 602 in 1992 and each year
thereafter (para. 6.06);
(e) Before May 1 and November 1 of each year, ASKI will review
whether it would meet the agreed self financing levels set forth
in subparagraph (d) above on the basis of forecasts prepared by
ASKI and accepted by the Bank for the current year and the
following year; and if the review should indicate that ASKI
would not meet the agreed levels, ASKI will promptly take
measures enabling it to meet the levels, including the
adjustment of ASKI's tariffs (para. 6.09);
(f) ASKI will reduce its accounts receivable to no more than the
equivalent of two months of current billings by
December 31, 1990 (para. 6.06);



- 38 -
(g)  ASKI will provide to the Bank by the end of February each year
for review and comment by the Bank a report on the status of the
ASKI investment program (para. 6.06);
(h)  ASKI will obtain the agreement of the Government and the Bank
prior to contracting any debt in excess of the total cumulative
amount of US$5 million equivalent, other than the intended KfW
credit for the Project's sewage treatment facility, until the
completion of the Project (para. 6.06);
(i)  ASKI will correct deficiencies in its accounting and financial
reporting, including the revaluation of its assets, by
December 31, 1990 (para. 3.09).
8.02     In addition, ASKI agreed during negotiations on standard
requirements for: progress reports on the Project (para 5.42); annual
audits (para. 3.11); financial reporting to the Bank (para. 6.09);
administration of a Special Account (para 5.40); use of Statements of
Expenditures (para 5.39); preparation of a Project Completion Report
(para 5.42); and the use of Wcrld Bank Guidelines and changes needed to
make LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank (para 5.34).
8.03     With the above conditions and agreements, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$173.0 million equivalent to the
Ankara Water Supply and Sewerage Administration for a period of 17 years,
including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ANKARA SEWERAGE PROJECT
Selection of Sewage Treatment Process
Background
1.       In a 1969 study for the Turkish authorities, the joint venture of
Camp/Harris/Mesara (CHM) consultants (USA/USA/local) recommended that an
activated sludge treatment plant be built to treat Ankara's sewage. The
proposed plant was recommended to be sited adjacent to the Ankara River about
2 km west of the present Greater Municipality boundary. The recommendation
was based on an analysis limited to two types of treatment plants: trickling
filters and activated sludge. The analysis indicated that the activated
sludge plant would be the less expensive means of meeting the desired effluent
quality. No action was taken on the recommendation because of lack of
financing.
2.       In 1979, the local consultants BMB-United Engineering Ltd. (BMB)
reviewed the CHM recommendations for the treatment process and plant
location. The expansion of Ankara had occurred mainly in a westerly
direction, and the plant site recommended by CHM in 1969 was no longer
available. BKB concluded that the most suitable location for the plant was 11
km downriver from the western boundary of the city, and BMB reconfirmed the
CEM recommendation of an activated sludge plant. Again, no further action was
taken.
3.       A joint venture of Lavalin/CH2M Hill/Temel (LCT) consultants
(Canadian/US/local) was employed by the Ankara authorities in September 1988,
financed by a World Bank Project Preparation Facility advance, to review and
update the previous recommendations and to prepare a recommended program for
sewage collection works. At the same time, the KfW financed the consultants
GKW Consult/Su Yapi (German/local) to carry out a pre-feasibility study of the
sewage treatment plant (KfW was considering the possibility of financing the
plant's electrical and mechanical equipment). The new consultants confirmed
that the site recommended by BMB for the plant is still the best choice.
Almost all of the sewage will flow to the site without pumping; access to the
site is through a narrow valley with the surrounding hills separating the site
from the Ankara urban area; and there is a considerable area of flat,
uninhabited, low yield agricultural land available for the site.
4.       In other key respects, however, preliminary conclusions reached in
early 1989 by the two consulting groups conflicted, the LCT analysis and
recommendation indicating stabilization ponds as the preferred solution, and
the GKW/SY group indicating the activated sludge process. A comparison of the
work of the two groups showed significant differences in assumptions and
criteria, which led in turn to undertaking a joint exe.:ise in Ankara in May
1989 by the consultants, Turkish authorities and Turkish technical
specialists, and representatives of the World Bank and the KfW.

Current Analysis and Conclusions
5.       One of the main factors in the selection of the treatment process is
the potential use of the rivers and reservoir downstream from the treatment
plant. The most critical period is the summer, when the flow of the Ankara
River at the treatment plant will be, at its minimum, approximately only l..O
m3/sec compared to the plant effluent of approximately 9 m3/sec.
Simulation modeling was carried out by GKW/SY to estimate effects of the
effluent from various alternative sewage treatment schemes on: (a) the Ankara
River; (b) the Sakarya River (the Ankara River is a major tributary); and (c)
the Sariyar Reservoir into which the Sakarya River flows. The modelling
showed that having effluent with no more than 30 mg/l of Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD) and 30 mg/l of Suspended Solids (SS) is essential to the health
of the rivers and reservoir. It was concluded that the treatment process to
be selected should meet this standard.
6.       Three treatment processes were evaluated:  (a) waste stabilization
ponds; (b) activated sludge; and (c) a hybrid of (a) and (b). The results of
the evaluation were:
(a) Waste Stabilization Ponds would not meet the effluent criteria
unless a high degree of mechanical aeration would be used during
winter when the biological processes are slowed due to the
colder temperature. Aeration to this degree would impose costs
leading to a total cost which would not be competitive with the
alternatives. The possible advantage of ponds in eliminating
pathogenic organisms by long detention of the organisms in
maturation cells would be offset by the property of growth of
algae in the cells during summer, which would introduce
unacceptable levels of algae-formed BOD. The cost of algae
removal or land application of the algae-loaded effluent would
be prohibitive.
(b) The Activated Sludge Process is less affected by seasonal
temperature extremes, would have the advantage of relatively low
civil works costs to offset in part its higher equipment costs,
and, thus, was found to be the least cost solution. Another key
factor leading to the least cost result is that the process
would include anaerobic digestion of sludge to produce gas for
electric power generation to supply virtually all of the plant's
energy needs.
(c) The Hybrid Plant comprising Primary Settling and Secondary
Stabilization Ponds was determined to be more expensive than the
activated sludge solution for the desired effluent standard,
mainly because of the costs of aeration during winter and of
algae removal during summer.

Prolect Cost Estimates
1.    Summary cost estimates by expenditure category, year and financing
source are in Tables A5.1 through A5.4. Detailed estimates are included in
the Project File. All of the estimates were prepared from January 1989
prices, and the base estimates are presented in these prices.
2.    Cost estimates for the sewerage and drainage civil works are based on an
analysis of the inputs (equipment, materials and labour) required to carry out
the work at Turkish rates. For the sewage treatment plant, the equipment
costs are based on quotations from suppliers in Germany, and the civil works
cost is based on recent bid prices for similar construction in Turkey.
3.    The cost of consultants for project coordination, design, construction
supervision, and technical assistance are based on man-month estimates and on
rates charged by foreign and local consultants in Turkey.
4.    Physical contingencies are 15 percent (except for land where 0 percent
contingency has been used). Value added tax of 10 on local equipment,
materials and services is reflected in the local cost component of the
affected components. Import duties are not included since ASKI is exempt.
