                                    REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
                                  DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT
Recipient                Republic of Honduras
Implementing Agency      Ministry of Finance
Financing Data           IDA Credit Amount: SDR55.1 million (US$86 million equivalent).
                         Terms: Blend terms with 25 year maturity including a 5-year grace period. Service charge fee of
                         0.75 percent and a 1.25 percent interest charge.
Operation Type           First in a series of two programmatic single tranche Development Policy Credits, to be disbursed
                         upon loan effectiveness.
Main Policy Areas        This Development Policy Credit (DPC) is designed to support the Government’s efforts to reduce
                         vulnerabilities and foster growth by strengthening fiscal management and institutional mechanisms
                         and programs responsible for an integrated violence prevention strategy. Four complementary policy
                         areas are supported:
                                   Tax administration reform
                                   Pension reform
                                   Civil service reform
                                   Citizen security
Key Outcome Indicators   Tax administration:
(2012)                             The number of large taxpayers filing electronically increases by at least 10 percent
                                    (baseline 2010= 335 large taxpayers).
                         Pension reform:
                                   100 percent of PROHECO teachers' pension contributions are flowing into INPREMA.
                         Civil service reform:
                                   Central Government’s wage bill falls by at least 0.7 percent of GDP (baseline: 2010 = 11
                                    percent of GDP).
                         Citizen Security
                                   Average perception of insecurity improves in the municipalities from the center, northern,
                                    and eastern regions where the ―Safer Municipalities‖ Program is being implemented
                                    (Baseline 2010: 91 percent felt insecure (UNDP 2010): Target 2012: 80 percent felt
                                    insecure).
Program Development      The operation’s Development Objective is to assist the Government in strengthening fiscal
Objective(s) and         management and institutional mechanisms and programs responsible for an integrated violence
Contribution to CPS      prevention strategy. The DPC operation supports progress towards the Country Partnership Strategy
                         objectives of Expanding Opportunities and Reducing Vulnerabilities and of Improving Citizen
                         Security.
Risks and Risk           The achievement of the development objective is subject to five main risks:
Mitigation
                                  On the political side, the main risk derives from the Government’s ability to complete
                                   implementation of the fiscal reform package. With a polarized society following the
                                   political crisis of 2009, approval and implementation of the planned fiscal package could
                                   be more difficult than anticipated, jeopardizing the needed fiscal adjustment. To reduce
                                   this risk, the Government has been building consensus to implement the needed reforms to
                                   return the country’s finances to a sustainable path. It will be important for the Government
                                   to ensure an adequate communications strategy regarding the present DPC, highlighting
                                   its positive distribution/poverty impact (as indicated in Table 6) in dealing with these
                                   urgent reforms, and its potential to greatly contribute to the resolution of long-standing
                                   issues in public administration in Honduras.
                                  On the institutional side, the main risk is related to the weak capacity of Government
                                   institutions to implement the fiscal consolidation program. To reduce this risk, the Bank is
                                   working with other donors to support the Government’s fiscal consolidation efforts
                                   through technical assistance and other means.
                                  On the economic front, the main risk derives from the possibility that the global economy
                                   (or some of Honduras’ key trading partners) might enter into another recession. The
                                   implications of a global economic downturn as well as the main transmission channels are
                                   likely to be the same as in the 2008 crisis: First, since the U.S. and the European Union
                                   are Honduras’ largest export markets (about 60 percent of total trade value), exports
                                   would fall significantly. Second, as workers’ remittances amount to about 16 percent of
                                   GDP and 90 percent of them originate in the U.S., remittances could fall sharply in the

                                                           i
                         event of a global economic downturn. Third, official development assistance might be
                         limited. The Government has been closely following the external economic conditions and
                         is currently preparing an action plan to mitigate the negative effects of a possible sharp
                         downturn of the world economy. In addition, the Bank and the Fund are maintaining an
                         on-going dialogue with the authorities on macroeconomic policy issues, which will help
                         detect potential threats to Honduras early.
                        On the environmental side, the main risk is the country's high exposure to natural
                         disasters. Honduras' major natural hazards are tropical storms and hurricanes that
                         frequently strike the country, generating extensive flooding along the north coast and
                         other regions. Hurricane Mitch in 1998 affected large portions of the country's population,
                         causing major economic damages estimated at US$3.5 billion. In 2005 Honduras was hit
                         by Hurricane Stan, which caused an estimated US$100 million in total economic damages.
                         The Government has taken important steps towards strengthening the country's disaster
                         risk management legal and institutional frameworks. In addition, the Bank is providing
                         key technical support to Honduras in terms of strengthening the institutional capacity to
                         engage in disaster risk management. If a disaster occurs, the Bank will revisit its planned
                         lending program and existing portfolio to ascertain how and where adjustments need to be
                         made.
                        On the citizen security component, there are institutional and indirect risks related to
                         strengthening institutional capacities to implement an integrated violence prevention
                         strategy. Institutional risks relate to weak capacity and financing requirements and are
                         being mitigated through (i) sound policy design (based on solid analytical work and
                         consultations), (ii) a gradual and sequenced implementation action plan, (iii) to be
                         coordinated by a multi-stakeholder National Citizen Security Council, (iv) developed with
                         the support from a coalition of development partners, and (v) funded partly through the
                         fiscal space created by a new security tax. Indirect risks relate to potential basic rights
                         abuses or corruption that might be associated with some of the actions supported by
                         programs that will be designed in the future as part of the law enforcement component of
                         the citizen security policy framework. Given that the law enforcement component is not
                         part of this DPC, the link with the prevention component as part of the overall citizen
                         security framework presents a low level of risk. Nonetheless it deserves mentioning and a
                         discussion of corresponding mitigation strategies. There are important risk mitigation
                         measures in place to reduce these risks, namely, (i) a strong rights-based approach
                         underpinning the design of the policy, (ii) an active coalition of development partners
                         supporting the design and implementation of the programs and actions that derive from
                         the policy, and (iii) the creation of multiple instances of oversight and accountability of
                         policy implementation such as the establishment of a Citizen Security Council (with
                         representatives from executive and judicial branches of government, and national and
                         local levels of government) and provisions for the participation of civil society and the
                         private sector at the national and local levels. The Bank will work with the Government to
                         strengthen even further mechanisms to engage civil society and private sectors in
                         monitoring policy implementation, particularly through grievance mechanisms. An
                         additional risk is that during political campaigns, candidates may take advantage of
                         voters’ perceptions of insecurity in order to justify repressive measures to combat crime
                         and violence. To mitigate this risk, the Government plans to carry out informational
                         campaigns based on the new integrated citizen security policy in order to emphasize the
                         importance of a comprehensive approach to tackle crime and violence. Such campaigns
                         include community mobilization and citizen engagement in a social dialogue on how to
                         respond to citizen security issues.

                    PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT
                        TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS

                                    I. INTRODUCTION

1.      One of the Honduran administration’s top objectives is to foster high economic
growth. Putting the economy on a rapid and sustainable growth path will not be easy, but it is
feasible. Action will be required on five fronts. First and foremost, a more conducive
macroeconomic framework is necessary; in particular, redressing the large imbalances in
Central Government finances and unresolved structural weaknesses in public pension funds
and public sector enterprises. Second, an integrated citizen security strategy is necessary to
tackle the increasing levels of crime and violence that are undermining the country’s growth
potential and investment climate. Third, investments in infrastructures are needed to promote
the country’s regional development. Fourth, poor governance negatively affects return rates of
investment opportunities in Honduras. Finally, low levels of human capital are an important
growth constraint. This operation will focus on addressing the first two areas; the rest are
being supported by other Bank operations and activities.

2.      The Government launched fiscal consolidation efforts in 2010 and has begun
tackling the remaining risks to macroeconomic stability and unresolved structural
weaknesses in public pension funds and public sector enterprises. To this end, the
Government has already introduced measures to close the actuarial deficits of the main public
pension institutes—Instituto Nacional de Previsión del Magisterio (INPREMA), which serves
the private sector and public sector teachers, and Instituto Nacional de Jubilación y Pensiones
de los Empleados Públicos (INJUPEMP), which covers Central Government civil servants.
Similarly, the Government has introduced measures to contain the wage bill and is
implementing a strategy to strengthen tax administration.

3.       President Lobo’s administration has begun to make significant efforts to fight
crime and violence and promote citizen security; however, these efforts will require
substantial implementation support in order to be sustained and to have a robust
development impact over time. The Government has approved the National Citizen Security
and Co-existence Policy 2011-2022, which provides a comprehensive and long-term approach
to this challenge, with crime prevention as one of its main pillars. In addition, the Government
has mandated the Security, Defense, and Governance Cabinet (Gabinete de Seguridad,
Defensa y Gobernabilidad) to provide the intra-governmental coordination which is required
to implement the policy. Moreover, Congress has approved legal reforms to secure new
resources to finance activities to foster security, including those addressed in the citizen
security policy framework.

4.      This document describes a proposed First Programmatic Reducing
Vulnerabilities For Growth Development Policy Credit (DPC) in the amount of SDR
55.1 million for the Republic of Honduras. The programmatic series, which includes one
subsequent loan, is designed to assist the Government in strengthening fiscal management and
in implementing an integrated citizen security policy. Specifically, the operation supports four
areas that are central to the reform program: (i) tax administration, focused on improving
taxpayer compliance; (ii) civil service reform, focused on the rationalization of the public
wage bill by delinking teachers’ salary adjustments from those reflected in the private sector’s
                                               1
minimum wage; (iii) pension reform, designed to lessen contingent fiscal vulnerabilities by
reducing the public pension institutions’ actuarial deficits, and (iv) citizen security reform,
focused on strengthening institutional coordination mechanisms and programs needed for an
integrated violence prevention strategy . The reforms supported by this operation are expected
to have a positive impact on poverty and inequality (see section VI).

5.      The proposed operation is envisaged in the new Country Partnership Strategy
covering the period FY2012-2014 (to be presented jointly with this operation to the
Board of Executive Directors) and is closely aligned with other Bank operations. For
example, the Improving Public Sector Performance Technical Assistance Loan (P110050,
currently under preparation and expected to accompany this operation) provides support to
strengthen public sector human resource management. In addition, a Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF) for Employment Generation in Poor Urban Neighborhoods will
complement this operation.

                                 II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

6.      Honduras is a lower middle income country with per capita gross national
income of US$1,800.1 It is Central America’s second most populated country, with 7.5
million people, and the second largest in size, with an area of 112,088 square kilometers.
About half of the population is rural, and 80 percent of these people live in hillside areas, 2
practicing subsistence agriculture. Honduras’ social indicators are among the worst in the
Latin America and Caribbean region but are comparable to other lower middle income
countries in other regions. At 82.4 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, in 2010 Honduras had
the highest homicide rate in the world.
Political Context

7.     On June 28, 2009, the Honduran Supreme Court ordered the removal of
President Zelaya following his decision to conduct a referendum that, if won, would
have allowed him to convene a National Constituent Assembly to rewrite the
Constitution and stand for re-election. An interim President was appointed by Congress the
following day, to remain in place until the November 2009 elections. Following these political
developments, Honduras was suspended from the Organization of American States (OAS)
and much of the international community put aid programs on hold, although a number of
donors continued implementing projects, particularly those focused on the poor.

8.      President Porfirio Lobo from the National Party won the November 2009
elections with 55 percent of votes cast. International observers concluded that the elections
were free and fair. After President Lobo was inaugurated on January 27, 2010, the new
Government quickly set about a series of actions aimed at easing political tensions. Some of
the most important steps were naming a government of national reconciliation which included
some political rivals; establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission; working with
Congress on important Constitutional reforms; restoring diplomatic relations with partner
countries; and prompt re-engagement with the international community and development
partners. The Government also faced a major challenge bringing the fiscal situation under

control (see below). In June 2011, Honduras’ membership in the Organization of American
States was restored, marking a milestone in the country’s efforts to normalize international
relations. Despite these advances, however, the widespread public sentiment appears to be
that change is not happening fast enough.
Recent Economic Developments

9.       Shocks that hit Honduras in 2008 and 2009 negatively impacted the economy,
reducing the average growth rate to 1.6 percent in the 2008-2010 period. As the country
struggled to cope with rising food and fuel prices, a tropical depression struck on October 16,
2008. Honduras was then hit particularly hard by the global financial crisis because its
economy is relatively export driven, with high vulnerability to shifts in the global economy
and oil prices. The 2009 political crisis further compromised the nation’s fiscal situation, with
the combined public sector deficit increasing to 4.7 percent in 2009. As a result of these
crises, the economy contracted by 1.9 percent in 2009.

10.     The Honduran economy staged a moderate recovery in 2010, with exports and
public investment being the key drivers of growth. On the supply side, financial
intermediation was the most dynamic sector, growing at 4.3 percent year over year, followed
by manufacturing at 4 percent. However, construction struggled for a second year, contracting
by 6.7 percent. On the demand side, public investment grew by 19.7 percent year over year,
followed by exports at 6 percent. Official figures show that GDP grew 2.8 percent in 2010,
reversing the decline of 1.9 percent in 2009. Economic growth was also supported by
increases in remittances from the US.

11.    The recovery in 2010 was accompanied by a deterioration in the external balance
and an increase in inflation. The current account deficit increased from 3.6 percent of GDP
in 2009 to 6.2 percent in 2010. This reflects a jump in the merchandise trade deficit due to
higher oil prices. Inflation reached 6.5 percent in 2010, up from 3 percent in 2009. The surge
in the current account deficit was financed primarily by an increase in foreign direct
investment and long term public sector borrowing.

12.    Fiscal consolidation efforts started in 2010. According to the Ministry of Finance,
preliminary fiscal information shows a Combined Public Sector deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP
in 2010, down from 4.7 percent in 2009 and well below the target of 3.7 percent under the
IMF program. This improvement is mainly explained by a surplus from the public entities, tax
reforms (which yielded an additional 1 percent of GDP), and measures to control public sector
wages. In addition, the Central Government deficit reached 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010, down
from 6.2 percent in 2009. The Bank supported the country’s fiscal consolidation efforts
through a Development Policy Credit (US$76.4 million) delivered in December 2010, along
with the IMF program and similar budget support operations from the IDB, European Union,
and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration.3

13.    The Government is committed to continuing its fiscal consolidation efforts and
reducing public sector vulnerabilities. While the fight on crime may need additional
resources, the Government is taking the necessary measures to secure them. In June 2011,

 The Government publishes in a timely manner on the Ministry of Finance’s website both the budget as approved by
Congress as well as the budget proposal. In September 2011, the Government published the 2012 Budget proposal in a timely
manner on the Ministry of Finance’s website: http://wwwsefin.gob.hn.

Congress approved the Efficiency of Revenues and Expenditures Law (Ley de Eficiencia en
los Ingresos y el Gasto Público), which eliminates some tax exemptions and enforces new
measures against tax evasion. In addition, Congress recently approved reforms of the
Population Security Law (Ley de Seguridad Poblacional), which creates new temporary taxes
to finance efforts to address security and social prevention issues. The new taxes include: (i) a
financial transactions tax on withdrawals from individual checking accounts and corporate
saving accounts with a minimum monthly average balance, (ii) a tax on the food and beverage
industry’s monthly gross income under special tax exemption regimes, (iii) a tax on the
mobile phone industry’s service monthly gross income, (iv) a tax on mining activities, and (v)
a tax on annual renewals of credit cards. The new taxes are estimated to raise government
revenues by about 0.3 percent of GDP on an annual basis for the next 5 years.4 In addition, the
Government will be reallocating resources from other areas of the budget and will be
receiving new grants from the donor community to finance the efforts in citizen security. The
fiscal consolidation efforts will come from reducing the wage bill, increasing tax revenues
through tax administration measures and by addressing the contingent liabilities in the
pension systems.

14.     The rapid rise in the public sector wage bill has been halted. The 2007 Public
Expenditure Review (PER) identified rising public wages as a significant fiscal challenge and
has been a longstanding issue for Honduras. The proliferation of special pay regimes for civil
servants, notably teachers and health workers, has meant the Central Government could no
longer exert full control over the public wage bill. From 2000 to 2010, the public sector wage
bill increased from 7.5 percent to 11 percent of GDP—one of the highest levels in Latin
America (see Figure1). In particular, the largest jump in the wage bill was in 2009 when the
salaries increased by more than 20 percent. The wage bill represents about 75 percent of total
tax revenues and is more than three times the investment budget. To counter the trend, the
Government introduced several measures last year to freeze the wage bill at 11 percent of
GDP in 2010. The Government has recently introduced additional measures to reduce the
wage bill, which is expected to decline to about 10 percent of GDP by the end of 2011.

15.     The public pension systems have important actuarial deficits, but the
Government is taking steps to reduce them. INPREMA has an actuarial deficit of about 79
billion Lempiras (US$4 billion) and reserves have started to deplete.5 The Government has
submitted a bill to Congress that would put the management of INPREMA in the hands of
technical and actuarial professionals to avoid the misuse of assets. In addition, the pension bill
makes several parametric adjustments, such as gradually increasing the retirement age from
50 to 65 and the minimum number of working years from 10 to 25 to be vested. Similarly,
INJUPEMP has an actuarial deficit of about 32 billion Lempiras (US$1.7 billion). The
authorities submitted a bill to reform INJUPEMP in April 2011. The legislation proposes
several parametric adjustments, such as gradually increasing the retirement age from 58 to 62
and the minimum number of working years from 10 to 15 to be vested. In the absence of the
reforms to the public pension systems, the Central Government will need to transfer to
INPREMA and INJUPEMP an additional 0.2 percent of GDP starting in 2014.6

present. A pension system is said to be in actuarial deficit if the summarized income rate is less than the summarized cost rate
of Social Security for any given valuation period.

  INPREMA’s net worth is sufficient to cover pension payments until 2019, however, many of its assets are not liquid and
therefore it will need transfers from the Central Government to cover its deficit in the medium term.

16.     After weathering the crisis quite well, the domestic financial system is gradually
improving. Since the beginning of 2011, the Central Bank has reduced reserve requirements.
As a result, overall funding costs have decreased and stimulated credit demand, while a
growth in the banking system’s deposit base has helped maintain liquidity at adequate levels.
Asset quality has improved significantly since 2009. In June 2011, the banking system
reported a non-performing loans (NPL) ratio of 3.4 percent (4.7 percent in June 2009), which
is lower than the pre-crisis level, but still above the regional average. For the first time since
2007, the provisions of the system (3.8 percent of credit portfolio) fully covered the NPLs.
The system also reported an adequate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 14.7 percent, the same
as posted in the previous year, and all banks complied with the minimum capital requirements
of 10 percent of risk weighted assets. Supervision of the banking sector has also improved in
the last year, as the implementation of an ambitious plan to introduce risk-based supervision
and to strengthen the Banking and Insurance Commission's (CNBS) supervisory capacity
advances with support of the Bank’s Financial Sector Technical Assistance Credit and the
IDB.

                         Box 1. Global Uncertainty and Risks in the LAC Region
While LAC’s fundamentals remain robust and growth dynamics have been healthy to date, the region has become
increasingly aware of the rise in global uncertainties and risks. As the room for policy maneuvering to avert a
deeper crisis in the developed world is narrowing, risk aversion has risen across markets and so has the probability
of a worldwide economic downturn. There are two epicenters of uncertainty: the first and gravest one is Europe and
the second one is the United States.

This uncertainty gives rise to highly contrasting global scenarios, ranging from difficult but tolerable, to a severe
economic contraction. While real economic activity in LAC does not seem to have been much affected by the
recent turbulence in the developed world so far, downward revisions to growth forecasts for the region are likely to
happen in the short run, in line with the more pessimistic growth projections that are being produced for the U.S.
and Europe. The strong coupling of stocks across the world has tightened further in recent months. Sovereign
spreads for LAC have recently also picked up, but they have in general remained at low and stable levels compared
to those for several European countries.

In case of a new crisis, advanced economies may enter a recession followed by a prolonged low-growth path, as
happened in 2008. Unfortunately, the shock absorption capacity across countries within the region varies
considerably, implying that a bad global scenario could have crippling implications for some countries in the
region, especially those countries in Central America and the Caribbean that lack countercyclical macroeconomic
policy capacity and suitable social safety nets and those most tightly linked to the US and Europe, and least
benefitting from high commodity prices due to Chinese demand.

In Central America, the main transmission channels are likely to be the same as in the 2008 crisis:

o      Trade: The United States and the European Union are Central America’s largest export markets, accounting
       for 60 percent of agricultural exports.
o      Remittances: Workers remittances from abroad amount to between 12 and 20 percent of GDP, except in
       Costa Rica and Panama. In addition, 90 percent of remittances sent to Central American countries originate
       in the United States.
o      Capital markets: Accessing international capital markets may become more difficult if investor confidence
       collapses. This could affect those countries with significant financing needs that cannot be met in the
       domestic markets and/or through multilateral and bilateral loans.
o      Official Development Assistance (ODA): After the 2008 economic crisis the donor resources were very
       scarce. If a new severe contraction of the global economy occurs, financing through these sources will be
       limited.

In light of these risks, authorities in Honduras have shifted to a much more cautious attitude, focusing on fiscal
structural reforms and a gradual tightening of fiscal policy to provide the room to act promptly in case an adverse
scenario materializes. The Central Bank is conscious of the need of continuing to enhance its capacity to deploy
counter-cyclical policy if needed. Honduras would face the challenge of a global recession with limited scope for
easing its fiscal stance given the need to buttress long-term fiscal sustainability. Monetary easing in Honduras
would need to remain in tune with the business cycles. In this regard, exchange rate flexibility is being considered
as part of the strategy to buffer the impact of a more pronounced slow down. Under a scenario of a double dip
recession in the world economy, Honduras’ GDP would grow by 2-3 percent in 2011 and would contract in 2012
by about 2 percent as exports and remittances flows slow down. However, the central government deficit would not
increase as much as in 2008 (6.2 percent of GDP) reaching about 4.5 percent of GDP. In addition, although in this
scenario exchange rate depreciation would increase the value of foreign debt, Honduras has a relatively low debt to
GDP ratio (27.8 percent of GDP) that could provide a cushion and would allow the country to access additional
financing from multilaterals and domestic creditors.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

17.     The Honduran economy is expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2011, an
improvement from 2009-2010 but a low rate compared with those posted in the mid-
2000s. On the one hand, as the economies of Honduras’ major trade partners are slowing
down, maquila exports have stagnated.7 On the other hand, as commodity prices remain high,
the value of agriculture exports such as coffee and bananas have increased. In addition, the
economic slowdown in the US is expected to lead to a decline in remittances with respect to
2010. Total exports are expected to grow 22.5 percent while imports are projected to increase
18.2 percent. Foreign direct investment is expected to rise from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to
5.5 percent of GDP in 2011.

18.    Despite the global uncertainties, the growth outlook for Honduras remains
overall positive. Under a baseline scenario, world economic growth is expected to remain
sluggish through at least the first semester of the 2012. As a result, maquila exports are
expected to stagnate while agriculture exports will continue increasing due to relatively high
commodity prices. During the second half of 2012, the global economy is expected to slowly
recover. Maquila exports, spurred by growth in the US, are expected to drive industrial
production starting in the second half of 2012. As a result, the Honduran economy is expected
to grow at 3.6 percent in 2012, and at around 4 percent in 2013-2014.

19.     Monetary policy is expected to remain vigilant as headline inflation picks up.
Headline inflation stood at 6.5 percent in July, and current projections suggest it will reach 8.2
percent by end-2011, which is well inside the Central Bank’s target range of 7-9 percent. The
Central Bank is committed to meeting its inflation target. To attain this goal, it will continue
to mop up excess liquidity through the placement of its own securities. In the near term, the
exchange rate will continue to serve as the main anchor for inflation expectations. In the
medium term, commodity and fuel prices are expected to decline and thus inflation is
projected to follow a similar trend and reach 6 percent in 2014.

20.     The Government introduced a crawling exchange-rate band in late July 2011,
reverting to the policy it had pursued before 2005 and ensuring greater exchange rate
flexibility. The crawl rate will be equal to the expected differential between domestic and
foreign inflation and changes in the nominal effective exchange rate. The base rate will be
adjusted accordingly every week. As a transition measure, the exchange rate can appreciate to
its lower band in a single day, but depreciation cannot exceed 2 cents a day.

21.     The current account deficit is expected to narrow in the medium term. Worker
remittances are expected to remain at about 16 percent of GDP in 2012-2014. Imports are
projected to grow on average close to 7 percent; combined with higher exports, this would
narrow the current account deficit from 7.2 percent of GDP in 2011 to 5.7 percent in 2014.
Foreign direct investment, mostly to the maquila sector, is projected to decrease from 5.2
percent of GDP in 2010 to about 5 percent in 2014.

textiles and garments, among others.

22.     The Government remains committed to reducing the combined public sector
deficit to 2 percent of GDP over the medium term. 8 Throughout President Lobo’s term,
the Government will continue undertaking reforms to strengthen the finances of the public
pension funds and the Honduran Institute of Social Security, increase the efficiency of state
enterprises, and improve the targeting of social safety nets. Tax revenues are expected to
increase slightly over the medium term as a result of the implementation of reforms aimed to
strengthen the tax administration. Current expenditures are expected to decline as the wage
bill has been contained through several measures. The Government expects to rely on external
borrowing to finance its deficit and refinance domestic debt.9

23.    A debt sustainability analysis suggests that Honduras’ public debt is on a
sustainable trajectory (see Annex 5). In the baseline scenario, the public-debt-to-GDP is
expected to increase from 26.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 28 percent in 2012 and gradually
decline afterwards. The trajectory of public debt is projected to decline even under the most
pessimistic alternative scenarios considered in the analysis.

24.     There is a risk that the global economy might enter into another recession at the
end of 2011. Our baseline scenario assumes that the global economy grows 2.8 percent in
2011 and 3.2 percent in 2012. Central America and Honduras are likely to be affected if the
developed countries enter into another recession. Although the magnitude of a new crisis
remains highly uncertain, a number of factors may make it more severe than in 2008. First,
the scope for monetary and fiscal policy in Europe and the US is limited at this point.
Second, if Chinese growth was affected, this would drag down commodity prices and
exacerbate the slump in global demand. In case the global economy falls into another crisis,
the Honduran economy may experience a contraction similar to the one in 2008 (about -2
percent).10 However, the fiscal impact may be less severe thanks to the recent structural
reforms undertaken in the fiscal sector (see Box 1 for more details). Also, the Government has
been closely following the external economic conditions and is currently preparing an action
plan to mitigate the negative effects of a possible sharp downturn on the world economy.

25.   In sum, in light of the measures taken by the Honduran authorities and the
ongoing domestic economic recovery, the macroeconomic policy framework is deemed
adequate for this proposed Development Policy Credit.




8
   In the long run, it is expected that the country will be able to run a proper countercyclical fiscal policy. Many of the
structural reforms supported by the program will contribute to this end.
9
   Currently, domestic financing is more expensive than external financing and is relatively short term. The Government
wishes to refinance its domestic debt for a longer period and at a lower cost. However, the Government is also weighing
possible exchange rate and interest rate risks as well as the effects on domestic liquidity of not borrowing from local
investors. In addition, given investors’ perceptions of country risk, the interest cost of placing a bond in international markets
is uncertain.
10
    If the global economy contracts, maquila exports are likely to decline significantly and overweighing the positive impact
of coffee and banana exports.
                                                               11
Crime and Violence, Citizen Security

26.     The citizen security agenda has become increasingly significant in Honduras.
Weak governance, political instability, slow growth, and poor social outcomes have
contributed to an environment conducive to crime and violence. Between 2005 and 2010, the
country’s homicide rate doubled from 37 to 82.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, moving
Honduras from third to first place in Central America and indeed the world (Figure 4).11
Homicides are concentrated among males (94 percent), particularly those between 15 and 34
years of age. According to the Violence Observatory, 70 percent of all homicides are in urban
areas, although they are significant and on the rise in rural areas as well (30 percent of
homicides).

27.     In the past five years, violence against women has also increased by 125 percent;
women’s homicide rates have increase from 4.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005 to
10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. It is the second highest cause of death for
women in Honduras. According to the 2005 National Demographic and Health Survey
(ENESF), 12 15 percent of women were victims of some form of violence at least once in the
previous 12 months. Rates were slightly higher for women in urban areas compared to women
living in rural areas (17 percent versus 12 percent).

28.    Crime and violence are making Honduras poorer and have become a major
development challenge. Deteriorating citizen security is undermining Honduras’ growth
potential and investment climate, its social and human development progress, and its
prospects for improving governance. The annual economic costs of crime and violence have
been estimated at near 10 percent of Honduras’ GDP (nearly US$900 million).13 A recent

11
   Violence is concentrated in urban areas. Among cities with more than 100,000 people, the most violent are La Ceiba (158
homicides per 100,000 inhabitants), San Pedro Sula (148), Juticalpa (129), Puerto Cortes (109), Comayagua (104), and
Tegucigalpa and Comayaguela (93).

Bank study estimates that reducing homicide rates by 10 percent could boost annual economic
growth by 0.7 percent.14 Not surprisingly, citizens perceive violent crime as one of the major
threats to their welfare, and the failure to curb this epidemic continues to undermine the
legitimacy of government and the rule of law.

29.     The World Development Report 2011 on Conflict, Security, and Development
provides a solid framework to understand the dynamics of crime and violence in
Honduras. The WDR argues that the risk of major violence is greatest when high levels of
internal and external stress combine with weak national institutions. Societies are vulnerable
when their institutions are unable to protect citizens from abusers, or to provide equitable
access to justice and economic opportunity. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated in countries
with high levels of internal stress (high youth unemployment, growing income inequality, and
perceptible injustice). Externally driven events such as the presence of trafficking networks or
economic shocks add to the stresses that can provoke violence.

30.    In the case of Honduras, the escalating levels of crime and violence are partly the
result of external phenomena. Drug trafficking has become the main factor in increasing
violence levels in Honduras in recent years, as a result of the shift of drug-trafficking routes
between South America and North America from the Caribbean to the Central America-
Mexico corridor.15 There is a correlation between homicide rates and the parts of the country
with high intensity of drug trafficking, such as the Atlantic coast and areas bordering
Guatemala.

31.     Like other countries of Central America’s northern triangle, Honduras has seen
a proliferation of youth gangs from the deportation of transnational gang members from
US prisons since the mid-1990s.16 It is estimated that approximately 112 gangs, or maras,17
with 36,000 members, are now operating in the country, and that 15 percent of homicides are
gang-related.18 While the role of youth gangs has been exaggerated, its close links with
different forms of organized crime has made them a growing threat for citizen security.

32.     The impact of these external stresses has been exacerbated by the prevalence of
many risk factors that make individuals and communities vulnerable to violence. Studies
show that violence does not result from a single factor but from the accumulation of
disadvantages and risks. Violent individuals tend to experience disadvantages at the
individual level (e.g., low education, poor employability skills) and in their families (domestic
violence, lack of parental monitoring), relationships (friends who are gang members),
communities (living in violence hotspots with high presence of guns, drugs, alcohol), and
society at large (culture of violence, stigmatization of poor youth as criminals, repressive and
corrupt police).19 Honduras shows a prevalence of many of these risks. In at least the past two

   When referring to gangs in Central America, a distinction is sometimes made between maras and pandillas, with the term
maras being used to refer to the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs, while the term pandillas is used for localized, home-grown
gangs.

   Territorial ―hotspots‖ of crime and violence tend to coincide with enclaves of urban inequality suffering from multiple
forms of risk and disadvantage (high levels of poverty, low social capital, lack of public services, high exposure to natural
disasters, urban decay, etc.).
                                                            13
decades, the country has had high levels of outmigration in search of work, leaving
dysfunctional family structures where young children and youths often do not have sufficient
parental supervision, rendering them prey to the guidance and structure offered by the youth
gangs or maras. Another risk factor is the high levels of firearms due to weak enforcement of
regulations. In 2010, 151,003 firearms were registered but the estimated total was close to
800,000.20 Firearms are used in most murders reported during 2010.21 High levels of
inequality and a lack of opportunities are also a contributing factor (see next section).

33.      Weakened by (among other factors) the corrupting influence of organized crime,
the criminal justice system has been ineffective in its preventive, deterrent, and punitive
roles, undermining good governance and the rule of law. As the state’s ill-equipped justice
and security sectors struggle and often fail to combat organized crime, Honduran citizens’
trust in the rule of law declines. Institutional weakness often contributes to maintain situations
of impunity. In 2006, 63,537 criminal complaints were filed, 49,198 of which were referred
for investigation and only 1,015 ended in a conviction due in part to deficiencies of the
criminal investigation process. Overall trust in criminal justice institutions and the police have
declined significantly in the last few years, from 51 percent in 2004 to 41 percent in 2008, and
from 57 percent in 2004 to 44 percent in 2008 respectively. 22 Despite low confidence of
citizens’ in the security and justice sector, the number of legal complaints has doubled in the
last years. The weak social sector performance and the lack of a comprehensive social policy
on violence prevention activities weaken society at the same time that poor educational
prospects and limited job opportunities make crime an attractive option.

Poverty, Gender and Social Development

34.     Honduras remains one of the poorest and most unequal countries in Latin
America. The country was severely affected by the economic crisis. Preliminary estimates
indicate that as result of the economic contraction in 2009 associated with the international
economic crisis, poverty in Honduras may have risen by approximately 2 percentage points
between 2008 and 2009. Consumption-based figures for 2009 indicate that 44.5 percent of the
population lived in poverty and 20.1 percent lived in extreme poverty (Figure 5).23 These rates
are expected to fall gradually as growth recovers. According to the Honduras Poverty
Assessment (2006), indigenous peoples and other non-Mestizo/Ladino groups account for 6.5
percent of the population, and 71 percent live below the poverty line. According to official
figures, the Gini coefficient that measures inequality in income distribution for 2007 stood at
0.57. These figures are among the highest in Latin America.

35.    The decline in wage remittances observed in 2009 constituted an important
transmission mechanism for poverty. A quarter of the poorest 20 percent of the population
receive remittances, and this contributes around a quarter of their total incomes. Since more
than half of all migrants come from urban areas, the urban poor are more vulnerable to the
decline in remittances. Recent Bank analysis indicates that the majority of workers are

   Honduras official figures may differ from these because they are based on household income and use a different
methodology in the calculation.

employed in low skilled and low paying jobs in agriculture and related sectors. In Honduras,
agriculture seems to be the residual absorber of labor—not retail services, as in other Central
American countries. During the 2008-2009 crisis, Honduran urban unemployment rose
rapidly due to job losses in maquilas and construction.

36.     To offset the potential negative impact of the fiscal consolidation efforts on the
most vulnerable the Government recently launched a new Conditional Cash Transfer
Program (Bono 10,000). By end-2011, the Program is expected to cover about 300,000
families living in extreme poverty. The program, which was launched in 2010, not only aims
to mitigate the impact of the economic and fiscal crisis on the poor in the short run, but also
contributes to the long-term objective of reducing poverty as outlined in the National Plan.
The program, which is supported by the Bank's Social Protection Project, subsumes some of
the earlier cash transfer programs and will improve coverage, benefits and accumulation of
human capital for eligible families living in extreme poverty. The earlier cash transfers Bono
Solidario and Bono Escolar have been discontinued as separate transfers and integrated
within the Bono 10,000. The eligible population for this Program ultimately comprises the
approximately 600,000 extremely poor families with children aged 0 to 59 months, children in
primary school (grades 1 to 6), and pregnant mothers. These families represent about 87
percent of all extremely poor families. The program aims to provide more adequate benefits to
these households conditional on investments in human capital accumulation through regular
use of health and/or education services. Moreover, a large share of households currently
benefiting from the program has indigenous background.

37.     Gender and age-related issues have led to risky behaviors that may contribute to
violence as a major development challenge. High teenage pregnancy rates, especially
among poor women leads not only to a large proportion of households headed by women—35
percent in 2006, the highest for Central America—but also to higher dropout rates, which
makes it harder for young women to obtain quality employment. Nevertheless, on average,
women now have more schooling than men which results in an inverse gender gap in
education (female to male ratio in: primary enrollment 99.78; secondary enrollment 123.94;
tertiary enrollment 151.48 in 2008). In contrast, participation of women in the labor force has
increased slowly over the last two decades. At only 40.1 percent in 2009, it continues to be
                                                                   15
one of the lowest rates of female labor force participation in Latin America (LAC average: 56
percent in 2009).

38.     Among boys, dropping out of school, compounded by the lack of employment
opportunities, may lead to their involvement in gangs and acts of violence as well as in
crime and drug trafficking. For both girls and boys, the poor quality of education may also
contribute to dropping out of school and result in the risky behaviors just described. Over the
past two decades, Honduras has devoted an increasing share of public spending to the
education sector. Public sector education expenditures increased from 5 percent to 8.6 percent
of GDP between 1990 and 2007. Despite this increase, however, Honduras has not been able
to increase the level of education outcomes of its students, due in part to serious teacher
absenteeism and opposition to reforms by strong teachers’ unions. The weak performance of
the education system also has serious implications in terms of violence, given that dropping
out of school is one of the primary risk factors for the involvement of children and youth in
criminal and violent behavior.

                         III. THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

39.     Early in 2010, the Honduran Congress approved the Government’s proposed
Country Vision 2010-2038 and National Plan 2010-2022. The overarching long-term
objectives of the Country Vision are: (i) a Honduras without extreme poverty, educated and
healthy with consolidated provision of social services; (ii) a Honduras with a developing
democracy, with security and without violence; (iii) a productive Honduras generating
opportunities for dignified employment while making sustainable use of resources and
reducing environmental vulnerability; and (iv) a modern, transparent, responsible, efficient,
and competitive state. The Lobo Administration’s priorities and challenges are derived from
these objectives and include:

40.     Strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal management. Achieving GDP growth at
rates above population increases remains a key challenge for the Government. Among the
principal issues to tackle are: strengthening public finances, building the private financial
sector, diversifying exports, increasing access to credit, providing added value to export
products, and increasing adoption technology for key engines of growth. The proposed
operation supports key elements of the government’s strategy. These include: (i) reforming
the country’s tax system to raise collections, improve tax administration, and fight tax
evasion; (ii) bringing the public wage bill under control in key sectors, with a focus on
education; and (iii) reducing the actuarial deficit of public pension and health institutions.

41.     Ensuring the rule of law and controlling crime and violence. Developing an
integrated citizen security policy, fomenting credibility of justice enforcers, enhancing the
performance of public institutions responsible for preventing crime and violence and
enforcing the rule of law, and strengthening public and private sector performance against
organized crime remain key issues identified by the Lobo administration. The proposed
operation supports the violence prevention strategy and inter-institutional coordination
mechanism of the Government’s integrated citizen security policy (Política Integral de
Seguridad y Convivencia Ciudadana 2011-2022).

             IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

Link to Country Partnership Strategy

42.      The proposed operation supports progress toward the strategic objectives of
expanding opportunities through reducing vulnerabilities, and improving citizen
security included in the new Country Program Strategy (CPS, Report No. 63370-HN).
The CPS aims to support: (i) consolidation of macroeconomic stability and fiscal
management; (ii) poverty reduction and higher employment as the basis for social stability;
(iii) efforts to improve governance; (iv) improved citizen security; and (v) the continued
implementation of the current portfolio in support of the CAS pillars. The proposed DPC is
the first programmatic lending operation envisaged in the CPS and would contribute to the
objectives of macro stability and fiscal management as well as improved citizen security.

Relationship to Other Bank Operations

43.     The proposed DPC is linked to the Improving Public Sector Performance
Technical Assistance Project (P110050) geared to address human resource management
issues, among other areas (US$18 million). The Government is committed to consolidating
a sustainable wage bill, with growth limited to 10.1 percent of GDP in 2011 and 10 percent of
GDP in 2012. In the area of human resources management, the new public sector operation
will provide technical assistance to the Government to support its efforts to control personnel
expenditures and improve civil service professionalization in selected institutions. The project
will contribute strengthening control of personnel expenditures through the implementation of
the following payroll audits: (i) transactions-based payroll audit for the Health Secretariat
focusing on contracted personnel and for the Public Works Secretariat focusing on temporary
personnel on wages (jornales), both groups with payrolls parallel to the Government’s
integrated financial management system (SIAFI); and (ii) process-based payroll audit for
central administration institutions. Given the political sensitivity of these issues, the project
will also finance a communications strategy to advise the government on the political
economy aspects of the process.

44.     The Bank will also consider how its portfolio, even those projects that do not
directly address these issues, can play a role in reducing crime and violence. These
include the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project with its focus on payment systems,
the Quality of Education Project aimed at preparing graduates for the workforce, and the
Nutrition and Social Protection Project that supports skills development and placement
services for youth at risk. Moreover, the Barrio Ciudad operation which combines the
delivery of basic services via urban upgrading, combined with social prevention interventions
in poor urban neighborhoods, the JSDF grant for Employment Generation in Poor Urban
Neighborhoods accompanying the Barrio Ciudad operation, should all be seen as part of this
package of interventions with potential to contribute to enhancing citizen security and
addressing crime and violence in Honduras.

Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

45.    The complexity of the Honduran economy calls for the coordinated engagement
of key donors. The proposed operation has been prepared in close consultation with the IMF

                                               17
and IDB as part of a coordinated multilateral effort to support the Government’s agenda to
consolidate fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability. The IDB is preparing a similar
operation supporting civil service and pension reform.24 In 2010, the IMF Board approved a
blended 18-month arrangements supported under the Stand-By Credit Facility and the Stand-
By Arrangement with a total access of 100 percent of quota (about US$202 million).
According to the IMF, all the quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2011 were fully
met after the second review.

46.     The IMF program covers five reform areas. First, the program foresees strict
control of current spending and government employment, aiming at a public sector deficit no
greater than 3.1 percent of GDP for 2011. Second, it calls for an improvement in the financial
situation of public sector enterprises. Third, it establishes a ceiling for new non-concessional
debt. Fourth, it foresees a reduction of the actuarial deficits of the public pension systems.
Finally, it seeks to strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank. In addition, the IMF
is providing technical assistance on multi-annual budgeting, revenue projection, resolution of
arrears and tax administration.

47.     In addition, the Bank is working on the security agenda in collaboration with the
G-16 donor group on justice and security in Honduras. This group consists of the
European Union, UNDP, the Spanish Cooperation, USAID, the US State Department, JICA,
IDB, and CIDA. A matrix on projects and technical assistance to be funded by the
international cooperation has been prepared by the donor group. In addition, the Bank will
work with the Friends of Central America, a multi donor coordination group created in 2010
to coordinate citizen security initiatives in Central America. The Bank is also working in close
collaboration with UNDP, which has been advising the Ministry of Security on the national
citizen security policy and the Safer Municipalities program (Municipios mas seguros), which
defines a strategy at the local level. The Bank will continue to promote partnerships with key
donors working on violence prevention in Honduras, such as USAID and KFW. The Bank
will continue to promote partnerships with key donors such as the European Commission and
the IDB that are designing large citizen security operations in the country. IDB has also
expressed interest in coordinating with the Bank the provision of technical assistance related
to the design of an action for the citizen security and co-existence integral policy. The Bank is
also discussing with the European Commission opportunities for joint analytical work and
collaborative interventions on violence prevention.

Lessons Learned

48.      Four main lessons from the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (FY05), and the
First Programmatic Financial Sector Development Policy Credit (FY05) have been
incorporated into the design of this DPC. Both operations were rated moderately
satisfactory. In addition, emerging lessons from the Fiscal Emergency Recovery Development
Policy Credit (FY10) were taken into account. The lessons include:

    Ownership of reforms is critical for a successful outcome. The satisfactory outcome of
     previous lending operations is to a large extent a consequence of exclusively supporting

24
  Both the Bank and the IDB support the same reforms through the budget support operations in pensions and civil service.
The technical assistance activities provided by both institutions are complementary, as the IDB’s support focuses on the legal
aspects while the Bank’s support has been in the technical aspects of the reforms.
                                                             18
    government-led initiatives. A continued technical and policy dialogue with the authorities
    and their technical team was important to maintaining the authorities’ ownership and
    commitment.

   Strong analytical underpinnings and links to Bank investment lending provides the
    foundation for a well-designed development policy operation. The key pieces of
    Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and the Country Financial Accountability and
    Procurement Assessment Report (CFAA/CPAR) not only contributed to the design of the
    previous lending operation, but also helped inform the reform efforts of the Government
    and supported a fruitful policy dialogue.

   Effective donor coordination during project preparation is important. To avoid
    conflicting policy advice and have a stronger voice in the policy dialogue with the
    Government, it was important to coordinate with the IDB, IMF, EU, and other donors
    during program preparation.

   Policy lending should support reforms under implementation. The PRSC relied on the
    future approval of legislative instruments to advance many of the key reforms, which was
    not very effective. In the case of the proposed operation, an intensive policy dialogue and
    technical assistance helped the Government complete most of the prior actions during the
    preparation phase of the credit, including legislative approval of necessary laws and
    decrees. In line with the lessons learned from the PRSC, however, the majority of
    measures are administrative in nature and do not require approval by Congress.

Analytical Underpinnings

49.    The design of the proposed operation is backed up by solid analytical work
conducted by the Bank, IDB, and IMF. The substantial body of analytical work has
provided the basis for an in-depth dialogue with the Government and has supported the design
of the DPC. Table 2 shows the links between the components included in the DPC and the
recommendations provided by recent analytical work.

(WB 2007)
                                   The pension system in Honduras is facing financial problems due to
                                   structural and design problems. An aging population, early retirement age,
                                   and low contribution ratios in most of the system’s institutions have resulted

Challenge
(WB, 2011)                         The economic costs of crime and violence in Honduras have been estimated
                                   at nearly 10 percent of Honduras’ GDP (approximately US$900 million a
                                   year). It is estimated that reducing homicide rates by 10 percent could boost

Honduras, Criminal justice and   Increases in crime and violence in Honduras have exacerbated existing
Human Rights (Draft)             institutional weaknesses and the lack of inter-institutional coordination
WB (2011)                        among criminal justice institutions.

                                 A coordinated effort is needed among the executive, judiciary, and
                                 legislative branches to develop a national security and criminal policy with a
                                 human rights perspective and a strategic plan to implement it. To date a
                                 number of legal reforms aimed at strengthening judicial independence have
                                 had poor and limited results.

                                 In Honduras, criminal procedure reforms have been a first step in a long
                                 process that still needs significant improvement. In this regard, it is critical   4.1
                                 to create modern management systems for the various entities responsible
                                 for the new procedures. A coordinated effort is needed among the executive,
                                 judiciary, and legislative branches to develop a comprehensive security and
                                 criminal policy with a human rights perspective and a strategic plan to
                                 implement it. The study also recommends that a national integrated
                                 intelligence platform be created. Such a platform would be designed to
                                 facilitate criminal investigations of organized crime and would integrate a
                                 database with information from different sources.



Institutional Governance         Honduras has undertaken important reforms since the early 1980s to
Review. Strengthening            strengthen the justice sector as a key element in good governance, and its
Performance Accountability in    role in improving public security. These reforms include the adoption of
Honduras. The World Bank,        legal changes, the creation or expansion of key organizations, and the
2010.                            allocation of additional human, financial, and material resources. In spite of
                                 the reforms, Hondurans are still demanding general improvements to the
                                 justice system, particularly with regard to security.

                                 Compared to regional and international standards, the productivity of all
                                 sector institutions is very low. In a country with one of the highest crime
                                 rates in the region, the performance of all actors in the criminal justice chain
                                 is disappointingly poor.                                                           4.1

                                 The police seem to be the weakest link in the criminal justice chain and
                                 perhaps a key element to achieving improvement in overall performance.
                                 New programs to finance equipment and infrastructure and a series of
                                 outreach initiatives aimed at bringing the police closer to the community
                                 and fostering citizen cooperation hold some promise. However, what is
                                 needed most is organizational restructuring, efforts to improve the quality of
                                 existing staff and to attract more qualified recruits, a more efficient control
                                 of performance (including information systems, which are significantly
                                 underdeveloped), better coordination among all parties, and the formulation
                                 of policies for the overall sector.

                                     V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
Operation Description

50.     The proposed operation supports the Government’s efforts to launch a number
of structural reforms that will help to consolidate the foundations for growth by
achieving fiscal sustainability and reducing crime and violence. More specifically, the
operation’s development objective is to assist the Government in strengthening fiscal
management and the institutional mechanisms and programs responsible for an integrated
violence prevention strategy. To achieve these objectives, the operation supports key
structural reforms in four components: (i) tax administration; (ii) pension reform; (iii) civil
service reform; and (iv) citizen security.

Policy Areas

Component 1: Tax Administration

Background

51.     Tax collections increased slightly in 2010 but remain below pre-crisis levels. In
part as a result of the recently approved tax reforms, revenue as a share of GDP increased
from 14.6 percent in 2009 to 14.8 percent in 2010. Direct tax revenues rose from 4.8 percent
in 2009 to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2010, indirect taxes increased from 9 percent to 9.1 percent
of GDP and tariffs increased from 0.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2010
(Table 3).

52.     Tax collections have not met expectations partly because of weaknesses in tax
administration. The 0.2 percent of GDP increase in overall tax revenues in 2010 reflects the
combined effect of new tax measures with an expected yield of 0.8 percent of GDP and
implicit revenue losses of about 0.6 percent of GDP, partly attributable to weak tax
administration. The Dirección Ejecutiva de Ingresos (DEI) identified important operational
capacity constraints that explained the underperformance of tax collection units. In particular,
the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU), responsible for collecting close to 80 percent of Central
Government revenues, had important operational deficiencies. In addition, DEI recognized the
importance of applying measures to facilitate tax administration and reduce tax exemptions.25

Government Actions

53.     The Government is committed to ensuring full implementation of the tax
administration reforms by focusing on substantial improvements of the operational
capacity of the large taxpayer unit in the course of the year. Modern tax administrations
develop strategies for administering different categories of taxpayers, recognizing the
different risks, requirements, and their contribution to the overall tax revenues. By segmenting
taxpayers into groups that share similar characteristics, modern tax administrations can better
understand the compliance risks each segment possesses and better customize enforcement
and service strategies to deal more effectively with these risks. A frequent approach to
taxpayer segmentation is to distinguish taxpayer by their size, usually by dividing taxpayer
base into three market segments, that is, large, medium, and small taxpayer. However, this
approach takes into account not only their contribution to revenue but also their behavior and
characteristics. In fact, a common feature in almost every country is that a small group of
large taxpayers (the largest 1-2 percent of taxpayers) account for the bulk of tax revenue
(between 70-80 percent of total revenue collection). These large taxpayers share some other
distinct characteristics apart from their significant contribution to revenue collection. These
entities are typically legal entities and are often corporate groups with overseas branches, they
are often involved in complex international transactions, and they have access to advice from
accounting and legal professionals. Also, new IT developments, including tax registry, e-
filing and taxpayer services are tested in a small portion of taxpayers, like LTU, and then
extended to the whole taxpayer base. Similar strategies are being used for control and
enforcement. Other actions include to achieve this goal include the approval of the anti-
evasion law that strengthens tax administration and the upcoming assessment of tax
exemptions. The Government recognized that the approval of the anti-evasion law was crucial
to ensure that the full benefits of the tax reforms are realized.

54.    Tax administration represents a key pillar of the Government’s fiscal
consolidation strategy. The DEI executive board has approved its project plan to strengthen
the Large Taxpayers Unit.26 As a first step, the DEI approved and implemented the large
26
  Strengthening the large taxpayer unit with a specific focus on tax audit is one of the most critical aspects of the tax
administration reform in Honduras. In effect, less than 1 percent of taxpayers (621 taxpayers are assigned to the LTU)
accounts for almost 80 percent of tax revenue. DEI’s strategy is aligned with international good practices and hinges on three
                                                             23
taxpayer inclusion criteria and carried out a census of large taxpayers, resulting in a total of
621 taxpayers who account for about 80 percent of revenues. Other measures are already
underway and include: (i) signing agreements to file tax returns electronically; (ii) including
taxpayers in the reporting system and electronic tax payments; and (iii) selecting and training
of LTU auditors according to international best practices.

                             Box 2. Project Plan of the Large Taxpayer Unit

Short term (through December 2011)
• Establish an organizational structure for the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU).
• Strengthen the San Pedro Sula LTU in terms of personnel and equipment.
• Establish an inventory of existing tax exemptions and special regimes.
• Implement selective control for credit notes.
• Approve the regulations of Decree 17/2010 on electronic billing.
• Start regular controls and reduce the number of noncompliant large taxpayers to less than 3 percent by the end
of the year.
• Increase the number of taxpayers who register to file on-line to at least 80 percent by the end of the year and
increase the number of e-filing returns to at least 50 percent for the Value Added Tax (VAT) and 30 percent for
the Corporate Income Tax (CIT).
• Increase the percentage of electronic payments of the VAT, income tax, and withholdings.
• Create an Information Technology Commission to determine development priorities for different areas.
• Prepare an action plan to turn contract workers into permanent staff for IT personnel.
• Create a unit in charge of developing audit technical guidelines for the different economic sectors.
• Develop the audit guidelines for the mining sector or other strategic economic sector.
• Strengthen training in the development of audit guidelines and auditing.

Medium term (2012)
• Centralize planning in the LTU.
• Establish a registry of special regimes and exemptions.
• Develop a control system for the authorization of returns and exempt purchases.
• Swap credit letters to facilitate the control of existing stock and prevent fraudulent use.
• Develop an electronic invoice system.
• Develop audit manuals for each economic sector and establish a medium-term training plan.


Expected Results

55.      Tax administration and policy reforms will contribute to higher Central
Government tax collection by tapping into a larger tax base and ensuring greater
compliance. It is expected that the number of large taxpayers filing electronically will
increase by at least 10 percent by December 2012. Improved control, combined with the
effect of the recent tax policy reforms, is expected to result in an increase in the tax-to-GDP
ratio from 14.8 percent in 2010 to about 15.3 percent in 2012.




pillars: use of risk-based criteria to select taxpayers for audit, sectors specialization, and targeted training programs to
increase auditors' skills. In addition, it is expected that the LTU will be used as a pilot with a view to replicating revamped
business processes in other units.

                                        Box 3: Prior Actions – Tax Reform
     Improve tax administration

     To improve taxpayer compliance, the Government has: (i) approved a plan to strengthen the large taxpayer unit
     within DEI, as evidenced by Agreement DEI SG 118-2011, dated May 16, 2011, and published in the
     Recipient’s Official Gazette on October 25, 2011; and (ii) approved a registry of large taxpayers, as evidenced by
     Agreement DEI SG 043-2011, dated March 18, 2011, and published in the Recipient’s Official Gazette on June
     25, 2011.


Government’s medium-term reform agenda

56.     The Government is committed to further strengthening tax administration as
evidenced by the implementation of the project plan of the LTU and the reduction in the
number of incompliant large taxpayers by 2.5 percent by December 2012. Among the
measures to be implemented are: a) to elaborate a report at the end of the day of those who
have not filed their returns, b) to implement a system for sending reminders and c) to make a
telephone follow-up plan for incompliant tax-payers. These measures are considered crucial
to sustaining an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio over time. The Government has hired a
consultant to assist with the implementation of these reforms.

57.     A number of medium-term measures are planned to make customs and tax
administration more effective. These include the adoption of legislation on transfer pricing
and a tax procedural code, the creation of the office of control of tax exemptions, and
improvements in the application of rules of origin in customs.27 The adoption of transfer
pricing rules is a trigger for the next operation.




27
   Transfer pricing refers to the setting, analysis, documentation, and adjustment of charges made between related parties for
goods, services, or use of property (including intangible property). Transfer prices among components of an enterprise may
be used to reflect allocation of resources among such components, or for other purposes. OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
state, ―Transfer prices are significant for both taxpayers and tax administrations because they determine in large part the
income and expenses, and therefore taxable profits, of associated enterprises in different tax jurisdictions.‖
Many governments have adopted transfer pricing rules that apply in determining or adjusting income taxes of domestic and
multinational taxpayers. The OECD has adopted guidelines followed, in whole or in part, by many of its member countries in
adopting rules. The rules of nearly all countries permit related parties to set prices in any manner, but permit the tax
authorities to adjust those prices where the prices charged are outside an arm's length range. Rules are generally provided for
determining what constitutes such arm's length prices, and how any analysis should proceed. Prices actually charged are
compared to prices or measures of profitability for unrelated transactions and parties. The rules generally require that market
level, functions, risks, and terms of sale of unrelated party transactions or activities be reasonably comparable to such items
with respect to the related party transactions or profitability being tested.
Most systems allow use of multiple methods, where appropriate and supported by reliable data, to test related party prices.
Among the commonly used methods are comparable uncontrolled prices, cost plus, resale price or markup, and profitability
based methods. Many systems differentiate methods of testing goods from those for services or use of property due to
inherent differences in business aspects of such broad types of transactions. Some systems provide mechanisms for sharing or
allocation of costs of acquiring assets (including intangible assets) among related parties in a manner designed to reduce tax
controversy.
Most tax treaties and many tax systems provide mechanisms for resolving disputes among taxpayers and governments in a
manner designed to reduce the potential for double taxation. Many systems also permit advance agreement between taxpayers
and one or more governments regarding mechanisms for setting related party prices.
Many systems impose penalties where the tax authority has adjusted related party prices. Some tax systems provide that
taxpayers may avoid such penalties by preparing documentation in advance regarding prices charged between the taxpayer
and related parties. Some systems require that such documentation be prepared in advance in all cases.

Component 2: Pension Reform

Background
58.     The Honduran mandatory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) system is implemented by
five institutions covering 645,833 contributing members. The system reaches 21 percent of
the working age population ages 20 to 60 and 10 percent of the population over 60 years old
(48,903 beneficiaries) (Table 4). Contributions in 2010 were L$6,155 million (2.1 percent of
GDP), and benefits and expenses amounted to L$4,938 million (1.7 percent of GDP). The
system had a combined net worth of L$52,410 million (17.8 percent of GDP) at the end of
December 2010.

59.      The system is facing financial problems due to structural design issues. An aging
population, early retirement ages, and low contribution ratios in most of the system’s
institutions have resulted in cash-flow situations that cannot ensure benefit payments in the
long term. In addition, in the case of INPREMA it has been affected by poor management.

60.     INPREMA and INJUPEMP28 have reached critical actuarial situations, as cash
payments have exceeded, or will shortly exceed, cash inflows. These institutions jointly
account for 19 percent of contributors and 48 percent of retirees. To ensure continuity of
operations, they need to introduce parametric changes in their operational rules. Due to their
legal structures, the changes need to be introduced by law.

61.     INPREMA is already facing an operational deficit: contributions are not
sufficient to cover the payment of benefits and expenses. During the first five months of

28
   INPREMA (Instituto Nacional de Previsión del Magisterio) serves the private sector and public sector teachers, and
INJUPEMP (Instituto Nacional de Jubilación y Pensiones de los Empleados Públicos) covers Central Government civil
servants.
                                                                                   26
2011, the institution has accumulated an operational deficit of approximately L$35 million.
The actuarial deficit of L$78,271 million (equivalent to about 25 percent of GDP) is four
times bigger than INPREMA’s net worth. There are approximately 10,400 active participants
who have reached retirement age. Considering the present mean pension of L$10,966 a
month, the additional annual pension payments these participants would require under current
rules—if they were to retire now—is equivalent to approximately L$1,600 million.29 This
amount would make the cash flow situation unsustainable and put pension payments at risk.

62.     INJUPEMP has an operational surplus but the actuarial deficit30 of L$32,250
million (equivalent to about 11 percent of GDP) is approximately two times bigger than
the institute’s net worth of L$15,208 million. By 2014, it is expected that benefits and
operational expenses will surpass contributions. If nothing is done, cash-flow actuarial
projections indicate the net worth will be consumed by 2030.

63.    The Instituto de Seguridad Social de Honduras (IHSS) faces financial problems
stemming from both its health and pensions obligations. The IHSS manages private sector
and municipal employee’s pensions, and medical and workers’ insurance. The premium
charged to provide medical coverage—8 percent on capped salaries—has been insufficient to
pay operational expenses. This situation has prompted IHSS management to transfer (―lend‖)
money from the pension area to cover the shortfall in the health area. Continuing to do this
will jeopardize future pension payments. IHSS net worth of L$10,595 million represents
approximately 28 times the amount of annual pensions and operational expenses in 2010
(L$376 million). However, the average age profile of its participants is low. In addition, they
have displayed significant job turnover, so many of them do not reach the minimum
requirements for a pension. Existing rules allow participants who do not qualify for a pension
to withdraw their personal contributions. However, the same rules dictate that employers’
contributions remain in the pool of IHSS assets. This situation provides a windfall increase in
assets that could partly cover remaining participants’ future payments. However, this
mechanism to cover future needs is not in the spirit of an equitable social contract.

64.     Cash flow for the Instituto Nacional de Previsión de la Universidad Autónoma de
Honduras (INPREUNAH) is suffering from an irregular pattern of employer’s
contributions from the Universidad Autónoma de Honduras (UNAH). The institute started
operations with actuarial liabilities from existing participants as well as from already retired
university personnel. This actuarial liability was not compensated and, when combined with
the irregular employer contributions, complicates the payment of present benefits. An
actuarial study was done in 2009, but it needs to be revised to be consistent with the criteria
used by Comision Nacional de Bancos y Seguros (CNBS, National Commission of Banks and
Insurance Agencies) for other pension institutes.

65.     In December 2006, the Government reformed the Instituto de Previsión Militar
(IPM), which covers active members of the armed forces and civilian personnel. The
reform included an increase in the population of contributors. Police and firefighters (almost
24,000 participants) were transferred from INJUPEMP to increase the low base of
contributors (4,000). Parametric reforms were also introduced—including a higher retirement
age, longer contribution periods and elevated contributions.

Government Actions

66.     The IHSS’s cash flow has been improved by the increase in the maximum
contributory salary to L$7,000. As of June 2011 the previous cap on contributing salaries
(L$4,800) was increased by 46 percent. This increase is significant because a higher portion
of participant's salary will be used to calculate the contribution to the IHSS. However, the
new cap is slightly over the minimum salary and further increases might be needed.

67.     In 2011, the government drafted and sent to Congress new laws for INPREMA
and INJUPEMP, substantially modifying rules and regulations to improve their
actuarial situations. The most important changes for both include: income from the 13th and
14th monthly paychecks will be subject to pension contributions; the number of months to
compute the final mean salary (on which benefits are based) will increase gradually from 36
to 180 months; use of International Accounting Standards (IAS 19 & 26) and Guidelines from
the International Actuarial Association will be mandatory to prepare Financial Statements
(including the actuarial valuation as notes); and governance will be improved (selection of
Board Members based on merit, CNBS as Regulator and Supervisor). Additional changes
include increases in minimum retirement age, contribution rates, and the minimum years of
services needed to achieve a full pension (Table 5).

                        Table 5: Specific actions for INPREMA and INJUPEMP

68.     The new INPREMA law has a mandatory retirement age of 65 years; however,
existing contributors could retire earlier. Table 6 shows the requirements to submit a
retirement application if the retiree is 56 years or older. These retirement applications will be
prioritized according to a formula based on applicant’s age and years of service. To ensure a
stable financial situation over a projected period of 20 years, the projection of the new
pension payments, including the payments for these retirees that qualify for early retirement,
during that period should be consistent with a projected net worth that is not diminished in
real terms.

69.     The Government regularized the situation of teachers from the Honduran
Program for Community Education known as PROHECO (Programa Hondureño de
Educación Comunitaria). The PROHECO program was created in early 1999 as a policy
action to help improve the coverage, quality and accountability of education in the most
relegated areas of the country. PROHECO teachers faced criticism from their public school
counterparts on the basis of the lack of qualifications that these new teachers had, on average,
compared to their peers in regular public schools. Since the dispute had legal grounds, a new
set of regulations for the appointment of educational staff with no formal teacher training had
to be issued to validate these teachers as public servants.31 Ever since the creation of the
PROHECO program, though, these teachers started earning salaries and began sending
personal and employer contributions to INPREMA. Yet, they were never formally registered
in INPREMA and, after six years of full contribution (1999-2005), INPREMA stopped
receiving any of their contributions. The situation then turned into one where: a) original
contributions were never returned back to the PROHECO program; b) PROHECO teachers
were left without contributions and without the access to any social security benefits for the
ensuing years (2005-2011). The situation changed, finally, in June 2010, when INPREMA
issued the Resolution N°4364-1515-2010, by which it was decided that the PROHECO
teachers had to be affiliated with INPREMA. In August 2011, a Tripartite Commission
(INPREMA, SEFIN, and SEDUC) was formed to prepare a Tripartite Agreement for
Affiliating the PROHECO teachers retroactively to March 1999, when the Program first
started, and to settle on the obligations of the parties in regards to the floating debt for pension
contributions since the year 2005, when INPREMA stopped receiving any such related
transfers on behalf of PROHECO teachers. The Tripartite Commission also worked on a
complementary Agreement, to be signed between SEFIN and INPREMA, laying out a
repayment schedule for the aforementioned debt. Both Agreements have been finalized. As a
result, authorities committed to registering the amount of pending contributions to the
teachers’ pension plan as floating debt in the SIAFI and SIGADE, and the Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Education, and INPREMA created a Tripartite Commission to lay out a
repayment schedule for the outstanding debt and for incorporating the PROHECO teachers
into the INPREMA.32

Expected Results

70.     The pension system’s financial condition will improve as result of the measures.
The combined introduction of the parametric reforms will reduce the INPREMA’s actuarial
deficit by 43 percent and by 51 percent in the case of the INJUPEMP. The parametric changes
introduced in the laws will provide a solid base and cash flow consolidation which in turn will
substantially reduce the actuarial deficit for both institutions. Improved governance will set
the stage for adequate administrative, and investment performance. In the case of INPREMA,
the increase of the retirement age to 65 together with prioritization of future pension payments
will stabilize its net worth in real terms for the next 20 years. The Government’s long-term
agenda includes the reform of the IHSS separating the Pension from Health.


31
  This was accomplished by the issuance of the Executive Agreement N°369-01 signed on July 13, 2001.
32
   This will be operationalized through the production of three instruments: a) a Tripartite Agreement formalizing the
Incorporation of the PROHECO teachers into INPREMA; b) a Tripartite Agreement formalizing the scheme for the
repayment of the floating debt of PROHECO teachers with INPREMA in a period of 5 years starting in 2012; c) the inclusion
of an article in the Special Clauses of the National Budget 2012 securing the resources to honor the payment of the first
installment of the floating debt in 2012.
                                                          29
71.     Increasing the base of IPM contributors will improve the institute’s actuarial
prospects. Additional contributions will bring immediate resources to cover present
payments, balancing the cash flow and allowing for the building of reserves for the near
future. However, detailed actuarial projections will be needed to validate the institute’s long-
term stability.

72.    PROHECO teachers will have their situation regularized. The commitments and
agreements reached bring to an end the uncertainty over which institution should pay the
pensions of these teachers. Having been signed, the teachers now have the same pension
coverage as the teachers participating in INPREMA.

                                Box 4: Prior Actions – Pension Reform
 Reform the public pension systems

 To reduce the actuarial deficits of the public pension systems, the Government has: (i) submitted to Congress, for
 approval thereof, a bill of law to reform INPREMA’s pension system, as evidenced by acknowledgement
 (Constancia), dated November 28, 2011 signed by the first secretary of Congress; and (ii) submitted to
 Congress, for approval thereof, a bill of law to reform INJUPEMP’s pension system, as evidenced by
 acknowledgement (Constancia) signed by the first secretary of Congress, dated April 26, 2011.

 To regularize the pension regime for the PROHECO teachers, the Government has formalized the incorporation
 of the PROHECO teachers to the INPREMA pension system as of the date each said teacher was appointed, as
 evidenced by: (i) agreement signed among SEFIN, SE and INPREMA (Convenio de Afiliación), dated October
 27, 2011; and (ii) agreement signed by SEFIN with INPREMA to cancel the Recipient’s debt to INPREMA with
 respect to teachers’ and employers’ contributions (Convenio de Cancelación de Deuda), dated October 27, 2011.

 To strengthen the financial situation of IHSS, the Government has increased the maximum salary subject to
 contribution to IHSS, as evidenced by Resolution SOJD No. 02-29-03-2011, and published in the Official
 Gazette on June 17, 2011.



Government’s Medium-Term Reform Agenda

73.     The Government is working on a long-term plan to tackle remaining issues. They
include portability of contributions and developing an action plan to resolve issues IHSS faces
both in pensions and health.

74.     A new provision (Ley de transferencia de valores actuariales) will address
portability. Signing and implementing agreements mandated by the law will allow
participants to accumulate enough years of service and qualify for a proportional pension
from the institutes to which the participant has contributed.

75.     The increase in the IHSS’s maximum contributory salary is the continuation of a
healthy trend toward bringing more resources to the institute. In relative terms, however,
L$7,000 is low—almost equivalent to the minimum legal salary. The pension contribution
rate of 3.5 percent of the salary is very low compared with other Central American countries.
The cash flow situation of the IHSS health segment will require further intervention. In the
coming months, the Government will draft a new law to reform IHSS that separates the health
and pensions management, which is a trigger for the next DPC.

Component 3: Civil Service Reform

Background

76.     Achieving a fiscally sustainable wage bill remains a crucial challenge for
Honduras’ public administration. Steady increases in teachers’ pay and benefits in 2006-
2009, combined with ineffective controls over the creation of new posts and payroll
management, pushed personnel expenditures from 8.3 percent to 11 percent of GDP, or about
75 percent of tax revenues. In particular, the largest jump in the wage bill was in 2009 when
the salaries increased by more than 20 percent. Teachers’ pay accounted for 53 percent of the
Government’s wage bill in 2010; teachers were approximately 57 percent of the public
sector’s workforce. The teachers’ salaries in Honduras are among the highest in Latin
America (See Section IV) and are about 7 times higher than the private sector minimum
wage.

77.    Since 2010, the Government has made significant efforts to contain personnel
expenditures, particularly in the education sector, but these changes will need to be
sustained over time. A teachers’ payroll audit in 2010 has allowed the Government to
eliminate ghost workers and stop payment of incorrect allowances. Better controls over
payroll information systems by SEFIN have strengthened the Government’s capacity to
contain the number of teacher positions. The new controls align the actual positions with
those authorized by the budget and prevent potential mistakes when calculating and
processing payments. The Government has frozen the teachers’ pay per class hour between
2010 and October 2011 by temporarily delinking base pay from the private sector’s minimum
wage and not adjusting for inflation.33 The audit and elimination of anomalies were mostly
one-time efforts. However, the Government will need to continually enhance controls in the
next years and seek a more sustainable and at the same time politically viable solution.

78.    Control over the creation of new positions and pay negotiation are areas of
particular concern. SEFIN and the Civil Service Agency lack legal or management control
instruments over the creation of new positions, particularly in the education sector and the
decentralized administration. In addition, negotiations with trade unions have been
fragmented due to the existence of more than eight different employment regimes.34 Different
provisions apply to different staff groups, which have sought to leap-frog each other to
preserve their benefit differentials. Legislative Decree 220/2003 (Ley de Reordenamiento del
Sistema Retributivo del Gobierno Central) regulates pay negotiations, basing them on
expected inflation. It provides a ceiling for the public sector’s consolidated wage bill as a
percentage of GDP, but the regulations and the limit were bypassed by the pay increases
granted to teachers during the Zelaya administration.




33
   The Teachers’ Statute indexes pay adjustments to increases in the average private sector minimum wage. See Legislative
Decree No. 136-1997, articles 46, 48 and 49. Legislative Decree No. 224-2010 suspended any pay measures established in
the statutes of special regimes during the period October 28, 2010 to October 27, 2011.
34
   These eight groups include the seven professional statutes (teachers, doctors, pharmaceutical chemists, dentists, social
workers, microbiologists and professional nurses) and the regular civil service. Military personnel and the police also
negotiate pay increases separately.
                                                           31
Government Actions

79.      The Government has sent a bill to Congress for containing wage bill growth by
anchoring pay negotiation for all public servants, including all special regimes, on the
previous year’s inflation level. By applying the same pay adjustment methodology for all
public servants, the draft bill, submitted to Congress in October 2011, would delink
permanently the teacher’s salary adjustments from the private sector minimum wage. The use
of the previous year’s inflation, as determined by the Central Bank, as the basis for pay
negotiation for all public servants, will enhance equity of pay increases while maintaining
purchasing power of public servants. The pay increase being negotiated between the
Government and the public sector trade unions following the approval of the proposed new
law is expected to end the wage freeze for teachers established since January 2010. The draft
bill aims to provide predictability for personnel expenditures growth and contribute to achieve
a fiscally sustainable wage bill in the medium term.

80.     The Government has also implemented stronger controls over payroll. Executive
Decree PCM-006-2011 created and implemented a Payroll Monitoring and Control Unit at
SEFIN to monitor overall payroll with an initial focus on teachers and the health sector. The
Government has also included teachers in the centralized database for payroll management
that links SIAFI and SIARH, increasing coverage from 23 percent to about 83 percent of all
central administration permanent staff. Finally, the Government has approved Executive
Decree PCM-032-2011, regulating the procedures for any measures that have a financial
impact on the education wage bill, including the authorizing mechanisms for processing the
education sector payroll. The Executive Decree will provide stronger controls to SEFIN by
linking authorized positions in the budget to the payroll, allowing online monitoring of
payments, and the introduction of automated controls in SIAFI to prevent payments without
available resources, among other control mechanisms.

Expected Results

81.     Anchoring pay negotiation with the previous year’s inflation level as determined
by the Central Bank of Honduras for all public servants, including all special regimes, is
fundamental to the Government’s objective of achieving a fiscally sustainable wage bill.
The proposed law provides predictability and control over the wage bill and would avoid the
scenario of fully applying the methodology established in the teachers’ statute (see Box 6).
Increased management controls are also expected to contribute to the same goal. The Central
Government’s wage bill is expected to be 9.9 percent of GDP in 2011, and then slowly
decrease in the following three years (Figure 6). Enhanced controls over the payroll will limit
the creation of new positions to those authorized in the budget and reduce potential mistakes
in calculating base pay and allowances.

Achieve a fiscally sustainable wage bill

To ensure equity of salary increases for all public servants, the Government has submitted to its Congress, for
approval thereof, a bill of law to establish a uniform pay adjustment methodology for all said public servants, as
evidenced by acknowledgement (Constancia) signed by the first secretary of Congress, dated October 28, 2011.

To strengthen the monitoring of the teacher's payroll, the Government has:

(i) Established a single database (SIARH-SIAFI) which accounts for over 80 percent of the Government's public
servants and includes all teachers, as evidenced by a letter from the Minister of SEFIN, dated October 27, 2011;

(ii) created a payroll management and control unit within SEFIN, as evidenced by Executive Decree PCM-006-
2011, dated February 8, 2011, and published in the Official Gazette on March 22, 2011; and

(iii) approved a consolidated set of norms regulating human resource management processes in the education
sector (Normas Unificadas Aplicables a la Gestión de Recursos Humanos Docentes), as evidenced by Executive
Agreement No 032-2011, date October 25, 2011, and published in the Official Gazette on October 25, 2011.

Box 6. Potential fiscal impact of the proposed law suspending pay adjustment methodologies for
                                          special regimes
Unlike all the other public sector employment regimes, teachers' pay adjustments are based on the private sector
minimum wage rather than on inflation levels. Article 46 of the Teachers’ Statute establishes that the class-hour
value for calculating teachers’ base pay will be based on a calculation using the average current minimum wage.
All teacher allowances, such as seniority and academic degrees, are in turn, determined following the class-hour
value. According to the 2011 Minimum Wage Agreement (No. STSS-223-2011), the applicable average
minimum wage would value the class-hour at L$ 129.94, compared to the current value of L$ 57.5 (or a 126
percent increase).

If the Teacher’s statue were to be applied in October 2011 by using the current minimum wage, personnel
expenditures in the education sector would skyrocket from L$ 17 billion in 2011 to more than L$46.5 billion in
2012, taking the overall Central Government’s wage bill from 10 percent of GDP to over 18 percent of GDP.

While the government has maintained a wage freeze on teachers since January 2010, this has been politically
difficult to sustain due to inflation levels. The proposed new law, supported by this DPC, applies a uniform pay
adjustment methodology to all public servants including special regimes, ends the wage freeze for teachers by
determining that pay increases will be based on the previous year’s inflation, and provides predictability and
control over public sector personnel expenditures. Thanks to this proposed law, the Central Government wage
bill is expected to reach 9.9 percent of GDP in 2011 and later stabilize below 10 percent during the period 2012-
2014.

Government’s Medium-Term Reform Agenda

82.      The Government is committed to achieving a fiscally sustainable wage bill by
having the proposed law approved by Congress and by strengthening controls over
payroll in other key sectors. In the meantime, 2012 Budget Law, expected to be approved in
December 2011 and which in Honduras is primary law, is expected to determine pay increases
for all public servants based on the previous year inflation level according to Central Bank
figures, as mandated by Legislative Decree 220/2003 (Ley de Reordenamiento del Sistema
Retributivo del Gobierno Central). The SEFIN-managed human resources database for
teachers, which is used for payroll management, is expected to be audited on a regular basis
and its equipment will be upgraded with support from a World Bank loan on human resource
management in education. A payroll audit exercise will ensure adequate controls are in place
in all central government institutions in each step of the payroll process to reduce the floating
debt related to personnel expenditures. Transactions-based payroll audits to check accuracy
of individual payments are planned in the Secretariats of Health and Public Works, where a
high number of contracted personnel are paid following manual processes parallel to SIAFI.
The transactions-based payroll audits in these two secretariats and the approval of the
proposed law suspending pay adjustment methodologies for special regimes are triggers for
the next DPC.

83.     Finally, the Government also plans to work towards achieving other key human
resource management objectives, such as improving the attraction and retention of
qualified personnel and the professionalization of the civil service. The Government is
already working on institutions such as the Department of Revenues and Customs and the
Banks and Insurance Commission to improve attraction and retention through the creation of
a differentiated pay scale and career structure and plans to introduce externally validated
merit-based selection and recruitment processes for selected positions in pilot institutions.

Component 4: Citizen Security

Background

84.     Honduras has lacked a comprehensive and integrated citizen security policy. The
systemic multi-sectoral/multi-causal nature of crime and violence has become one of the most
important obstacles to good governance, growth, human development, and economic
development in Honduras. Over the past decade, the Government has been unable to develop
a comprehensive and integrated policy that can meet this challenge. Efforts to prevent
violence by addressing its multiple causes have been marginal, underfunded, and sporadic. A
few innovative experiences at the municipal level have shown the importance of the local
level to coordinate actions that increase safety and peaceful co-existence.

85.     The dominant approach has been mostly reactive and focused on repression. In
the first half of the 2000s, the Government adopted an ―iron fist‖ (mano dura) approach,
framing citizen security as an objective that could be reached only through more repression.
Some of the key measures included: modifying the criminal code 10 times between 2003 and
2006 to define new crimes and harden penalties, passing an anti-maras law that made it a
crime to belong to a gang, and modifying the children's code in 2005 to allow for the
detention of juvenile criminals in high-security prisons and lower the age of legal
responsibility to 14 years.

86.      The previous administration began to develop a comprehensive policy on citizen
security. Based on executive decree No 095-2006, the Secretariat of Security drafted the
guidelines for an integrated citizen security policy (Bases de la Política Integral de Seguridad
Publica y Ciudadana. Lineamientos para el Plan Quinquenal 2008-2015). The Security
Secretariat has the mandate to develop strategies, plans, and programs on security related to
the public order, peaceful coexistence, violence prevention, criminal investigation, and citizen
safety. It also regulates issues related to migration and security, detention centers, and the
management and administration of the national police among other functions. The draft
guidelines for the citizen security policy addressed four key areas: (i) violence prevention, (ii)
reaction or coercion, (iii) rehabilitation, and (iv) reintegration. The guidelines were prepared
with the participation of a broad range of Government institutions and the active participation
of civil society organizations working on human rights and security issues, including the
Center of Investigation and Promotion of Human Rights (CIPRODEH) and the Women
Rights Center (CDM) among others. Government delays and the political crisis in 2009
hindered the guidelines’ approval by the Council of Ministers. Nevertheless, it has been an
important precedent and input for the National Citizen Security Policy recently approved by
the current administration. For instance, several recommendations included in the draft
guidelines for the public policy on citizen security have been included in the recently
approved integrated policy, such as the creation of a sub-secretariat of coexistence and
community participation, promotion of private sector participation in violence prevention
activities, and the creation of a National System of Citizen Security.35

87.     Measures to prevent crime and violence have been marginal thus far and
fragmented. In 2001, a national program for the prevention, rehabilitation, and social
reinsertion of mara members and gangs was created. However, it was not until 2005 that the
program actually started with a very small budget. Its approach goes beyond the issue of
gangs by addressing the risk factors that generate youth violence and exclusion. Recently the
program has received additional funds to carry out a public policy and national campaign on
violence prevention at the national and municipal levels. Programs on crime and violence
prevention are dispersed across government agencies without coordination or interaction with
each other (e.g., National Institute of Youth, National Institute of Women, Family and
Childhood Institute, etc). Nevertheless, some projects appear to be delivering positive results,
such as the World Bank funded Barrio Ciudad Program implemented by FHIS which
promotes community-based initiatives for violence prevention in 10 municipalities. In
addition, a new law, which creates a national council on coordination and the definition of the
social policy (Consejo Nacional de Coordinación y Articulación de Politicas Sociales
[CONCAPS]) has been approved by Congress. This council has the potential to be an
important platform for enhancing collaboration on violence prevention interventions among
government and civil society organizations working on the issue (e.g. FHIS, National Institute
of Youth, National Institute of Women, etc).

88.      While there has been progress in terms of strengthening inter-agency
coordination, there is room for improvement on the policy side. The Government has been
convening more regularly its Security, National Defense, and Governance Cabinet (Gabinete
de Seguridad, Defensa Nacional y Gobernabilidad) to achieve greater inter-ministerial
coordination within the executive branch.36 What has been missing is a mechanism for
coordination across branches of government (particularly between executive and judiciary)
and between national and local levels of government (see next section on establishment of
Citizen Security Council to address this). In addition, a key challenge for the Honduran
criminal justice institutions is to ensure that effective coordination mechanisms are in place,
and that the decisions of senior management are effectively implemented at the intermediate
and lower levels of each organization. More effective and simpler coordination instruments
are needed. An action plan to improve inter-institutional coordination among the agencies
involved in criminal justice and security is essential to ensuring effective implementation of
the citizen security and co-existence integral policy. (See Annex 7 for a description of key
institutions in security and justice sectors).

89.     Honduras has relatively weak information systems. The country lacks an integrated
information system capable of collecting, producing, and analyzing crime statistics. The
national police, the Attorney General’s Office, the judicial and health systems use different
definitions, methods, and practices to register and report crimes. Furthermore, the national
police lack unified instruments to collect data produced by different departments such as the
preventive, criminal investigation, special services, and traffic police. Therefore, information
on crime and criminal justice is contradictory, unreliable, and fragmented In this regard, the
National Violence Observatory, which is operating in the National University of Honduras,
has been created in Honduras as a mechanism to register, process, and analyze information on

36
   The Cabinet is comprised of the Secretariat of the Presidency, the Secretariat of Justice and Human Rights, the Secretariat
of the Interior and Population, the Secretariat of Security, the Secretariat of Defense, and the Secretariat of Planning and
International Cooperation. Its mandate is to ensure that the activities of the key actors involved in citizen security and justice
in the executive branch are in line with the main presidential priorities established in the Nation’s Plan.
                                                               36
crime and violence; however, it currently lacks the equipment and human resources needed
for an optimal performance. Municipal observatories have also been established in addition to
specific modules on violence against women and children.

90.     Local governments have been at the forefront of the innovations in citizen
security. Some municipalities, such as Puerto Cortes, have developed successful mechanisms
to raise security taxes and manage them transparently through a trust fund monitored by local
authorities, the private sector, and civil society organizations. In addition to the Bank financed
Barrio Ciudad program, UNDP has supported a program to increase local governments'
capacities to develop citizen security plans. The program is being carried out in coordination
with the Secretariat of Security in cities such as La Ceiba, Choloma, Juticalpa, Comayagua,
Choluteca, and Islas de la Bahia. IDB (with its project in the Sula Valley), the Spanish
cooperation, and USAID have also funded initiatives at the municipal level. Despite the
progress achieved so far, these efforts are isolated and lack evaluations to measure their
effectiveness.

Government Actions

91.      In early October 2011, the Government approved a comprehensive and
integrated National Citizen Security and Co-existence Policy for 2011-2022. This is the
first time the Government has adopted a policy that combines the traditional emphasis on
crime control with a strong emphasis on preventing crime and violence. This integrated policy
reflects the key principles and programs recommended by the guidelines for an integrated
citizen security policy in Honduras developed by the previous administration in consultation
with civil society organizations. It is the product of a long process of analysis, discussion, and
negotiations related to a comprehensive public policy on citizen security in the country. The
policy defines citizen security as the effective protection of a wide range of human rights,
specifically the right to life, the right to physical and emotional integrity and other rights
related to personal safety (security of one's home, freedom of movement, the right to personal
property), in addition to collective rights such as the freedom to access public spaces. The
strategy’s three pillars include: (i) strengthening national and local management of citizen
security policy, (ii) implementing programs on crime and violence prevention and social
cohesion with a human rights approach, and (iii) strengthening the infrastructure for security,
alternative justice, and the penitentiary system. The policy aims to address the main risk
factors (such as guns, drugs, gangs, lack of family and community cohesion) and protective
factors (such as a culture of prevention, availability of conflict resolution mechanism) that
influence crime and violence (Figure 7). The new policy acknowledges that sound decision-
making should be based on accurate and updated information, and thus envisions the
strengthening of criminal justice information systems, and the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Honduras’ Violence Observatory. The policy is being supported by a broad
coalition of international partners, including IDB, EU, USAID, CIDA, Spanish Cooperation,
GIZ, UNDP, and the Bank.

92.     In terms of institutional development, a critical reform introduced by the policy is
the creation of the National Citizen Security Council. The Citizen Security Council will
report directly to the president and will be given responsibility for the elaboration of the
policy’s action plan and its oversight mechanisms. The Council’s multi-stakeholder
composition will ensure that the National Citizen Security and Co-existence Policy is
implemented in a way that represents the views not only of the national Government through
the Security Cabinet, but also of the judiciary, local authorities, civil society, and the private
sector. This council is comprised of the President of the Republic, the Security Secretariat
(which will act as the technical secretary), the Secretariat of Interior and Population, the
Secretariat of Justice and Human Rights, the Office of the Attorney General, the national
police, the Supreme Court, line ministries and institutions working on crime and violence
prevention.37

93.    In terms of policy content, the innovation of this policy lies in its call for a
paradigmatic shift in the Government’s approach to citizen security. This shift can be
characterized as moving away from the traditional exclusive focus on law enforcement
measures towards one that complements it with a new emphasis on the social prevention of
crime and violence as evidenced by the inclusion of programs aimed at:
     Protecting youth and children at-risk of violence through a set of interventions that,
       among other things, strengthen parenting skills within dysfunctional families, establish
       social bonds between alienated youth and their communities, and prevent addiction to
       alcohol and drugs.
     Scaling up alternative dispute resolution mechanisms as a way to prevent that minor
       conflicts escalate into violent altercations by strengthening municipal justice offices
       and conflict mediation units, creating integrated justice centers, strengthening
       municipal counseling offices for women, and reforming legislation (see below).
     Building citizenship and culture of peace through programs that enable proper and
       safe use and enjoyment of public spaces, promote social and economic inclusion of
       vulnerable populations by building their life and work skills, civic competences, and
       their disposition to become agents of social change.
     Promoting road safety through the formulation of a national road safety policy,
       mainstreaming road safety principles in the construction of road infrastructure and
       promoting behavioral changes among all road users through education and awareness
       campaigns.

94.    The recent passage of the population security law (Ley de Seguridad Poblacional),
creating new taxes to finance security and social prevention programs, increases the
chances that these institutional and policy innovations will deliver concrete results (see
Box 7). Addressing the escalation of violence in a sustainable manner requires the
mobilization of additional resources. Following the example of successful countries like
Colombia in creating new specific taxes to finance additional security programs, on
September 13, 2011 Congress approved a security tax law.38 Revenues from the new law
should help boost the share of the budget allocated to security in Honduras, which is

37
   In addition, the National Council of Interior Security (Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Interior or CONASIN) was created
in 2008 as a body through which civil society and private sector could advice the Security Secretariat in policy design and
implementation. The performance of CONASIN has yielded mixed results and the Government is reviewing its role.
38
   Congress approved in June 2011 an initial version of the Population Security Law but was modified significantly in
September 2011.
                                                           39
approximately 10 percent of the total budget, lower than El Salvador (19 percent of the total
budget), Guatemala (13 percent of the total budget) and Nicaragua (12 percent of the total
budget). From 2006 to 2010, security expenditures in Honduras have increased about 76
percent, while total crime and homicides have also increased during this time frame
(homicides increased from 46 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2006 to 77.5 per 100,000 inhabitants
in 2010). A thorough review of the security and justice sectors budgets will shed light on
challenges and opportunities for improving budget allocation within citizen security.39


        Box 7. Taxes created by the Population Security Law (Ley de Seguridad Poblacional)

Recognizing the importance of collecting additional revenues for security programs and following the example
of Colombia and other countries that have needed to resort to novel taxes for this purpose, the Honduran
congress created the following new taxes which are expected to yield revenues of about 0.3 percent of GDP
annually:
 A 0.2 percent financial transactions tax on withdrawals from individual checking accounts and corporate
    saving accounts with a monthly average balance greater than 120,000 lempiras. Remittances and
    transactions from the public sector among others are exempted.
 A tax on annual renewals of credit cards. The tax ranges from 500 to 1000 lempiras and depends upon the
    credit’s card limit.
 A 2 percent tax on FOB exports from mining companies.
 A 1 percent tax on the mobile phone industry’s service monthly gross income.
 A 0.5 percent tax on the food and beverage industry’s monthly gross income under special tax exemption
    regimes.

Expected results

95.     The creation of the Citizen Security Council and the social prevention emphasis
of the Citizen Security and Co-existence Policy are expected to deliver a diverse set of
results in the short, medium, and long term. On the institutional side, greater coordination
across sectors and levels of government should result in more comprehensive and integrated
municipal security plans, which in turn should help reduce the sense of insecurity and fear of
crime and violence as well as the opportunities for crime through situational prevention
interventions. Increased access to alternative conflict resolution mechanisms and campaigns
aimed at promoting a culture of peace should reduce the levels of conflict and violent crime.
Increased economic, educational, and leisure opportunities for at-risk youth could reduce the
number of youth joining criminal gangs. Finally, improved collaboration and strengthening of
the security and criminal justice sectors may lower impunity rates, and lead to overall
improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of sector expenditures.




39
    The distribution of the budget has remained almost constant, with the largest share allocated to operational expenses (79.4
percent in 2009 and 77.3 percent in 2010). Most notably, from 2009 to 2010 almost 10 percent of the budget in security
shifted from crime prevention to institutional building. The budget allocated to prevention declined from 11.4 percent to 2.7
percent from 2009 to 2010, while the budget allocated to institutional building increased from 5.3 percent in 2009 to 15.2
percent in 2010. While these trends are not very different from the distribution of the budget in other countries in the region,
it is noticeable that there is a relatively lower share of the budget allocated to prevention in Honduras when compared with
other countries in Central America.
                                                              40
                                     Box 8. Prior actions- Citizen Security
Improve citizen security

To support the prevention of crime and violence and achieve the Government's development and poverty
reduction objectives, the Government has: (a) adopted a violence prevention strategy of proposed programs
focused on: youth at risk, alternative conflict resolution, road safety, and citizenship building, as evidenced by
Decree No. PCM 057-2011, dated September 6, 2011, published in the Official Gazette on October 1, 2011; and
(b) created the National Citizen Security Council, as evidenced by Decree No. 003-2011, dated October 18,
2011, published in the Official Gazette on October 20, 2011.

Government Medium-Term Agenda

96.     The Government will develop an Action Plan to ensure an effective
implementation of its National Citizen Security and Co-existence Policy. The Security
Secretariat, supported by the Security Cabinet and the National Citizen Security Council, will
coordinate this policy through a plan establishing goals, milestones, operational rules, and
funding mechanisms for its various programs and components by March 2012. The policy
also proposes to strengthen the National Violence Observatory which will facilitate useful
information for planning and designing crime and violence prevention programs. With the
introduction of the security tax, the Government is committed to ensuring the necessary
resources to implement its policy, and managing them in a transparent, accountable, and
results-oriented manner. Funding and technical assistance for the implementation of the action
plan will come from the Security, Justice and Human Rights Donors Group. In addition,
specific grievance mechanisms can be included in the policy’s action plan at the national and
local levels. These mechanisms could be developed in close collaboration with the Secretariat
of Justice and Human Rights, the Office of the Human Rights Prosecutor, and civil society
organizations working on human rights issues.

97.     An important element of this Action Plan will be the operationalization of the
Government’s flagship Safer Municipalities Program, which places municipalities at the
center in the development of integrated citizen security strategies. The program aims to
improve citizen security across municipalities by strengthening: (a) coordination between
national government agencies, police, judiciary, and local governments, and (b) partnerships
between the local government, citizens, private sector, and community organizations. The
model outlined in the Safer Municipalities Program is based on integrated municipal citizen
security plans designed by multi-stakeholder citizen security councils led by the mayor.
Among other activities, the municipal plans include the mapping of violence and conflict in
communities through participatory assessments, the strengthening of local crime information
systems, improving public-private partnerships, and developing alternative mechanisms for
conflict resolution at the local level. In this regard, addressing citizen security at the municipal
level has showed successful results in dropping interpersonal crime rates and promoting
citizen coexistence in cities such as Bogota, Medellin and Quito, as well as in Honduras itself
through the Bank-financed Barrio Ciudad Project. The Government plans to pilot the Safer
Municipalities Program in at least 10 municipalities with the highest levels of crime and
violence in the country. As a key element of the citizen security policy, the Safer
Municipalities Program has been launched and discussed among local governments, judicial


                                                       41
operators, and civil society organizations in Tegucigalpa as well as in various regions of the
country.

98.      The Government is designing a violence prevention program at the municipal
level called “National Campaign for Violence Prevention.? It will coordinate prevention
activities among schools, health posts, community organizations, and municipal offices of
women, youth, and conflict resolution. The initial emphasis will be on creating opportunities
for youth at risk, and will start in 50 municipalities. While in the beginning it will be managed
by an office that reports directly to the president, it is envisioned that it could be absorbed by
the Ministry of Social Development, tasked with the role of coordinating social policies. This
national program should help operationalize the prevention pillar of the Citizen Security
Policy at the national level, and the prevention component of the Safer Municipalities
program at the municipal level.

99.     The Government is also planning to promote a more active role of local
governments in terms of alternative conflict resolution mechanisms. To achieve this
objective, the Security Secretariat and the Secretary of the Interior plan to reform the
arbitration and conciliation law (Ley de Arbitraje y Conciliación) to expand the authority of
municipal governments regarding alternative conflict resolution mechanisms. Expanding
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms is a critical service to promote a culture of peace
and respect for basic rights at the local level, and to reduce the excessive workload of the
judicial system. The Bank is proposing to make the approval of the Ley de Arbitraje y
Conciliación an indicative policy action for the second operation of this DPC series.

100. The Government is developing a policy to improve inter-institutional
coordination among the National Supreme Court, the Attorney’s General Office and the
Security Secretariat. Effective coordination among agencies involved in criminal justice
and security is essential to complement the security and violence prevention focus of the
citizen security and co-existence policy. This policy will provide guidelines related to legal
harmonization, crime prevention, modernization of the criminal justice and police systems,
and inter-institutional coordination among judicial operators. It will also include a human
rights perspective to criminal justice issues. The EU has conditioned its second operation in
the security sector (for 30 million euros) on the approval of this policy and is mobilizing
substantial technical assistance resources to support its design. The Bank is proposing to make
the approval of this policy an indicative trigger for the second operation of this DPC series. In
addition, the Bank will conduct a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review of the
justice and security sectors.

Overall Operation’s Design and Conditionality Principles

101. The operation’s design takes into account good practice principles on
conditionality. These include strong country ownership through close cooperation and
technical assistance, close coordination with other development partners (especially the IDB
and the IMF), alignment of the operation with the Government’s reform timetable, and
selection of critical structural reforms that will yield medium- to long-term benefits (Box 9).




                                               42
                        Box 9: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
 Principle 1: Reinforce Country Ownership.
 • The operation is closely aligned with the Government’s National Plan and the pension reform package, which
 was submitted to Congress this year.
 • It is accompanied by a program of technical assistance, supporting the Government in the design and
 implementation of the reforms.

 Principle 2: Agree upfront with the Government and other financing partners on a clear division of labor.
 • The operation’s policy matrix was developed in close cooperation with the Government, and jointly agreed
 upon with other key development partners, especially the IDB and the IMF.
 • All donors involved in budget support meet regularly and closely coordinate their support.

 Principle 3: Customize the components and structure of the operation to country circumstances.
 • The timing of the operation is aligned with the Government’s reform timetable and financing needs.
 • Potentially controversial reforms were designed so that the impact on poorer groups is mitigated by other
 measures (such as the CCT program).

 Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement.
 • Four prior actions were selected based on their structural nature and criticality for re-establishing fiscal
 sustainability. In addition, two prior actions were selected to tackle citizen security.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
 financial support.
 • In response to the Government’s request, the operation’s timetable would allow for disbursement in CY2011
 to help meet the Government’s financing needs.
 • The operation’s outcome indicators will be jointly monitored by the Government and the Bank.


                             VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

Poverty and Social Impact

102. The policy actions supported by this operation are likely to have short, medium,
and long-run impacts on welfare and its distribution. For instance, in the short run,
teachers and contributors to IHSS, INPREMA and INJUPEM will be affected by: (i) the
increase in the salary ceiling for contribution to IHSS from LPS 4,700 to LPS 7,000, (ii)
delinking of teachers’ salaries from the private sector minimum wage, (iii) the increase in the
employees contribution rates from 7 to 9.5 percent of salaries for INPREMA participants, and
(iv) the increase in the employees’ contribution rates from 7 percent to 8 percent for
INJUPEMP participants. Also in the short run, the increase in private school employers’
INPREMA contribution from 11 percent to 15 percent is likely to negatively affect the
welfare of those sending their children to private schools because demand for private
education is likely inelastic and additional costs would be completely transferred to
consumers. The increase in public school employers’ INPREMA contribution from 12 percent
to 15 percent is likely to affect welfare only indirectly via additional fiscal deficits.
Nevertheless, these impacts are likely to be small in the short run.

103. While in the short run, the increase in the salary ceiling for contributions to the
IHSS are likely to affect mostly the non-poor, only a small share of households are likely
to be pushed below the poverty line. As seen in Figure 8, approximately 85 percent of the
IHSS participants that earn more than Lps 4,700 belong to the upper two quintiles and are
unlikely to become poor because of the reforms. Approximately 3.6 percent belong to the

                                                     43
bottom two quintiles, and while they may be pushed deeper into poverty, the expansion of the
CCT program Bono 10,000, which is targeted to the extremely poor, is likely to mitigate some
of this negative impact. The estimates also suggest that approximately half of those belonging
to the third quintile (6 percent of IHSS participants) are likely to be pushed below the
moderate poverty line. For those, the expansion of CCT program is unlikely to be a mitigating
factor, however.40
             Figure 8. Distribution of IHSS Participants that will be affected by the Reforms

104. In terms of their distribution, the short-run impacts of the policy actions related
to INPREMA are unlikely to hurt the poor. Almost 93 percent of teachers who contribute
to INPREMA belong to the upper two quintiles of the income distribution (Figure 9). In
particular, more than 78 percent belong to the top quintile. Thus, the delinking of teachers’
salaries from the private sector minimum wage and the increase in employees’ contribution to
INPREMA are unlikely to have negative poverty impacts. Moreover, in the long run, the
reforms should help the country in allocating more fiscal resources to more effective anti-
poverty programs by reducing the likelihood that the country would have to allocate general
fiscal resources to cover INPREMA deficits. Also, families who send their children to private
schools, who are likely to be impacted in the short run by the increase in the employers’
INPREMA contribution, tend to be the richest in Honduras.

105. In the short run, the increase in the employees’ INJUPEMP contribution from 7
percent to 8 percent of salaries is unlikely to affect poverty and equity negatively. As in
the case of INPREMA, more than 92 percent of INJUPEMP participants belong to the upper
two quintiles of the income distribution, and approximately three-quarters of them belong to
the top quintile (Figure 10).

106. Teachers’ real wages are likely to maintain current levels due to their pay
increase based on inflation, but will be lower compared to the pay adjustment
methodology mandated by the Teachers’ Statute because of the de-linking of their
salaries from the private sector minimum wage. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to affect the
poor as most teachers belong to the upper two quintiles of the income distribution. Moreover,
the new Law for Education is expected to partially countervail these negative wage effects. It
will ensure a minimum education threshold for individuals to become teachers (university
education) and will allow and encourage teachers to obtain graduate degrees in education.
These extra credentials are expected to lead to a new salary scale for the teaching profession,
allowing for more flexibility in salary increases within the current teacher wage grids. Also,

                                                   45
the creation of the National System for Teacher Training will provide an important boost for
the teaching profession formalizing (and institutionalizing) a long overdue demand from
teachers for permanent and relevant capacity building across the teacher corps, all of which
also has important salary implications for teachers. The combined effect of the reforms in the
education sector is likely to be higher quality of teaching in public schools, which will benefit
especially poorer households.

107. Teachers in Honduras receive relatively high salaries when compared to other
countries in LAC and Central America, and alleviating the fiscal burden associated with
the large teachers’ payroll will allow the country to invest more in reducing poverty and
inequality in the medium and long-run. As shown in Table 6, at 6.6 percent of GDP,
Honduras spends 60 percent more in public education than the LAC average. It spends, on
average, almost 32 percent more than Costa Rica, a country known for its high investments
and positive results in public education. On average, educational spending in Honduras is
highly inefficient. World Bank (2007, p.29) shows that the efficiency of education spending
(dollars invested per unit of educational outcome attained) is, on average, lower in Honduras
than elsewhere in the region. 41 The bulk of this spending goes to the salaries of teachers, who
are relatively better off than comparable professions. In fact, as indicated by the labor market
analysis presented in the Public Expenditure Review (PER, World Bank, 2007), Honduran
teachers are remunerated 16 to 25 percent more than similarly qualified counterparts outside
the education sector, especially in the 35-to-50 age group.42 Therefore, a gradual decrease in
teachers’ pay is not only likely to reduce income inequality, but it is also likely to free up
fiscal space to expand access to education to a growing school-age population.

* Central Government Expenditures in Education

108. While there are no “victimization? data linked to income or expenditure surveys
in Honduras, it is likely that the poor, especially the urban poor, are the ones that suffer
the most with crime and violence. Rich households are more able to defend themselves by
investing in private security and demanding police protection. The urban poor often live in
communities controlled by gangs and are more exposed to murders, extortion, and robberies.
Corrupted police forces, while often ensuring the safety of the rich, frequently victimize the
poor as well. In the medium run, therefore, policies enacted to combat crime and violence are
likely to be progressive because the poor have more to gain in terms of welfare than the rich.

41
   Out of 22 countries ordered in descending order of efficiency, Honduras ranks close to the bottom in terms of this
indicator. See ―Project Appraisal Document on a Proposed Credit in the Amount of SDR9.8 million (US$15.37 million
equivalent) to the Republic of Honduras for an Education Quality, Governance and Institutional Strengthening Project‖,
Report N°40514-HN; Washington, DC: The World Bank.
42
   Note that such comparison does not take into account the fact that the teaching profession tends to have lower working
hours and larger vacation periods than non-teacher professions of equally educated counterparts. See World Bank
(forthcoming), ―Teachers in the LAC Region: Honduras Country Note‖.
                                                           46
109. In the medium run, welfare and equity are likely to be positively affected by: (i)
the increased efficiency of tax collection, (ii) the fiscal savings resulting from the
delinking of teacher salaries from the private-sector minimum wage, and (iii) the
reduction in crime and violence. Increased revenue collection due to the tax administration
reform and the delinking of teachers’ salaries are likely to expand the Government’s fiscal
envelope, allowing it to invest more on its social programs. For instance, additional revenues
could be allocated to expanding the national conditional cash transfer program (CCT) Bono
10,000. According to the poverty and distributional analysis carried for the Honduras Fiscal
Emergency Recovery DPC (Report number 55656-HN), the CCT’s well-designed targeting
system is very progressive and likely to be effective in reducing poverty and improving the
country’s income distribution in the medium and long runs.

110. The combined impacts of the policies supported by this operation are likely to be
pro-poor in the long run. First, all of them are likely to induce faster economic growth, a
necessary condition for long-term poverty reduction. For instance, increasing the efficiency of
revenue collection is likely to enhance growth by reducing economic inefficiencies linked to
the dead-weight losses of taxes. In addition, crime reduction seems likely to boost economic
growth. Moreover, ensuring the sustainability of pay-as-you-go pension systems in the
country reduce the likelihood that general taxes will be needed to cover future deficits,
another factor likely to help boost growth.

111. Finally, parametric pension reforms that will affect future generations of retirees,
are likely to be progressive and improve the distribution of income in the long run. The
benefit/contribution ratio is likely to fall for all future retirees due to the delay in retirement
age, increase in the contribution rates, and the extension of the time horizon upon which
average retirement benefits are computed. The improved sustainability of the overall system
will reduce the need for additional general fiscal resources in the future. Since the VAT,
which is the main source of revenues in Honduras, is mostly regressive, policies that
minimize the future need for fiscal resources to fund pension deficits out of general taxation
are likely to improve income distribution in the long-run. Moreover, most participants in the
pay-as-you-go systems affected by the reforms belong to the upper quintiles of the income
distribution, which means that the poor are unlikely to be negatively impacted currently and in
the future.

2.3 Formalize the legal situation of the PROHECO teachers

The Government has signed an agreement to
reincorporate PROHECO teachers into                      PROHECO teachers

3.1. Achieve a fiscally sustainable wage bill

The Government has submitted to its Congress,
for approval thereby, a bill of law to establish a
                                                        Public sector teachers

3.2. Strengthen the control of the teacher’s payroll

The Government has started paying teachers’             Public sector teachers

Environmental Aspects

112. The policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to produce
significant impacts on the environment, forests, or other natural resources. The tax
administration reforms supported are not pertinent to environmental regulations. The same
applies to the prior actions related to civil service reforms that pertain to the wage bill control
of the education sector. The prior actions related to pension reform are not likely to have
significant positive or negative effects on the environment.

Consultation and Participation

113. While generating broad-based policy dialogue around national development
strategies within the framework of the Country Vision and National Plan has proven
difficult in the post-crisis context, Government efforts in this regard have been focused
on some of the most pressing, volatile, and politically sensitive issues in the national
public sphere. The policy measures prioritized in the current DPC have been part of this
urgent reform agenda, all of which have also received ample media attention and debate:

      Tax administration: Consultation with non-governmental actors has been limited
       mostly to business and banking sectors. However, this is a permanent issue in national
       media and debate, with widespread support particularly with respect to focusing on tax
       evasion and exonerations among large contributors.
      Efficiency in public administration, particularly with respect to the wage bill: The
       debate has largely focused on education as a sector that represents one of the country’s
       largest public wage bills and public budget allocations. At the same time, the
       education sector has been plagued by an inefficient administration, corruption at
       various levels, poor performance levels, and ineffective mechanisms for accountability
       and local oversight/participation. During the past year and a half, the Government has
       held consultations on this issue, with ample participation on the part of civil society,
       parents associations, teachers’ unions, local governments, and legislators. Most
       recently, Congress approved a law to incentivize local participation and oversight in
       education. In addition, the Lobo administration and the National Congress have
       recently conducted an open multi-sector dialogue process aimed at consensus-building
       for a completely new General Law on Education. The leadership of the teachers'
       unions is also actively participating in this dialogue, albeit with some periodic flashes
       of opposition; nonetheless, there is broad public support for reform, including among
       teachers (see Annex 6 for a more detailed discussion).
      Pension system reform: This is linked to the previous issue because of the number of
       teachers enrolled in the pension system. Although there is widespread recognition of
       the urgent need for reforms, debate continues regarding how to best ensure their
       sustainability, transparency, and improved fairness in the distribution of benefits (see
       Annex 6 for a more detailed discussion).
      Citizen security (crime and violence): As perhaps the most pressing development
       challenge, there is widespread recognition of the urgent need for action and a
       perception that the country still has time to implement measures to combat crime. The
       citizen security policy was approved by the current Government administration,
       building upon processes of ample consultation with civil society working on citizen
       security and violence prevention. The new policy has been consulted among local
                                                49
      governments and civil society actors in Tegucigalpa, as well as in various regions of
      the country, with particular emphasis on the Safer Municipalities Program.
      Nevertheless, some civil society organizations have raised issues of limited
      participation in the design of the citizen security policy. Civil society organizations,
      particularly those working on human rights issues, have also expressed the need for
      increased coordination among crime/justice/security sectors, with a view towards
      combating corruption and an adequate focus on prevention, social programs, and
      cooperation with local actors in development (see Annex 6 for a more detailed
      discussion).
114. Other priority issues at the center of national dialogue during the first half of the Lobo
Administration include:

         National reconciliation: Healing the divisions among the population has been a top
          priority for the Unity Government message of the Lobo Administration as well as part
          of international agreements linked to the 2009 crisis.
         Anti-corruption plan: The focus has been on the executive branch. A more complete,
          integral plan, with elements within the judicial and legislative branches, as well as
          improved coordination among public agencies and effective linkage to citizen-led
          initiatives, is needed.
         Development of “charter cities?:43 A dialogue has been prioritized among government
          officials, members of Congress, and the business sectors. There is enthusiasm in the
          country with respect to their potential, but at the same time concern that a rapid
          process for approval might not allow for sufficient dialogue to ensure more favorable
          conditions for the Honduran population.

115. As noted in the Fiscal Emergency DPC of 2010, ensuring quality multi-
stakeholder dialogue and consultation processes will be key in generating a greater
awareness and consensus around the Government’s reform program as well as
increased public ownership of the overall development strategy. The effort requires active
citizen participation and representation of social sectors from and within the various regions
of the country. One of the most novel aspects of the Country Vision and National Plan is the
new framework for policy dialogue at the national and regional/local levels. However,
progress in this regard has been slow, and the effort has in some cases been discredited by
political interference. In particular, civil society organizations note that there should be
stronger social monitoring of the use of budget support resources. This is a key element that
the Government should not put aside because it represents a great potential for creating
broader awareness and consensus around urgent reforms and broader development strategies.

Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation

116. The Ministry of Finance (SEFIN) is responsible for the implementation of the
operation as well as for coordinating the actions among the concerned agencies,
including the Central Bank of Honduras, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of
Planning, and the Ministry of Security. Together with SEFIN and the National Institute of
Statistics (INE), these institutions collect the necessary data for the identified monitoring
43
  A charter city is a city-scale special reform zone that can take many forms. The common elements are: a) An uninhabited
piece of city-sized land, provided voluntarily by a host government; b). A charter that specifies the rules that will govern the
new city; and c) The freedom for would-be charter city residents, investors, and employers to move in or out.
                                                              50
indicators. SEFIN and the Bank have agreed to monitor the progress in the program supported
by the DPC, and its evaluation will shape preparation of a new Country Partnership Strategy.

Fiduciary Arrangements

117. The recipient is the Republic of Honduras. The credit is for an amount of 55.1
million SDR, on standard IDA terms to be disbursed in a single tranche. The closing date for
the credit is November 15, 2012.

118. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA, 2009) report
identified a number of strengths and weaknesses of Honduras’ financial management
systems. The report concludes that a notable modernization of the Public Financial
Management (PFM) system has been implemented in Honduras, but some challenges remain.
SEFIN’s modernization is progressing well, and the main challenges for the administration
are to address the uneven institutional capacity of some key PFM regulatory agencies. In
addition, it will be important to consolidate the advances made in PFM, especially those
affecting consolidation of the procurement system (HONDUCOMPRAS), formulation of
strategic sectorial planning, strengthening the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF),
and implementation of the human resources module.

Disbursement and Audit

119. The Bank would make the single loan disbursement to a dedicated account that
forms part of the country's official foreign exchange reserves at the Central Bank of
Honduras. The disbursement would be made upon Bank's assessment of satisfactory
compliance of prior actions agreed. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases
and no procurement requirements would be needed. Once the credit is approved by the Board,
the recipient would open and maintain a dedicated deposit account in US dollars for the
recipient’s use. IDA will disburse the proceeds of the credit into the deposit account. If the
proceeds or any part thereof are used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing
Agreement, IDA will require the recipient to either return the amount to the deposit account
for use for eligible purposes or refund the amount directly to IDA. The deposit account in US
dollars would be maintained in the Central Bank and its transactions and balances fully
incorporated into the recipient’s accounting records and financial statements via the integrated
financial management system (SIAFI). The legal agreement will include a clause requiring
written confirmation that the amount of the loan has been credited to an account available to
finance budgeted expenditures. It will also contain a clause for an audit at the Bank’s request
of financial transactions from the receipt of the loan proceeds by the Central Bank to the
transfer of the local currency equivalent into a treasury account designated for budget
expenditures.

120. The Central Bank is the financial agent of the Government. The latest IMF
Safeguards Assessment available for review was performed in 2008. The Central Bank
published its Annual Financial Statements for 2010 with a clean opinion by external auditors,
but the audit report notes a deviation from the IFRS that could result in material adjustments
if IFRS are fully adopted. However, a review of the financial statements, project external
audit reports, and the experience with segregated accounts for investment lending brought
nothing to the Bank’s attention of that would indicate that the banking control environment
                                              51
into which the loan proceeds will flow is other than adequate under the proposed
arrangements. The fiduciary arrangements are in place to mitigate identified risks.

Risks and Risk Mitigation

121. The DPC is subject to five main risks: political, institutional, economic and
environmental. In addition, the innovative and sensitive nature of the citizen security
component adds a fifth risk that combines reputational and development impact elements.

122. On the political side, the main risk is related to the Government's ability to
complete the implementation of the fiscal reform package. With a polarized society
following the political crisis of 2009, approval and implementation of the planned fiscal
package could be more difficult than anticipated, which could jeopardize the needed fiscal
adjustment. To reduce this risk, the Government has been building consensus to implement
the needed reforms to bring the country's finances back to a sustainable path. It will be
important for the Government to ensure an adequate communications strategy regarding the
present DPC, highlighting its positive distribution/poverty impact (as indicated in Table 6) in
dealing with these urgent reforms, and its potential to greatly contribute to the resolution of
long-standing issues in public administration in Honduras.

123. On the institutional side, the main risk is related to the weak capacity of
Government institutions to implement the fiscal consolidation program. To reduce this
risk, the Bank is working with other donors to support the Government's fiscal consolidation
efforts, including programs to provide technical assistance.

124. On the economic front, the main risk derives from the possibility that the global
economy might enter into another recession. Under this scenario, the country’s shock
absorption capacity could face important limitations, in particular to apply effective
countercyclical macroeconomic policies and suitable social safety nets. In Honduras, the main
transmission channels are likely to be the same as in the 2008 crisis: First, since the U.S and
the European Union are Honduras’ largest trade markets (about 60 percent of total trade
value), exports would fell significantly. Second, workers’ remittances from abroad amount
about 16 percent of GDP and 90 percent of them are originated in the United States. Third,
official development assistance would be limited. To reduce this risk, the Government has
shifted to a much more cautious attitude, focusing on fiscal structural reforms and a gradual
tightening of fiscal policy. In addition, the Government has been closely following the
external economic conditions and is currently preparing an action plan to mitigate the
negative effects of a possible sharp downturn on the world economy. Also, the Honduran
Central Bank is continuing to enhance its capacity to deploy counter-cyclical policy if needed.

125. On the environmental side, the main risk is the country’s high exposure to
natural hazards. Honduras’ major natural hazards are tropical storms and hurricanes that
frequently strike the country, generating extensive flooding along the north coast and other
regions. Hurricane Mitch in 1998 affected large portions of the country's population, causing
major economic damages estimated at US$3.5 billion. In 2005 Honduras was hit by Hurricane
Stan, which caused an estimated US$100 million in total economic damages. The
Government has taken important steps towards strengthening the country's disaster risk
management legal and institutional frameworks. In addition, the Bank is providing key

                                              52
technical support to Honduras in terms of strengthening the institutional capacity to engage in
disaster risk management. If a disaster occurs, the Bank will revisit its planned lending
program and existing portfolio to ascertain how and where adjustments need to be made.

126. On the citizen security component, the main risks are related to supporting
institutional reforms for the implementation of the integrated citizen security policy,
which includes both violence prevention and law enforcement/crime control objectives.
There are two main types of risks involved— institutional and indirect. The former relates to
the weak institutional capacity of the Government and the challenges involved in
implementing a security policy that requires strong multi-sectoral and intergovernmental
coordination, and tackling complex problems. There is a risk that the policy will not be
implemented, or be implemented partially because of lack of funding, weak capacity, or
insufficient political will to coordinate. Indirect risks relate to potential basic rights abuses,
abuse of authority, or corruption that might be associated with some of the actions supported
by programs that will be designed in the future as part of the law enforcement component of
the policy (in areas such as police equipment, prison infrastructure and management, gun
control). Even though the law enforcement component is not part of this DPC, the link with
the prevention component as part of the overall citizen security policy presents a low level of
risk that deserves mentioning and a discussion of corresponding mitigation strategies.

Institutional risks are being mitigated through five strategies:

a.    The citizen security policy follows good international practice, is based on consultations
     and incorporates solid analytical work. The diagnosis underpinning the policy includes a
     national victimization survey, information from the National Violence Observatory, as
     well as wide consultations with multiple stakeholders (see below). The core objectives and
     strategies of the policy are also aligned with recent analytical work done by the Bank in
     Central America and Honduras (see analytical underpinnings section).
b. The decision to implement the policy in a gradual and sequenced manner over the next
   decade, and to prioritize actions through an Action Plan for the remaining period of this
   administration. A parallel effort is being done (with support from EU) to develop a
   criminal justice and security policy that will be coordinated with the citizen security
   policy.
c. The creation and strengthening of coordination and oversight mechanisms to implement
   the policy, including: (i) a Security Cabinet for inter-ministerial coordination within the
   Executive power, and under the leadership of the Secretariat of the Presidency, and (ii) a
   National Citizen Security Council that brings the relevant security, judicial, human rights,
   and line ministries together with the Supreme Court, Prosecutors Office and local
   governments to support the implementation of the policy.
d. A coalition of international development partners that strongly support an integrated
   approach. There are more than ten partners organized in a Security, Justice, and Human
   Rights Round Table that will provide technical assistance and financing to design and
   implement the policy’s Action Plan. Each agency (e.g. IDB, EU, USAID, UNDP) will
   focus on technical engagement in areas where it has a comparative advantage. Some of
   the main players include IDB preparing an operation around criminal justice investigation
   for 20 million dollars and EU with 40 million euros.
                                               53
e. Mobilizing national resources through a new security tax that will help finance activities
   included in the action plan for the citizen security policy.
Indirect risks are being mitigated through some of the strategies mentioned above (such
as the broad coalition of partners supporting the implementation of the action plan) as
well as through three additional strategies:

a. The Government of Honduras has included a strong rights-based approach to its citizen
   security policy. The Government has created the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights,
   which is part of the Cabinet and Council. One of the functions of the Citizen Security
   Council will be to formulate recommendations to preserve human rights and fulfill civic
   duties for peaceful coexistence. The policy document stresses that all programs need to be
   designed within a rights-based framework. In addition, the government is developing
   education and sensibilization campaigns to promote a change in mentality among citizens
   away from repression and iron fist approaches and more towards prevention and a culture
   of legality and peaceful coexistence.
b. The policy provides for measures to include civil society and private sector participation
   in the design and implementation of the policy at the national and local levels. The policy
   is based on a draft prepared in 2008 by the previous administration which held wide-
   ranging consultations with civil society organizations. Informal consultations held by the
   Government and by the Bank confirm that the content of the policy addresses many of the
   concerns of civil society organizations (such as the need for a greater focus on community
   participation in violence prevention activities and inter-institutional coordination). The
   objective of flagship programs such as Safer Municipalities was discussed at the
   grassroots level with mayors and key local stakeholders at department-level meetings,
   which provided ample opportunity to gather inputs for program design. The strategy has
   been launched by the Security, National Defense, and Governance Cabinet with broad
   participation of government institutions, NGOs, donors, and the media, among others. In
   addition, a link to the citizen security policy will be posted on the websites of the
   Secretariat of the Presidency and the Secretariat of Security. The Bank will work with
   Government to strengthen even further mechanisms to engage civil society and private
   sectors in monitoring policy implementation, particularly through grievance mechanisms.
c. The citizen security policy itself incorporates international standards and good practices
   in its different components to mitigate some of the potential risks. For instance, among
   other provisions, the modernization of detention centers initiative includes internal
   conduct codes based on international disciplinary standards as well as measures intended
   to professionalize the police. With regard to institutional strengthening of the police force,
   the policy supports the development of internal control systems to enhance transparency
   and accountability of police officers, as well as increased effectiveness of the preventive
   policing, and education of the police force as public servants and community members.
127. An additional risk is that during political campaigns, candidates may take
advantage of voters’ perceptions of insecurity in order to justify repressive measures to
combat crime and violence. To mitigate this risk, the Government plans to carry out
informational campaigns based on the new integrated citizen security policy in order to
emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to tackle crime and violence. Such


                                               54
campaigns include community mobilization and citizen engagement in a social dialogue on
how to respond to security issues.
128. Overall, the level of risk of this component is low (given its focus on institutional
coordination and in social prevention) and it is far outweighed by the much higher risk
of inaction. While the proposed mitigation measures provide a robust risk management
strategy, it is clear that some level of risk will always remain. The economic, social and
human costs imposed by the current levels of crime and violence mean that ordinary citizens’
most basic and fundamental rights are under attack and as such, the risk of inaction far
outweighs the remaining level of risk. Strengthening institutions and social prevention
initiatives are critical steps of an integrated response to what has become the most
fundamental challenge to the development and welfare of Honduras citizens.

   IMF Completes Second Review under Stand-By Arrangement and Standby Credit
                             Facility for Honduras
Press Release No. 11/298
July 29, 2011

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the second
review of Honduras’s economic performance under a program supported by an 18-month
Stand-By Arrangement and a Standby Credit Facility. The arrangements were first approved
on October 1, 2010 in the amount of SDR 129.5 million (about $207.1 million), equivalent to
100 percent of the country’s quota in the IMF (see Press Release No. 10/374). Completion of
the review would make SDR 71.225 million (about $113.9 million) of that total available to
the authorities. The Honduran authorities, however, intend to continue treating the financing
as precautionary. The Board decision was taken on a lapse of time basis (a process where the
Board agrees that a proposal can be approved without convening formal discussions) on July
29, 2011.

Higher domestic investment spending and growing demand for Honduras’ exports are
contributing to output growth. However, high international commodity prices are putting
pressures on inflation and the external current account deficit. The policy responses to these
shocks, consistent with the authorities’ economic program for 2011, should include
reassessing public expenditure priorities to help mitigate the effect of the shocks on the poor
and a monetary policy stance that keeps domestic demand in check. The main goals of the
Fund-supported economic program continue to be consolidating the public finances,
increasing the share of investment and social spending in public expenditure, strengthening
the international reserves position, and upgrading the monetary and exchange rate policy
frameworks.

Note: The review was completed on a lapse of time (LOT) basis. Reviews would be proposed for consideration
on an LOT basis if all of the following conditions are met:
1. The relevant arrangement does not involve exceptional access;
2. The most recent program review under the relevant arrangement was not concluded on a lapse of time basis;
3. The review to be completed does not raise general policy issues requiring Board discussion;
4. All prior actions for the review have been met;
5.The review does not introduce major changes in the objectives or design of the program, including but not
limited to, an augmentation of access, major changes in conditionality for future reviews, the combination of
future reviews envisaged under the arrangement, or the rephasing of disbursements; and
6. Performance under the member’s program does not raise concerns as to whether the review should be
completed, in particular as a result of deviations, other than minor deviations, from the quantitative performance
criteria and structural benchmarks.

                                  Annex 5: Debt Sustainability Analysis

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) yields results similar to those reported in the IMF
program report—the risk of debt distress continues to be regarded as low. The analysis
continues to be based on the assumptions that Honduras will strengthen macroeconomic
policies to stabilize the current account deficit at sustainable levels and maintain a prudent
borrowing strategy. Under those assumptions, the country’s debt would remain sustainable,
with all debt indicators remaining below their indicative thresholds and robust under various
stress tests. However, debt dynamics would weaken if policies deviate from the IMF program
and/or GDP growth suffers a permanent adverse shock.

Key Assumptions

1.      Strengthened macroeconomic policies. The scenario assumes that the strengthening
of macroeconomic policies started in the second half of 2010, and the commitment to the new
policies will remain strong over the medium term. In addition, the baseline assumes certain
measures will be adopted during 2010, such as controlling the wage bill, reducing subsidies,
and adjusting electricity tariffs to reduce the public sector deficit to about 2 percent of GDP
over the medium term. It incorporates the flexibilization of the exchange rate, based on the
methodology of the Central Bank of Honduras, too. It also includes the expected impact of the
tax reform approved in April 2010 that would yield revenue equivalent to 0.7-1.2 percent of
GDP (on an annual basis) over three years. The baseline also considers the medium term
effects of several regulations approved during 2011, including anti-evasion measures, wage
bill control, and the IMPREMA’s pension system reform.

2.     Real GDP will grow at an average of 4 percent a year in the medium term. The
baseline includes the most recent growth outlook (see Table 1). In this regard, improved
performance in commodity exports, the maquila44 sector, and remittances will boost the
economy. In addition, growth prospects are based on public investment, assumed to reach 4.8
percent of GDP over the medium term.

3.     The overall fiscal deficit of the public sector will stabilize at about 2 percent of
GDP.45 Public sector revenues and grants are projected to increase to approximately
23.4 percent of GDP by 2014. The composition of expenditure would be tilted toward
investment and poverty reduction. The fiscal deficit would be financed mostly by
concessional resources from multilateral and bilateral creditors.

4.     The noninterest current account deficit is projected to decline to below 6 percent
of GDP in the medium term. This would be the result of favorable dynamics in the trade
balance, tourism, and remittances. The current account deficit would be largely financed by


44
  A maquila or maquiladora is a manufacturing plant that imports and assembles duty-free components for export. Maquila
exports represent 50 percent of total exports and are mainly related to textiles and confections.
45
   The consolidated public sector includes the central government, local governments, decentralized agencies,
social security institutions, the central bank, and public enterprises.

                                                         79
official sources, foreign direct investment (FDI), and the projected expansion in maquila
activity and tourism.

5.      Annual export growth would average 7.5 percent over the long run. While current
commodity prices are high, a projected decline in the prices of Honduras’ main commodity
exports (coffee and bananas) is expected in the medium term. However, this effect will be
offset by continued productivity gains and greater access to international markets through
CAFTA and a trade agreement with the European Union, effective until 2012.

6.      Annual import growth would average about 6.8 percent per year. Nonfuel imports
are projected to increase moderately in line with domestic demand growth and maquila
activity. Fuel imports volumes are assumed to grow in line with real GDP.

7.     Non-concessional financing. Non-concessional financing is estimated at US$350
million;46 of the total, US$280 million corresponds to a multi-sector loan from the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI).47 As in the IMF 2010 Article IV, it is
assumed that Honduras would progressively tap additional non-concessional sources of
financing (which would rise from 5 percent to 23 percent of total disbursements in the long-
run), mostly in loans from bilateral (Paris Club and non-Paris Club countries) and commercial
sources.

External debt sustainability analysis

8.     Honduras’ external debt would remain sustainable. All external debt indicators
remain below their thresholds,48 with the present value of external debt projected to stay
below 22 percent of GDP over the entire horizon of the analysis (Table 3 and Figure 1).

9.      External debt indicators remain below their indicative, policy-related thresholds
under all stress tests and alternatives scenarios (Figure 1). Debt-burden indicators are
lower under the historical scenario than under the baseline scenario because the projected
average real GDP growth for 2011 is higher than the estimated values for 2010. On the other
hand, the noninterest current account average is lower for 2011 than for 2010.




46
   Honduras is classified as a low-capacity, low-vulnerability country, and is allowed to have untied non-
concessional financing (See Debt Limits in Fund-Supported Programs—Proposed New Guidelines (SM/09/215)
and Capacity Assessment-Preliminary Results (IMF), and Introducing Greater Flexibility into the
Implementation of IDA’s Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP) Capacity Assessment Exercise (World
Bank, 2010).
47
   Lending from CABEI is on non-concessional terms. However, recently CABEI lending to Honduras for some
projects (e.g. infrastructure) was combined with concessional lending from the other institutions (e.g. World
Bank and IDB) to reach of concessionality of 35 percent. For the purpose of this DSA update, however, the
US$280 million lending has been considered non-concessional.
48
  Based on the recent update, the three-year average of the Honduras’ CPIA index (between 2007 and 2009) is 3.69. In this
context, the debt burden thresholds correspond to the ones associated with a medium policy performance—a rating above
3.75 corresponds to strong performance. The latest average CPIA represents a deterioration compared to the previous average
(2006-2008), which was 3.8 and was associated with a strong policy performance.
                                                           80
Public sector debt sustainability analysis

10.     Honduras’ public sector debt would remain sustainable. Public sector debt would
remain at about 27 percent of GDP (20.5 percent in present value terms). As the fiscal deficit
progressively declines to about 2 percent of GDP and growth rebounds to its long-term rate,
the sustainable primary deficit would be about 1 percent of GDP.

Stress Tests

11.     The alternative scenarios and stress tests show that public-sector debt dynamics
are vulnerable to adverse shocks, either exogenous or policy-related. The status quo stress
test, which assumes a primary fiscal deficit at the 2011 level in terms of GDP until the end of
the projection period as well as a permanent decline in real GDP growth, would place the
present value public debt-to-GDP ratio on an upward trend (Table 2). In addition, a one-time
real depreciation of 30 percent (e.g. a severe balance of payments correction) or a 10 percent
of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows (e.g. a severe financial sector distress that leads
to the realization of contingent liabilities) would increase the present value of public debt-to-
revenue ratio to more than 100 percent in the long term, compared to 88 percent under the
baseline scenario.

Conclusion

12.     Based on the above analysis, Honduras is considered at low risk of debt distress.
Assuming consistent pursuit of strengthened macroeconomic policies, Honduras’ debt
indicators would remain below their indicative thresholds and broadly resilient to adverse
shocks. Under alternative policies, however, public-sector debt dynamics would weaken.
Honduras’ favorable debt outlook reflects the low initial levels of public debt, which resulted
from the large debt relief granted to Honduras during the 2000s.

13.     Given that Honduras would progressively tap more nonconcessional sources of
financing, it will be important to build on the existing capacity to manage debt and
formulate a strategy linked to medium-term fiscal framework. Authorities are committed
to strengthening their debt-management capacity—with the availability of additional technical
assistance.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ?(1+g)]/(1+g+?+g?) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ? = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

    Annex 6: Consultations and context for reforms in education sector and in citizen
                                        security

Consultations and Context for Reform in the Education Sector

1.       During most of the last decade, the yearly and almost permanent conflict within the
education sector in Honduras has seriously affected results in learning, and human
development more broadly. This difficult context has historically been rooted in an inefficient
sector administration, corruption at various levels, poor performance levels, ineffective
mechanisms for accountability, and poor local oversight and citizen participation. Various
initiatives in education reform have been put forth over the years, but have largely failed to be
approved or to enact substantive improvements. The 2009 political crisis further exacerbated
social tensions surrounding this and other issues, but also served as a wake-up call among
social sectors, highlighting the urgent need for reform in politics and public administration;
above all, the need to shift policy dialogue towards an enhanced focus on results in
development, with an improved approach based on multi-sector partnerships, and effective
mechanisms for transparency and accountability that will limit state capture.
2.      The context of present-day Honduras is quite different from that of a decade ago,
however, and the conditions determining the possibility of enacting meaningful reforms in
education today are much greater, considering: increased public awareness regarding the
growing and unsustainable public-sector wage bill, fueled by relatively high wages for
teachers; the lack of significant improvements in levels of learning in recent years; the
frustration among teachers themselves, as well as among the Honduran population (which
over the last decade has been strengthened in its awareness and capacities for improved
citizen engagement and social accountability) regarding the seemingly permanent crisis
situation in education; as well as a new Government administration and Congress
demonstrably committed to resolving the most urgent of the lasting problems in education, in
order to set the sector on a path towards national transformation. Recent developments that
have also greatly contributed to a context conducive towards reform, include an audit of
teachers’ posts by the Government to detect and eliminate ―phantom teachers‖ and other
irregularities, and the role of civil society organizations in social auditing and dialogue
processes representing more broad based citizen interests in their demand for good
governance and performance in the education sector.
3.      In 2011, the National Congress, having approved a new Law of Incentives for
Community Participation in Education, had also initiated discussion of a proposal for a
completely new General Law of Education (the current Law was approved in 1962). Faced
with strong insistence from various sectors (particularly teachers’ unions) that any such law
would have to be the product of ample consultation and consensus, the National Congress
withdrew the original proposal, and together with the Lobo Administration, has initiated a
broad process of open consultation for the drafting of the new Education law.
4.      The dialogue process has been completely open and widely disseminated in national
media; it has included participation on the part of the Government, the teachers’ unions,
parents’ associations, students, universities, civil society organizations (national and
community based), local governments, sector experts, and anyone else interested in
participating. Several roundtables for dialogue were set up based on the key thematic issues
                                               89
defined by the participants themselves (such as: Foundations of Education in Honduras;
Structure of the Education System; Administration; Educational Model; Teaching Career; and
Community Participation). At the time of this writing, after several meetings and plenary
sessions in Tegucigalpa and several different regions of the country, the results have been
delivered to a special Congressional Committee to be drafted into a formal Law proposal to be
further discussed, and approved by the end of 2011. Participants of the various sectors
involved have expressed their satisfaction with the process up to now, highlighting the
importance and the real potential of consensus-building processes among sectors for reform,
particularly in the present post-crisis context.
5.     Regarding pension reform, as a prior action within the Government’s plan for the
present DPC, the teachers’ unions have publicly expressed their opposition to the changes
envisioned. However, it is reported that inside the unions there is recognition of the urgent
need for reforms in order to save the pension funds.
6.      Regarding the reforms oriented towards containing the growth of the public education
sector wage bill, the teachers’ unions have maintained a strong resistance to any long-term
reform to the Teacher’s Statute, which indexes teachers’ salaries to the minimum wage, in
Article 49. The unions have ceded to Government the suspension of this Article during three
years only (with alternative means for salary negotiation), but have made clear that this is
only a temporary exception.
7.      Finally, as payments to teachers have already begun to be implemented through
SIAFI, teachers’ unions have complained that some teachers are not being paid, or are being
unfairly eliminated from payrolls handled by the Secretariat of Finance, among other issues.
These are elements that were expected to a degree within the initial period of transfer to
implementation of payments through SIAFI, considering the disorderly administration in
payrolls up to that point by other institutions. However, in the medium term this will very
likely not be a point of contention anymore, as the system will allow for more orderly and
timely payments, as well as better control over the recruitment and management of human
resources.
Consultations and Context for Reform in Citizen Security

8.      With regard to the consultations on the design of the citizen security policy, it is
important to mention that the proposed policy framework is based on a draft guidelines for
citizen security policy prepared under the previous administration, which had held extensive
consultations with civil society organizations working on citizen security and violence
prevention (see para 86). Formal and informal consultations held by the government and by
the Bank confirmed that the content of the policy addresses most of the main messages and
concerns from civil society, such as the need for a greater focus on prevention, strengthening
information systems, and coordination of inter-sectoral efforts at local and national levels. 49
The design of key programs of the policy such as the Safer Municipalities Program, were
discussed at the grassroots levels with mayors throughout the country and key local

49
   As part of the CPS drafting process, a total of 9 formal consultation sessions were conducted by the Bank, with
representatives of civil society, local governments and members of Congress; 3 of these consultations were particularly
focused on issues related to citizen security, crime and violence. About 250 persons participated in the consultation for the
new CPS in Honduras. In addition to the formal consultation sessions, a series of semi-structured meetings and interviews
were held during field visits to several parts of the country with various stakeholders.
                                                            90
stakeholders at Department-level meetings. In addition, the citizen security policy contains
specific dispositions related to the participation of civil society organizations and private
sector at the national and local levels. Discussions are currently underway regarding how to
best ensure civil society participation at the national level, particularly in a monitoring role
(included in the policy). In this regard, civil society should continue to deepen engagement
among its own diverse sectors, recovering from its own internal tensions and divisions related
to the 2009 political crisis, in order to arrive at a more cohesive approach to monitoring and
advocacy efforts, and more articulate expression of civil society concerns and demands.
Finally, civil society organizations view the Bank as an honest broker that can help foment
this type of dialogue among sectors on this particularly issue.
9.      Although it is clear that the success of the reforms involved will benefit the Honduran
population in general (as crime and violence levels have dramatically increased over recent
years), and will contribute to the strengthening of governance conditions with a more
constructive interaction among authorities and civil society, it is also very likely that powerful
vested interests that have infiltrated themselves into official security structures (whether they
be groups engaged in illicit activity, or actors that have enjoyed a certain control over sectors
of the citizen security institutions) will perceive the envisioned reforms as a threat to their
power, and will try to obstruct its success. The Honduras Institutional Governance Review
(IGR) of 2009 identifies this issue, and further suggests that:
10.    ―It is doubtful that simply adding more resources would improve the situation. What is
required is first an initial, broad-based consensus on the need for change and on the objectives
to be pursued… and subsequently, a high-level agreement to reduce political interference in
the operations of the various institutions…. In the meantime, the first step would be to
acknowledge the poor level of performance within the sector, and setting productivity goals to
hold each institution accountable for the resources it receives and the services it provides.‖
11.     The IGR also brings to attention the marginalization of the National Security Council
(CONASIN) in the past; civil society organizations have attributed this dynamic to a lack of
will on the part of citizen security institutions to be held accountable. Currently, however, the
Government has established the Citizen Security Council. This Council brings the relevant
security, judicial, human rights, and line ministers together with the Supreme Court,
Prosecutors Office and local governments to oversee the implementation of the policy. The
approved Integrated Citizen Security Policy also includes specific measures to include civil
society and private sector participation in the implementation of the policy at the national and
local levels.

                          Annex 7: Institutional Framework of Honduras
                         Citizen Security and Co-existence Integrated Policy

The purpose of this annex is to describe the institutional framework in which Honduras’
Citizen Security and Coexistence Integrated Policy operates. Even though this DPC focuses
only on the prevention aspects of this policy, it is useful to provide the institutional context for
the overall policy. This annex provides a basic analysis of the lead institution in the citizen
security sector, namely the Secretariat of Security (including police and prisons) and related
interagency coordinating bodies. The analysis also includes a summary assessment of other
justice sector institutions such as prosecutors and courts.50

Basic competencies along the security and justice value chain are distributed as follows:
   1. Preventing crime and violence is the responsibility of the Security Secretariat in
       coordination with a number of agencies including the Secretariat of Interior
       (responsible for promoting alternative conflict resolution), social development
       agencies (such as Youth Institute, Children and Family Institute, Social Development
       Secretariat, Education Secretariat, Health Secretariat, National Institute of Women,
       etc), local governments responsible for local citizen security plans, and specialized
       NGOs.
   2. Controlling crime is the responsibility of the Security Secretariat, mainly through the
       different divisions of the national police.
   3. Investigating crime is a responsibility shared between the national police’s General
       Division of Criminal Investigation and the General Attorney’s Office (Public
       Prosecutors’ Office).
   4. Accusing and prosecuting those suspected of having violated the law is the
       responsibility of the the General Attorney’s Office (Public Prosecutors’ Office).
   5. Administrating justice is the responsibility of the Judicial branch.
   6. Administrating the penitentiary system is the responsibility of the Security Secretariat.
   7. Rehabilitating and reinserting people in conflict with the law is the responsibility of
       the Security Secretariat, in coordination with institutions like INFHA which is
       responsible for juvenile detention centers.
   8. In addition there are a number of coordinating and oversight bodies, namely for
       coordinating within the executive branch of government (Security Cabinet), across
       executive and judiciary branches of government (Citizen Security Council), with civil
       society (CONASIN); as well as a Human Rights Commissioner and an active civil
       society.
The Citizen Security Policy deals only with the responsibilities outlined in numerals 1, 2, 3
(only related to Security Secretariat), 6, and 7, and establishes the Citizen Security Council.
Responsibilities related to numerals 3 (as related to the GAO), 4, and 5, and the coordination
between security and justice sectors are the object of another policy which is currently being
discussed within government. The criminal justice and security policy has strong support from
the European Commission (which has it as a trigger for its second sector budget support

A. Agencies responsible for promoting and administering security and justice

1. Secretariat of Security

The Secretariat of Security was created in 1998 to separate the national police from the army
forces (Decree No. 155-98). This Secretariat has the mandate to formulate national policies
related to public order, peaceful co-existence, violence prevention, criminal investigation, and
citizen safety. The Security Secretariat is also the technical secretariat responsible for
implementing the citizen security and co-existence policy 2011-2022. Traditionally, The
Secretariat has been responsible for the national preventive police, national criminal
investigation, special investigation services (smuggling, fraud, etc), special preventive
services (prisons), police education, and traffic police. With the recent passage of the citizen
security policy, the Secretariat has created a new Sub-secretariat of Co-existence and
Community Participation whose specific mandate is to design and implement crime and
violence prevention programs with a human rights approach.
Concerns about the country’s increasing crime rate have resulted in an increase in the
Secretariat’s budget. In recent years, the budget of the Security Secretariat (which includes
funding for the police) was increased to allow for the recruitment of more officers. Even with
this increase, the ratio of police to population (148 per 100,000 inhabitants) is just half the
regional average, and the training and preparation of recruits could be significantly
improved.51 Donors, especially the Spanish Cooperation Agency, have contributed technical
assistance, training, and equipment in an effort to build capacity in the security sector.
Despite legal reforms for a more rehabilitation-oriented system, the prison situation in
Honduras continues to be critical, with high levels of overcrowding, escalating violence, and
only limited improvement in the percentage of pre-trial detainees. The prison situation has
changed little over the years as it has been a low priority for the government and the general
public. With respect to prison reform measures, the citizen security policy provides a
comprehensive framework for the modernization of the penitentiary system including the
professionalization of administrative personnel, equipment, etc.
According to the Institutional Governance Review (IGR) 2009, the police seems to be the
weakest link in the criminal justice chain and perhaps a key element to achieving
improvement in overall performance. New programs to finance equipment and infrastructure
and a series of outreach initiatives aimed at bringing the police closer to the community and
fostering citizen cooperation hold some promise. However, what is needed most is
organizational restructuring, efforts to improve the quality of existing staff and to attract more
51
  This figure is calculated against the number or preventive and investigative police officers only (Republic of Honduras
2005. If transit officers are included, the figure reaches 169, which is still low. The region’s average is 300 per 100,000
inhabitants.
                                                           93
qualified recruits, a more efficient control of performance (including information systems,
which are significantly underdeveloped), better coordination among all parties, and the
formulation of policies for the overall sector and individual police divisions. The citizen
security policy proposes a set of programs and actions that will move the sector in this
direction, such as strengthening the police education and training system to orient it towards
respect for basic rights and civic coexistance, developing their capacities to partner in local
citizen security plans, ensuring a minimum of high school education for all policemen,
developing an inter-institutional action plan to conduct criminal investigation in a integrated
fashion with the Public Ministry, and so on.

2. Secretariat of Justice and Human Rights

The Secretariat of Justice and Human Rights was created by Executive Decree PCM-027-
2011. The Ministry is responsible for providing guidance, coordination, direction, and
supervision for the implementation of public policies on human rights and access to justice.
These activities include the elaboration of the National Action Plan on Human Rights with the
participation of civil society organizations. The Ministry also coordinates with the National
Commission on Human Rights, which investigates complaints about possible human rights
violations. Since the establishment of the Ministry was a fairy recent event and its budgetary
arrangements are still under consideration, its financial and technical capacities are limited at
this time. The Security Secretariat is coordinating with the Human Rights Secretariat are
conducting dissemination activities of the citizen security policy and will work closely on the
elaboration of the action plan for the policy. The EU has recently approved a grant of 5
million euros to strengthen the Secretariat’s capacity.

3. Secretariat of Interior and Population

This Secretariat aims to strengthen and consolidate internal governance and citizen
participation mechanisms. Its mandate includes coordination, supervision, and evaluation of
departmental and municipal development plans. The Secretariat of the Interior coordinates
with the Security Secretariat activities aimed at increasing the capacity of local governments
in the implementation of alternative justice and mediation mechanisms. A reform of the
mediation law championed by the Secretariat of Interior is under discussion. This new law is
expected to provide more responsibilities to local governments to promote alternative justice
and conflict resolution mechanisms. This is a critical service to promote a culture of peace
and respect for basic rights at the local level, and to reduce the excessive workload of judicial
system. It is being proposed as an indicative policy action for DPC2 of this series.

4. Honduran Children and Family Institute (INFHA)

INHFA was created by Decree No. 199-97 (December 29, 1997) as an autonomous agency in
charge of the protection of children and family. Under the provisions of the Children and
Adolescents Code, INHFA is responsible for the detention centers for juvenile offenders.

5. Local Governments

Local governments have been at the forefront of the innovations in citizen security. Some
municipalities, such as Puerto Cortes, have developed successful mechanisms to raise security
                                              94
taxes and manage them transparently through a trust fund monitored by local authorities, the
private sector, and civil society organizations. Despite this critical role, the normative and
policy framework did not provide much space for local governments’ role in citizen security.

One of the key contributions of the Citizen Security Policy is the recognition of the critical
role and relevance of local governments in the implementation of the citizen security policy.
In this regard, the policy contemplates the creation of citizen security and coexistence local
councils. These councils will be made up of institutional representatives of the National
Council on Citizen Security at the municipal level and will facilitate coordination between the
national and regional levels.

6. Public Ministry (Public Prosecutors Office)

This institution was created by Decree No 228-93, published in the Official Gazette No 27241
January 6, 1994. As in most countries in Latin America, the Public Ministry is an agency
with a broad mandate that includes prosecution of common or organized crime, but also
domestic violence, abuse of children and human rights violations. The PM has a Special
Human Rights Prosecutor who has been very active in the investigation of sensitive cases of
possible human rights abuses. Cases brought to the PM have to rely on investigative capacity
of the police and there are serious complaints about the prosecutorial capacity of this
institution. Lack of resources and political external forces seriously limit its capacity and
effectiveness.

7. Judicial Branch

The judicial branch of government consists of a Supreme Court of Justice, courts of appeal,
trial courts (Juzgados de Letras), and justice of the peace courts. The Public Defense Office
is also attached to the Judiciary. The Supreme Court has 15 justices, elected for seven-year
terms by the National Congress. The principal objective of a Judiciary is to solve the conflicts
among individuals, and between them and the State. The system must provide the necessary
elements to channel social conflicts and preserve social peace. Under the rule of law, the
administration of justice is a power that must be exercised impartially. Several reforms have
been enacted to promote judicial independence, but several factors have conspired to reduce
their effectiveness. For a detailed analysis see World Bank’s Institutional Governance
Review (2009).

B. Coordinating and Oversight Bodies

8. National Citizen Security Council

The Citizen Security Council, created by the citizen security and co-existence policy will
report directly to the president and will be given responsibility for the elaboration of the
policy’s action plan and its oversight mechanisms. The Council’s multi-stakeholder
composition will ensure that the National Citizen Security and Co-existence Policy is
implemented in a way that represents the views not only of the national Government through
the Security Cabinet, but also of the judiciary, line ministries and local authorities. This
council is comprised of the President of the Republic, the Security Secretariat (which will act
as the technical secretary), the Secretariat of Interior and Population, the Secretariat of Justice
                                                 95
and Human Rights, the Office of the Attorney General, the national police, the Supreme
Court, and line ministries working on crime and violence prevention.

9. Security, National Defense, and Governance Cabinet
The Cabinet is established by the Country’s 2010-2038 Vision Law, the 2010-2022 National
Plan, and the Public Administration law. It is comprised of the Secretariat of the Presidency,
the Secretariat of Justice and Human Rights, the Secretariat of the Interior and Population, the
Secretariat of Security, the Secretariat of Defense, and the Secretariat of Planning and
International Cooperation. Its mandate is to ensure that the activities of the key actors
involved in the implementation of the comprehensive citizen security policy are in line with
the main presidential priorities. The Security, National Defense, and Governance Cabinet is
also expected to request that key line ministries such as the Social Development Secretariat
participate in the discussions of the citizen security action plan.

10. National Council of Interior Security (CONASIN)

This Council was created by the Organizational Police Law (2008). The Council is made up
of the Security Secretariat along with civil society and private sector organizations whose
function is to advise the Minister of Security on citizen participation in policy design and
implementation. However, CONASIN has been inactive in recent years. There are ongoing
discussions on how to restructure its role in light of the creation of the Citizen Security
Council and the experience gained with CONASIN.

11. Human Rights Commissioner (CONADEH)

The CONADEH was created by Decree No 2-95 that reformed Article 59 of the Constitution.
This agency is entrusted by the Constitution with the responsibilities of a Human Rights
Ombudsman. It is an independent and autonomous body with a crucial role in the prevention
of torture and ill-treatment, particularly in relation to detainees. It has a network of offices
covering the whole country. These offices must conduct periodic reviews of individual abuse
cases and prepare analyses on systemic issues that may include inspections of police and
prison facilities to ascertain the physical presence and conditions of possible victims of
abuses. CONADEH has also developed a database with a standard reporting system on
allegations of human rights violations.

12. Civil Society Organizations

A number of civil society organizations play very important roles in the promotion of citizen
security and protection of basic rights within the criminal justice system. Some of the most
active organizations are Casa Alianza, CRPTR (Centro de Prevención Tratamiento y
Rehabilitación de las Víctimas de la Tortura y sus Familiares.); CIPRODEH (Centro de
Investigación y Promoción de los Derechos Humanos); COFADEH (Comité de Familiares
de Detenidos Desaparecidos en Honduras); CEJIL (Centro por la Justicia y el Derecho
Internacional); ERIC (Equipo de Reflexión e Investigación de la Compañía de Jesús en
Honduras); Women’s Rights Center (Centro de Derechos de la Mujer); Women’s Studies
Center (Centro de Estudios de la Mujer) and; the Violence Observatory (Observatorio de
Violencia) at the National Autonomous University of Honduras.
