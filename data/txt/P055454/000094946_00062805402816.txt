KERALA RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL
SANTIATION PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS STUDY
Executive Summary
Preamble
1. The decentralised planning process initiated by the Government of Kerala (GoK) in
1997 has empowered the Panchayati Raj institutions in the state to plan, formulate
and implement local development programmes in relevant sectors such as water,
sanitation and health. The proposed Kerala Rural Water Supply and Environmental
Sanitation (KRWSS) Project is a part of this process and is aimed at improving the
quality of rural water supply and environmental sanitation service delivery to achieve
sustainability of investment and generate health and income benefits.
The Project Setting
2. The proposed KRWSS project envisages implementation of about 2000 water,
sanitation and environmental (watershed) management schemes in about 100
panchayats in the four northern contiguous districts of the state, viz. Kozhikode,
Malappuram, Thrissur and Palakkad . The project districts fall essentially under three
river basins, viz. the Chaliyar, the Chalakudy and the Bharathapuzha.
A unique feature of the proposed project is its bottom-up planning process in which
the beneficiary community is actively involved in all stages of development of the
project and its implementation including O&M of facilities created under the project.
3. The key components of the proposed project include construction of new /
augmentation / rehabilitation of drinking water schemes, drainage schemes,
household latrines and environmental management and watershed development
schemes. The health, hygiene and sanitation component of the project includes health
and hygiene education programmes for safe handling of drinking water, disposal of
waste water (sullage), personal hygiene, household hygiene and community
environmental sanitation. The integrated watershed management component of the
iv



project includes schemes for improving sustainability and perenniality of the water
sources. The project also includes state-wide sector development studies including
institutional capacity building and programmes for improving KWA's O&M cost
recovery performance and preparing river basin plans for the project area. The
project estimated to cost US$60 million is to be implemented in phases over a period
of 6 years with financial assistance from the World Bank, through the recently
established Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (KRWSA), an autonomous
registered society under the Department of Irrigation, Government of Kerala.
Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
4. The proposed KRWSS Project has been classified by the Bank as Category 'B' and
requires environmental analysis (EA) only. The project does not require any formal
clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), Government of
India as also from the Department of Science, Technology and Environment of
Kerala and the State Pollution Control Board. The State Water Policy (1992) accords
high priority for drinking water and underscores the need for regular programme of
monitoring of fresh water bodies for their health and ecology. In order to prevent
undesirable environmental impact due to erratic development of ground water, the
State has formulated in 1997 a draft legislation to regulate and control extraction of
ground water. But the Act remains to be passed. The State is also yet to formulate its
water supply and sanitation policy, but follows the national policy which promotes
participation by the Panchayat Raj Institutions. It lays emphasis on integration of
water supply and environmental sanitation (inclusive of environmental, domestic and
personal hygiene). There are several agencies, both Central and State, which are
engaged in water quality monitoring, but no agency with a mandate to monitor the
quality of water supplies managed by the Panchayats. The   policy   has   also
delineated the institutional arrangements for the implementation of the policy. A
Water Resources Control Board (WRCB) to oversee and co-ordinate all policy
related activities at state level, a Centralised Hydrological Data Bank and Data
Processing Centre and a separate cell in the Irrigation Department to organise and
coordinate all programmes related to non-conventional fresh water resources in the
v



state, viz., tanks, ponds, springs etc., would form essential ingredients of the proposed
institutional arrangements. The State has also a Coastal Zone Management Plan to
regulate various activities within the 500 m zone from the high tide line of its coast.
Baseline Status
5. The state of Kerala, flanked by Karnataka in the north and Tamil Nadu in the east, is
one of the smallest states in India with an area of 38,863 sq.km and is located
between 8°18' and 12°48' N latitude and 74°52' and 77022' E longitude. The Westem
Ghats constituting the eastern parts of the state rise from very low altitudes of a few
hundred metres upto 2000 m on an average. Most of the reserve forests of the state
are in this highland region. The salient demographic data of the state including that
of the four project districts are presented in Table 1.
6. Based on physical features, the state is divided into three natural regions: i) the
sandy coastal region (< 7.5m above MSL), ii) the mid-land region (7.5m - 75m above
MSL), and iii) the highland region (> 75m above MSL). Of the four project districts,
Palakkad has no coastal area. Geologically, the state is mainly comprised of
crystalline rocks such as charnockites, khondalites, gneisses and Dharwar schists of
pre-cambrian age. Laterites cover wide areas in the state, and alluvium overlying
laterite extends all along the coast.
Water Resources and Water Quality
7. The average annual rainfall in the state is about 3000mm and its spatial distribution
varies significantly (lowland 900mm - 3500mm; midland, 1400mm-4000mm and
highland 2500mm - 6000mm). About 60% of the annual rainfall occurs during the
south-west monsoon (June-August). There are 44 rivers with a length more than
15km in Kerala all of which originate in the Westem Ghats. 41 of these are west
flowing and join the Lakshadweep Sea while the rest are east flowing and discharge
into the Bay of Bengal. Because of the undulating topography with steep gradients,
the rivers flow into the sea within hours after precipitation. The surface water
resources as also the groundwater resources of the state are given in Table 2 and 3
vi



respectively. The estimated ground water resource of the phreatic aquifer in the state
is 7,900 MCM. There is considerable variation in the available / utilisable ground
water resources between the districts and between the blocks within a district due to
natural variations in topography, the hydrogeology, the pattern of rainfall and the
ground water draft. The available per capita water resources (surface water 4985
Vlhead/day and ground water 780 1/head/day) are less than that of many other dry
states of India.

District wise utilizable groundwater is the annual replenishable recharge of the district phreatic aquifer
(including rainfall, topography, hydrogeology etc).

8. Surface waters in rivers, especially in the lower reaches, are polluted by municipal
and industrial discharges, agricultural runoff and by salinity intrusion from the sea.
Extensive sand mining in almost all the rivers has also seriously affected the quantity
and quality of river waters in the state.
9. The level of ground water utilisation in the state and in the project districts
(Table 3) is in the 'white' category (<45% of the utilisable resources) excepting in
some isolated pockets thus leaving still a significant scope for utilisation of ground
water for rural water supplies. Elxcessive ground water withdrawal in certain parts of
Palakkad and Thrissur Districts has resulted in the lowering of ground water level.
By and large, the ground water quality in the state and the project districts is potable
except in certain areas which have high concentration of F, Fe and Cl. However,
there is wide spread fecal contamination of open dug well waters and some borewell
waters due to the existence of a large number of non-point sources of contamination
such as deep pit latrines, septic tanks, barn yards and storm and agricultural runoff
(Tables 4,5 and 6).
Water Supply & Sanitation
10. The coverage of rural population with safe drinking water supply in the state as on 1-4-99 is
only 51% (Table 7) while the coverage for urban population is 77.66% (Table 8). As per a
survey by the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission, there are still 7091
'partially covered' (water supply less than 40 lpcd) habitations, 990 'not covered'
habitations and 13 inaccessible and hence 'not covered' habitations in the state. The
total number of fully covered habitations (water supply more than 40 lpcd) are only
1682 (Table 9). The existing piped water supply schemes in the state account for only
1008 mld of which the loss due to leakages in distribution is about 30%.

11. A large proportion of the rural population of Kerala still continues to depend for their
daily water needs on open dug wells, the density of which is one of the highest in the
country. The existing schemes implemented by various agencies have proved
inadequate to meet the growing needs of the population, and the gap between the
demand and supply of drinking water has been widening year after year. The
availability of adequate quantity of safe drinking water remains acute in the coastal
areas with limited fresh water resources. Lack of funds and inadequate infrastructure
have remained as the major constraints in the coverage and timely implementation of
water supply projects.
12. In general, the sanitation coverage in the project districts is high but much lower in
the densely populated lower income settlements, especially in the coastal areas.
The sanitation coverage in the State is only 51.3%, rural household coverage is 44%
and only 32% of the households below poverty line have latrines (1991 census).
In many households with individual plots, the traditional drinking water well, the
latrine, the cattleshed and the manure pits are all located in close proximity, with the
potential risk of contamination of the drinking water source, especially during the
rainy season.
13. Acute diarrhoeal diseases (ADD) mainly related to water quality problems, and worm
infestations due to poor personal hygiene and environmental sanitation, especially
among the lower income groups, are the most common public health problems in the
project districts (Table 10 a). A comparison of water-borne diseases in Kerala with all
India average is given in Table 1 Ob.

Public Consultations
14. The public consultations held with the target beneficiaries and other partners to the
proposed KRWSS project brought forth the following main issues to be addressed in
the project design.
* Sustainability of yield from the new sources for the proposed water supply
schemes with minimal interference to the existing sources and the need for
flexibility in the per capita water supply depending on the source yield
* Need for regulatory measures for groundwater withdrawal to prevent water
mining, hydraulic interference between wells and salt water intrusion along
coastal areas.
* Ensuring at all times a bacteriologically safe, potable water supply to the community
*  Watershed management programmes should be implemented concurrently with
water supply schemes to ensure sustainability and perenniality of sources
* Need to address the problem of safe / sanitary disposal of solid waste including
hospital and slaughter house wastes in certain panchayats
- Effective promotional campaigns and community awareness programmes to elicit
the participation of all sections of people in the proposed project
Key environmental issues
A critical review of the base line data, observations during site visits and
public consultations in the project districts clearly bring out the following key
environmental issues:
Water quantity
* The availability of safe drinking water is a serious problem. In the summer
months, most of the traditional private dug wells run dry and the public supply
from various sources is inadequate. The problem is very acute for the coastal
areas where traditional dug well sources are saline and the service level from the
existing water supply scheme is meagre.
* Declining water table is observed to be an emerging phenomenon in some parts
of the state. The Central Ground Water Board (1993) reports decline in water
xx



tables in the range of 1-3 m. for the period 1981 - 1990 in the northern districts
of Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad and in eastern parts of Palakkkad district due to
a spurt in ground water development. A recent study by CGWB (Workshop on
Groundwater Regime Monitoring in Kerala, CGWB, Kerala Region, January
1998) has also confirmed the decline in water level in certain parts of Palakkad
district. The study has further concluded that increase in groundwater draft is the
major cause for this phenomenon. It is generally observed in the project districts,
that competing demands for agricultural and domestic purposes are leading to an
increasing use of 'pumps' for lifting water from traditional sources, in addition to
bore wells. Generally, 60-80 percent water is being lifted for irrigation purposes,
10 - 15 percent for industrial and the balance for domestic uses.
Lack of sanitation and environmental health
The present level of sanitation coverage in the state is only 51.3 %, the rural
household coverage is 44 % and only 32 % of households below poverty line have
latrines. This implies that still a large percentage of rural population resorts to
open field defecation with its associated risk to public health. Open field
defecation also constitutes a major non-point source of pollution of surface and
ground waters in addition to soil contamination. This problem is more acute in
densely populated settlements, especially in coastal areas. Poor environmental
sanitation conditions and personal hygiene habits and lack of adequate supply of
safe water are factors responsible for high incidence of water bone / water related
diseases / deaths among the rural population. This situation could be remedied to
a large extent by increasing the community coverage with sanitation facilities to
achieve 100 % coverage in as short a time frame as possible.
Water quality
There is widespread bacteriological contamination of fecal origin in sources of
public drinking water supplies, viz; traditional open dug wells, bore wells and surface
sources, as confirmed by the findings of a study commissioned under this project and
the public concerns expressed during site visits. These concerns for ground and
xxi



surface water contamination relate to i)close proximity of increasing number of leach
pit latrines under varying soil conditions, laterite (midland) and sandy soil (coastal
area); ii) non point sources of pollution in the catchment area including possible
agricultural and surface run off; especially during the rainy season; iii) washing,
bathing and other domestic activities around the open dug well sources, especially
among the low income communities; iv) inadequate and irregular disinfection of
drinking water supplies, including chlorination under KWA schemes; and v)
inadequate testing and irregular monitoring of drinking water quality.
Environmental Impacts
15. The potential environmental impacts arising from the proposed project activities have
been identified, classified as positive / negative and presented in a matrix form in
Table 11. The overall impact of the project on the target communities will be highly
positive in general and the women in particular. The most significant positive impact
of the proposed project will be the availability of adequate quantity of safe water on a
sustainable basis all through the year and household on-site sanitation to the
underserved rural population in the project districts, thus meeting a basic need for a
healthy, productive life.
16. Better service delivery would enable and promote safe water at convenient points
within the household premises and will eliminate / reduce the drudgery in fetching the
daily water needs by women and children. The time and labour saved due to better
and more convenient service could provide opportunities for income generation,
especially for women.
17. Availability of adequate quantity of safe water through the new schemes coupled with
effective hygiene education and awareness programmes would promote improved
personal and environmental hygiene among the community.

18. The proposed project envisages large scale construction activities which will generate
significant employment opportunities to the local people and the NGOs which in turn
will have a positive impact on their income levels.
19. The watershed management component of the proposed project will reduce surface
runoff, improve ground water recharge, reduce soil erosion and promote growth of
vegetation and help arrest / reverse the declining trend in ground water level such as
that reported from some areas of Palakkad district. This activity would also help in
achieving sustainability and perenniality of water supply sources.
20. The bottom-up planning process, a unique feature of the proposed project, would
generate and promote among the beneficiary communities a sense of pride and self
reliance and enhance their capacity building in other sectors of development.
21. The demand driven approach to the proposed project with active participation of the
beneficiary communities in all stages of planning and implementation of the project
including sharing of capital costs of the schemes and meeting the total O&M
expenditure will reduce the financial burden on the state, thereby making more
resources available for increased coverage of population.
22. The dependence of most of the proposed water supply schemes on ground water with
enhanced service levels may trigger a spurt in ground water abstraction in the project
districts. This however, will not have a significant impact on the level of ground
water utilisation which presently does not exceed 45% except in some isolated areas.
23. The construction of large number of on-site sanitation systems under the project could
pose a risk of contamination of ground water unless the best practicable methods
w.r.t. siting, technology choice, and construction are followed.
24. Land acquisition for siting of new sources of water supply is not an issue as the
beneficiary communities are largely ensuring voluntarism by the people in making
land available for the common facilities.
Mitigation Strategy
25. The mitigation strategy would include the following essential elements:
i)    Formulation of appropriate policies, programmes and priorities as also
enabling legislations.
xxv



ii)    Creation / augmentation / restructuring of institutional infrastructure /
framework for implementation.
iii)   Forging effective linkages and ensuring co-ordination between various related
agencies and departments.
iv)   Active involvement and participation of the beneficiary communities through
the panchayati raj institutions.
These are broadly discussed as under
i)    There already exists a well formulated State Water Policy (1992) which has
identified in a comprehensive manner the important issues to be addressed,
the priorities, the short term and long term water management strategies as
also the institutional framework for policy implementation. However, much
remains to be done to make any visible impacts of the policy on the water
sector. For instance, the establishment of Water Resources Control Board
(WRCB) as the apex body to advise the Government on water sector and a
centralised facility for processing, evaluation, storage and dissemination of
hydrological data has not yet been effected. Likewise, concrete action to
regulate uncontrolled extraction of sand from river beds is yet to be initiated.
The state has formulated a legislation to regulate and control the ground
water extraction, but the legislation is yet to be passed. In the context of the
emerging trend of the decline in groundwater level in certain pockets of the
state, there is an urgent need to pass this legislation and to notify these areas
to be brought under the Act.
ii)    The existing institutional infrastructure with strengthening / restructuring as
necessary and those proposed / identified in the State Water Policy and the
Kerala Groundwater (Control and Regulation) Act 1997 and that
recommended in this report should be able to cope with the activities
envisaged in the water and sanitation sector.
iii)   The responsibility for implementation of most of the mitigatory measures for
the proposed project will rest with the Beneficiary Committees and Support
Organisations under the overall supervision and guidance of KRWSA. The
xxvi



DSTE could be assigned the task of preparing the water resources map for the
entire state down to the village level with recourse to remote sensing and
technical backup support from CWRDM, CGWB and the GWD. The data
generated could be shared with all the interested agencies for a fee. There are
a few measures such as bringing in a legislation for regulation and control of
groundwater abstraction which, however, has to be taken up at the
government level with technical backup support from institutions such as
DSTE, CWRDM, CGWB, GWD etc in the enforcement of the Act.
iv)   With the decentralisation process and bottom up planning already in place,
the panchayati raj institutions have to play a lead role in all local development
programmes related to water, sanitation and health. These institutions would
need technical support and training to undertake activities such as measuring
the depth to water level and test for residual chlorine in water supply. In this
task the support organisations have a crucial role in identifying the
information and training needs of the beneficiary committees as also the
appropriate institutions which will provide these inputs. The initial cost for
these inputs has to be met from the project funds.
In the light of the key issues identified and the associated environmental impacts, the
recommended mitigatory measures along with the agencies responsible for action are
summarised in Table 12. Mitigatory measures can be easily devised for the likely
negative impacts. These are presented briefly as follows:

Water quantity aspects
Proper siting of new  sources with recourse to scientific methods to ensure
sustainable yield throughout the year
The State and Central Ground Water Departments, CWRDM, and the Department
of Science, Technology and Environment of Kerala should play a lead role in
rendering technical assistance to the GPs (local bodies) in identifiying and siting
of aquifers of sustainable yield. Following the construction of the dug well/bore
well, the safe yield of the source should be ascertained by conducting  a
recuperation/pumping test during the most critical period i.e., summer. The
source should be commissioned for supply only if the quality meets the drinking
water standards.
D Construction of water conservation structures to enhance ground water recharge
thereby improving the sustainability of the sources
Implementation of integrated watershed management programmes should receive
the highest priority. These programmes will include catchment area treatment
(contour bunding/trenching, rain pits, percolation tanks, sub-surface dykes, etc.)
and drainage line treatments (check dams, gully plugging, retaining walls, etc.)
In coastal areas with sanility problem in drinking water and in water scarcity
areas, roof catchment of rain water should receive priority.
A flexible approach should be adopted in deciding the water supply service level
and a system of incentives/penalties in water tariff should be devised to
discourage wasteful consumption and promote equity in distribution.
Arresting the decline in groundwater level
In the context of the emerging phenomenon of decline in groundwater level in
certain pockets of the state as confirmed by recent studies, the Government of
Kerala should expedite legislation for regulation of ground water abstraction and
immediately notify these areas for appropriate action under the purview of the
Act.

Water quality aspects
* Effective and continuous disinfection of all drinking water supplies so as to maintain
a minimum residual chlorine of 0.5 mg/l.
In all the proposed water supply schemes, a reliable, continuous means of
disinfection (such as the differential pressure bleaching powder solution doser)
should be incorporated to ensure bacteriological safety of the supply.
* Sanitary protection of existing traditional open dug well sources
Impervious wall lining, a well constructed parapet and a drainage platform all
around would act as effective barriers of contamination from spill waters, storm
and agricultural run off.
* Establishment/strengthening of institutional arrangements for regular monitoring and
control of water quality
In this context a community based water quality monitoring and surveillance
system with active participation of grass root level educational institutions and
NGOs as proposed by the KWA merits consideration. The proposed 3-tier system
comprises the panchayat, + 2 level/technical institutions at the grass root level,
satellite laboratories at the middle level and the KWA district laboratory at the
apex level. Routine monitoring and control will be performed at the lower level
using portable kits attached to the panchayats, analysis of a more complex nature
and training of the water quality monitoring personnel will be taken up by the
satellite laboratory with higher level support from the district laboratory with an
appropriate system of cost sharing. In order to ensure accuracy and realiability of
water quality data generated under the three tier system, an exercise in inter
laboratory analytical quality control should be undertaken periodically. The water
quality data generated should also be compiled periodically (atleast once in 3
months) and made available for ready access to the public. The above set up,
which will have the catchment area as its jurisdiction, will also complement the
IEC activities of the panchayat/educational institutions.
* Selection and installation of safe sanitation technologies
xxxi



A variety of low cost on-site sanitation technologies (the pour flush single/two pit
latrines, conventional septic tanks and its variations, dry compost latrine, etc.) are
available. Of these, the pour flush two pit latrines are extensively used in the
State. In thickly populated coastal areas with high water table and prone to
flooding, communal latrines connected to biogas plants could be provided to
minimise the risk to soil and ground water contamination. The SOs should play a
crucial role in facilitating the BCs in the choice of safe sanitation systems
appropriate for the site specific situations.
* Revamping, wherever economically feasible, the existing deep pit latrines
Some of the older installations of deep (>3m) pit latrines penetrating the free
water table could be a source of potential danger to public health. These may be
revamped and converted into safe sanitation systems.
* Increasing environmental awareness regarding water supply, sanitation and personal
hygiene
The high bacteriological contamination of traditional drinking water sources is
also related to personal and community hygiene practices. Programmes related to
hygiene education and awareness are needed to keep the area around the
traditional water sources clean.
Performance Indicators
26. In keeping with the identified environmental impacts / issues which need to be
addressed in the project design and implementation, a list of environmental
performance indicators has been identified (Table 13) which could provide a basis for
monitoring and evaluation of the project performance.
