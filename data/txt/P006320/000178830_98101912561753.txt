BRAZIL
NORTHWEST REGION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE II
MATO GROSSO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Agriculture in the Economy
2
1.01      The national territory of Brazil covers 8.5 million km , of which
36% is registered as being in agricultural properties. The same share of
Brazil's 119 million population in 1980 lived in rural areas (down from 44%
in 1970), and agriculture employs 36% of the country's labor force (industry
23%; services 41%). There are wide variations in population density among
regions, from 1.7 inhabitants per km2 in the North to 56.3 in the Southeast
(1980 data). Of the 306 million ha in agricultural properties, 42 million ha
(13.8%) are in either annual or perennial cropping use, 166 million ha (54.1%)
are used for livestock, 68 million ha (22.1%) are in extractive or planted
forestry operations, and the remaining 31 million ha (10.0%) are considered
as productive agricultural land not currently utilized. A considerable
proportion of the latter is to be found in the Northwest region. With large
areas of undeveloped land, Brazil has traditionally relied on an expansion
of its development frontiers to increase its agricultural production. During
the 1981-1985 period, in part because of the rapid expansion of sugarcane for
the Alcohol for Fuel Program, it is estimated that up to 2.8 million ha of new
land will be put into cultivation annually.
1.02      During the last five years, agriculture has maintained its relative
importance within domestic production (between 10.5% and 12.4%) in spite of
several years of weather-related poor harvests, but has experienced a drop in
its share of exports (47%, with a total value of US$9.5 billion, in 1980, down
from 57% in 1975). The appreciable rate of growth in agriculture has resulted
for the most part from increased area under cultivation (mainly for soybeans,
fruits and vegetables) rather than improved yields. In fact, rain-fed rice,
beans, maize and cassava--all of which are major domestic food crops--have
experienced erratic and slightly decreasing yields over the last 30 years.
The Brazilian cattle population had reached 89 million head by 1979, with
some 38 million pigs, 310 million chickens and considerable numbers of horses,
goats and sheep. The 1980 milk production was estimated around 10 million
tons, after a rapid growth period between 1972 and 1976. Some 10.7 million
cattle were slaughtered in 1980 and the poultry industry has been growing
extremely rapidly.
1.03      The major export crops are coffee, sugarcane, soybeans, cocoa, oranges,
cotton and tobacco, a list greatly diversified in comparison to the mid-sixties
when coffee accounted for 45% of total export earnings. By 1975 coffee's share
had dropped to 11%, replaced by soybeans and soybean products as the country's
largest foreign exchange earner. Wheat has recently accounted for one-third
of the value of Brazil's agricultural imports (3.8 million tons of wheat
imported in 1979). Other principal agricultural import commodities include
natural rubber, live animals for breeding, temperate zone fruits, milk and
certain meats and seeds. Poor crop years result in periodic importation of
basic food crops such as maize, rice and beans (US$1 billion in 1980).



B. Government Agricultural Policies and Programs
1.04      Agricultural development has been assigned a high priority in Brazil's
1980-1985 development plan to (a) help dampen inflation through expanded food
production and stronger transport and marketing systems; and (b) alleviate the
balance-of-payments constraints through increased production of export crops
and energy substitutes. To help achieve these objectives the Government has
reinforced its support of special regional programs. Nonetheless, due to the
high inflation rate and the public sector deficits, the Government is restrain-
ing public expenditure and also trying to reduce the very high agricultural
credit subsidies.  Despite a series of recent measures, however, the subsidy
on regular rural credit remains quite high. Even more heavily subsidized
specific crop incentive programs remain available, such as those to produce
natural rubber. Regionally, credit distribution is biased in favor of more
modern agriculture in the South. Also, about 130% of crop-specific credit
has gone to six crops (soybeans, wheat, rice, riaize, coffee and sugarcane)
which account for 60% of gross agricultural production.
1.05      For the past several years, the minirium price program has set
guaranteed floor prices for 42 commodities to (a) help farmers make planting
decisions; (b) provide for the establishment of Government regulatory stocks;
and (c) ensure stable feed prices to livestock producers. Although minimum
prices are periodically adjusted upward in real. terms, they still remain
below market prices prevailing at harvest.
1.06      Provision of fertilizers and other inputs and implements is usually
done by the private sector, except in more remcte areas where it is handled,
often poorly, by state enterprises. The use of improved seeds, fertilizers
and insecticides remains concentrated in the scuthern half of Brazil. Consid-
erable scope exists for the expansion of their use in other regions. National
consumption of fertilizers increased at a rate of 16% per year between 1972
and 1978 and is now slightly above 3 million tens per annum. Some 40% of
nitrogen fertilizers and 70% of phosphoric components are domestically
produced. All potassium feritilizer is imported. Soybean growers are the
main fertilizer users (21%) i-ollowed by sugarcane, wheat, coffee, rice and
maize, which account together for another 54% of fertilizer consumption.
1.07      The principal regional development programs over the past several
years, largely devoted to providing agricultural services and infrastructure,
have comprised: (a) the Development Program for Integrated Areas in the
Northeast (POLONORDESTE), aimed at the rural poor in priority areas of that
region; (b) the Development Program for Integrated Areas of Amazonia
(POLAMAZONIA) to help coordinate investment for agricultural and mineral
development in the Amazon basin; and (c) the Development Program for the
Integrated Central Areas (POLOCENTRO) to bring the vast "cerrado" lands into
agricultural production. The Northwest Region Integrated Development Program
(POLONOROESTE), recently established and of which the proposed project is
part, aims at the further settlement, small farner development and environ-
mental protection of its area of action.

C. Agriculture in Northwest Brazil
1.08      The proposed project lies within the Northwest Region of Brazil,
defined as the area of influence of 1,500 km of federal highway BR-364 and
encompassing the territory of Rondonia and the West of the State of Mato
Grosso. A recent Bank survey of the region ("The Integrated Development of
Brazil's Northwest Frontier", Report No. 3042a-BR of December 23, 1980)
describes its fragile ecological situation, the good agricultural and mineral
potential, the rapid rate of population growth, and the various problems to
be overcome if harmonious long-term socioeconomic development is to be obtained.
The region covers approximately 410,000 km2. The regional population was
estimated in the neighborhood of 1,100,000 in 1980 and has been growing at 7.8%
per year in Mato Grosso and 15.8% per year in Rondonia. The dominant physical
feature of the region is the east-west oriented ridge of the Serra dos Parecis
(about 600 m) continued in Rondonia by the Serra dos Pacaas Novos, and separating
the Amazon basin to the North from the River Plate basin, South. According to
preliminary surveys at a scale of 1:5 million by EMBRAPA (the Brazilian Agri-
cultural Research Company) in 1975, and at a scale of 1:1 million by RADAMBRASIL
in 1978, the northwest region is estimated to have some 29,000 km2 of good
"terra roxa" or eutrophic podsols, 5,000 km2 of which are in Mato Grosso.
Further studies undertaken by EDIBAP, the study of the Integrated Development
of the Upper Paraguay Basin) indicate the figure for Mato Grosso could be as
high as 7,200 km2. Half of the remaining soils in the Northwest region are
estimated to be capable of sustaining agriculture with adequate fertilization.
Tree crops are preferred over annuals on environmental grounds. By 1978 only
about 1% of the region was planted in either annual or tree crops, 14% was in
natural or seeded pasture (mostly in the Savannah and Pantanal); less than 5%
was under forestry operations; and about 80% remained totally unused. Less
than 5% of the forest area had been cleared up to 1980, and while the pace of
deforestation has increased in recent years, there remain millions of hectares
of virgin forest which could be developed into productive national forests,
national parks or biological reserves.

1.09      At present, the dominant system of agricultural development in the
Northwest is highly traditional. That is, the forest or cerrado is cleared;
the timber of a few valuable species is extracted; and the remaining debris
is burned. This sequence is usually followed by a single upland rice crop,
although several annual crops may be planted i.f soil fertility is adequate.
Fertilizers and lime are seldom used and seeded pasture may eventually
degenerate or be invaded by scrub to the point: where it produces very little,
depending on the quality of the soil and level, of management applied. Mean-
while, clearance of new land continues. Annual crops such as rice, corn,
beans and manioc occupy about 75% of the total. area under crops in the region,
about 460 thousand ha in 1978/1979. Coffee is the most widely cultivated peren-
nial, with some 50,000 ha planted in 1978/19759, using traditional production
techniques brought from the South of Brazil. Intercropping is widespread and
pesticides often used. Cocoa (25,000 ha in 1978/1979) is well suited to the
better soils of Rondonia where almost all existing stands are located. Sweet
bananas are often interplanted to give shade for the first three to four years,
and to provide income before the cocoa comes into bearing. Rubber, although
native to the Amazon Basin, has had its development constrained by the presence
of South American leaf blight. The marked dry period in the Northwest contains
the development of this disease, and this, combined with the availability of
relatively resistant clones and recent advances in disease control has led to
the promotion by Government of rubber cultivation in the region.
1.10      There were under 1.2 million head of cattle in the region in 1978/79
officially, but the Rondonia herd of 130,000 is reported to be growing at some
30%/year, while the Mato Grosso herd is static. Dairying and milk production
is of importance around urban areas.
1.11      The Northwest Region is an important future source of agricultural
production for export and for domestic consumption as well as a location where
migrants from other parts of Brazil can be productively and permanently
settled. The orderly development and occupation of the region is currently
one of the high priorities of the federal government. To guide development of
the region, the government has created the POLONOROESTE special program under
Decree No. 86,029 of May 27, 1981, through which investments over the 1981-86
period would be financed. The program's objectives are mainly to:
(a)  promote the orderly human occupation and development, and
integration into the national economy, of this currently less
developed region;
(b)  increase the productivity, incomes, and health and social welfare
of the region's present and future populations, especially those
marginalized migrants from other regions of Brazil; and
(c)  ensure that the envisaged development: of the region is consonant
with the need to protect the land resources, the ecological system,
and the indigenous communities.
1.12      An estimated, updated POLONOROESTE budget, including physical and
price contingencies would amount to some US$1,548.0 million. The above-
mentioned basic objectives would be reached through the execution of a
number of integrated measures in: (a) Transport. The reconstruction and



- 5 -
paving of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho Highway (41.6% of the Program), the
strengthening of the Rondonia roads department (2.8%) and the improve-
ment of the feeder road network (8.5%); (b) Settlement of New Areas   The
opening of up to 3 million ha of land, suitable for sustained agricultural
production, to settlement through colonization projects sponsored by INCRA
(24.2%); (c) Land Tenure Services. The regularization of land tenure in Mato
Grosso (0.8%), (d) Rural Development. The consolidation of existing areas of
settlement in Rondonia and Mato Grosso through the provision of infrastructure
and services (14.9%); (e) Environmental Protection   Establishment of such
protective measures as the creation and consolidation of parks and forest
reserves, the strengthening of institutions responsible for the implementation
of such protective measures, zoning based on soil surveys, and and ecological
research (1.4%); (f) Malaria Control and Health Services   The strengthening
of malaria control and establishment of a network of rural health posts and
urban health centers in Rondonia, and health research (2.3%); (g) Protection
of Indian Communities.  The strengthening of the National Indian Foundation's
(FUNAI) capability for protecting the land and welfare of these communities
and for assisting them (2.5%); and (h) Administration. Administration and
monitoring of the overall program (1.0%).
1.13      The Government views the measures proposed under POLONOROESTE as
highly warranted on both economic and social grounds, especially since a
sizeable population already exists in the region, living in largely precarious
conditions due to insecure land tenure and the lack of access to basic infra-
structure and services. However, the execution of a Program of this type
entails higher-than-normal risks due its frontier development nature, the
weakness of some of the existing administrative structures, and the possible
threats to a fragile and imperfectly known natural environment and to the
Amerindian populations located in the Program area. The preliminary economic
assessment of the Program indicates an internal economic rate of return of
over 50%. Analysis is based on a comparison, over a 20 year period, of a
without' situation with no infrastructural or institutional investment, and a
with' situation which includes the impact of the various activities to be
financed under the program (para 1.12).
1.14      The Government has requested Bank support for the Program, in which
the Bank is envisaging participating in three overlapping phases:
(a) First Phase. An integrated initial package approved by the Board
in December 1981 and consisting of 3 projects (with 3 parallel Bank
loans) to be implemented simultaneously, includes: (i) the paving
of BR-364, strengthening of the Rondonia highway department and an
initial portion of the feeder road program for Mato Grosso and
Rondonia; (ii) a health program for Rondonia, including a strength-
ened malaria control program; and (iii) the agricultural settlement
consolidation subproject in Rondonia, including financing for land
tenure regularization activities in second and third phase project
areas in Mato Grosso, together with the environmental protection
aspects and the central monitoring, evaluation and studies component
for the overall program. The remainder of the feeder roads needed
in both the Rondonia and Mato Grosso program areas are expected to
be financed in parallel to this package through an existing mechanism



- 6 -
involving the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE) and
a proposed Third Feeder Roads Project:. The Program's protective
measures for the Amerindian communitiJes are to be entirely financed
by the Government. Staff Appraisal Reports 3532b-BR of October 29,
1981 (Roads), 3537b-BR of November 9, 1981 (Health) and 3512b-BR of
October 30, 1981 (Agricultural Development and Environmental
Protection) provide more information on this first phase.
(b) Second Phase. This encompasses the piroposed rural development
project in nine of the fourteen Northwest Program municipalities
in Mato Grosso, which is the subject of this report.
(c)  Third Phase.  Though this new settlement phase of the program was
initially expected to help place some 30,000 families on 3 million
ha in Rondonia and Mato Grosso during the next 5-6 years, avail-
ability of accessible suitable lands, execution capacity constraints,
and delays or complications in the development of appropriate
production recommendations where cultivable soils of relatively
lower quality are ito be used, may well reduce the number of farmers
and the total new area settled, or may also extend the execution
period of these new settlements. Preparation of proposals is at an
advanced stage.
D. Bank Involvement in the Agricultural Sector
1.15      The Bank has so far made 22 loans, totalling US$868.6 million, for
agriculture and rural development in Brazil (in^luding the recently approved
first phase Northwest project). These include two, amounting to US$119.2
million, for agro-industries; two, totalling US$60.5 million, for livestock
development; one for US$18.2 million for grain storage; two amounting to
US$100 million for agricultural research; one for US$100 million to improve
agricultural extension services; and 14, totalling US$470.7 million, for
various settlement, irrigation and rural development projects, 11 of which are
located in the Northeast.  In addition, there have been three loans totalling
US$196 million for fertilizer production; a loan of US$19 million for a
nutrition research and development project; a loan of US$32 million for a
Northeast basic education project; and two loans, totalling US$165 million for
secondary and feeder roads. A rural development: project in the Northeast state
of Maranhao and an agricultural development project in Amazonas state were
recently appraised. Additional agricultural and rural development projects are
also under consideration for possible future Bank financing. Completion and
Project Performance Audit Reports have been issued for the grain storage and the
two livestock development projects. In each of these three projects, significant
differences developed between the Government and the Bank regarding interest rate
policy, leading to some cancellation and/or early repayments of the loans. Project
Performance Audit Reports are currently under preparation for an agro-industry
credit Project and the Alto Turi land settlement project, for which Completion
Reports were recently issued.

II. THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO AND THE PROJECT AREA
A. The State
Location and Natural Features
2.01      The present state of Mato Grosso was established on January 1, 1979
when the former state was divided into two parts, the southern portion becoming
the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. As a result of this division, the state's
881,000 km2 represent two-thirds of its former land area, but its current
population (1,141,200 inhabitants) and economic activity are now only about
one third of the totals of the former state.
2.02      Mato Grosso is a frontier state encompassing 18% of the Amazon Basin
region of Brazil. The third largest state in Brazil, Mato Grosso is a trans-
ition area between the cerrados (or savannahs) to the East and South which
cover some 33% of its area, and humid tropical jungles to the West and North,
which cover some 57% of the state. The remaining 10% of the state is a
low-lying swampland (the Pantanal) in the southwest corner of the state, in
the basin of the Paraguay river. Altitude varies from 0-100 m in the southwest
Pantanal to 500-600 m on the Chapada dos Parecis, a weathered plateau continuing
east from Rondonia, that defines the southern watershed of the Amazon Basin.
Rainfall varies from 1,150 mm/annum in the Pantanal, to 2,000 mm/annum in the
northern rain forest. The Xingu and Juruena basins carry waters from the
northern part of the state to the Amazon. The Paraguay river drains the
region south of the Chapada dos Parecis into the Rio de la Plata Basin.
Social and Economic Conditions
2.03      During the 1960s and 1970s the population of Mato Grosso grew
rapidly, on the basis of immigration of small farmer families from southern
Brazil, settling in Government and privately organized colonization schemes.
These farmers gradually opened up the agricultural frontiers, moving west
and north through the state, but population density is still only 1.3
inhabitants/km2, the fourth lowest in the country.  The capital, Cuiaba,
with some 213,000 inhabitants in 1980, was established in the eighteenth
century by mineral prospectors coming up the Paraguay River, and is the
cultural, government and service center for the state.
2.04      Over 75% of the 56,100 farms in the state were established after
1960. Ownership of the area under farms (almost 22 million ha) is highly
concentrated, with less than 1% of the farmers controlling 55% of the area.
Land tenure conditions are also fairly unstable, with 30% of all farms operated
by squatters. The remainder are operated by owners (42%) or renters and
sharecroppers (28%). Use of land under farms is not intensive, with (in 1975)
only 2.3% of farm land under crops, 51% under natural or planted pasture, and
the remainder under forest. Rice is the state's most important agricultural
crop with some 80% of total cropped area, followed by corn (8%), beans (5%)
and manioc, soybean, banana, cotton, peanuts and coffee (7%). Livestock
production is fairly static, with a herd of some 4 million cattle and an
estimated half million pigs.



-8-
2.05      The agricultural sector has been the largest generator of employment,
occupying 52% of the economically active population (1975), followed oy
services (41%) and industry (7%). Industrial activities are concerned
primarily with the processing of agricultural and forest products, altnougn
construction and manufacturing are also important.  Mining concerns are
located in remote areas of the state, depending on findings of gola or diamonds.
The State government expenditures in 1981 are expected to be some US>317
million, the largest share goiing to Public Works (43X). 'ltne Secretariat of
Agricuture would account for about 5%. The state's resource Dase is still
weak; the major sources of funding are: (i) local taxes (31/.)  of which tne
ICM (value added) tax is the most important; (ii) transfers of federally
administered funds (31%); and (iii) borrowing from commercial or government
sources (38%).
B. The Project Area
Location and Political Subdivisions
2
2.06      The project area covers 61,500 km  and includes the nine municipalities
of Caceres, Mirassol d'Oeste, Tangara da Serra, Barra do Bugres, quatro Marcos,
Rio Branco, Araputanga, Jauru and Salto do Ceu (see Map No. 15935). It is in the
southeastern portion of the overall Northwest Region. The last five municipalities
were created in January 1981 from the subdivision of Caceres and mirassol d'oeste
in the region with the best soils and climate, a:ad hence the greatest number of
farms and settlers. Although the reduced size o-: tthe municipalities means thlat
the inhabitants will have easier access to public officials, the short time the
new officials have been in power means that the new administrative mechanisms
have not been fully consolidated.
Natural Features and Climate
2.07      The project area includes the three types of vegetation characteristic
of the rest of the state: dense tropical rainforest in the western and central
sections, giving way to the more barren cerrado ecology on the poorer soils
in the far north of the area on the Parecis escarpment, and to the Pantanal
complex to the south. The area is drained by the river Paraguay which runs
North-South. The southern portion (some 15,000 im2) of the project area forms
part of the Pantanal, a swamp bordering the river Paraguay, that floods annually
and is used almost exclusively for extensive livestock farming. Temperatures vary
between 120 and 34 0C. Relief in the northern half of the area is mildly undulating,
bordered on the North by the Parecis escarpment (600 m). The southern half is very
flat (150 m) consisting principally of the PantarLal. Rainfall is between 1,50U
and 2,000 mm/year in the northeastern section of the project area, and between
1,150-1,400 mm in the southern portion.  Some 70% of the rainfall is oetween
November and March. The three-month period beween June and August is very dry,
with only 2% of annual rainfall.  Recent agricultural aptitude surveys under-
taken at a scale of 1:1,000,000 by an OAS-financed study on the possibility for
integrated development of the upper Paraguay Basin (EDIBAP), show that some 3U/.
of the area can be used, with minor restrictions, for annual or perennial crops.
Some 23% of the region presents moderate restrictions for annual cropping, 1)1.
of the region could at best be used for artificia.l or natural pasture (mostly



- 9 -
Pantanal area) and 12% of the total area presents an aptitude only for forestry,
at best, and should be kept in reserves. For planning and project execution
purposes, the area was divided into two sub-areas, Caceres/Mirassol d'Oeste and
Tangara da Serra/Barra do Bugres. These regions have somewhat different agro-
ecological characteristics, and are separated by a ridge and a six-hour drive.
Information on each subarea is presented in Table 1 of Annex 8.
Social and Economic Characteristics
2.08      The population of the project area in 1980 was about 217,400, of
whom 59% were rural. Occupation of this region began in the mid-eighteenth
century, when gold prospectors and explorers established settlements such
as Caceres and Porto dos Bugres along the rivers. The population grew slowly,
mainly on the basis of subsistance livestock production on natural pastures
and fishing until the 1960s, when the agricultural frontier reached the area,
and private and government settlement schemes drew in small farmers from other
parts of the state and elsewhere in Brazil. Between 1960 and 1970, population
growth was about 13%/annum with the total number of inhabitants reaching
108,000 at the end of the decade. Most of the pioneers settled in the more
fertile regions of Mirassol d'Oeste and Tangara da Serra. Immigration slowed
to about 7%/annum in the next decade, as the best agricultural areas were
occupied, and cheaper, better land came available in Rondonia. As the density
of occupation increased, the oldest municipalities of Caceres and Barra do
Bugres were gradually dismembered into the nine municipalities existing today.
The population is young, with 46% under 14 years of age. Families are rela-
tively large, averaging about 6 members. The main economic activity is
related to agriculture or timber extraction, with some 80% of the economically
active population involved in primary production; some 5% are involved in
processing or industrial activities and the remaining 15% in services. Per
capita income levels are estimated to average about US$450 per annum for
the predominant type of small farmer family.
Agricultural Production
2.09      The main crop is rice (which represents about 50% of the area
cropped), followed by beans, corn, manioc and coffee. Importance in value
terms is roughly the same, although coffee production will increase rapidly
as recent and new plantings begin to bear. Herbaceous cotton, peanuts
and bananas are being grown, although on a much smaller scale, and some
farmers are experimenting with soybeans, which are grown more widely in the
southeastern half of the State. Total area under crops was estimated at
158,000 ha in 1979, and the area under pasture at 600,000 ha. Comparisons of
area cultivated and volume of production for the project area and the state
are given below:

Land Tenure
2.10      The ownership and occupation of land in the project area is highly
concentrated. Data from the 1975 Agricultural Census (see Table 3) show that
establishments of under 100 ha (89% of the total of over 16,000) occupied
only nine percent of the tot:al area under farms (some 2.7 million ha). Some
fifty-three farms occupied forty three percent of the area, which implies an
average for those farms of about 22,000 ha. The average size for farms under
100 ha is about 16 ha. The average farm size for the overall area is 167 ha.
The smaller farmers, typically settlers on colonization schemes, would be the
priority beneficiaries of the proposed rural development project.

2.11      Only 39% of the area farmers own the land they are working (see
Table 4 below). The remainder are either squatters (29%), renters (27%), or
sharecroppers of some kind (5%). The large number of squatters makes some
kind of tenure regularization imperative if they are to be encouraged to
make permanent improvements in their farms, and obtain long-term credit for
such improvements and for the establishment of permanent crops. Steps would
be taken under POLONOROESTE to resolve this problem, as noted in para 2.12.

2.12      The status of land ownership in the project area is confused.
Although the region is within 100 km of a Federal highway, placing it under
the jurisdiction of INCRA, the state land agency and colonization companies
have also issued titles in the region, often without an adequate title search,
resulting in overlapping claims to land and conflicts. Portions of the region
have good soils and agricultural potential, and immigrant squatters have taken
advantage of the uncertainty of tenure to establish their claim. Thus "areas
of social tension" have been created, when groups of farmer families occupy
lands of previously claimed larger farms. Some five such areas have been
identified in the project area, totalling some 330,535 ha.  In addition to
squatters, there are settlers who have been allocated land by state or private
colonization companies, without being provided with formal title to it as in
the Colonizacao Reserva do Cabacal, for example, which was settled under the
aegis of CODEMAT, the state colonization company some five or six years ago.
INCRA, aware of this situation, has divided the entire region into two land
tenure regularization projects (projetos fundiarios) headquartered in Caceres
and Diamantino, and is proceeding with an investigation of legitimate claims
(discriminacao), giving priority to areas of social tension. As a result of
this exercise, squatters with legitimate claims would receive a "license to
occupy" their farms (an adequate guarantee for long term credit), eventually
receiving title. Those areas without legitimate claims would revert to the
Federal Government and would, as appropriate, be distributed to settlers.
These tenure activities would be accelerated in a component subject to Bank
financing under the First Phase of the Northwest Program.
Potential Project Beneficiaries
2.13      Some 16,350 farmers lived in the project area in 1975.  Based on
growth to 1980 (2.6%/annum), it is estimated that some 20,800 farmers will
be living in the area by mid-1986 (the target project completion date).



- 12 -
As farmers in the 200-1,000 ha farm size category are likely to represeint
farmers who already have access to the various services, or have sufficient
resources to finance their own development, the potential target group for
this project was defined as farmers with access to under 200 ha. As some 90%
of all farms in the area are expected to be under 200 ha in size, a total of
18,700 farms would be in the potential target group. By 1986, after successful
execution of INCRA's land tenure regularization program, it is estimated that
some 60% of these farmers would be owner/operators, 27% renters, 8% squatters
and 5% sharecroppers.
2.14      Potential beneficiary farm families are pioneers, who settled in the
region up to 10 years ago, emigrating initially from Sao Paulo, Parana, Minas
Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul and the Northeast, possibly shifting location again
once in Mato Grosso. A recent survey of migrants in the region indicated that
the main reasons for moving were to improve living standards, employment and
income (50% of those interviewed). Other reasons were: difficulties in place
of origin (18%), the desire to occupy land (17%), and family ties (8%). The
tendency was for migrants, particularly those from outside Mato Grosso, to
spend an initial phase as wage laborers, later becoming sharecroppers or small
farmers. The majority of squatters appeared to take possession of land soon
after arrival. Migrants in general had a low level of education, with 35%
illiterate, and 95% having four or less years of education. The pattern of
settlement seems to have been to establish a claim on some land, through a
government or private settlement scheme, outright purchase or squatting.
(Those farmers in the tenant or sharecropper category, who rarely work on a
property for more than three! or four years, usually to establish coffee or
pasture for the landowner, would normally move on before reaching any later
stage of establishment.) A crude house was built and forest cleared to plant
subsistence crops. Small livestock (hens and perhaps a pig) were typically
also acquired.  After two or three years, settLers often introduced a cash
crop, usually coffee or bananas, sometimes with government credit. Typically,
after five or six years, the settler with some security of tenure would build
an improved house, and put an area down to pasture to keep cattle for milk and
beef, establishing his basic "mixed" farming system.
Agricultural Services
2.15      Agricultural extension services in the area have traditionally been
oriented toward preparation of credit requests and, until recently, favored the
larger farmers. EMATER-MT (the state Technica:L Assistance and Rural Extension
Service) has been operating in the project area since 1965 and has 15 agricultural
extension staff and 2 specialists operating oul: of nine local extension offices.
About 90% of official rural credit is channeled through the two agencies and one
advanced credit post of the Bank of Brazil, wit:h the remainder going through the
three agencies of the Bank of Mato Grosso, and the one agency of the Bank of the
Amazon. Some US$34 million in official rural credit was committed in the project
area in 1980, with 97% going into crop financing, and about half of this going
to fund working capital requirements. Distribution of credit use by farm size
is fairly skewed with large farms accounting for 46% of the BB financing, but
only 6% of the 4,369 contracts. Due to the size of the region, and the poor
quality of transportation services, access to credit is costly and difficult
for small farmers. Chemical agricultural inputs and equipment are provided
exclusively by private suppliers. The state-operated storage capacity



- 13 -
of 42,000 tons is inadequately distributed and lacks the grain drying facilities
necessary to ensure full utilization. Private storage capacity is equivalent
to that of Government, but of much poorer quality. Although the Government
has made significant purchases of rice in the region through the Minimum Price
scheme, private intermediaries remain the major link between farmers and markets.
Agroindustry
2.16      The main industry in the region is related to the processing
of agricultural products and timber. Facilities are all privately owned.
Some 95 rice mills with a capacity of 425 tons/day were operating in the
region in 1979. The log-sawing capacity was some 165,000 m3/annum in the
same year, although this capacity appears to be underutilized, as logging
areas become more distant. Only 39,000 m3 of sawn wood was officially
registered as marketed in 1979, although the actual total is probably double
this figure. The agricultural cooperative in Araputanga recently installed
milk cooling and processing facilities with a capacity for 30,000 1/day.
Other private sector milk cooling facilities are also being installed.
Physical Infrastructure
2.17      The road network is poor, but in the process of being consolidated
and extended. The project area contains some 500 km of federal highways,
1,200 km of state roads and 1,470 km of municipal roads. The municipal roads
link rural settlements and farms with state and federal roads. The over-
whelming majority of these municipal roads are no more than earth tracks
4.0 m wide, poorly maintained and frequently impassable during the wet season;
forest or heavy bush is allowed to grow to the road side, and the running
surface is consolidated to a level below the surrounding ground. Traffic is
seasonal, and few roads carry over 10 vehicles per day. The towns of the
southern portion of the project area are almost all served by the national
energy grid coming from the Cachoeira Dourada hydroelectric station, and
administered by CEMAT, the state Electrification Company. The electricity in
towns of the northern section of the project area is supplied from local
diesel powered generators. Rural electrification is practically non-existent,
although a cooperative has been formed as a first step to obtaining government
support for this kind of service. There are two rivers in the project area
with stretches that are navigable most of the year: the river Paraguay, from
Caceres to Corumba (720 km) and Caceres to Barra do Bugres (370 km), and the
River Jauru between Porto Espiridiao and the River Paraguay (170 km). These
were used principally for the transportation of cement and logs before the
advent of road transport. Only Caceres has a direct telephone link to Cuiaba.
Communication is a serious problem, and most public and private entities
depend on radios. The state Water Supply Company (SANEMAT) had provided water
to some 36% of the project area urban population by 1979, via simple systems:
only 27% of the houses served have an individual connection. Solid waste
disposal systems do not exist.
Social Services
2.18      Health and education services are reasonable in the larger urban
communities in the area (over 2,000 inhabitants), but very poor in the
rural areas. In 1978, infant mortality was estimated at 10% in the area;



- 14 -
malnutrition is widespread. Most of the medical services in the project
area are provided through the private sector: 80% of the doctors and 71% of
the hospitals and health posts are private. Sesrvice coverage is thin, with
0.28 doctors and 2.49 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants. Almost all health
facilities are located in urban areas. The ov,srall school participation rate
of 65% for the 7-14 age population in the project area conceals the very low
rate of 48% in rural areas, the substantial participation of students over
14 years old, and the very high rate of attrition. There were a total of
438 primary schools in the project area in 1980, providing a total of
31,640 student places, 43% rural. Primary teacher training levels are low,
with only 5% having completed secondary school in rural areas, and 40% in
urban areas.
Amerindians and Amerindian Reserves
2.19      There are an estimated 640 Amerindians living in the project area,
on five reserves totalling some 610,000 ha, as detailed below:

2.20      These people belong mainly to the Pareci tribe, and the reservations
are located in the cerrado region of the Pareci escarpment, in the otherwise
uninhabited northwest portion of the municipality of Tangara da Serra. The
only demarcated reserve, Umutina, lies in a different region, just to the
northeast of the town of Barra do Bugres. There is only one FUNAI post in
this region (at Rio Verde, in the southwest corner of the Pareci reserve on
the old BR-364), which is understaffed. Although the region occupied by the
Amerindian reserves is mainly cerrado, with poor soils, some 330,000 ha of
Class 2 soils, with moderate aptitude for crops exist in the Pareci reserve.
The reinforcement of staffing of the FUNAI post, health services for the
Amerindians and the physical demarcation of the various reserves will be
financed by the Federal Government under the FUNAI Special Project for the
Northwest Region, described and to be monitored in the first phase of Bank
participation in the Northwest Development Program (see Staff Appraisal Report
No. 3512b-BR of October 30, ]L981).

Natural Reserves
2.21      The project area has two ecological stations:  (i) Taiama, an
established facility of 15,000 ha in the northern Pantanal, and (ii) the
recently acquired Serra dos Araras, which includes 22,000 ha of a very diverse
region of escarpments, cerrado, forest (and Class 6 soils) on the eastern
border of the project area, in the municipality of Barra do Bugres. These
stations are administered by SEMA, the Special Secretariat for the Environment
of the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, the 70,000 ha Cara Cara
Biological Reserve has been created in the Pantanal area, to be administered
by IBDF (the Brazilian Forestry Development Institute). The whole of the
project area lies within the State's "Distrito Florestal," the area that has
priority for reforestation schemes financed under fiscal incentives. The
principal legislation regulating deforestation is the Codigo Florestal Law
4.771 of September 15, 1965, under which a maximum of 50% of any property with
forest on it, in the Amazon basin, can be cleared. Enforcement of this legis-
lation is the responsibility of IBDF, an institution which is being strengthened
at the state level under the first phase of the Northwest Development Program.
Other program-wide measures regarding environmental protection and ecological
research to be undertaken in the first phase of Bank participation, are
described in detail in S.A.R. No. 3512b-BR of October 30, 1981.
III. EXECUTING AGENCIES
Framework for Coordinating Regional Development Programs
3.01      The mechanisms for coordinating special programs (funded from
special Federal sources) are established in Presidential Decree No. 83,436 of
May 10, 1979, and Inter-Ministerial Orders (Portarias) 90 and 91 of May 27,
1980. Responsibility for overall planning, coordinating, monitoring and evalu-
ating these programs rests with the regional development superintendencies of
the Ministry of the Interior. SUDECO, the Superintendency for the Development
of the Center-West, already coordinates various special programs involving
Mato Grosso, including: POLAMAZONIA (the Program for Development of Agricultural
and Mineral Centers in Amazonia), POLOCENTRO (the Program for the Development
of the Cerrado Areas), PRODEPAN (the Program for the Development of the
Pantanal), and PROMAT (the Special Development Program for the State of
Mato Grosso), as well as funding from sectoral sources, such as the Ministries
of Transport, Health or Agriculture. SUDECO's main function is to review budget
proposals, control the flow of funds and monitor execution, making sure that
the necessary information on execution returns to the Federal Government.
3.02      Actual execution of special programs in Mato Grosso is usually
controlled by the GPC (the State Cabinet for Planning and Coordination) which
receives and disburses the Federal funds, and coordinates implementation of
targeted activities by the various state Secretariats and semi-autonomous
agencies involved. State development policy is set by the CDES (Economic and
Social Development Council). The POLONOROESTE program would be implemented
under the same structure but with special measures to reinforce execution,
coordination and monitoring capacity (see para 6.03).



- 16 -
Insitutions Engaged in Rural Development in the Project Area
3.03      To date, rural development in the State has meant the construction
of rural infrastructure, such as state and municipal roads through the state
Highway Department (DERMAT), warehouses and grain dryers through the state
Warehouse and Silo Company (CASEMAT), schools through the Secretariat of
Education and Culture (SEC), health facilities through the Secretariat of
Health (SES), the state Foundation of Health (FUSMAT) and the Federal Foundation
for Public Health (FSESP), and water supply systems through the State Sanitation
Company (SANEMAT). Some rural infrastructure development and maintenance is
also the special responsibility of the municipalities (prefeituras) and the
state Development Company (CODEMAT), which implements small farmer colonization
schemes. Land titling and collection of the land tax is the purview of the
Federal Institute for Land Reform and Colonizai:ion (INCRA) in the areas
controlled by the federal government, and state Land Institute (INTERMAT) in
other areas. The state Agricultural Development Company (CODEAGRI) comple-
ments the largely private sector supply of seeds and other inputs. Other
agricultural services are provided by the state Technical Assistance and Rural
Extension Company (EMATER-MT), the state Agricultural Research Company
(EMPA-MT), and the state Program for the Development of Community Action
(PRODAC). Credit is provided by the government-owned Bank of Brazil (BB), the
Bank of the Amazon (BASA), and the state Bank of Mato Grosso (BEMAT), in
addition to private banks. Coordination of the various entities involved is
the responsibility of the relevant secretariat (Agriculture, Education,
Transport, Health) with the Secretariat of Planning overseeing the execution
of the overall development effort. State agricultural policy is developed by
the recently established state Council for Agricultural Policy (CEPAG)
headed by the Secretary of Agriculture.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
Origin and Rationale
4.01      The proposed rural development project is a portion of the inte-
grated POLONOROESTE regional development progran, conceived with the objective
of obtaining a rational, agriculturally and ecologically sound use of the natural
resources of an area of Brazil's agricultural frontier. Economic development
in the area would soon be reinforced through the improvement of the Cuiaba-Porto
Velho Highway to paved, all-weather standards, which would lower transportation
costs. Although it is expected that the extraction of mineral resources from
the region would also increase with the improvement of the road, the thrust of
the program is towards the increase of sustainable agricultural production in
those areas appropriate for this type of exploii:ation, through the establish-
ment of stable small farmer production systems. In this way, gainful occupa-
tion would be offered to the small farmers dispLaced from other regions of
the country due to drought, frost, erosion, lim:ted access to land, increasingly
mechanized and capital intensive forms of agricultural production, or changes
in cropping patterns, among other factors. The project was identified in 1979,
during the Bank's general socio-economic survey of the region. The initial



- 17 -
project proposal was prepared by the state Government, with assistance from the
FAO/CP and guidance from the Federal Government through SUDECO. Initial drafts
of the Decree No. 86,029 and the "Exposicao de Motivos No. 028/81 - CDE,"
detailing the budget and activities sanctioned under the POLONOROESTE program,
provided a framework which served to guide the project preparation process.
The project is focussed on stabilizing the rural population and improving
long term agricultural development in an area which was the agricultural
frontier 10-15 years ago, and is now settled by farmers who have established
a fairly reliable productive base.
Objectives and Target Group
4.02      Proposed project objectives are to:
(a)  raise the incomes and living standards of some 17,500 of the small
farm families with farms of under 200 ha, giving priority and more
intensive assistance to 10,000 of the least developed small farmers
in the area;
(b)  promote a sustainable and rational development of agricultural
production mainly through increases in productivity, with some
increases in areas cropped; and
(c)  improve agricultural and social services in the area, expand and
strengthen physical infrastructure, and improve the Government's
capacity to plan and execute similar area development programs in
other parts of the state.
4.03      Although all of the estimated 18,700 farm families with holdings
under 200 ha in size in the project area by 1986 are expected to benefit
from improved physical infrastructure (roads, warehouses) and social services
(health, education), an estimated 17,500 would be targeted to participate in
at least some group orientation sessions on improved agricultural techniques,
provided by the extension service. A smaller subset (some 10,000) would be
given more intensive assistance (including occasional individual on-farm
guidance), coupled with first-time access to working capital and/or investment
credit. It is expected that the latter group of 10,000 small farmers will be
the major source of the proposed project's impact on incremental production,
and it is these farmers who are represented by the illustrative farm models
discussed in Chapter VIII. Of these 10,000 farmers, it is expected that 20%
would be sharecroppers, 35% would be owner-operators in the 0-20 ha size
category, 40% would be in the 20-100 ha size category, and 5% would have farms
of between 100 and 200 ha. While virtually all of these farmers would likely
be engaged in production of rice and other subsistence food crops, some 25% of
the beneficiaries would also have livestock as an important productive activity,
with the other 75% concerned with the cultivation of cash crops such as
coffee, rubber or bananas.
4.04      Project activities would focus on some thirty small rural communities,
the gathering points and service centers for most of the small farmers in the
region. These communities, already identified and surveyed, are located
in areas of at least reasonable agricultural potential, in order to have
attracted settlers in the first place. The communities are found in the



- 18 -
northern section of the municipality of Caceres, throughout Mirassol d'Oeste
and the five newly created municipalities in this subarea, and in the eastern
half of Barra do Bugres and Tangara da Serra. No project investments were
forseen for the southern portion of Caceres (the Pantanal area), where farms
tend to be very large, dedicated to extensive cattle raising, with few small
farmer communities.
Brief Description
4.05      The project would include the following activities:
(a)  the strengthening and expansion of agro-ecological zoning,
rural extension, agricultural research and input supply;
(b)  the improvement of physical infrastructure including consolida-
tion and expansion of crop storage and drying capacity, and the
improvement of murticipal roads and establishment of a road main-
tenance capability;
(c)  the strengthening and expansion of edlucation and health facilities
and services, and construction of rural water supply systems and
community centers; and
(d)  establishment of project management and coordination, including
monitoring and on-going evaluation.
4.06      Additional support activities such as credit for agricultural and
agroindustrial development, minimum price purchase mechanisms, as well as
incremental recurrent costs not financed by the project, would be provided by
Government. The Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection Project
to be financed in the first phase of Bank involvement in the POLONOROESTE
program, would provide for a series of parallel activities in Mato Grosso
crucial to the attainment of the objectives of the proposed second phase
project, such as land tenure regularization anc the strengthening of IBDF.
B. Detailed Features
Agroecological Zoning
4.07      In support of longer term development planning in the area, as well
as the specific agricultural extension and adaptive research work to be
carried out under the project (paras 4.09-4.12), the objectives of this
component would be to continue the efforts to better identify the natural
resource potential of the area, undertake general agricultural aptitude
studies, and collect and analyze environmental data with a view to preserving
the ecological equilibrium of the region. The component would be executed by
EMPA-MT, the state agricultural research agency.  The project would finance:
(a) soils and agricultural aptitude surveys of 55,000 kn2, covering the
ecologically and pedologically most diverse portion of the project area,
and the Guapore Valley (potential site of future INCRA settlements) at a
scale of 1:250,000 (this work contracted by EMPA-MT to EMBRAPA, the Brazilian



- 19 -
Agricultural Research Company); and (b) vehicles and equipment, salaries of
incremental staff (one senior and two junior technicians, one draftsman and
one administrator), incremental operating costs, six manmonths of consultant
services and funds to contract preparation of additional maps and services
as necessary. Efforts to evaluate the availability, potential use and critical
ecological aspects of natural resources in the project area would be attained
through: (i) systematic collection, updating and analysis of available data
on climate, hydrology, topography, cultivation practices, soil properties and
local flora and fauna; (ii) detailed studies and production of maps of a scale
not smaller than 1:50,000, representative of special soil or ecological condi-
tions, looking into topics such as water retention capacity and special
physical or chemical soil characteristics, and (iii) preparation of topo-
graphical maps by municipality at a scale of 1:100,000.
4.08      The component would help promote and refine improved land use
decisions, and lead to better and more timely identification of major research
problems. The institutional capacity would be created to replicate this type
of work in other parts of the State. The component would permit the extension
service, EMATER-MT, to improve its effectiveness in providing guidelines on
land use, and its training in farm management, erosion control and cultivation
techniques. The soils and agricultural aptitude survey, already contracted
and underway, is expected to be ready by June 30, 1982. Assurances were
received from the state Government that: (a) the topographical maps of the
project area, by municipality, would be completed by December 31, 1982,
and (b) the initial data collection and analysis phase of evaluation of
natural resource use in the project area would be completed by December 31,
1982.
Rural Extension
4.09      The component, to be executed by EMATER-MT, would provide direct
technical assistance to some 10,000 beneficiaries (owners and non-owner farmers)
to improve their agricultural production techniques, with particular attention
to crop diversification, and to raising on-farm productivity. It would also
offer agricultural orientation messages to a broader group of farmers through
farmers groups, promote community organization and initiate education in
nutrition, sanitation and home economics, benefiting a total of some 17,500
farm families. These activities would complement assistance provided under
the Bank-financed Agricultural Extension Project (Loan 1568-BR) for items such
as central administration and training facilities, which have a more general
state-wide impact. The project would finance: (a) establishment (some new
construction) of 11 new local extension offices; (b) vehicles and equipment
for the expanded extension system; (c) training courses for some 60 new or
existing extensionists during each of the first two project years and some 25
courses per year in subsequent years; for about 500 farmer leaders in general
agricultural cultivation techniques and preservation of soil fertility; and
for about 7,100 farmers in specific techniques such as land preparation,
erosion control, forage silage, milking, pruning, spraying and use or mainte-
nance of equipment; (d) extension information programs, such as radio programs
and farmer bulletins; (e) establishment and operation of about 150 demonstration
plots to disseminate adaptive research results; and (f) salaries of incremental
staff and incremental operating costs of local offices. The agricultural
extension staff would be increased from 15 to 80 persons and a new social



- 20 -
extension staff of 31 persons would be established. Subject matter specialists
would be increased from two to five and the administrative support staff from
ten to forty-two.
4.10      EMATER-MT has begun to provide technical assistance to small and medium
farmers for annual crops, mainly rice and beans, perennial crops and livestock,
mainly for milk production. It has already taken some initiatives to diversify
farmers into other crops such as soybeans, cotton and sugarcane. EMATER-MT is
responsible for technical assistance to local beneficiaries of the PROBOR rubber
program, and it maintains about five specialized extension agents and various
rubber nurseries. TechnicaL assistance in the establishment and maintenance of
coffee is also provided by EMATER-MT. Diversification in perennial crops, by
providing saplings of fruit and other trees is being initiated. Under the
project, extension services would be provided through: (a) individual contacts
over a couple of years to assist farmers in planning, interpretation of soil
analyses and preparation of credit requests; (b) group extension to provide
information and training in specific activities such as disease control
techniques, erosion control, crop rotation and fertilizing; and (c) orientation
through field days, mass media techniques and farmer organization. It is
expected that by the end of the project period the project would have provided
intensive assistance to about 50% and generally oriented about 80% of the
farmers with under 200 ha irt the project area. Extension agents would operate
in a fixed area and each would initially reach about 40 beneficiaries.
This would increase to about 125 per extensionist after five years.  EMATER-MT
would maintain a record (cadiastro) of each beneficiary receiving direct
assistance, indicating main farm characteristics, use of main inputs and
production data, with a view to ensuring continuity in assistance and providing
subsequent information on prcoject impact. Training courses for new and
existing extension agents would include, in addition to instruction in extension
techniques, special training: in: (i) individual crops of interest to the
project; (ii) project organization; and (iii) farm management. During normal
field work, extensionists would receive assistance from subject matter special-
ists and staff of the research company, EMPA-MT. Assurances were received
from state Government that (i) all new local extension offices would be
operational before April 1, 1984, and (ii) each local office would be located
so as to serve an area including at least 500 small and medium farmers.
Adaptive Agricultural Research
4.11      Complementing the agricultural research being carried out under the
Bank-financed First and Second Agricultural Research Projects (Loans 1249-BR
and 2016-BR), agricultural research under the project would concentrate on the
adaptation and selection of varieties and cultivation techniques to the
logistical and ecological conditions in the project area. The variability in
climate and soil conditions and the need to improve the research basis for
agricultural extension in this relatively recently settled region justify the
creation of a fairly broad research field network. The project would finance
(a) construction costs, vehizles and equipment for (i) a small regional center
for coordination and support of research activities in Caceres; (ii) three
local experiment stations each with two small test areas; (iii) six simple
weather observation stations and six simple hydrological observation posts;



- 21 -
(b) construction of limited incremental office space to accomodate project
generated research support services in Cuiaba, utilizing equipment and library
documentation provided under the Second Agricultural Research Project of
EMBRAPA; (c) salaries and incremental operating costs for seven senior and six
junior staff, six field technicians, twenty-five support staff and twenty-six
laborers; and (d) some thirteen manmonths of technical assistance to EMPA-MT
for improving its managerial capabilities and providing support in specialized
subject matters.
4.12      The executing agency would be EMPA-MT, the state Agricultural Research
Company, established in 1979, after partition of the State. The fledgling
institution incorporated existing EMBRAPA laboratories in Cuiaba, but is still
in need of considerable technical and financial support to establish the research
base necessary to support agricultural development in the sometimes fragile
ecology of the State.  Most of the work to date has been done on the "cerrado"
areas in the East of the State, where the bulk of agricultural production has
so far originated. Under the project, additional emphasis would be given to
the western areas of the State. Research would include investigation into
areas such as locally appropriate crop rotation and diversification, use of
livestock as part of a mixed farming system, farm management, and farming
systems. Some 55 crop experiments would be executed initially at the three
stations located in each of the three main ecological sub-areas (in the
municipalities of Caceres, Mirassol and Tangara da Serra), and then tested,
initially with full EMPA-MT control on experimental plots located in six private
farms. Some 115 tests would then be made at other farm level observation plots,
with EMPA-HT observing and recording the results. At least half of the
observation plots would be on farms of under 50 ha. It is not expected that
research results would be available until well into the project implementation
period. Assurances were received from the state Government that EMPA-MT
would: (i) publicize annually research results obtained in the project area
during the preceding year; (ii) systematically consult with EMATER-MT and
small and medium farmers in the project area before establishing its annual
research program; and (iii) by September 30, 1982, employ a regional EMPA-MT
coordinator in Caceres with terms of reference and qualifications satisfactory
to the Bank. A condition of disbursement for the research component would be
that appropriate sites for the three experiment stations had been satisfactorily
acquired. In addition it would be a condition of disbursement for the various
construction jobs under the research component (not all of which would be on the
three new stations) that satisfactory evidence of acquisition of the respective
construction site had been furnished to the Bank.
Input Supply
4.13      The project would improve the supply of agricultural inputs with the
establishment of a supply store and nursery in the project area. The project
would finance: (a) construction, equipment, and a vehicle for an input supply
post in Mirassol d'Oeste region of the project area; (b) the operational costs
(including incremental salaries) for setting up and the initial operation of
three nurseries. The executing agency for this component would be CODEAGRI.
The supply post in the Mirassol d'Oeste/Quatro Marcos area, where the most
fertile soils and many small farmers are located but where input supply is
still very limited would handle products particularly suited to the smaller,



- 22 -
least developed farmers in the region. It is expected that, with the develop-
ment of the area, private suppliers will also become more active in the
region. The three nurseries would be set up in the Mirassol d'Oeste/Quatro
Marcos area, possibly as an annex to the input-supply facility; the Caceres
region; and Barra do Bugres. Nurseries would produce seedlings of species new
to the area (pinus, eucalyptus, tectona grandis) as well as local varieties
(ipe, peroba, oiti, angico, sibipirna) for harvest as timber, and fruit
trees such as citrus, avocado, mango, caju, jaboticaba and coconut. Seedlings
would be promoted through the extension service and sold through CODEAGRI to
small farmers willing to plant up to 5.0 ha, with the objective of promoting
reforestation as a productive use of soils unfit for annual crops; diversifi-
cation of perennial crops; prevention of soil erosion and creation of an
ecologically satisfactory cover. Funds obtained from the sale of seedlings
would be reinvested in the operation of- the nursery.
4.14      Assurances were received from state Government that (i) adequate
working capital would be provided for stocking and operating the input supply
post; (ii) the new input supply post would be in operation by December 31, 1982;
and (iii) CODEAGRI would by September 30, 1982 have prepared a detailed sales
strategy and operational program satisfactory to the Bank indicating steps to
be taken and methods used to improve the availability of fertilizer, chemical
inputs and small equipment t:o small farmers.
Crop Drying and Storage
4.15      The project would finance construction and equipment costs for:
(a) initially, the consolidation of two existing 3,000-ton warehouses and the
construction of two adjacent: 15-ton/hour grain dryers, one in each Jauru and
Rio Branco; and constructioIl of a new 6,000-ton warehouse and 15-ton/hour
grain dryer in Araputanga, a 15-ton/hour grain dryer in Tangara da Serra and a
15-ton/hour grain weighing and drying unit in Salto do Ceu; and (b) construc-
tion of an additional 18,000 tons of storage capacity and complementary grain
drying capacity, and of three grain weighing and drying stations, the location
plans and timing to be finalized based on studies undertaken early during
the project.
4.16      The agency responsible for implementing this component would be
CASEMAT. The expansion and consolidation of warehousing and drying capacity
would reduce losses due to the grain deterioration after harvest (rice is
harvested in the middle of the rainy season), permit project beneficiaries to
dry and store and produce in the expectation of more favorable future prices,
and extend the potential operating scope for the Government Minimum Price Loan
and Purchase Scheme, which requires appropriate storage facilities. CASEMAT
establishes and updates its storage fee structure so that operation and main-
tenance costs are fully covered. In order to ensure that the additional yet
un-sited storage and drying infrastructure is appropriately dimensioned and
phased, assurances were received from the state Government that, prior to
construction of the 18,000 tons of storage capacity and associated dryers
still to be located, the Bank would be provided with: (a) evidence of
minimum annual utilization of 70% of installed capacity in the project area,



- 23 -
and (b) an updated regional grain storage and drying plan satisfactory to
the Bank, justifying locations and substantiating the proposed needs for the
additional units. Assurances were also received from the state Government
that, prior to the construction of the additional three grain drying and
weighing units still to be located, the Bank would be provided with
(a) evidence of utilization of at least 3,000 tons/annum on similar installa-
tions in the project area, and (b) a satisfactory location plan for the
proposed units. A condition of disbursement for each construction under the
crop drying and storage component would be that satisfactory evidence of
acquisition of each construction site had been furnished to the Bank.
Municipal Road Improvements
4.17      This component would include (a) design and construction of improve-
ments on 1,470 km of municipal roads; to Class F standards (see Annex 1); and
(b) establishment and initial operation of a system to provide routine main-
tenance along sections of road improved under the project and emergency works
on existing roads until they were improved. To achieve these objectives the
project would finance construction, equipment and spare parts, engineering
consultancy services and establishment of 4 technical support teams in CODEMAT,
the state development agency, to provide assistance to the municipalities in
establishing and executing road maintenance and improvement programs.
4.18      The component coordinating agency, CODEMAT, would contract out the
construction of improvements to some 805 km of municipal roads in Mirassol
d'Oeste, Quatro Marcos, Jauru, Rio Branco, Salto do Ceu and Araputanga. These
municipalities are the weakest administratively, having just been created
at the beginning of 1981. Civil works to be contracted would be divided into
a number of lots, regionally grouped, suitable for small and medium construction
firms. The remaining 665 km of improvements would be executed under force
account by the municipal governments in Caceres, Tangara da Serra and Barra do
Bugres. Selection of priority municipal roads for engineering design and
improvement would be updated annually by CODEMAT in consultation with the
overall project management unit and the municipalities. Improvements to Class
F standards provide minimum requirements for all-weather access, and provide a
road of 4.0 m carriage-way with approximately 10% of the length gravel surfaced.
Construction would usually involve the opening of a 20.0 m side strip; establish-
ment of effective lateral drains and culverts; and raising the road surface
about 30 cm and compacting. Design work would be contracted out to local
consultants. The average baseline cost of road improvement works has been
estimated at about US$5,000/km.
4.19      Road maintenance activities would gradually increase to cover the
entire municipal road network by the end of the project period. Responsibility
for maintenance would lie with the municipalities, with technical assistance
from four special teams in CODEMAT and assistance in training of operators and
supervision of machine maintenance being provided by DERMAT, the state Highway



- 24 -
Department. Equipment for road maintenance and for force account improvements
would be provided by CODEMAT and leased free of charge to the municipalities
under agreements whereby continued use would be conditioned on correct and
timely execution of planned road works and adequate maintenance of the equipment.
Assurances were received from the state Government that: (i) roads would be
improved according to the design standards in Annex 1; (ii) road building and
maintenance equipment would be used exclusively for works on municipal roads
in the project area; (iii) prior to the initiation of construction of any
project financed road improvrements in a given municipality, the state would
enter into agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with the municipality,
CODEMAT and DERMAT, defining programming and execution procedures, road
maintenance responsibilities, procedures for transfer and maintenance of
equipment and training of operators, and sources and levels of funding for
the maintenance of the municipal roads undergoing improvement; (iv) CODEMAT
would by September 30, 1982 (a) engage satisfactory consultants for detailed
engineering designs, and (b) nominate and have in place a civil engineer as
full time coordinator for the POLONOROESTE program works to be handled by
CODEMAT; (v) CODEMAT would have in place the fDur technical support teams
and the municipalities would have their maintenance foreman in place by
March 31, 1983; and (vi) roads improved under the project would be adequately
maintained.
Education
4.20      The component would seek to increase access to rural primary schools,
and improve the quality of rural primary education. The project would finance
costs of (a) constructing and equipping 126 schiools, creating an additional
394 classrooms and 31,520 student places; (b) renovating 122 existing schools;
(c) training for 1,818 teachers and administrative personnel; (d) publishing a
new primary curriculum adapted to rural areas; (e) equipping three multi-
purpose schools and (f) strengthening coordination of execution and monitoring
of rural education development in the area.
4.21      The Secretariat of Education and Culture (SEC) would be responsible
for coordinating execution of the component. I'onstruction and repair of
schools would be contracted by the state Department of Public Works, or
delegated to the municipalities themselves. Some 63% of the schools would be
small two classroom units in rural areas, 21% four classroom schools, and the
remainder of six and eight classrooms in the larger centers. The additional
space should raise the primaLry student area-wide matriculation rate from 65% to
73% by 1987, with the rural rate going from 48' to 70%. The location of project
construction would depend on a school mapping ex rcise, under which schools to be
established would have a catchment area of 30 km , and a maximum walking distance
of 3 km. Training would be given to: (i) some 70 school directors and
120 municipal level administrative personnel, especially for the six new munici-
palities; and (ii) currently under-qualified primary school teachers, with
422 receiving 100-180 hours of training in new teaching methods to be initiated
under the new curriculum; 456 receiving courses to upgrade their qualifications
to secondary school level; aLnd 750 participants receiving 100-180 hours each of
instruction in improved methods of teaching reading and grammar in rural schools.
SEC is developing a new curriculum adapted to Life in rural areas. The project
would provide for the publication and distribution of this, once a trial



- 25 -
curriculum had been tested and found satisfactory. The multi-purpose
schools to be equipped are trial efforts at expanding vocational
instruction in the region to include courses in agriculture and crafts for
adults and youths alike. To help improve coordination and supervision of
component activities, the project would provide for one central and two
regional staff. This team would also work to establish within SEC an
improved performance monitoring system for component activities. One
man-year of consultant services would be provided to assist in this task.
4.22      Assurances were received from the state Government that:  (i) a
satisfactory mapping of schools to be constructed or repaired under the project
would be completed and provided to the Bank by September 30, 1982; (ii) prior
to the initiation of construction of any school, satisfactory evidence of the
acquisition of the respective construction site had been furnished to the
Bank; (iii) a satisfactory implementation plan for the multi-purpose schools
detailing objectives and evaluation parameters would be presented to the
Bank by September 30, 1982; (iv) SEC would provide the Bank with a satis-
factory review of the initial results in the implementation of the first
multi-purpose school prior to initiating the others; and (v) the schools
constructed under the project would be adequately staffed and operating costs
covered. A condition of disbursement for this component would be that the
central and regional SEC project coordination staff were in place and oper-
ational.
Rural Water Supply
4.23      In order to support activities under the health component, and
reduce the incidence of water-borne disease, the project would finance
(i) the construction and equipping of about 24 simplified rural water supply
systems; and (ii) the startup costs in establishing maintenance capabilities
for existing systems.
4.24      The state Water Supply Company, SANEMAT, would be the executing
agency. Water supply systems would be provided for some 24 towns and villages
of under 2,000 inhabitants with a total 1980 population of 20,455, (and
averaging less than 1,000 inhabitants) that have been identified on a pre-
liminary basis to have the most pressing needs and to conform to locations
for other project activities. Systems would all consist of a well, a water
reservoir and standpipes, with an average of 200 persons per standpipe and
a target flow per capita of 50 litres per day, at an average construction
base cost per system of US$55,600. Costs are based on previous SANEMAT expe-
rience in the area, which shows the availability and quality of underground
water to be adequate. The project would fund SANEMAT's (i) setting up and
maintaining a small team of technicians and adequate spare parts, to provide
periodic preventive maintenance for systems operating in the project area, and
(ii) training the village level personnel selected to operate the systems.
Assurances were received from state Government that (i) prior to the con-
struction of a rural water supply system, EMATER-MT, in cooperation with SES
and SANEMAT personnel, would have assisted the recipient community to estab-
lish an association to be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
system and collection of water use charges sufficient to cover operation and
maintenance costs; and (ii) SANEMAT would be responsible for routine preventive
maintenance of the systems installed.



- 26 -
Health and Sanitation
4.25      The project would improve the coverage and quality of primary health
care services in the project area through (a) the construction and equipping of
7 health centers and 30 health posts; (b) the expansion of an existing heaLth
center in Caceres; (c) the training of 81 health post attendants, 21 attendant
supervisors, 14 sanitation auxiliary personnel in latrine construction and 7
laboratory technicians; and the provision of refresher courses for State
Secretariat of Health staff in administration of health services and community
organization; (d) provision of vehicles to be used as ambulances, in the
distribution of medicines, and for field supervision by SES staff; and of
bicycles for health post attendants; (e) installation of some 5,400 latrines
(f) the strengthening of SES planning and supervision capacity; and (g) incre-
mental personnel salaries and other costs associated with first year startup
activities.
4.26      SES would be the executing agent for this component.  Most of the
project action would be executed through the Health Foundation of Mato Grosso
(FUSMAT), a semi-autonomous entity within SES. Rural health care would be
improved with the establishment of service tlmocLules," composed of a health
center and the various rural health posts it supports, and of a routine visit
schedule by the health post attendant, whereby each of the families in the
community would receive a visit at least once every two months. Health post
attendants would be provided with a bicycle, and would be trained to monitor
and assist in areas such as: nutrition, hygiene, sanitation, immunization,
family health and planning, care of pregnant women, treatment of common
maladies and first aid. The health post would also be the first step in
the referral chain, extending through the healt:h centers to local hospitals
and Cuiaba. Latrine components would be produced by SES and stored at
strategic locations within the project area. ';ome 14 sanitation auxiliaries
would promote latrine use. Communities that had received the orientation
course and had organized themselves to provide the manpower to construct
the latrines would be supplied with plans and c:onstruction materials free oEF
charge. Implementation of the overall health and sanitation component would
be directed from the regional health office in Caceres, linked to the main
offices in Cuiaba, where a staff member in charge of project activities would
maintain contact with the Project Management Unit. Assurances were received
from the state Government that (i) project support in the construction of
latrines would be provided only in communities trained and organized for
their installation; (ii) a satisfactory manual for rural health attendants,
providing guidance in the bi-monthly routine family visitation program and
other responsibilities, would be provided to the Bank by September 30, 1982;
and (iii) prior to initiation of construction of any health post or health
center, satisfactory evidence of the acquisition of the respective construction
site had been furnished to the Bank.



- 27 -
Community Organization
4.27      To enhance community development and participation, the project
would (i) support organization of community councils and provision of training
with community level agents of the rural extension, health and education
components, as well as with other agencies active at the local level; and
(ii) construct six community centers. The executing agency for this sub-
component would be the EMATER-MT. A social extension agent would work in the
targeted communities to help organize groups and coordinate the training
activities of the various other agencies involved in the area. Assurances
were received from the state Government that (i) communities selected to receive
assistance under this component would have demonstrated receptivity to and
interest in community organization activities; be composed of a majority of
small farmers; be receiving or going to receive assistance under other
components of the project; and be distributed so as to enable broad demon-
stration effects as well as use of facilities by nearby communities; and
(ii) prior to the construction of any community center, would (a) provide to
the Bank satisfactory construction plans and satisfactory evidence of the
acquisition of the respective construction site, and (b) assure that a community
council had been formed and was functioning satisfactorily.
Project Management and Coordination
4.28      Overall project management and coordination would be the responsibil-
ity of a newly created unit in the state Cabinet for Planning and Coordination
(GPC), which would coordinate planning, budgeting and policy decisions, as
well as monitor and evaluate attainment of targets and objectives. The
project would finance equipment, vehicles, salaries of incremental staff and
consultant services for a Project Management Unit (PMU) of 12 staff members
and 16 support personnel, including field offices in Caceres and Barra
do Bugres (para 6.04). In addition to coordinating execution of project
activities, the PMU would be charged with keeping informed of the execution
of other elements of the Northwest Program that have a potential bearing
or impact on project activities, such as Land Tenure Regularization, Amerindian
Protection and the actual paving of the Cuiaba-Porto Velho highway. It would
raise any problems of collaboration and compatability with the POLONOROESTE
Program Coordinating Unit in SUDECO, the agency charged with overall program
evaluation.
C. Activities Parallel to the Project _/
Credit
4.29      On-farm development by beneficiary farmers would be financed
through existing Government rural credit programs without Bank participa-
tion. Large subsidies are inherent in the current interest rates which
1/   These activities would not be financed under the project, but are
complementary to it.



- 28 -
for small and medium farmers range between 12 and 35% on unadjusted principle
at a time when inflation is at around 100%. Credit requirements for the
10,000 directly assisted farmers, are expected to include:  (i) incremental
seasonal credit, estimated at US$28.0 million total, to help cover input
costs and    labor for annual crop production, and maintenance of perennial
crops, to be financed under the existing "normal" rural credit lines offered
by the BB and BASA; and (ii) medium and long tesrm credit, estimated to total
about US$15 million, to help cover purchase of equipment and animals, improve-
ments of on-farm facilities, land clearing, establishment of permanent crops
or pasture, and to be financed through existing Government investment credit
lines such as PROTERRA (Program for Redistribution of Land and Stimulation of
Agroindustry in the North an,d Northeast), PROASE (Program for Selected
Applications), and PROBOR (Natural Rubber DeveLopment Program). Although
credit procedures have been simplified for smaLl farmers, through elimination
or reduction of guarantees required, and the initiation of group-credit
requests handled by the extension service, access to credit is difficult for
many of the amall farmers in. the area, due to the small number of BB (3), 1/
BASA (1), and BEMAT (3) agencies in the projec: area. There are plans for the
installation of an advanced credit post in Jauru, and the conversion of the
Mirassol d'Oeste advanced credit post into a full fledged agency. Assurances
were received from the federal Government that: i) it would take all necessary
steps to ensure the timely availability of adequate working capital and invest-
ment credit to the projects' small and medium-sized farmers (including share-
croppers and tenants); and (ii) that the Program Evaluation Unit in SUDECO
would, on a yearly basis, evaluate the implementation of the project credit
component. Assurances were received from state Government that a Project
Credit Statistics and Monitoring System would be set up not later than
September 30, 1982.
Supply of Improved Seed
4.30      The scarcity of improved or certified seed has been a constraint
to improving small farmer productivity in the project area. Production
and distribution of certified seed in the state is monitored by CESM (the
State Commission of Seeds and Planting Stock). Seed certification is provided
by the INDEA (Institute for Agricultural Defense) at the farmer level and DFA
(Federal Delegation for Agriculture) at the rel:ail level. Seeds are produced
by cooperating farmers who multiply basic seeds brought in from out of state.
About two thirds of the seed multiplication programs are controlled by private
companies, and one third by CODEAGRI. Rice seed represents over 75% of the
certified seed market. In 1980 CODEAGRI sold some 720 tons of certified rice
seed in the State. The state Agricultural Planning Commission (CEPA-MT)
is developing a state seed production and distribution program, within the
guidelines established by the National Seed Production Program for 1980-1984.
Once sanctioned by the State Agricultural Policy Commission, this plan would
establish a mechanism to evaluate potential statewide demand for the various
types of certified seed, and put together schemes involving both the public
and private sector to supply these requirements. Assurances were received
from the state Government that the Seed Supply Program would be underway and
a Seed Supply Program coordinator would be in place by September 30, 1982.
1/   Including Mirassol d'Oeste as a full service agency.



- 29 -
Minimum Price Financing Scheme
4.31      The Commission for the Financing of Agricultural Production (CFP)
operates the storage financing and crop purchase scheme in the region, based
on minimum prices set specifically for the region, and readjusted periodically.
The guaranteed purchase price is usually 20% to 30% below market. Storage
financing and crop purchases are handled through Bank of Brazil, usually
utilizing the official government storage companies (CASEMAT and CIBRAZEM).
Due to the importance of these activities to the farmers in the project area,
particularly for rice, assurances were received from the state and federal
Governments that they would take all measures necessary to maintain the crop
purchase and financing mechanism fully operational in the project area,
including the provision of product classifiers, where necessary.
V. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Project Cost
5.01      Total project costs over the five year investment period (mid-1981
to mid-1986) are estimated at US$76.4 million as of June 1981, including a
foreign exchange cost of US$14.2 million, or about 19%, and taxes of about
US$1.53 million. Physical contingencies total 11% of baseline costs, and price
contingencies are equivalent to 29% of baseline costs. Physical contingencies
were added to baseline costs at 5% for the rural extension, drying and storage,
and education components; 7% for the adaptive research, rural water supply,
health and sanitation and project management components; 10% for the agro-
ecological zoning, community center and input supply components, and 15% for
municipal roads. Price contingencies were calculated in US dollar terms,
based on international inflation rates estimated at 9% for calendar 1981, 8.5%
for 1982, and 7.5% from 1983 on. It was assumed that periodic local currency
devaluations would compensate for differences between projected US dollar
inflation and local inflation rates. Project costs are summarized in the
table overleaf, and annual phasing of investments is shown in Annex 4.
Financing
5.02      The proposed Bank loan of US$26.4 million to the Federative Republic
of Brazil would include US$0.4 million to cover the cost of the front end fee
assessed by the Bank, capitalized at the request of Government, and US$26 mil-
lion which would finance 35% of total project costs net of taxes, or about 34%
of project costs including taxes. This would include the total foreign
exchange component of the project, plus about US$12 million equivalent of
local costs. The loan would be for 15 years, including 3 years of grace.
The balance of project financing would be provided by the federal and state
Governments through the POLONOROESTE special program, and the regular budgets
of the agencies involved. In addition, the Government would finance agricul-
tural development credit (about US$43 million) and essential complementary
items, such as teacher and health attendant salaries and road maintenance, not
included in project costs financed by the Bank. Assurances were received
from the federal and state Governments that adequate counterpart funding would
be available for the effective and timely execution of the project, and that
project facilities and services would be adequately operated and maintained.
Assurances were also received from the federal and state Governments that they
would arrange for the timely acquisition and necessary financing of additional
land or rights-of-way required for project works.

5.03      To ensure timely and effective implementation, and especially aue
to the need to maintain appropriate complementarity of the proposed activities
with the other aspects of the Northwest Regional Development Program, aireaay
begun, various startup activities such as employment and training of statt,
surveys related to agroecological zoning and education, and various engineerin6
designs, have already been initiated or would be initiated in the second nalit
of 1981. Retroactive financing of up to US*2.0 million is proposed to lielp
cover eligible expenditures made after July 1, 1981, but before loan signature.
Procurement
5.04      Civil works for municipal road improvement, which would be relatively
simple and often in somewhat remote areas, would be executed in two modes:
(i) by contract (some US$4.6 million without contingencies) following competi-
tive procurement procedures in Mirassol d'Oeste, and the newly created munici-
palities of Rio Branco, Salto do Ceu, Araputanga, Quatro Marcos and Jauru,
where force account construction and administrative capabilities are relatively
weak; and (ii) by force account (some US$2.1 million) in the well established
municipalities of Caceres, Tangara da Serra and Barra do Bugres, where proven
force account implementation capacity exists. Although foreign firms would
not be excluded from bidding on the portion to be contracted, none are likely
to be interested.  Construction lots would be sized between 50 and 90 km, witn
estimated costs from about US$300,000 to US$500,000, to allow participation
from small and medium local contractors. Brazil has a competitive local
construction industry which is capable of carrying out project works. The
road construction and maintenance equipment including spare parts (totalling
about US$3.0 million) would be procured on the basis of competitive biading,
nationally advertised. Again, foreign firms would not be excluaea but are
unlikely to be interested. For civil works and equipment for municipal roads,
the Bank would review and approve ex-ante standard procurement documents and
specifications, and for equipment, also the bid evaluations and award recommen-
dations. Awards for civil works would be reviewed on an ex-post basis. Ilost
civil works for drying and storage, education, health and other project
construction (about US$18.9 million) would be in relatively small lots and
quite dispersed and would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally. A small proportion of these works would be carried out Dy
force account or community action government agencies. The miscellaneous
equipment, materials and vehicles required by the project (totalling some
US$3.0 million) are almost all locally produced and readily available. Such
items, which would be purchased by the several executing agencies in various
locations over the 5-year execution period, would be procured in accordance
with Government procurement procedures which are acceptable. Consultancy
services (totalling some 6 manyears equivalent) to provide technical assistance
in road design, adaptive research, agroecological zoning, the education
component, and project monitoring and administration would be procured in
accordance with terms of reference and conditions satisfactory to the bank.
The cost of such consulting services, which are expected to be procured
locally, would range from US$1,200/month to US$4,000/month, depending on the
specialty.
Disbursements
5.05      The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed on the basis of
a uniform rate of 34%.  Disbursements for the adaptive research component



- 32 -
would be for all component costs other than the limited but necessary purchases
of land for research stations. Disbursements for civil works by force account
and operational expenses would be made under Statements of Expenditures initiated
by the various implementing agencies and certified by the PMU. Supporting
documentation would not be submitted to the Bank, but would be retained by the
agency responsible for their certification and would be made available for
inspection by the Bank during project supervision missions. Standard documenta-
tion covering civil works, vehicles, equipment and technical assistance would
be submitted to the Bank. Disbursements are expected to occur over a period
of about five years. As noted in Annex 5, the disbursement schedule reflects
the disbursement profile for previous agricultural projects in Brazil, adjusted
slightly to take into account improvements likely to result from the establish-
ment of the Special Account (para 5.06 below). The closing date of the Loan
would be December 31, 1986.
5.06      In order to reduce the interval during which the Government would
finance the Bank's share of project financing with its own resources, a
Special Account would be opened in the Central Bank with an initial deposit
of up to US$2.0 million. The Government may request the Bank to make advance
payments in dollars from the loan account into this Special Account. With-
drawals in cruzeiros from the Special Account would be made on the basis of
the statements of expenditures forwarded to the Central Bank. Conversion from
dollars into cruzeiros would be made at the exchange rate that prevailed on
the date the expenditures were made. The Central Bank would send the state-
ments to the Bank, which would then replenish t:he Special Account.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATIONT
POLONOROESTE Program Organization and Management
6.01      The proposed project would be a part of the Northwest Region
Development Program (POLONOROESTE) and would fit into the organizational
framework established under Decree No. 86,029 cf May 27, 1981 which created
the program. 1/ Responsibility for the administration of the overall pro-
gram has been entrusted to SUDECO, in accordance with Decree No. 83,436 of
May 10, 1979 which gives the responsibility for planning and supervising
execution of special development programs to the appropriate regional super-
intendencies attached to the Ministry of the Interior. Guidelines for the
execution of Special Programs are further detailed in Inter-Ministerial
Orders (Portarias) 90 and 91 of May 27, 1980, which describe (i) the ways
in which the Ministry of the Interior (charged with supervisory execution
of the programs), SEPLAN-PR, the Ministry of Agriculture, and other minis-
teries and State Governments involved should collaborate, and (ii) the
various programming, budgeting and fund disbursement procedures.
6.02      Successful and timely execution of the various facets of the
overall POLONOROESTE program has an important bearing on the degree of
success of the proposed Mato Grosso project. These other facets are to be
partly financed under the first phase of the program which would include,
among other things, improvement of the BR-364 highway and the first phase
1/   For further details, see Section VI of S.A.R. No. 3512b-BR dated
October 30, 1981.

agricultural development and environmental protection project. Land tenure
regularization in Mato Grosso, improving the protection of Amerindian
communities, and the strengthening of the various institutions involved
in environmental protection are especially important to the proposed Mato
Grosso project. Failure to comply with any covenants in agreements between
the Government and the Bank on the Northwest I Agricultural Development
and Environmental Protection, Highways or Health loans would represent non-
compliance with the agreements for this proposed loan, pursuant to the bank's
General Conditions.
Project Management and Organization
6.03      Although most project components would be executed by existing
agencies (e.g., the extension service, CODEMAT, the Secretariats of Health
and Education) overall coordination and management of the project at the
State level would be the responsibility of a specially created Project
Management Unit (PMU) in the state's Cabinet of Planning and Coordination
(GPC). Other federally funded special programs are also managed tarough
the GPC. State policy level decisions relating to this project would be
made by the Economic and Social Development Council kCDES) headed by tthe
Governor and including all the State Secretaries, which already provides
development policy for state activities.  In designing the management
structure for the project, an effort was made to use the existing planninr
and control mechanisms as much as possible. The only new unit created
would be the PMU, charged with day to day project management, acthieving
close coordination and integration among the activities to be executed under
the project, and providing clear focus on the project region as a planning
unit. In undertaking the annual programming and reprogramming exercise, ana
in liberating program funds received by the State to executing agencies, tne
PMU would have the support of the existing Planning and budgeting Coordination
Unit also within the GPC, where project accounts would be consolidated and
maintained.
6.04      The head of the PMU would respond directly to the Secretary of
Planning, head of the GPC, and would have a core team of professional staff to
cover the main planning and supervision functions: (i) identification and/or
taking steps to resolve problems in project implementation ana deviation trom
originally agreed project objectives;-(ii) consolidation of annual operating
plans; (iii) monitoring of physical and financial progress in project execution;
(iv) ongoing preliminary evaluation of project impact; and (v) preparation of
trimestral and other monitoring reports. Within the PMU, the various members
of the eight-person headquarters team of technicians would be responsible for
problem solving and coordination relating to project activities in (a) infra-
structure (municipal roads, and all the construction executed under otner
components); (b) agricultural production services (extension, research and
agroecological zoning); (c) agriculture support services (credit, input
supply, marketing, seed and planting material supply, crop drying and storage);
(d) education; (e) health, sanitation and rural water supply; (f) community
organizations and centers; and (g) backstopping for the project manager,
preparation of monitoring reports, and coordination of this project with otner
relevant government activities in the area such as land tenure regularization,
protection of Amerindian communities and environmental protection. Headquarters



- 34 -
PMU staff would be expected to spend some fifty percent of their time in the
project area. In addition, there would be two PMU regional representatives,
one each in Caceres and Barra do Bugres. Their task would be to coordinate
execution and solve those problems within their authority, identify issues to
be taken up by higher management, and serve as a starting point for supervision
trips from headquarters staff. Assurances were received from the state
Government that it would establish the 2 field offices of the PMU no later
than December 31, 1982, maintain the overall PMIU with adequate qualified
staff and resources for the full implementation period of the project, and
fully support other state agencies participating in the project.
Annual Planning and Budgeting
6.05      Comprehensive updated annual planning would be essential to project
success. For each POLONOROESTE fiscal year (April 1 to March 31) an annual
operating plan would be prepared, adjusting initially agreed targets and
activities to actual circumstances and implementation possibilities. To
help assure adequate and timely budgetary support, the State would furnish
to the regional and federal authorities by May 1 each year, its preliminary
estimates of the budget required for this project. By June 15 each year,
the federal authorities would notify the State of the preliminary financial
allocations for the project. After this, each participating agency would
prepare a proposed detailed plan of activities and expenditures for the
following fiscal year, assisted by the PMU. By September 30 of each year, the
plans would be consolidated by the PMU, ensuring their internal consistency
and their integration into oiher special programs and development plans under
execution in the State, which are all also under the coordination of the GPC.
Annual plans would be. forwarded to the state CDES and SUDECO for confirmation
and approval. These plans serve as the basis for the yearly budget allocation.
Assurances were received from the federal Government that the proposed annual
operating plans would be submitted to the Bank no later than October 31 of
each year for review and comment, and that the Bank would be advised of the
approved plan by the beginning of the applicable POLONOROESTE fiscal year.
Monitoring
6.06      A project monitoring system would be astablished and managed by the
PMU, and would provide the collection and analysis of information to compare
project achievements with targets, alert management to problems as they may
emerge, and provide a basis for the annual planling exercise. Initial indicators
and time-phased targets established prior to project execution, by component,
would provide a benchmark for comparisons to ta:zgets adjusted during every
annual planning exercise and to actual results. Execution information would
be provided to the PMU by the executing agencies on a quarterly basis, to be
consolidated and submitted to SUDECO, which would select the most important
items to enter into the POLONOROESTE program monitoring system. At the state
level, the project information system would build on existing reporting
requirements, but adding indicators particularly to give a better idea of
the quality of services provided. SUDECO already maintains the computer-based
SAPE-GRAFF program progress monitoring system, used for all Special Programs
executed in the Northwest region. This project's monitoring system would feed



- 35 -
into that larger system. Timely reporting would be encouraged by requiring
the report on activities of the quarter prior to releasing funds for the
quarter beginning 3 months later.  The reports, consolidated by the PHU would
provide a comparison of numerical targets with actual performance (in terms of
key actions completed and costs), as well as PMU comments on special problems
and steps taken to overcome these problems. In addition, preliminary informa-
tion on the impact of project financed activities on the target population
would be provided through periodic evaluation of an additional series of
parameters by PMU staff on the basis of field supervision and interviews.  An
annual review of project impact on agricultural activities would be held at
the end of the production cycle. Project attainment of objectives in health,
education and community development would also be reviewed annually by PMU
staff and SUDECO. These periodic impact reports would be incorporated into
the regular quarterly project reports, as they are completed. SUDECO would
provide the Bank with detailed monitoring plans and procedures for the various
aspects of the POLONOROESTE program by March 31, 1982. Assurances were re-
ceived from (i) the state Government that the PMU and the executing agencies
would develop standardized data requirements and reporting formats, establish
coding and analysis procedures, including the operating policies and procedures
of the PMU, and provide the Bank, through SUDECO, with a satisfactory manual
outlining these requirements and procedures, as agreed upon with the various
participating agencies, by September 30, 1982; and (ii) the federal Government
that the quarterly monitoring reports would be provided to the Bank promptly
upon their completion, but not later than three months after the end of the
respective POLONOROESTE fiscal quarter.
Evaluation
6.07      Project evaluation activities would involve periodic in-depth attempts
to assess the effect project financed services and infrastructure deveLopment
are having on the natural environment and on the incomes and welfare of those
families the project is supposed to assist. Due to the interrelated nature of
the various projects in the overall Northwest Region Development Program, of
which this proposed Mato Grosso project is part, overall in-depth evaluation
of the impact of the various projects has been assigned by the Government to
the POLONOROESTE Program Monitoring and Evaluation Unit in SUDECO. 1/ Evalu-
ation work, which would be partly financed under the Bank Loan for the first
phase Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection project, would
focus on three main studies: (a) a summary and critique of the current,
baseline situation; (b) a mid-term review of Program execution as of March 31,
1984 (to be completed by June 31, 1984), and (c) a completion report,
giving an interim assessment of project impact, due to be provided to the Bank
within 6 months of the final completion date of the project. SUDECO would
also be responsible for ad hoc special studies, to be commissioned during
program execution, which would investigate particular issues which arise
during implementation. It is expected that some aspects of the evaluation
activities could be contracted to local agencies with adequate research
1/   The monitoring and evaluation of the other aspects of the program
are described in Staff Appraisal Report 3512b-BR of October 30, 1981,

capacity, such as the Federal University of Mato Grosso. Assurances covering
the timely execution of the evaluation aspects of this project are as included
in agreements relating to the first phase of Bank support to the POLONOROESTE.
program.
Operating Agreements
6.08      The GPC would enter into written component execution agreements
(convenios) with all the executing agencies involved (see the list in Annex 2).
Assurances were received from the state and federal Government that receipt
by the Bank of the respective satisfactory signed agreements would be a
condition of disbursement for each component. These agreements would provide
guidelines and key targets :Eor the execution cf the component involved, under-
standings and procedures regarding disbursemerLt of funds, reporting require-
ments and needs for collaboration with other e!ntities. This type of project
specific agreement should help to assure adequate coordination of activities
in this project under the aegis of the State Government of Mato Grosso.
Program level coordination of activities of independent federal agencies such
as INCRA and IBDF, whose PO].ONOROESTE activities are closely interdependent
with this project's activities, would be the responsibility of SUDECO, through
its POLONOROESTE program unit. Assurances on the establishment and maintenance
of that POLONOROESTE unit in SUDECO are covered in agreements relating to the
first phase of Bank support to the POLONOROESTE program.
Accounts and Auditing
6.09      Assurances were received from the federal Government that each of
the participating agencies would maintain separate accounts of its project
expenditures, which would be audited annually by the Central Secretariat of
Internal Control (SECIN) of the federal Secretariat of Planning according to
standard Government practice, which is satisfactory. Copies of the audit
report on the various participating agencies would be provided to the Bank
through SUDECO within six months of the end of the fiscal year of the
POLONOROESTE program. This audit report would also convey the auditor's
opinion (and comments as necessary) on the methodology employed in the compila-
tion of the Statements of Expenditures, their accuracy, the relevance of
supporting documents, eligibility for financing in terms of the project's
legal agreements and the standard of record keaping and internal controls
related to the foregoing. I'he Special Account (para 5.06) would be audited by
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank.
VII.  PRODUCTION, DEMAND, MARK,TING AND PRICES
Production
7.01      The impact of the project on agriculi:ural production in the project
area is expected to be derived from: (a) an increase in the productivity of
annual and perennial crops and livestock and a reduction in the decline in
fertility in newly cultivated soils; (b) a moderate expansion in areas of
annuals and tree crops; and (c) a reduction in post harvest losses. Such
objectives would be achieved through, inter al:La, (i) adoption of improved



- 37 -
fertilizer practices; (ii) improved disease and pest control; (iii) introduc-
tion of improved crop rotation systems; (iv) the inclusion of a greater
proportion of nitrogen fixing legumes on the cropping pattern; (v) utilization
of improved genetic material and certified seeds; (vi) improved husbandry
practices in existing stands of coffee; (vii) more rational use of labor;
and (viii) improved soil conservation techniques. Although most of the
production increases are assumed to come from the 10,000 farmers who would
adopt proposed practices and receive more intensive extension assistance, the
adoption of only a portion of the package by the remaining 7,500 farmers who
only receive limited extension "orientation" and training would also have an
impact on production. Average yields assumed at full development are 20 to
40% below what the most progressive farmers would obtain and represent best
estimates of general production levels attainable given constraints of soils,
inputs, the availability of support services, and the typical farmer's
managerial capacity.
7.02      A summary of expected production patterns in seven illustrative
farm types is given in para 8.01. A more detailed description of agricultural
planning assumptions and expected results is given in Annex 8. At estimated
June 1981 farmgate prices, incremental annual production at full development
is expected to amount to US$34 million (see Table 7). Of this, some 7% is due
to rice, 47% to coffee, 8% to other perennial crops (such as rubber and
bananas), 25% to other annuals (such as beans, corn, soybeans, and manioc),
and 13% to incremental production of meat and milk. The range of perennial
and annual crops is expected to broaden with the establishment of appropriate
processing industries (sugarcane or manioc for alcohol), the expansion of the
marketing apparatus for tropical fruits (such as avocado, coconut, oranges,
and mangoes), and as the results of the adaptive agricultural research program
become available.
Demand, Markets and Prices
7.03      Brazil produces around 29% of the world's coffee, and contributes some
26% to the world export market. High prices in 1979 have been followed by lower
price levels which are expected to persist in the medium term, in light of world
economic conditions. The severe frost of July 1981 in southern Brazil killed
or severely damaged an estimated 310 million coffee trees. The area under
coffee is projected to expand some 15,500 ha due to the project, and support
would be provided to improve productivity of existing stands (some 12,000 ha)
through improved husbandry and cutback pruning. Incremental project production
at full development (about 1995) is estimated at 14,400 tons of green coffee
beans. This represents less than 1.5% of the average Brazilian production
during the last five years or less than 0.5% of recent world production. The
International Coffee Organization (ICO) foresees a possible world oversupply
of coffee by the end of the decade as a possibility. ICO reintroduced quotas
on exports of coffee in October 1980 and has cautioned against investment in
projects designed to increase production significantly, unless such increased
production is due to a diversified pattern of agriculture as part of an
integrated rural development program.

Production from such programs should be offset by reduced production from
marginal areas taken out of coffee. The proposed project meets these criteria
as the production of coffee in the project area is part of rural development
efforts oriented towards relatively low-income farmers, and in the medium term,
project production is more than compensated for by the permanent reduction in
the coffee tree population in the "frost-prone" states due to the limited level
of recovery expected after the recent severe frosts. In the Northwest,
ecological considerations make tree crops particularly suitable to protect
soil resources, while other crop alternatives are limited. In addition, coffee
is an excellent pioneer crop, providing substantial and sustained cash earnings
to low income settler families after only a short maturation period. Brazil is
a major member of the ICO and has demonstrated its interest in an orderly world
coffee market and its support for the International Coffee Agreement. The
Government's policy in the medium term is to aim for production levels of 28-30
million 60 kg bags of green beans per annum, which would permit full utilization
of Brazil's export quota under ICO (currently 15.5 million bags), exports to non-
traditional markets (currently about 2.2 million bags) and domestic consumption
(currently about 7.0 million bags). These various markets are expected to
grow, but quite slowly, in the next decade. Coffee not utilized under these
options would go towards rebuilding Brazil's stocks, expected to be severely
depleted in the near future to compensate for reduced production due to the
frosts of July 1981. In view of these considerations, the Brazilian policy
target of an average production level of 28-30 million bags would not present
serious market risks for the remainder of the 1980's. The Government's policy
and its confirmed intention to use available policy instruments, such as working
capital and investment credit mechanisms and price guarantees, to assure that
production is within a level compatible with its international obligations and
with a stable world market and to help assure that coffee production in new
non-traditional regions would be offset by reduction elsewhere, further reduce
the risk of excess production.
7.04      World demand for elastomers is increasing at a rate that cannot be
met by existing areas planted with rubber, nor by increased output from
existing synthetic rubber factories, which are furthermore affected by
increasing oil prices. Three major producers -- Malaysia, Indonesia and
Thailand -- dominate the world natural rubber market, producing among them
80% of the total. Of the three, only Thailand's exports show a rapidly
rising trend. About two-thirds of Brazil's 65,000 t natural rubber and
one-fifth of its 180,000 t synthetic rubber annual consumption requirements
are imported. Yet Brazil is considered to have a long term potential to
become a net rubber exporter. Plans embodied in Brazil's rubber development
program (PROBOR) aim at increasing the area planted to rubber in Brazil by
120,000 ha within the next five years. While current price incentives to
local farmers will probably decrease as imports are reduced, and the present
difference (of the order of two to one) between Brazilian and world natural
rubber prices narrows, international prices are expected to increase by
about 10% over the next ten years, which would permit the maintenance of
an attractive price to the domestic producer. It is expected that disease
control would not present undue problems (see para 1.09) and profitability to
the farmer is expected to remain at acceptable levels. Under this project,
some 500 ha of rubber would be planted, in 2 ha lots, directed towards the



- 40 -
smallest farmers in the reg:Lon, well within state and national planning
targets. It is not expected that there would be any problems in the absorption
of incremental production.
7.05      The growth in demand for fruit, vegetables and other foodstuffs
from Mato Grosso's rural and urban population, as well as from urban centers
in neighboring states, is expected to be larger than the projected increases
in production. Bananas, besides supplying the needs of the local population,
are sent to the Sao Paulo market. Area rice production is consumed mainly on
the farm and within the state, with surpluses sent to the large national urban
centers. Corn is consumed mostly by local livestock and poultry. Milk
production would be absorbecl by the towns in the project area, and Cuiaba.
Beans and manioc (as flour) would be consumed on farm or in the neighboring
urban centers and villages. World prices for food crops are expected to at
least remain stable, if not increase in certain cases such as rice, beans
and corn. This is especially true for Brazil, where competition for suitable
soils between foodcrops, commercial export crops and cultivation of sugarcane,
manioc and other products for fuel production is expected to move prices in an
upward trend. The main prices used in the financial and economic analyses of
the project are given in Annex 8, Table 6.
Marketing Channels
7.06      Private intermediaries such as local processing facility owners
(beneficiadores), merchants (cerealistas), and truckers for large marketing
firms (caminhoneiros) are the main marketing c'nannels in the project area,
collecting about 70% of total production. Local processors and merchants
in turn sell to larger firms in Parana, Sao Paulo and other regions. Some
merchants advance funds or goods, in return for a guarantee that they can
purchase a farmer's produce at a price discounted to compensate for interest
and inflation. Milk is marketed through a rec,sntly established cooperative
in Araputanga, with cooling capacity for 30,001) 1. Another cooling and
processing plant has been established in Barra do Bugres. The Government
is also a large purchaser of grains through the Minimum Price Scheme,
when market prices go below the minimum establLshed by Government (see
para 4.31). Access to drying facilities has been identified as a key marketing
constraint. Due to high transportation costs, lack of medium term financing
and inadequate storage and drying facilities, on or near the farm, monopso-
nistic power is great, and farmers obliged to ,ell to intermediaries at the
farmgate receive a much lower price than they potentially could.
7.07      A number of actions considered under or in parallel to the project
should help reduce losses and substantially improve and then stabilize farmgate
prices: (a) access roads would be upgraded and maintained to all-weather
standards; (b) warehouses and grain drying fac:ilities would be built at
strategic locations within the project area; (c) the Government Minimum Price
Purchase and Loan Schemes would be expanded to service a larger number of
small farmers; (d) credit access would be broadened, increasing the small
farmer's range of marketing options and improv:ing his bargaining position;
(e) farmers would be encouraged to build simple on-farm stores; and (f) the
agricultural extension service would provide price and other market information
to farmers.

VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Illustrative Farm Types
8.01     The farm level impact of changing cultivation techniques, proposed
and to be enabled under the project, was analyzed using seven farm types.
These were based on information gathered from field surveys by CEPA-MT and
EMATER-MT and secondary data from INCRA and the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics (FIBGE), and they reflect six typical owner-operators and one
coffee sharecropper situation. Farmers are assumed to be at a fairly well
established (although low income) level of activity. Assumptions for on-farm
development inputs and phasing are described in detail in Annex 8. Land use
characteristics of the various illustrative types are summarized follows:

8.02     Estimated financial rates of return range from 17% (in the rubber
development farm type) to over 50%. The sensitivity of the financial rates
of return to a 20% reduction in yields (or prices) of the main crops (coffee,
beans, cattle, milk and rubber) was tested. The effect of an increase of 20%
in fertilizer usage was also tested. None of the rates of return dropped
below 12.0 under the various assumptions. The results of the tests are shown
in para 23 of Annex 8.
8.03     The representative farm budgets reflect on-farm investments
(including land clearing and preparation, establishment of pasture and/or
permanent tree crops, purchase of livestock, minor tools and equipment)
and expected cash operating and maintenance costs, including fertilizers,
soil conservation and disease control, and excluding non-cash expenses such
as family labor. Prices for inputs and production were assumed to be at
the average level prevailing over the last three years, in real terms,
adjusted however to take into account project induced year-round access,
improved marketing conditions and reduced transportation costs.

Producer Income
8.04      The estimated present income of the targeted beneficiary families
is equivalent to a weighted average of about US$2,735 in 1981. However, some
75% of the farm families fall below the rural poverty level for Brazil, which
is about US$330 per capita, or US$1,980 for a family of 6 (the average in the
project area).

At full development (year 2000), the weighted average annual farm family income
would more than double to about US$6,750.  Return to on-farm family labor would
also double, going from current levels of US$8/day (above the daily wage for
unskilled labor of US$4.50/day) to around US$17/day at full development. 'With-
out the project, incomes would be expected to gradually decline, as natural
fertility decreases. Although there are areas of good soils still unexploited,
much of the land is already owned, and production alternatives providing
adequate income for the small farmer on medium and poor soils, without access
to fertilizers, credit and markets, are few.  In the absence of the technical
assistance and productive support provided under the project, some area farmers
would undoubtedly migrate again, to Rondonia or- other frontier areas. Among
the objectives of the project are to help consolidate the establishment of
small farmers in the region, maintaining reasonable levels of productivity
in the cultivation systems, and helping reduce the migratory pressure on
other areas of the country.
Fiscal Impact
8.05      Substantial fiscal benefits would be obtained from the taxation
of incremental project production marketed ins:ide or outside the state. At
an average rate of 13.5% on the adjusted value of marketed produce, the
marketing tax (ICM) would, at full development, produce annual revenues to
the state of Mato Grosso in the order of US$3.21 million. This compares to
the some $3.18 million per year in recurrent costs required to maintain the
infrastructure and services established under t:he project. The Federal
Government would, even at the recently reduced export tax level of US$50 per
60 kg bag of coffee beans, generate revenue in excess of US$12.0 million from
incremental coffee production alone, at full development. Incremental rural
Social Security revenues (FUNRURAL) levied at 2.5% on the value of production,
would amount to some US$0.6 million per year by full development.



- 43 -
8.06      It is not the Government's policy to directly and fully recover
the investment costs of special development projects directed principally
to lower income segments of the population. However, the above mentioned
annual tax revenues directly related to production increases would represent a
very substantial contribution to Government revenues. In addition, Brazil's
various road user charges and taxes can be expected to help recover road
investment and maintenance costs; also storage and water supply tariffs would
recover at least the operating and maintenance costs of these services. As to
the rural credit (amounting to some US$43 million) extended in parallel to
but not financed by the project, the currently highly subsidized interest rate
structure would result in direct recovery of only a small portion in real terms.
IX. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
Economic Rate of Return
9.01      The economic rate of return for the directly productive aspects
of the proposed project (representing about 68% of total project costs)
has been estimated at about 24%. For various other aspects of the project,
such as the health, rural water supply and education components, which have
significant but not readily quantifiable benefits, no economic rate of return
was calculated. The details of the cost and benefit streams assumed in the
economic analysis are given in Annex 7. Other details of the economic analysis
are available in the Project File.
9.02      The cost stream used in the economic evaluation of productive
activities included (a) all on-farm incremental investment and operating costs
(based on the phased aggregation of the different farm types); (b) off-farm
investments and incremental operating costs directly related to agricultural
development during the project period; and (c) recurrent costs of services and
maintenance of infrastructure after the 5 years of project implementation,
necessary to sustain projected development. The cost stream thus includes
100% of project costs for agricultural extension, research, agroecological
zoning, storage and drying facilities, input supply facilities, municipal
roads, and project coordination, management and monitoring at the Mato Grosso
level.
9.03      It should be noted that most of the off-farm investments and services
would have significant benefits over and above the incremental production of
the 10,000 participants receiving direct and intensive assistance. Extension,
storage, drying, marketing, input supply and other services would be available
to practically all of the 20,800 farmers, including sharecroppers, who would
live within their area of influence. In particular, group extension techniques
should eventually reach many more than the direct farmer beneficiaries enumer-
ated above. Project access roads are expected to have a substantial beneficial
impact on all who live in the project area, increasing access to services,
facilitating the outflow of production and hence improving the likelihood of
adoption of more productive farming techniques. Improvements in health,
education and rural water supply services are also expected to benefit most of
the rural population mentioned above. Taking the full number of families to
benefit from the various project activities into consideration results in a
cost per family of US$3,700, including physical and price contingencies but
excluding the on-farm development credit provided in parallel to the project.



- 44 -
9.04      The benefit stream used in the econcmic rate of return analysis
includes all of the incremental production (and reduced losses) above the
"without project" development situation of the 10,000 farmers expected to
receive direct technical assistance and credit, phased according to the
incorporation of these participants into the project. The analysis does not
attempt to quantify benefits derived from potential yield improvements and
diminished post harvest losses of other area farmers benefiting from minimal
group assistance or project infrastructure alone.
9.05      The prices used in the economic analysis for those goods traded
on the international market were adjusted to take into account transport,
handling and insurance costs. Of the products produced under the project,
Brazil is a net exporter of coffee and rice, and a net importer of rubber and,
periodically rice, corn, meat and now, beans. Brazil is also a net importer
of fertilizer, for which a price, similarly adjusted, was calculated. Non-
traded goods such as manioc are valued at local farmgate prices. Most of
these prices would remain stable or increase over the next decade. Labor was
priced at 75% of the market wage, to reflect unemployment and underemployment
especially in rural areas of Brazil. Foreign exchange costs and benefits were
adjusted upward by 15% to reflect trade-distorting tariffs, subsidies, advance
import deposits, export taxes and quantitative restrictions.
9.06      To measure the impact of possible changes in the economic environ-
ment on the project's streami of costs and benefits, several sensitivity
tests were made. The results of the most significant are as follows:
Table 10: Sensitivity Test Results on Internal Economic Rate of Return (%)
Best Estimate:          24             Benefits down 50%:                      16
Costs up by 20%:        22            Benefits lag 3 years:                    18
Benefits down by 20%:  22              Costs up 20% and benefits down 20%:  19
9.07      The estimated return of the project is fairly insensitive to possible
likely variations in costs and benefits. An analysis of the impact of major
declines in the prices of the main perennial crops shows that declines of up
to 50% in the price of any one of the main crops would not bring the economic
rate of return of the project below 13%, due to the diversified nature of
project production (see Table 11). Products sach as corn, bananas, rubber,
cotton, beef and milk would have an impact on the economic rate of return
similar to that of rice. A three-fold increase in fertilizer expenditures
would bring the economic rate of return of the project down to 15%. The rate
of return is enhanced by the! project's contriblition to agricultural exports
and the reduction of agricultural imports, and by the relatively low foreign
exchange content of project costs.

Employment
9.08      Absorption of additional labor in the project area has recently
slowed, as the easy opportunities for development on the best soils, with
easy access to highways, have been largely taken advantage of. The proposed
project would permit those families already productively installed in the
region to continue to improve their living standards on existing holdings,
without having to leave and look for other areas easy to exploit. The develop-
ment of perennial crops in the project area, and the intensification of
cultivation projected in the project would also absorb and retain manpower in
the region, creating requirements for an additional 6,500 full employment
laborer years, of which 460 laborer years would be provided by hired labor.
The economic activity generated by the incremental agricultural production
would furthermore create numerous jobs in the intermediation, milling and
processing industries. Some of the additional agricultural employment would
be on a sharecropping basis (as demonstrated in the farm type analysis under-
taken for the project).
9.09      The project aims to improve farm family income and considers
the whole family as a productive unit. Additional work opportunities are
provided on the farm for women and children; without their decisive participa-
tion it is unlikely that these relatively recent pioneer families could have
made it through the precarious first few years after arrival, when the family
had to rely on its own resources to meet its subsistence requirements and make
sufficient cash for necessary purchases (kerosene, clothing, salt, sugar).
The extension service and the farmer organization programs focus on the needs
of the whole family, with the social agent dealing with the non-agricultural
aspects of frontier life. Women participated at all levels of project prepara-
tion, and would be actively included in the implementation team, ensuring
continued attention to the role of women.
Project Risks
9.10      The region in question, located in an environmentally delicate agri-
cultural frontier, has been settled and cultivated for 10 to 20 years. However,
additional farmer immigrants continue to arrive. The challenge in this project,
as with other agricultural facets of the POLONOROESTE program, is to establish
and maintain a fairly intensive productive base, to stabilize the existing small
farmer migrant population within the region, and to help prevent ecological
damage, loss of productive potential and modification of the climate. The
project requires a series of parallel and coordinated investigative, service
and infrastructural activities. Failure to fulfill targets in one sector, due
to institutional, financial, climatic or other reasons, makes achievement of
objectives in other sectors more uncertain. This is the principal general
risk. Therefore, the project monitoring, feedback and decision processes have
to operate smoothly to obtain the desired objectives. Various administrative,
technological, ecological and social risks are described in more detail below.
In general, however, while these risks associated with the project cannot be
totally avoided, it is believed that the measures incorporated in the first and
the second phase of the Northwest Region Development Program would result in a
much lower level of risk than would occur without Bank participation. The
potential of the region to contribute significantly to the development of Brazil
outweighs these risks.
9.11      Institutional risks due to the failure of any of the executing agencies
involved to accomplish their tasks within the project have been taken into
consideration in designing each component, and it is believed that adequate



- 46 -
institutional strengthening aspects have been built in. The project is of high
priority at the Federal and State levels of Government, which have made a sub-
stantial investment in preparation and have shown strong committment to its
execution.
9.12      The technical production risks relating to the incomplete knowledge
of cultivation and soil conservation techniques in this frontier region, where
information on soils and climate is still weak, is addressed in the agro-
ecological zoning, extension and adaptive research components of this project.
It is also being addressed in the Program for the Humid Tropics of EMBRAPA,
the Brazilian Agricultural Research Company (partly financed under Loans
1249-BR and 2016-BR). The Local research institution would be strengthened
to permit quicker adaptation of the results of EMBRAPA's basic research to
conditions in the project area, and to disseminate information amongst the
extension agents. Topics for research would arise out of the extension
service's experience in day to day contact with farmers, and from the studies
to be undertaken in the agroecological zoning component.
9.13      The main ecological risk could result from deforestation on poor
soils. The project development strategy (as illustrated in the farm types)
includes a minimum of additional cutting down of forest, and relies more on
making productive long term use of areas already cleared. Under the agro-
ecological zoning exercise, areas under poor sDils would be identified and
additional clearing discouraged, or reforestation with productive wood
species encouraged. All of the project lies within the state's "Distrito
Florestal", an area that has absolute priority for reforestation schemes
financed under fiscal incentives. Enforcement of legislation restricting
deforestation in the Amazon would be strengthened under the first phase
POLONOROESTE projects.
9.14      The risk that settlement or expansion induced by this project could
result in encroachment on Amnerindian reserve areas has been foreseen under
the first phase of the program, under which tha Government has committed
itself to a series of measures to improve health care and protection of
Amerindian reserves, and to strengthen FUNAI, the federal agency charged
with supporting Amerindian interests. The likelihood of settler-Amerindian
conflict is fairly remote ir. the proposed Mato Grosso project, as most of
the reserves are on the Parecis escarpment, in Tangara da Serra, far re-
moved from the foci of agricultural development.

BRAZIL
NORTHWEST REGION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE II
MATO GROSSO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Development, Technical Coefficients and
Illustrative Farm Types
A.   General Environmental Conditions.
1.        The project area climate is hot and humid.  Temperatures average 25 C,
and rainfall is between 1,150 and 2,000 mm/anrum, with a relatively marked
dry season of 4-5 months between May and October, and very dependable often
excessive rainfall from December to February, which accounts for the high
average yields of upland ri,ze and dependable corn yields. Variation in the
timing of the beginning and end of the rainy period could result in moisture
limitations for annual crops. The dry weather in the region favors coffee
flowering, and helps to control proliferation of fungus diseases in coffee
and rubber.
2.        Four distinct land formations, with associated vegetation types, occur
in the project area: a) Plateau dos Parecis and foothills between about
400-600 m elevation in the north and northwest quarter of the project area.
Topography is gently rolling on the two-level plateau but occasionally steep
or hilly where the plateau ascends to its upper level or in the broken remnants
of the plateau, forming foothills between Jauru and Salto do Ceu. Vegetation
ranges from cerrado on the upper plateau to deciduous forest on the lower
level; b) Central Sub-Elevation, from west of Mirassol ranging to the foothills
or escarpment of the Plateau dos Parecis to the north, an area of gently
rolling to undulating topography reaches southward to the Bolivian border at
elevations of 190-300 m approximately. Vegetation above the Jauru river is
mostly deciduous forest but southward areas of cerrado (savannah) and pantanal
(swamp) vegetation predominate; c) The Pantanal Depression, encompassing the
lowlands which drain to the Paraguay river and which, from the true pantanal
region south of Caceres, form a trough between Mirassol and the Serra das
Araras, reaching west of Caceres almost to the latitude of Mirassol. The
vegetation of these areas is mixed swamp forest and seasonally uncovered
grasslands with grass savannah at the slightly higher more northern elevations
which never exceed about 150 m; and d) Serra das Araras, a series of broken
flat-topped ridges running NE-SW from a point just east of Caceres to
south of Porto Estrela. Its highest points frequently top 600 m, with
sharp troughs between the ridges. Vegetation is mainly cerrado. This
region has recently been declared a Biological Reserve by SEMA. Summary
information on the demographic and agro-ecological characteristics of the
region is presented in Table 1.
3.        The soils in the area are quite variable.  To the north and west of
Mirassol, in the middle of the project area, :is a concentration of eutrophic
podsols, capable of sustained cropping with onLy low to moderate fertilization
and light liming for maximum yields. These conlstitute the major part of the
Class 1 and 2 soils, covering some 30% of the project area, with the highest
suitability for agriculture. Typically, the Class 1 soils under cultivation
have a pH around 6 with variable P (phosphorus) levels generally in the



- 59 -
ANNEX 8
Page 2
low/moderate range, high K (potassium) levels, original organic matter content
of around 4 percent, minimal, nontoxic levels of exchangeable aluminum and
a moderate to high base status. The Class 2 soils have a much lower nutrient
status, and higher aluminum levels, although rarely toxic. Textures range
from clayey to sandy-loam and associated topography is mainly rolling or
undulating, with large expenses with minimal slopes located on the crowns
between valleys.
4.        Except for the lowlands of the Paraguay basin and the Pantanal,
the remainder of the region includes dystrophic and allic (low fertility)
red-yellow and dark red latosols, frequently found in the Amazon Basin, and
dystrophic and allic quartz sands. These soils are distinctly more acid with
pH ranging between 4 and 5, only traces of P, low to moderate K levels,
generally lower organic matter, low base status, and exchangeable aluminum
often reaching toxic levels. Textures range from clayey to fine sands, with
loams and sandy loams predominating in the latosols. These soils are mainly
Classes 3-5, suitable only for pastures, but some of the red and dark red
latosols with higher clay contents reach Class 2, which is the highest
agricultural aptitude class of these older soils. The quartz sands have
such low intrinsic fertility and water holding capacity that their limited
agricultural capacity and their susceptibility to erosion does not warrant
their clearing under any circumstances.
5.        Soils of the lowlands and the Pantanal proper are hydromorphic
lateritic soils and allic podsolic soils (both of low fertility) grouped
mainly in the class 5 category. These areas are used for extensive seasonal
pastureland or natural vegetation. Seasonal flooding of the Pantanal region
has effectively inhibited cropping up to the present.
B. Farming Systems
6.        Agriculture in the project area is divided between small coffee
farms and large cattle ranches (often established with fiscal incentives
under SUDAM). These activities have constituted the main incentives to opening
up new land. Soil fertility was recognized from early on, and land prices
on such soils rose to a point which induced subdivision of large holdings.
Private and public small farmer colonization schemes were also mainly located
in areas of good quality soils. As a result, some 90% of the farmers occupy
10% of the land, concentrated mainly in the areas of good (Class 1) soils.
Considerable potential still exists for the expansion of annual and perennial
crops (cropped area is only 12% of the Class 1 soils in the region). Settler
farmers who have come to the region can be categorized in three groups: (a)
pioneers with little or no capital, who occupy cheap land with limited access,
partially clear the land and plant subsistence crops, progressively mining
soil fertility while waiting for land prices to rise, when they sell out and
move on to a new frontier; b) colonizers, usually experienced farmers coming
from Parana, Sao Paulo or Minas Gerais, generally with some savings, who
buy fairly good land in an area with reasonable access, with the objective of
establishing themselves on a permanent basis; and (c) sharecroppers, who
clear land on large estates, plant subsistence crops for a few years, then
plant pasture and move on to clear a new area. In a variation of this,
sharecroppers clear land and plant coffee, with all the returns from.the

coffee and intercrops remaining with the sharecropper for the first three or
four years. Once the coffee :is mature, a 50/50 maintenance arrangement may be
established with the landowner. As consolidation occurs, and the agricultural
frontier moves North and West, the more permanent colonizers have come to
predominate over the other types of farmers in the project area.
7.        Land clearing is usually the first task undertaken by the new
settler, where the slash and burn method predominates. Prime timber has
usually been extracted earlier. Demand for second 'white' timber is poor, and
most of it is burnt off. The factors which then interact to determine the
type of farming system adopted include: (i) the quality of the land; (ii)
the availability of capital; (iii) farmer managerial capacity and cropping
tradition; (iv) access to markets; and (v) the size of the land-holding.
Land quality is the prime determinant factor in the choice of cropping patterns,
with the best soils going to coffee. A farmer with the desire to establish a
cattle farm will choose a larger area of cheaper land with soils not considered
suitable for coffee. The very small farmer with little capital and family
labor is almost wholly restricted to manual operations, the use of chainsaws
and threshing machines being t:he first choice for mechanization. Even the
very small farmer, however, can benefit from partly mechanized land preparation,
which allows him to plant a larger area, and renting machinery for this
purpose is the first step; this system is classified as semi--mechanized
because harvests are all manual. Animal traction is often used for inter-row
cultivation. When areas over 10 ha are planted, they are usually fully
mechanized, except for harvest: of beans and corn. Agricultural machinery
is fairly readily available on a rental basis in the project area.
C. Production Practices
8.        A summary of input and yield coefficients, by crop, in the pre-
project and full development situation, is provided in Table 2 of this Annex.
It should be noted that yields of annual crops decline over the 15 year
development period in the "without project" situation, and stabilize or
increase in the "with project" scenario.  An analysis of the gross margins
per ha of crops produced using the inputs and techniques recommended under
the project has shown that the return per manday of manual family labor is
always above the going wage in the region of US$4.50 per day., Characteristics
of particular crops are discussed below.
9.        Coffee:  In 1979, it was estimated that nearly 26,000 ha had been
planted in the project area, over half of this in Tangara da Serra, which
meets the TBC altitude criteria (400 m) and is thus eligible for special
subsidized credit. Coffee tech,nology has been imported directly from Central
South Brazil. Most of the current plantings are C. arabica (Mundo Novo
variety).  Normal planting density is 1,000 planting points per ha, with two
plants per point.  Coffee in this region begins yielding at a low level in its
second year, building up to mature yields by the fifth year. Coffee is a crop
with a high response to good husbandry. Small family farms, or larger areas
divided up between sharecroppers, assure the cof:Eee stands receive the individ-
ual attention necessary for higher yields. Coffee rust is present, but
although the disease can be expected to build up in time, periodic spraying
with copper-based products provide good control, and the relatively long dry

ANNEX 8
Page 4
period hinders the development of the fungus, providing some degree of natural
control. The buildup of coffee leaf miner, also present, can be controlled
with adequate spraying. The 'four year old disease' (mal de quatro anos),
caused by a root rot with no known cure, although not widespread, is respon-
sible for thinning out coffee stands after the fourth year.
10.       Rubber:  Experience with rubber cultivation in the area is confined
to two plantations with a total of around 30 ha of trees. Stands of about
400 trees/ha were yielding an equivalent of between 1,000 and 1,200 kg DRC/
year/ha. Although evidence did exist of the presence of South American Leaf
Blight (SALB) in certain clones of. rubber tree, none of the plantations had
been sprayed. Natural control through the low humidity of the fairly long dry
season, during which leaf change occurs, and adequate spraying is expected to
control the disease. Establishment of this crop is being promoted with
subsidized credit available under the PROBOR III natural rubber development
program, under which 6,000 ha would be planted in Mato Grosso. The minimum
area for financing has been reduced to 2 ha, which will permit the inclusion
of mini-producers in the program. EMATER-MT has two rubber nurseries, where
clonal planting material is produced. Rubber clones are distributed to small
schemes of under 50 ha, where clones are planted in separate plots. Farmers
of over 50 ha either establish their own nurseries, producing their own
planting material, or purchase it from private nurseries. The pueraria
legume, as a cover crop, is well adapted to the region. A major task in the
establishment of productive rubber plantations would be the training of labor
for tapping, and correct fertilization, pruning, insect and disease control.
The extension service would be responsible for providing training and orienta-
tion in these matters as they are under contract from SUDHEVEA, the Super-
intendency for the Development of Natural Rubber.
11.       Bananas:  A small area of intensive banana cultivation is common,
especially on farms not growing coffee. Some 1,400 ha were planted in the region
in 1979. The Maca and Prata varieties are the most common. Little or no control
of insects or disease is practiced, and average production levels which range from
2-15 tons/ha/year are low, declining rapidly with the age of the plantation, due
to Panama disease, banana-borer debilitation and declining fertility. Under the
project, varieties of the Cavendish group resistant to Panama disease would be
introduced, improved cultivation and marketing techniques promoted, and pre-
ventive measures taken to control Moko and Sogatoka disease. Bananas are a
good crop for soil conservation when planted densely, and fit well into
the labor budget because of their non-peak labor demand pattern. The regular
income, concentrated in the rainy season when cash flows are negative for
annual crops, supports and stabilizes farm family income.
12.       Pasture Improvements and Herd Management.  There were an estimated
0.6 million hectares in pasture in the project area in 1979.  The gradual
lowering of pasture stocking capacity with time is as much due to overstocking
as it is to fertility degradation. Lack of subdivision of pastures also means
selective grazing of favored parts of large paddocks. The general level of
pasture management is poor, in particular on the large cattle ranches where
pastures are generally very weed infested. Colonial Guinea (Panicum Maximum)
grass is the major pasture grass in the area, covering an estimated 70-80% of
all pastures, the remainder being divided between Brachiaria Decumbens and



- 62 -
ANNEX 8
Page 5
all pastures, the remainder being divided between Brachiaria Decumbens and
Brachiaria Humidicola (Hyparhenia Rufa), African Star Grass (Cynodon
Plectostachyus) and Jaragua.  Stocking rates for Colonial Guinea range between
1.0-1.4 au/ha and for Brachiaria Humidicola between 1.4-2.0 au/ha. No experi-
ence is available on introduction of legumes i: pastures in the project area.
In other parts of Mato Grosso the only legume which has done well is Pueraria.
This is so vigorous that it usually chokes out the grass, even when planted in
strips, although maintaining a stocking rate equal or better than the original
grass pasture. Local legumes are being tested. The rotation of legumes with
gramineous crops would be recommended under the project, and is discussed in
para 16. Cattle farmers favor the Nelore breed or Nelore crossbreeds with
other Zebu races for beef production. Calving rates are not high, averaging
typically between 55 and 60 percent, with calf mortality ranging between 5 and
15 percent, depending on the level of managemenit. Steers are fattened out
on Colonial Guinea at 3-3.5 years old with a carcass weight of 220-240 kg.
Male weaners are sold from 12-18 months by the small farmers that are mainly
interested in producing milk. for sale, and are generally bought by larger
beef farmers for fattening. Milking cows with calf at foot average approxi-
mately 2 litres/day over an 8 month lactation. Prices for thin steers and
weaners have recently been below their levels one year ago, representing
a fall in demand for beef cattle. The four to five months dry season causes
a bottleneck in pasture carrying capacity, which is at its lowest in September/
October. Veterinary health practices are rudiimentary except for a few special-
ized milk producers and on large beef ranches. The major problem for pastiure
maintenance is invasion by brush species and control is normally by hand
chopping for low infestations, burning for high infestation, which in turn
increases the risk of sape infestation (Emperal:a Cylindrica). The improvement
of veterinary health measures and pasture management through extension, coupled
with measures such as the upgrading of Zebu cows with Holstein blood, and the
use of a legume in pasture should help improve overall productivity, with milk
yields rising from 360 1/year/cow to 700 l/year/cow, mortality rates dropping
by 40% and the calving rates rising from 55% at present to 70-75% at full
development. Herd development and production parameters are provided in Table 3.
13.       Annual Crops:  The principal annual crops of the subproject area
are currently rice (73,600 ha),corn (27,900 ha) and beans (19,500 ha), with
lesser areas also planted to manioc, cotton, peanuts and soybeans. Upland
rice is cultivated under manual, semi-mechanized and fully mechanized methods
of exploitation.  Farmers using all manual cultivation generally use poor
quality seed and no chemical inputs. Use of improved and certified seed,
fertilizers and pesticides increases with the degree of mechanization. Almost
all the corn is planted and harvested using manual methods, with up to hali
the farmers using high-yielding hybrid seed. Beans are also cultivated
using manual methods, with a minimum of chemical inputs. Manioc is grown on
the poorer soils in the region. Use of improved seed, pesticides and fertili-
zers will have a definite impact on the yields of annual crops in the region.

ANNEX 8
Page 6
D.   Project Objectives and Impact
14.       The impact of the project on agricultural production in the project
area is expected to be: (a) an increase in the productivity of annual and
perennial crops and livestock, a reduction in the decline in fertility in
newly cultivated soils, or recuperation of degraded areas; (b) a moderate
expansion in areas of annuals and tree crops; and (c) a reduction in post
harvest losses. Such objectives would be achieved through combinations of:
(i) adoption of improved fertilizer practices; (ii) improved disease and pest
control; (iii) introduction of improved crop rotation systems (iv) the inclu-
sion of a greater proportion of nitrogen fixing legumes in pastures, and
inclusion of pastures in the cropping pattern; (v) utilization of improved
genetic material and certified seeds; (vi) improved husbandry practices,
fertilization, and cutback pruning in existing stands of coffee; (vii) more
rational use of labor; (viii) improved soil conservation techniques; and (ix)
improved animal husbandry and pasture management.
15.       Labor Use and Availability:  Labor availability is the principal
factor determining the amount of land which can be intensively cropped for
small farmers with under 20 ha. Above this size, semi- and fully mechanized
cultivation methods are more usually used. The peak labor requirement for
annual crops occurs in February/March when the rice harvest, breaking of corn
and planting of the second crop coincide. Coffee harvest coincides with the
bean harvest, creating a further peak in May and June. Labor requirements for
weeding would be offset by an increased use of herbicides and mechanization.
The range of crops grown would be widened, in order to allow the maximum
spread possible of peak labor requirements.
16.       Crop Rotation:  Shifting cultivation, the main traditional agricul-
tural system of small farmers in this region, provides enough food for family
subsistence and limits soil erosion, provided the population is low and
enough land is available to provide a long period of bush fallow (15-20
years). When land and population pressure increases, the bush fallow period is
of necessity reduced and the system breaks down. Maintenance of a fertility
balance, disease and pest control are the principal reasons for adopting
rotations in annual crops. Although more important for the poorer Class
2 and 3 soils in the project area, advantages from rotating gramineous crops
with legumes, through an improved nitrogen economy and reduction in fungal
diseases and pests, especially on rice and Phaseolus beans, can be expected to
accrue on all soils in the region. First cycle pasture reform on Class 2, 3
and 4 soils, currently planted to Colonial Guinea grass will probably occur at
between 8 and 10 years, but the interval will probably shorten to 5 to 7
years thereafter, depending on the soil's intrinsic fertility, the amount of
residual phosphorus after the cropping break, and the intensity of management.
17.       Crop Diversification:  Under the project the dependance on coffee
and traditional subsistence crops in the area would be reduced, through
increased promotion of diversification into other crops such as soybeans,
cotton, peanuts, and tree crops (introducing mixed tree crop gardens). This
should help spread both market and agronomic risks of the farmer, and dampen
environmental risks in the project as a whole.

ANNEX 8
Page 7
18.       Soil Conservation:  The major cleared areas have gentle slopes, and
little serious erosion was seen on cultivated Class 1 and 2 soils. Continued
mecahnized cultivation and heavy cattle grazing tend to slowly reduce the
infiltration rate of soils after clearing, and runoff problems consequently
increase. Contour banking would be promoted as an inexpensive investment on
slopes up to five percent, which covers most of the soils in permanent arable
cropping in the project area. On soils with steeper slopes annual crop cultiva-
tion would be discouraged. Minimum tillage techniques, using direct dril]Ling
for planting, and herbicideS for weed control, although not yet tested in
the project area, have been used extensively in soybean and wheat in southern
Brazil, and would give exceptionally good erosion control besides reducing
labor requirements and improving the soil's water economy.
E.   Illustrative Farm Mode:Ls
19.    The assumptions and conditions described above were incorporated into
seven farm development models, in order to better evaluate the potential
impact of the proposed program on the beneficiary farmer.  A summary of thLe
parameters and development scenarios of the various representative cases is
given in Table 4 of this Annex. Detailed results of one of the representative
models (a coffee owner/operaLtor in the 0-20 ha farm size category) are given
in Table 5 of this Annex.  Each of the models has two development scenarios:
that which would occur without the intervention of the project in the area,
and a probable development sequence with the project. The farming systems
which are evolving in the area are directly related to land class, which
reflects the capacity for sustained cropping, and are typif-ied as follows:
(a)  Three models in the 0-20 ha size category on various classes
of soil, all of which produce subsistence crops and a perennial
cash crop, using manual labor methods. The mini-farmers on
the class 2 or poorer soils, which are unsuitable for coffee,
plant rubber or bananas as their main cash crop, along with
beans, rice, manioc and corn, of' which the excess production is
sold. Fertility degradation would become a serious problem,
especially given access problems and limited availability of
credit and technical assistance,, in the "without" project
situation for farmers on poorer soils. The small farmers
in this size category on the bel:ter class 1 soils plant coffee
as their main cash crop, along with the traditional subsistence
crops mentioned above, and would be less threatened by loss of
fertility than in the "without" project case.
(b)  Two models in the 20-100 ha size class, producing subsistence
crops using semi-mechanized techniques, with the farmer on
the class 1 soils cultivating coffee as the main cash crop,
both with the labor of the family and a sharecropper (repre--
sented in a separate farm type) and the farmer on class 2
or poorer soils continuing with already established livestock
operation.  The cropping system for the coffee farmer is
similar to thatt for the smaller farm size described above,
except that labor constraints force the hiring of auxiliary



- 65 -
ANNEX 8
Page 8
labor for the peak harvest requirements, and the expansion of
the coffee area through the sharecropper system. The existing
stand of coffee (6 ha) would be refurbished through cutback
pruning and fertilization under the project. Land preparation
for annual pure-stand crops would normally be done with rented
machinery. The livestock farmer, however, has poorer quality
'soils, and would typically maintain some 12 ha of ten-year old
pasture, as well as cultivating 8-10 ha of various annual crops
with semi-mechanized techniques. Potential long-term fertility
decline would be corrected and productivity increased through
the various recommendations discussed previously.
(c) The final farm type, in the 100-200 ha size category, represents
a farmer on class 2 soils or poorer, who cultivates a cash crop
such as soybeans, as well as some subsistence crops (rice,
corn, beans) using partly mechanized techniques, and also
maintains a herd of cattle on around 55 ha of pasture.
20.       The expected "typical" eventual land and labor uses, incomes and
financial rates of return for each farm type are shown in Table 4. A maximum
of 50% of available land is cleared under each farm type. For those farmers with
no pasture, the area under annual crops increases with farm size (with more capital
and managerial talent available). The proportion of area under perennials also goes
up, with farm size. Livestock producers retain the same area under pasture as they
had prior to the project, investing rather in improving its productivity,
and expanding the area under annual crops a little. Labor intensity per
hectare cropped (including pasture) increases between 10 and 50% depending
principally on whether there was an expansion in area cultivated with the
implantation of a labor intensive crop, like coffee, or just the adoption of
more productive techniques, including labor-saving devices.
21.       The estimated present income of the targeted beneficiary families
is equivalent to a weighted average of about US$2,735 in 1981. However, some
75% of the farm families fall below the rural poverty level for Brazil, which
is about US$330 per capita, or US$1,980 for a family of 6 (the average in the
project area).  At full development (year 2000), the   weighted average annual
farm family income would more than double to about US$6,750. Return to on-
farm family labor would also double, going from current levels of US$8/day
(above the daily wage for unskilled labor of US$4.50/day) to around US$17/day
at full development.
22.       Rates of return vary according to the productive potential of the
soils being developed, with some farms and classes of soils giving a financial
rate of return of over 50%. The lowest return (17%) corresponds to the
rubber farmer, working on class 2 soils, or poorer, with a perennial crop with
a relatively long investment period. In the financial analysis, which looks
basically at the return to family labor, the cost of family labor was not
included in operating costs. The sensitivity of the farm models to variations
in yields or prices of the main crops was tested reducing them by 20%. Simi-
larly, the impact of a 20% increase in fertilizer usage was also tested.
Results are shown below:

23.       In order to arrive at an estimate of overall projet on-farm costs
and benefits, the phasing of incremental direct beneficiary farmers, by
farm type, by year, was assumaed to be as follows:
Phasing of Incremental Direct Beneficary Farmers

Banana, 0-20 ha              11.2      120        150        180       188       750

Livestock, 20-100 ha         300       320        400        480       500    2,000
Livestock, 100-200 ha         75        80        100        120       125       500

24.       The farm models are based on conservalive yield assumptions, moder-
ate fertilizer inputs, and rational use of form:Lcides, herbicides,fungicides
and pesticides. Ant and weed control are of special importance, and some
models do include a fairly large increase in the use of formicides and herbi-
cides. The profit margins on annual crops, even on the lesser quality soils,
would allow the farmers to increase their fertilizer consumption considerab:Ly
if this were to prove necessary. The economics of increasing fertilizer
consumption beyond the farm model assumptions to achieve higher yields will be
the subject of future research. Research in other Amazon or "pre-Amazon"
areas of similar or poorer soils indicates that such fertilizer increments can
be profitable within the prevailing price structure. On the poorer soils,
however, extension services would promote adequate crop rotations with legume
fallows, which are expected to ensure equivalent, or better results than those
which can be obtained with modest incremental fertilizer consumption.
