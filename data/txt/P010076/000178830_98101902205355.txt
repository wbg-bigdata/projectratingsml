INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPI{ENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC O' PAKISTAN FOR
THE THIRD KARACHI PORT DEVELOPM!WT PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent
of US $18.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for
the development of the Port of Karachi. US $17.75 million would be relent
to Karachi Port Trust for 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with
interest at 7-U percent per annum. The balance of US $250,000 is the
estimated foreign exchange cost of technical assistance to improve coordina-
tion between the Port and railway operations in the Karachi area.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        The most recent economic report "rEconomic Situation and Prospects
of Pakistan" (74-PAK dated February 16, 1973) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on February 27, 197J. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex I. The economy of present-day Pakistan (i.e. the former west
Pakistan) grew rapidly during the Second Plan (1960-65), with GDP increasing
at 6.7 percent per annum compared with 5.0 percent for the entire country.
This high growth was spearheaded by an industrial growth of 13.1 percent per
annum. However, agriculture grew by only 3.7 percent per annum. West
Pakistan's overall economic growJth slowed down somewhat during the Third
Plan (1965-70) to 6.2 percent per annum, compared with 5.0 percent for the
entire country. Industrial growth in the West Wing fell to 7.6 percent,
but agricultural output grew at 5.6 percent annually with the aid of new
high-yielding wheat and rice varieties, reducing, but not eliminating, the
food deficit.
2.        Though it is hardly apparent in these figures, Pakistan's eco-
nomic development began to encounter a number of difficulties after 1965.
Import restrictions and other direct controls introduced at that tinme
became permanent as the shortage of foreign exchange and budget resources
persisted as a result of higher defense expenditure, rising foreign debt
service, and decreased nonproject foreign aid. The inelasticity of
government revenues and the periodic need to inport food (particularly
during 1965-67) also contributed to these difficulties. Import controls
and the multiple exchange rate system slowed industrial growth, distorted
prices, and produced idle industrial capacity. Both net foreign aid and
domestic savings declined and an increasing portion of investment took
place in East Pakistan. Consequently, investment in west Pakistan fell
from about 22 percent of GDP in 1964/65 to about 17 percent in 1969/70.



- 2 -
More recently, it declined to only 11 percent in 1971/72. Investment in
transportation and other economic infrastructure has declined sharply,
and many such facilities, including Karachi Port, are now operating at
or near capacity. Income ineaualities increased during the second half
of the decade. Sharp increases in food prices, reflecting both crop
shortages and higher agricultural support prices, reduced the real wages
of urban workers during 1965/69. The slowdown in industrial growth,
along with urban population growth rates of more than 5 percent, also
produced rapidly rising urban unemployment. In rural areas, it was the
larger farmers of West Pakistan who got most of the benefits from new
"green revolution" wheat and rice varieties. The smaller farmers lacked
the credit and other resources to purchase the necessary inputs.
3.        The economy underwent severe strains during 1970/71 and 1971/72,
reflecting both political events and a prolonged drought which virtually
halted the increase in agricultural output. As agriculture accounts for
one-third of GDP, and is the major source of industrial raw materials,
this contributed to a general economic recession, which was made worse
after 1970 by the loss of markets, assets and sources of supply in East
Pakistan. Industry also experienced increasing difficulties in obtaining
imported raw materials and spare parts, as the foreign exchange shortage
grew more acute. Power shortages and labor unrest further curtailed indus-
trial production, which is estimated to have dec:Lined by about one percent
over the two years. With population growing at about 2.9 percent annually,
the per capita decline in availability of physical goods was at least 6
percent in two years. Reduced aid, the diversion of resources to defense,
and rising debt service forced the government to curtail development expen-
ditures, and the uncertaiIn economic and political situation reduced private
investment.
4.        A revival of the economy is now getting underway with a strong
increase in exports and a recovery of agricultural production. The rapid
growth of exports has been the most hopeful aspect of Pakistan's recent
economic performance. This growth has been greatly assisted by devalua-
tion of the rupee from Rs. 4.76 per dollar to Rs. 11.00 per dollar on May
12, 1972.1/ Devaluation has been successful in making Pakistani exports
more competitive in international markets, in increasing incentives to
produce for the local market, and in bringing about a much more liberal
system of import control.  Pakistan's favorable exchange rate and low labor
costs favor the export of textiles, leather goods, other light manufactures,
raw cotton, ri-ce, fish, fruits and vegetables, meats, and other primary
rroducts.  In 1971/72  exports rose by nearly 40 percent, and for the first
nine months of 1972/73 (through March) are running 30 percent above last
year.
1/ Pakistan did not devalue at the time of the February 1973 devalua-
tion of the dollar, so that the official rate against the dollar
is now Rs. 9.90.



5.        The import liberalization at the time of devaluation has also
contributed to the recovery of outout. While the previous controls
encouraged the creation of excess capacity, the system now encourages the
maximum use of existing capacity. Consequently imports of materials and
components have been rising, and will continue to do so as economic recovery
progresses. The government has also taken stecs to assure ample supplies
of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. Most of these additional
supplies must be imported for at least the next several years, until domestic
fertilizer, pesticide, tractor and other production capacity can be increased.
6.        Pakistan's trade and current account deficits (excluding interest
payments) are both expected to be about $250 million in 1973/74. Annual
foreign aid requirements are likely to remain at about 4250 million plus
total debt service (interest and principal) during the next several years.
In the absence of a division of its external debt with Bangladesh, or of
a debt rescheduling, Pakistan's debt service is expected to rise from $180
million in 1972/73 to $280 million in 197j/74 and to $400 million by 1975/76.
The rapid increase reflects the consequence of a short-term debt rescheduling
from Yay 1971 to June 1973, as well as growth of the outstanding debt. How-
ever, the Government of Pakistan has informed its creditors that after
,-tne 30, 197j, it will cease to service debt which it considers to have been
n urred on behalf of what is now Bangladesh. The Government estimates that
h. - would reduce its near-term debt service by about US $70 million annually.
i'hr. the total resource requirement for the trade deficit plus debt service
(but excluding that part designated by the Government as the responsibility
of Bangladesh) would probably be about $460 million in 1973/74 and $580
million by 1975/76. This can be compared with expected new aid disburse-
ments of about $435 million in 1972/73, and probably much the same amount
for 1973/74.
7.        Pakistan's major economic problems at the present time are to
stimulate output and employment (which requires continued growth of exports
and a continuation of liberal import policies), to control inflation, to
increase oublic and private saving and investment and to improve the dis-
tribution of income. The growth of exports, the increased availability
of imports and good prospects for agriculture are beginning to pull the
economy out of recession. Rising agricultural output gives promise of
increased activity for agro-based industries, increased exports and an
expanded rural market for consumer goods. Increased production of capital
goods, light engineering products and of agricultural and mineral raw
materials can also be expected. The government has launched an Integrated
Rural Development Program that is intended to bring credit, inputs, know-how
and marketing opportunities to all farmers within a few years. A PeopleTs
Xbrks Program (PWP) is also getting underway to provide employment plus
useful economic and social infrastructure.
8.        The recovery now underway gives ground for optimism. However,
there are problems still to be overcome. While production has been
recovering, investment has remained depressed. Production in key sectors
of the textile industry is now nearing capacity, electric power is likely
to be short over the next few years, and congestion in the port of Karachi



- 4 -
is slowing exports and adding to shipping costs. It is important, therefore,
that Government increase savings for investment in infrastructure and
public enterprises, that the orivate sector be induced to put its capital
to work, and that foreign capital flows continue.
c.        Increased public saring will require a reduction in nondevelopment
current expenditure and an increase in budget revenues and profits of public
enterprises. The Government has taken a number of actions to increase public
revenues. The 1972/73 budget eliminated or reduced certain tax deductions to
business and households, and railway and telephone tariffs have been
increased. There are some indications of a revival in private investment,
and the Governiwnt's recent success in obtaining agreement on a new
constitution may also contribute to private wfillingness to save and invest.
10.       If the necessary saving and Lnvestment are forthcoming, Pakistan's
growth prospects are bright.   Exports appear to be Lamited more by supply
constraLnts rather than lack of demand (with the important exception of the
textile quotas in importing countries).   Ex,ports could increase at 12 percent
a year for the next several years. The water from Tarbela Dam will be
available from late 1975 and the increasing participation of small and
medium-scale farmers in the "green revolution" could mean that agricultural
growth in the next 5 years will match the 5.6 percent annual rate of the
1965-70 Third Plan period. Capital goods, light engineering goods and
agro-based industries also have good growth prospects.
11.       In brief, therefore, the economy of Pakistan can reasonably be
empected to grow by about 7 percent annually in FY74 and the several
following years, provided the inflow of foreign capital and the genera-
tion of domestic savings are together sufficient to finance the necessary
investment.  In view of Pakistan's low per capita income and high debt
burden, foreign assistance needs to be provided on tenms as concessionary
as possible.  IDA financing is therefore appropriate for the project here
proposed.
PiP`T II - BANK GROUP OPERATIOTiS IN PAKISTAN
12.       The Bark and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan (total for west and East) between the start of operations in
1952 and June 30, 1971.  The Bank and IDA had then connnitted -1.2 billion
to the countrv, about one-half of which was provided by the Bank and one-
half by I-DA. Of this amount, one loan and 19 development credits, total-
ing US $4.7 million and US $168.1 million respectively (net of cancella-
,ions) were for projects locatEd wholly within what was then East Pakistan.
Of these, the loan and seven of the credits had been fully disbursed, and
Lk z95.6 million remained undisbursed under twelve development credits.
In addition, under ten loans and eight development credits for projects
involving expenditures in both East and lWest Pakistan, a total amount of
UD $257 million was outstanding in December 1971; part of this amount has
been used to finance goods located in Bangladesh, or services rendered
there.  The right of Pakistan to make further withdrawrals in respect of



expenditures for projects located in the East was suspended on December 29,
1971 (Sec M71-60), and the undisbursed amounts for projects in the East
were cancelled on September 29, 1972.
13.       In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the International
Monetary Fund, the Bank and the Association. It was decided that proposals
would be submitted to the Executive Directors for reactivation of all the
uncompleted projects wholly located in Bangladesh which had previously been
financed under credits to Pakistan. Accordingly, ten such credits in an
aggregate amount of US $126.4 million have since then been made to Banglade!.
One more, for highways, in an amount of U1S $25.0 million should be ready
for submission to the Executive Directors shortly. The aggregate amount of
these reactivation credits of UI $151.  million includes about US $44.1 mil-
lion for the notional repayment of amounts disbursed under the corresponding
previous credit agreements with Pakistan, thus debiting Bangladesh with this
amount.
1)4.      Of this $1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (Last and West), West
Pakistan received about 72 percent.   During its long association with
Pakistan, the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the
economy.  Until 1972, 38 percent of the total conmitments were for the
public services, 22 percent for agriculture, 22 percent for industry, 10 per-
cent for industrial imports, and 1 percent for education.   Lending for public
services amounted to some 4i325 million and included loans and credits for
railways, electric power, pipelines, the Karachi Port, highways, telecom-
munications and water supply. A large part of the lending for agriculture
was for the Indus Basin projects. The lending for industry has been mostly
through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC).
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and 1k
investments as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
15.       No Bank loans or IDA credits were made for Pakistan (or for the
former west Pakistan) between August 1970 and June 1972, when Executive
Directors approved a 50 million credit for industrial imDorts; this credit
was s:gned in October 1972. A second industrial imports credit of $45
million was approved by the Executive Directors earlier this month. The
present credit marks the resumption of project lending. Further lending
for PICIC, a fertilizer plant, a third telecommunications project and an
oil terminal for Karachi Port is now in course of preparation.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
16.       All transport modes, ranging from camel train to jet aircraft,
are represented in Pakistan. The main traffic flows serve the thickly
populated area in the northeast, of which Lahore is the center. This
area generates flows southwest to the port and industrial area of Karachi
some 700 miles away; west to the industrial and agricultural areas around
Iyallpur, Sargodha and Khushab; and northwest to the adtministrative centers



- 6 -
in Rawaloindi and Islamabad, and to Peshawar and the Afghan border beyond.
All these main routes are served by rail, road and air transport and by a
natural gas pipeline system based on the Sui and Mari, fields. Virtually
all Pakistan's imports and exports and part of Afghanistan's foreign trade
pass through the Port of Karachi.
17.       Pakistan western Railway (PWR) is government-owned and operated
and constitutes one of the largest and most important organizations in the
country. For many years, the railways provided the main means of mechanized
transport; recently an increasing proportion of transport has been carried
by road, and railway traffic has shown little overall growth.   PW1.'s opera-
tions and management have been studied by consultants, financed under a Bank
loan, who have made recommendations for improvements in managerial and
operational control.
18.       Motorized road traffic is growing at about 10 p rcent a year and
is the principal means of transport in urban areas. Trucking, almost all
privately owned, is highly competitive; publicly owned bus companies have
been running at a loss and are frequently unable to cover their cash expen-
ditures. While truck transport has been free of significant government
regulation for more than a decade, bus regulation was liberalized only in
1970. Since then there has been an increase in the number of buses in
oDeration and a substantial improvement in service.   Animal-drawn traffic
remains important in rural areas. The overall condition of the road system
ranges from fair to poor; the 'Length is about 48,000 miles, of which about
33,000 miles are unimproved.
1'.       Air transnort is provided by the government-owned Pakistan
International Airlines (PIA), which operates international and domestic
services.  The number of passengers carried on domestic routes rose from
198,000 in 1963 to 460,000 in 1971, an average annual growth rate of 11
percent. Ioad factors and efficiency were high and PIA operated profit-
ably until the separation of' the former East Pakistan, which caused a
disruption of the services.
20.       This basic structure of the domestic transport system has not been
changed by the events of the past two years, but important changes are taking
place in the pattern of Pakistan's international aviation and shipping
operations which are developing new route patterns to take the place of the
traffic routes which formerly existed. Also, overland traffic to the Middle
East and Europe is beginning to develop.
21.       Public development expenditures for transport reflect the
increased emphasis being given to highways, which are allocated 42 percent
of' such expenditures in 1972/7j, and, according to the recommendations of a
Bank-assisted Transport Coordination Study, this pattern should continue for
at least the next five years. Highways are built and maintained by a variety
of government organizations, and there are consicierable disparities in their
construction and maintenance practices. The study also indicates that the
railway system operates inefficiently and improvements in both management and
operational controls are reouired. This has a higher priority than additional



- 7 -
investments in the near future. The railways have received a substantial
amount of external aid (Pas. 1,200 million over the past ten years) for
capital expansion, but the growth of traffic has been slower than expected.
22.       The total of imports and exports passing through the Port of Karachi
has grown from 5.8 million tons in 1964 to 9.3 million tons in 1972. The
port is intensively used, with a berth occupancy of almost 100 percent, made
possible, in part, through double-banking of ships and at the expense of
substantial ship waiting time. The current shortage of berths, and the
consequent delays to shipping, resulted in two conference lines serving
Karachi, imposing in November 1972 a 12½ percent to 15 percent freight rate
surcharge.   In view of Pakistan's pressing need to find alternative markets
for exports, such a surcharge could be particularly serious. The surcharge
was subsequently suspended, pending evaluation of measures by Karachi Port
Trust to increase labor productivity. While these measures may alleviate
the problem in the short-term, the only satisfactory long-term solution is
the construction of additional deep-water berths, without which a surcharge
is certain to be reimposed as congestion develops with future traffic growth.
The proposed project resnonds to this urgent need for additional capacity.
PART IV - THE PRLOJECT
23.       The Bank Group has been associated with the development of the
Karachi Port for almost 20 years. Bank loans of 4114.8 million (126-PAK)
and 417.0 million (376-PAK) were made in 1955 and 1964 to assist earlier
reconstruction and development programs. An Engineering Credit of 41.0
million (S-9 PAK) was made in 1970 for the engineering studies on which
the present project is based; the outstanding balance or this credit
amounting to 4s900,000 would be refinanced out of the proceeds OI the
proposed credit. Loan 126-PAK was completely disbursed in 1962; the Closing
Date of Loan 376-PAK has been extended from March 1969 to June 1974, owing to
delays in construction arising from difficult foundation conditions, the
Indo-Pakistan war and labor troubles. The difficulties now appear to have
been brought under control and the berths are now ready for occupancy,
and only the trarnsit sheds and ancillary works remain to be completed.
The Closing Date of the Engineering Credit has also been extended one year
to the end of 1973. The present project was based on the findings of a
mission which visited Karachi in June 1972 and on information supplied
subsequently; negotiations took place in Washington during May 197J.
24.       The Appraisal Report on the proposed Third Karachi Port Project
is being circulated to Executive Directors separately.   A project summary
is attached as Annex III.
25.       The Port of Karachi is managed by a body corporate known as the
Trustees of the Port of Karachi (KPT) - a Board consisting of eleven
trustees representing shipowners, shippers, labor and the government,
inclualng a chairman appointed by the government. The chairman is respon-
sible for day-to-day port operations. The KPT is a generally efficient



- 8 -
organization, with adecuate authority to carry out its responsibilities.
Some improvements in its organizational structure and its accounting system
are required, however, and these have been studied by management consultants
retained under the 1970 Engine3ering Credit. During negotiations, agreement
fas reached on implementation of a new management and cost accounting system,
and of a new organizational structure by June 1975.
26.       The project consists of the reconstruction of lighterage berths
to provide four deepwater dry cargo berths anc. twc transit sheds, the pur-
chase of cargo-handling equipment, remodelling of the west Wharf railway
marshalling yard and storage area, and replacement of the very old Napier
Mole road bridge which provides access to the east side of the port. The
project also includes consultants' services for supervision of construction
of the berths and the Napier Mole road bridge and for detailed engineering
for a new oil terminal, and for six additional dry cargo berths in the
western Backwater which form the next stage oi the Port's expansion. Tech-
nical assistance will also be provided for dredging operations, for the
imp'Lementation of the new accounting system referred to above, and for
imnroved coordinationbetween the Port and railway operations in the Karachi
area.
27.       liirther expansion of Karachi Port beyond the present project will
require development of the Western Backwater area of the Port. Extensive
studies of this area have been made withUDTP financing and with the Bank
as Executive Agency and, as mentioned, the present project includes provi-
s-ion for detailed engineering of the initial six berths. In the light of
p.resent traffic trends, a project for the initial development of this area
will probably have to be comp'leted by 1979,
28.       The government is also considering the desirability of
developing additional port facilities at Phitti Creek, ten miles to the
east of Karachi. A pre-feasibility study of this site has been made by a
Japanese technical assistance team. However, since the cost of developing
a wholly new port will be substantial, a fully detailed project report,
including proper evaluation of relevant technical and economic factors,
is needed before such a major decision is taken. The government has under-
taken to do this.
Cost and Pinancing of the Project
29.       The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs. 338.4
(US 034.2 million equivalent), of which the foreign exchange component is
about Rs. 169.4 million (US 417.1 million equivalent) or 50 percent of the
total project cost. The estimates for civil wrrks include a 10 percent
allowance for physical contingencies and a 6 percent per annum allowance
for price increases, and are based on the preliminary engineering studies
conducted under the Engineering Credit.   All contracts for civil works and
orocurement of equipment and materials will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding except for the civil workscfalling within
larts (a) (ii) and (b) (ii) of the Project (Annex III) Which will not be
financed out of the. Credit. These will be carried out by KPT, following



- 9 -
its own contracting procedures and using its own funds. The cost of
imported items includes customs duties as a local cost.  Details of the
cost estimates and estimated disbursements are shown in Annex Ill.
30.       The Project is a part oi KPT's investment program through
1950 which amounts to $93.8 million and includes, in addition to the
ongoing and prooosed Bank projects, other capital expenditures amounting
to 450.0 m.illion, of which the berths to be built in the iestern Backwater
account for $28.0 million and the remainder is for items such as a new oil
terminal, dredging plant, cargo-handling equipment and various civil and
mechanical works. About 52 percent of the total funds required for the
investment orogram will be financed by loans and the remainder from KPT's
own resources, and from a Government grant of 4O percent of the total cost
of the Napier Mole bridge, which serves general traffic as well as that
using the port.
31.       The financial position of KPT is sound and, provided port charges
are maintained at adequate levels, it should be able to provide its required
contribution to the financing of the investment program. K?T has therefore
agreed to maintain a rate o1 return of not less than 4 percent on net fixed
assets from 1976 through 1981 and 7 percent from 1958 onwards,, and to adjust
its tariff if necessary.
32.       The IDA credit would be made to Pakistan, which would relend
4W17,750,000 of it to KPT for a term of 25 years, including a five-year
grace period with interest at 74 percent per annum. The remainder of the
credit would be used by the government itself for the study of railway
operations ir. the Karachi area.
Economic Justification
33.       The port expansion project is designed to alleviate the serious
delays to shipping caused by the shortage of berths, and thereby avoid
the rapidly rising costs of congestion which would be detrimental to
Pakistan's foreign trade. The economic benefits of the four berths, and
of the railway marshalling yard and cargo-handling equipment which form an
integral part of the four-berth expansion, stem from savings in ship waiting
time and an avoidance of increased lighterage costs. In 1972, congestion
in the port resulted in a loss of 2,600 ship-days, valued at US $5.2 million.
This -will be reduced by the seven additional berths provided under the pre-
vious project, which should be completed by mid-year; however, without the
present project, congestion by 1978 will again approach present levels. By
1950, the project would save some 10,000 ship-days annually, valued at US $20
million, and would avoid an increase in the volume and costs of lighterage,
estimated at US $l million per annum.   These benefits, which yield a returr
of 40 percent, will be passed on directly to the Pakistan economty through a
reduction in demurrage fees on chartered ships and through increased produc-
tivity of Pakistani ships. In addition, the project will enable Pakistan to
avoid the freight increases and surcharges which will be inevitable if the
present level of congestion is not reduced. Port services will be priced
so as to recover the project costs and to earn a reasonable return on invested
capital thereby ensuring that a reasonable proportion of the project's benefits
accrue to Pakistan rather than to shipowners.

34.       The existing Napier Mole bridge is over one hundred years old
and is in a dangerous condition. A structural failure could occur at
any time and, in this event, traffic now u_ing the bridge would be forced
to use longer routes at higher cost. Road traffic to and from the port
would be particularly affected. The economic benefits of the proposed
bridge, which would avoid the extra costs of traffic rerouting, yield a
return of 16 percent.

C. Projects in Execution-
Loan No. 266       Indus Basin; US $90.0 Million Loan of September
19, 1960; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
All major project items (except Tarbela Dam) have been completed.
Settlement of a number of claims and some remedial works are outstanding.
Further disbursement of this Loan will be mainly for the Tarbela Dam proj-
ect. The original Closing Date of September 30, 1973, has been extended to
December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 50         Education; US $8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Closing Date June 30, 1975
The project suffered serious delays from the start. Among the
reasons for delays were unsatisfactory consultants, disorganization of one
of the main contractors, shortages of building materials, lack of local
funds, cumbersome procurement methods for instructional equipment, and,
most recently, the war. Implementation is now proceeding energetically,
however, with over 90 percent of total planned construction contracts
awarded, of which about 75 percent are completed. Equipment procurement
for the agricultural university represents about 78 percent of the total
revised allocation and 90 percent of the total allocated for the technical
institutes. The training of technical teachers as envisaged by the Credit
has been satisfactorily completed. The project is now expected to be com-
pleted well before the new Closing Date of June 30, 1975. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1968, was extended first to December 31, 1970,
then to December 31, 1972, and most recently to June 30, 1975.
Loan No. 376       Karachi Port; US $17.0 Million Loan of May 14, 1964;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The execution of this project has been delayed substantially.
The total cost of the project has increased from the original estimate of
US $37.5 million to US $47.0 million but there has been no change in the
foreign exchange component of US $17.0 million. This increase has not
materially affected the economic justification of the project. The project
was first delayed by difficulties with the original design of the wharves.
In 1967 work had to be suspended and the wharves redesigned. Later, it was
found that more extensive soil investigation was necessary, which meant
further delay. The war in 1971 and labor troubles also contributed to the
delay. The difficulties now appear to have been brought under control and
the works are now approaching completion. The dredging operations, although
more than 90 percent complete, are still behind schedule but are now being
expedited. The original Closing Date of March 31, 1969, was extended first
to June 30, 1972, and then to June 30, 1974, the current date.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purnort to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page E of 6 pages
Loan No. 548       Tarbela Dam; US $25.0 Million Loan of July 10,
YC§; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and no disburse-
ments are expected until FY1976. Good progress is being maintained on
the project.
Cr. No. 145        Telecommunications; US $16.0 Million Credit of
March 6, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Cr. No. 186        Telecommunications; US $15.0 Million Credit of
May 22, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
There have been delays in implementing both these
credits. The original proposals allowed for the expenditure under the
two credits of about US $11.3 million in the former East Wing and
US $19.7 million in the West. US $5.2 million of the undisbursed bal-
ance of Credit 145-PAK was cancelled in November 1972 after a telecom-
munications project to Bangladesh was approved. Ihe Closing Date of
1T5-PAK was extended from the original date of December 31, 1972 to
December 31, 197h. This will allow GOP more time for the reorganization
of the Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph Department, the introduction of
an effective accounting system and the completion of the installation of
equipment under the Credits.
Loan No. 590       Development Finance Company - PILCIC; US $40.0
Million Loan of March 21, 1969; Closing Date:
March 31, 1974
This Loan has been fully committed.   Except for one subproject,
disbursement is also expected to be completed by the Closing Date.
Loan No. 621       Railways; US $1.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvenient of track and
bridges, and (b) rehabilitation and improvement of workshops and depots
has been satisfactory.  However, the proposal for the expansion of the
marshalling yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first phase of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri has been included instead. The change was
based on a feasibility study conducted by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France),
who indicated that a new yard at Pipri would be economically and opera-
tionally preferable. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972, has
been extended by three years to December 31, 1975, to allow time for
Pipri yard to be built and the balance of the loan has been reallocated.
PWR has also reappointed the consultants for a period of 18 months.

Cr. No. 157        Agricultural Development Bank; US $30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969; Closing Date: June 30,
19 74
Disbursements under this Credit are very much behind the
original schedule. Delays in issuing import licenses and slowness in
lending for tubewells because of difficulties in providing electrical
connections were mainly responsible for this delay. The original Clos-
ing Date of June 30, 1972, has been extended to June 30, 1974.
Cr. No. 177        Development Finance Company - IDBP; US $20.0
Million Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
The loss of the former East Pakistan had far-reaching reper-
cussions on IDBP's financial position and effectiveness in allocating
resources. Pending an assessment of the situation, IDA discontinued
approvals of subprojects under the Credit in April 1972.    A mission
which visited Pakistan in October/November 1972 found that IDBP's
effectiveness had been restored, but that the loss of its East Pakistan
assets seriously jeopardizes its financial position. The question of
resuming approval of projects is still under discussion.
Cr. No. S-9        Port Engineering; US $1.0 Million Credit of
June 10, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The major portion of the consulting and engineering studies
is completed. The remaining detailed design works will be completed
by the present Closing Date. The original Closing Date of December 31,
1972, has been extended to December 31, 1973.
Loan No. 696       Gas Transmission; US $19.2 Million Loan of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1973
The 1971 war has delayed execution of this project and also
caused a small increase in its cost (less than 3%). The project is
expected to be completed in mid-July 1973.
Cr. No. 206        Engineering Education; US $h.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Construction cost of the N.E.D. Government Engineering Col-
lege is estimated at about 25 percent above the appraisal estimate, due
mostly to the devaluation of the rupee, a sharp increase in the price
of imported construction materials, and higher duties. After consider-
ing the increase in cost, it was agreed that the project would still be
justified and the Government agreed to assume the extra cost. Construc-
tion drawings are now being completed. The probable completion date is
now January 1975, one year behind the schedule estimated during appraisal;
equipment procurement may not be completed in phase with the completion

of the physical facilities, due to cumbersome methods and regulations
for procurement. An acceleration of the technical assistance element
of the project will be necessary to ensure completion within the Clos-
ing Date.
Cr. No. 213        Power Transmission and Distribution; US $23.0
Million Credit of August 14, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
Owing to political, economic and organizational factors (major
personnel changes in WAPDA in early 1972), the project has been delayed
by about six to nine months. In September 1972, a new Chairman and new
members of the Authority were appointed and progress with the project
has resumed. Most of the contracts for major equipment have been awarded
and the remainder will be awarded soon. Deliveries and construction will
start very shortly.   If no further delays occur, a postponement of the
Closing Date of only one year will be necessary.
Cr. No. 337        Industrial Import; U.S. $50.0 Million Credit of
October 4., 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1973
Disbursement was completed in June, 1973.
