F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main objective was to assist participating LGUs in expanding and upgrading their
basic infrastructure, services and facilities and in strengthening their capacities in
municipal     governance,    investment     planning,     revenue-generation,      and     project
development and implementation. It would also enhance capabilities at the national level
to provide technical support and long-term financing to local government units through
the Municipal Development Fund.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal
Urban finance and development in the Philippines were characterized by four challenges: (a)
underdeveloped capital markets for LGU financing; (b) weak local capacity in delivering local
services and managing infrastructure projects; (c) limited local resource mobilization; and (d)
poorly organized information to monitor LGU fiscal and financial performance.

The Government, with Bank assistance, prepared the LGU Financing Framework (LFF) to
address these issues. The LFF was seen as a key instrument to address the financing challenges
faced by LGUs. It envisioned LGU financing to be provided by the private capital market rather
than by programs of National Government agencies. It also advocated for LGU financing
through market segmentation, along with a policy of "graduation" - lower-income and middle
income LGUs would access the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) for grants and loans and
gradually shifting towards Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) as their capacity improves
and then higher income LGUs would access private commercial finance.

The Local Government Finance and Development (LOGOFIND) Project was designed to
operationalize the LFF by reorienting and strengthening the MDF by: (i) enhancing its role in
helping resource-poor LGUs establish track records of credit-worthiness and improve their
capacities for planning, financial management and project management; (ii) supporting LGU
subprojects with social/environmental objectives that were considered non-bankable due to their
long gestation period and lack of identifiable revenue streams; (iii) strengthening MDF's
technical capacity to evaluate and monitor LGU credits and grants and oversee the
implementation of the LFF; and (iv) promoting direct access of LGUs to official development
assistance funding by providing MDF loans at market terms with technical assistance for project
preparation and capacity-building.

The MDF, created under the first Bank-financed Municipal Development Project (MDP1), was
implemented in 1984. MDP1 piloted the demand-driven approach to LGU financing. Subsequent
MDPs continued to provide LGUs with financing for infrastructure and supported the
strengthening of the administrative procedures of the MDF. LOGOFIND can be regarded as the
fourth in the series of MDPs. But this time, it is guided by the LFF. The Project, thus, intended to
bring together, in an integrated manner, the investment, capacity-building and policy reform
components of LGU lending.

The Government's decentralization thrust was supported by Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for the Philippines, which aimed at strengthening public policies and implementation
capabilities. LOGOFIND was seen as a key vehicle for sustaining the Bank's involvement in the
country's decentralization program. At the same time, it was considered an instrument for
introducing innovation and mainstreaming of lessons from global experience in municipal
finance in the Philippines.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The main development objective of the Project was to assist participating LGUs in expanding
and upgrading their basic infrastructure, services and facilities and in strengthening their
capacities in municipal governance, investment planning, revenue generation, and project



                                                  1

development and implementation. The Project was to also enhance capabilities at the national
level to provide technical support and long-term financing to local governments through the
MDF. The PDO presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) is worded differently in the
Loan Agreement.

The key performance indicators (KPIs) were: (i) 200 subprojects approved; (ii) 200 LGUs
trained; (iii) LGU credit rating system established by December 2000, fiscal information system
established by March 2002 and regular monitoring reports disseminated by 2002; (iv) 524 LGUs
participating in manual Real Property Tax Administration (RPTA), 200 LGUs in computerized
RPTA and 30 LGUs in Business Tax Enhancement (BTE); (v) the Municipal Development Fund
Office (MDFO) would have in-place new policies, procedures and operations manual by an
agreed specific date. The KPIs which should have been used to measure the achievements of the
Project in terms of its development objectives were not adequately defined at appraisal.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The PDOs were not revised but the KPIs were revised to take into account the reduction in the
loan amount of $40 million that resulted from the Project's slow implementation start-up. These
KPIs were also revised to better measure the progress of the Project in achieving its PDOs given
that the KPIs were not adequately designed in the PAD. While there was no formal agreement,
the Task Team and MDFO agreed to adopt the modified results framework.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries
The Project's target beneficiaries were LGU constituents (students, households, entrepreneurs,
and communities) requiring improved environmental and social infrastructure services and
facilities. The subproject financing component of the Project would target LGUs at the lowest
income classes (3rd through 6th). The Government of the Philippines (GOP) preparation team
estimated that about 200 LGUs would borrow for subprojects under the Project, and of this total,
180 would be from the 3rd to 6th income classes. These LGUs would also benefit from the
capacity-building program of the Project.

While not stated explicitly in the PAD, the Project would also benefit the National Government
by supporting its decentralization agenda. Technical assistance and equipment would be
provided to strengthen the capacity of the Department of Finance (DOF) through its two offices:
(a) MDFO to manage the financing facility for the lower income LGUs; and (b) Bureau of Local
Government Finance (BLGF) to monitor LGU fiscal and financial performance.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)
The Project had four components:
(a)     Component 1: LGU Subprojects (Original cost $95.7M ­ IBRD $77.1M and GOP
$18.6M) was to finance subprojects for the expansion, rehabilitation and improvement of basic
infrastructure, social and environmental services and facilities under LGU responsibility.
Financing under this component targeted LGUs in the 3rd through 6th income classes, LGUs in
the 1st and 2nd income classes could also access LOGOFIND funding on a case-by-case basis for
social and environmental subprojects.




                                                2

(b)    Component 2: LGU Training and Capacity Building (Original cost $8.2M ­ IBRD
$4.5M and GOP $3.7M) was to support LGU training and capacity-building for: (i) subproject
development and implementation; (ii) municipal planning, finance and management; (iii)
improved training modules and delivery mechanisms; and (iv) piloting of new programs.
(c)    Component 3: LGU Resource Mobilization and Monitoring (Original cost $16.5M -
IBRD $9.5M and GOP $7M) was to finance: (i) expansion of the RPTA Program to achieve
nationwide coverage; (ii) development and implementation of new initiatives to help LGUs
improve creditworthiness and revenue generation; and (iii) development and implementation of
systems to improve monitoring of LGU fiscal performance and local financial reporting and
disclosure.
(d)    Component 4: MDF Reorganization and Strengthening (Original cost $12.3M ­
IBRD $7.9M and GOP $4.4M) was to support the MDF reorganization and strengthening to
implement, on a phased basis, new institutional structures with new/streamlined procedures and
approvals, decentralized (field) operations, and contracting and training of management and
staff.

1.6    Revised Components
Several second and third level restructuring were undertaken that resulted in reduction in the
scope of project components. Key changes were as follows:
(a)    Cancellation of $40 million. June 21, 2001, Government requested the cancellation of
40% of the loan proceeds due to slow start-up resulting from weak initial organizational capacity
and impact of the Asian financial crisis on LGU borrowing at the start of the Project. The
financial crisis at that time affected the overall government fiscal position that in turn adversely
impacted on the transfers to LGUs. The ultimate effect in this context was the reluctance of
LGUs to carry out investments in municipal infrastructure. The entire amount cancelled was
taken out from Component 1.
(b)    Re-design of Component 3. During the May 2003 supervision mission, the Borrower and
the Task Team agreed to re-design component 3 to align the BLGF to its new role arising out of
the enactment of new laws and policies.

(c)     Reallocation of loan proceeds. The Borrower requested reallocation of proceeds
amounting to $3 million from Categories 2 (goods) and 3 (consultant services and training) to
Category 1 (subproject financing) in June 2006 to rectify the imbalance in terms of demand for
financing-- increasing demand for subproject financing and slow implementation of the LGU
Capacity-building and LGU Resource Mobilization components. Additional reallocation of loan
proceeds amounting to $3.3 million from Categories 2 and 3 to Category 1 was requested on
June 17, 2008 to respond further to the sustained demand for subproject financing and maximize
utilization of loan proceeds.

1.7     Other Significant Changes
Other significant changes include:
(a)   Adoption of the Modified Results Framework. KPIs for the PDOs were introduced and
intermediate outcome indicators were refined. This was informally agreed by the Task Team and
the Borrower in 2006 and the Borrower formally submitted the final Results Framework to the
Bank on March 3, 2008.
(b)   Utilization of exchange gains to fund additional subprojects. The Borrower requested to use
funds generated from the appreciation of the US dollar for five additional subprojects not
included in the initial list to be financed by the LOGOFIND during the loan extension period.
Work was completed by loan closing. This request was approved by the Regional Vice President
on December 29, 2008.
(c)   Loan extensions. The closing date of Project was extended from June 30, 2006 to June 30,
2008 to respond to the increased demand from LGUs for subproject financing. The second
extension (June 30, 2008-December 31, 2008) was requested to complete the 23 subprojects that
were on-going implementation at that time and other activities that were perceived to slip beyond
the June 30, 2008 loan closing date.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The QAG rated quality at entry as Satisfactory.

Background analysis for project preparation is sound. The problems in LGU capacity and
financing constraints to investments were properly identified and well-defined and the PAD
captured the essence of a number of related assessments of the devolution program. The
government was in transition, from national government-led to LGU-led service delivery policy.
The LFF tried to address the debates around the residual role of the National Government in the
financing and delivery of services at the local level, and the challenges of putting this into
motion motivated some of LOGOFIND's objectives and strategies. The background analysis was
considerably enhanced by the preceding policy work that went into the formulation of the LFF.
The LFF clearly defined what it seemed to be the efficient allocation of credit resources and
steered DOF interventions towards resource-poor LGUs.

The LOGOFIND Project was designed to continue the approach of the completed MDPs, i.e.,
expand and upgrade LGU capacity for service delivery at the local level by making municipal
finance readily available to interested LGUs. Project design benefited from the key lessons
offered by the review carried out by the OED, and enriched by its findings that include: (a) the
need for strong government commitment to the financial integrity of the intermediary's
operations; (b) the viability of any lending operation depends on the credit-worthiness of the
borrowers; and (c) the role of government-backed operations should be seen only as an interim
solution and should facilitate more direct relationship between the LGUs and the private markets.
These findings formed part of the innovation and broader reforms that the Project introduced and
aimed to achieve. The Project, however, did not fully consider the organizational challenges that
these proposed reforms would impose on DOF as the implementing agency that plays a role of
being both the policy oversight agency and key provider of loans and grants to LGUs in the
lower income classes.

Stakeholder participation was emphasized at project design and implementation. Subproject
identification and selection are vetted by municipal, provincial or city resolutions passed by
councils where the population at large is represented. To be eligible for project funding, the
activities proposed by LGUs would have to be part of local development plans that are
formulated though a consultative and participatory process.

Sufficient attention was also given to the fiduciary and safeguards requirements for Bank
projects. LGU subprojects to be supported by LOGOFIND were designed to be guided by
environmental and social assessment frameworks. Project management practices were to be
aligned with financial management and disbursement procedures acceptable to the Bank.

Project design is logical. The design of the Project had a logical structure of results. It was made
up of coherent project components that align well with government's strategic decision (laid out
in the LFF) to focus on LGUs belonging to the 3rd to 6th class categories and to support
investments with social and environmental benefits. This was consistent with the intention to
limit government intervention in the LGU credit market through a cost-sharing framework




                                                  5

between the National Government and LGUs that guided allocation of grants so as to
complement rather than undermine market-based financing.

The capacity of LGUs in the target market was typically weak in terms of managerial and
financial aspects, thus the need to provide assistance for capacity-building (component 2). The
Project envisaged tapping the resources of the Local Government Academy (LGA) and external
service providers. However, it departed from this approach when MDFO decided to provide
training through in-house consultants. The change in approach resulted in significant savings for
this component and helped significantly to increase the pipeline of well-prepared subproject
proposals.

Component 3 responded to a felt need by the National Government and was intended to finance
and implement the component to complete the coverage of all LGUs that were not reached by the
predecessor projects. The benefits were substantial to LGUs but for various reasons LGUs were
seen to be unable to pursue such investments without a push from the National Government. The
relevance of this component to the LFF was in its impact on the creditworthiness of LGUs and
the desired reduction in their dependence on National Government. This objective was, however,
lost when the Policy Governing Board (PGB) decided to deal with this as a lending operation in
order to forcefully implement the LFF. The shift from grant to loan caused a significant drop in
demand from LGUs which should have called for a downscaling of targets.

The component for MDF reorganization and strengthening (component 4) was appropriate as the
implementing agency was to assume the responsibility for the whole range of activities. It
focused its desired results, however, on the transformation of the MDFO into an autonomous
financial intermediary for LGUs. The legal and policy hurdles of the proposal to establish the
Municipal Finance Corporation (MFC) given the short timeframe were too great that
Government could not complete the transformation envisaged at design. But this result (or the
lack of it) was indicative of a gap in project design that could deal with high-level policy review
and reform in LGU financing. It is noted for instance that one of the PDO indicators was the
updating, monitoring and implementation of the LFF. Yet there was no engagement strategy or
an appropriate counterpart agency responsible for this. The PGB could have stepped up to fill
this role if the Project anticipated the need to transform it (from a governing board of the MDF)
into a policy coordination body for LGU financing.

Institutional and risk analyses were, however, inadequate when the Project was designed.
Preparation analysis is weak on the institutional arrangements for program implementation. The
Project adopted a structure for implementation that is based largely on earlier MDP operations
that were exclusively focused on LGU subprojects. The necessary shift in focus towards sound
institutional and policy arrangements for the implementation of the LFF was (and continues to
be) not adequately established. This places the MDFO in a difficult position where the success of
the "graduation" policy could mean the diminution of its share of the LGU credit market.

In addition, design was compromised by the very little attention paid to mitigating the
identified project risks. The PAD identified the following as moderate risks: (a) delays or
reversal by government in implementing the LFF, (b) lack of sustained government commitment
to strengthen and reorient the MDF, (c) inadequate demand from LGUs for subprojects, (d)



                                                   6

LGUs lack the capacity to prepare subprojects and benefit from the training and advice offered to
them, (e) turnover of elected officials and staff, and (f) reduction of the cost effectiveness and
timeliness of the MDF. While the Project correctly identified the relevant risks, the PAD did not
give sufficient explanation about the nature of these risks and was unable to provide sufficient
and effective mitigation strategies that could have been used to focus monitoring and supervision
of implementation.

Basic design requirements were also overlooked. The project results framework did not have
adequate KPIs, nor was an M&E system in place.

Project design is therefore unrealistic and ambitious. Expecting the MDFO to execute credit
operations and capacity building of 200 LGUs through the Project at the same time requiring it to
be instrumental in its own dissolution (at least from the viewpoint of shedding off its lending
functions) in a short timeframe seemed unrealistic. Again, this should have warranted a closer
assessment of institutional capacity of the implementing agency and another look at possible
approaches to simplify the Project by breaking it up into more manageable activities lining up to
meet singular rather than multiple objectives.

2.2    Implementation
The QAG assessed quality of supervision as Satisfactory.

Project implementation suffered from poor institutional preparation and mismatch of
implementation assignment in some of the project components. Implementation of the Project
was negatively affected by the inadequate preparation described in Section 2.1 and by the fact
that Government sought to proceed with new procedures under the LFF which meant developing
new implementation units/procedures than those envisaged by the Bank.

The ICR confirms the findings of QAG assessment on the inadequate capacity of the
implementing agency. The QAG review at supervision rated the project as unlikely to achieve its
objectives due to inadequate capacity of the implementing agency. This issue had not come up
prominently in the PAD because the Project was to continue the strategies and implementing
arrangements of past MDPs. Core staff would come from the same units of the DOF, BLGF,
LGA and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) that successfully implemented
previous MDPs and assisted in project preparation. This did not materialize, however, and the
slow process of constituting the PMO affected project performance in the first three years. The
preparatory work appeared to assume that the Project would be a "repeater" of the previous
MDPs, but in fact the Project assumed a larger role of developing the institutional capacity of
both the National Government and LGUs and their staff.

One key difference from earlier MDPs was the emphasis on subproject implementation as a
mechanism of learning-by-doing, particularly for lower income LGUs that had less experience in
this regard. Despite this shift in emphasis, inadequate attention was given to institutional and
human resource capacities which negatively affected implementation. Some of the critical tasks
required to do with subproject promotion appraisal and supervision were new and unfamiliar to




                                                 7

the MDFO.1 In addition, the shift to MDFO as implementing unit of component 2 from the LGA
also delayed subproject implementation-related training and the delivery of the capacity-building
program envisaged for LOGOFIND.

The first three components were by design intended to be provided to LGUs as internally
integrated interventions. The Capacity-building component was to prepare and assist the LGUs
in project development, implementation and sustainability; Subproject Lending component to
provide the funding for the municipal investment; and Resource Mobilization component to
enable the LGU to improve tax revenues in LGUs to pay off the investment, maintain or expand
infrastructure. The implementation including institutional arrangements did not seem to have
supported the intention. The expectation was for participating LGUs to have availed themselves
of assistance from the three components as a package to benefit from the synergy of the
outcomes. Most of the participating LGUs received either subproject financing and training, or
resource mobilization and training, or training only. Again, this is for most part a result of
fragmenting program implementation: component 1 was carried out by MDFO while component
3 was executed by BLGF. Component 2 was implemented both by MDFO and BLGF. Efficiency
was not achieved either as both DOF units tended to independently conduct their respective
marketing, appraisal and approval processes.

Lack of budget in MDFO was a recurrent problem, even more pronounced at start up when
the Government was in a chronic fiscal deficit situation. Having no budget for hiring the
Project Management Office (PMO) staff was a problem at start-up. Without a fully operational
PMO, the Project lost momentum built by the preceding MDPs, compounding the serious start
up setback when 12 of the 20 LGUs with completed proposals withdrew their applications for
sub-loans because of the slow process of subproject approval. Furthermore, because of
substantial delays in start up and unrealistic target of 200 LGUs, the Bank and GOP saw the need
to scale down the lending operation for LGU subprojects. Therefore, the Bank and GOP in 2001
agreed to cancel $40 million from component 1 only, leaving the allocations for the other three
components intact. Even as component 1 was scaled down, no corresponding adjustment was
made in the component targets. After reducing the loan amount for subprojects, it would appear
that the other components retained rather large resources for activities in relation to the overall
outcome of the Project. The Mid-term Review (MTR) could have been an opportunity to review
the extent of funding required by the other three components and to adjust the project targets.
Unfortunately, the MTR was not carried out because at the time that it was planned to be carried
out, the Project had just started to be fully operational. After much delay, the PMO was
expanded, reorganized and further strengthened to provide more efficient service to client LGUs,
especially for subproject processing. This became a major factor for the turnaround of the
project's performance after the project's first two years.

Delays in establishing the PMO, thereby, marketing the facility led to a slow build-up of
subprojects. Most subprojects were initiated four years after the MDFO became operational
(around 2004) and initial disbursement therefore remained low. Change in the terms of
LOGOFIND funding, tedious approval processes, and lack of LGU capacity to develop ready


1Under the MDP3, the MDFO was responsible only for subloan disbursements and collections.




                                                    8

proposals also contributed to a weak pipeline of subprojects. After a few years, the PMO sought
PGB approval to facilitate the processes by standardizing and simplifying requirements and
delegating approval authority to a Technical Review Committee and then later to a Management
Committee2, depending on the size of the loan application. This enabled the project to move
more quickly in the processing of subprojects and respond to the growing demand for
subprojects from LGUs.

Most participating LGUs had little or no demonstrated capacity in planning and implementing
development projects financed through loans. This lack of capacity was addressed by training
programs provided by the Project. The LGU capacity building component was delivered through
classroom-type training coupled with high-quality supervision and advice from the PMO to help
LGUs in implementing their subprojects in accordance with approved standards and guidelines.
Although this approach was deemed successful, the impact would have been greater had a
capability-building framework defining the content, delivery, institutional arrangements and
sustainability mechanisms was put in place at the onset of project implementation. This is
important since institutional development takes longer and more attention is needed to have
effective follow-up activities for scalability and sustainability.

The Project operated in unpredictable and changing environments. Implementation straddled
two governments, supervised by DOF under six Secretaries and an equal number of
Undersecretaries (who directly oversaw project implementation), three Project Managers, and
five Bank Task Team Leaders. These changes affected continuity and consistency of
interventions and commitments, in turn impacting on the pace of implementation. The change in
government in 2001 was critical as, at the time, the new administration did not appear to place
the implementation of this Project as a high priority and thus did not ensure adequate staffing
capacity of the implementing agency. In addition, the Project had to contend with a "re-enacted
budget"3. Adapting to such changes had forced the Task Team to focus on the day-to-day
requirements of ensuring that the activities are carried out. This approach, however, led to the
Team missing out on opportunities to re-think of the project as a whole, including conducting the
MTR that would have provided an exercise to review the relevance of the components, the
appropriateness of identified interventions and implementing agents.

At the local level, project implementation was also negatively affected by elections. LGU
decisions often change when new administration comes in. In some cases, the local chief
executive was unwilling to provide support for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of
revenue-generating subprojects which adversely affected subproject viability. In addition, some
LGUs initially resisted compliance with fiduciary and safeguards policies (especially
procurement and resettlement). However, the delivery of the mandatory training program,



2To "fast-track" approvals, the PGB delegated subproject approval to the MDFO-Technical Review Committee
(TRC) with an approval threshold of PhP15 million. The TRC was composed of technical staff (i.e., director level)
representing the various departments constituting the PGB. In 2006, PGB further delegated approval to the
Management Committee and increased approval threshold to PhP25 million. The Management Committee was
composed of MDFO Executive Director, BLGF Executive Director, and Project Manager of the concerned
subproject.
3The level of budget of the previous year was retained, leaving no room for spending for new activities (e.g.
additional subprojects for the project).


                                                         9

establishment of technical designs and standards for subprojects and close supervision of the
PMO and Task Team significantly built LGU awareness of the need to comply with the policies
and thus facilitated compliance.

But as the project gained momentum and proved its capacity to deliver useful support to LGU
development priorities, its profile improved and this resulted in better implementation
performance in the last few years of project implementation. On the supply side, the subproject
financing component was given particular prominence and subproject approvals, construction
and completion in much faster pace than in the first half of project life. On the demand side, the
successful implementation of the first batch of subprojects led other LGUs to express interest in
receiving support from the Project.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework was not well designed at appraisal. The
framework, as presented in the Program Design Summary of the PAD did not have adequate
indicators to monitor and evaluate its progress in achieving the PDOs. The PAD only provided


                                                        10

for intermediate outcome indicators some of which were later revised. The details of the M&E
framework including KPIs were refined and adjustments to the intermediate outcome indicators
were made in the middle of project life. The PMO initiated the establishment of an M&E system
using Excel-based databases to track the Project's progress in achieving the PDOs. Information
was generated through the subproject monitoring and completion reports submitted by the LGUs
to the PMO as well as back-to-office reports of PMO personnel during field visits. The large
number of LGUs participating in the Project and inadequate system of data collection and
analysis contributed to the delay in the provision of information on the KPIs. Building on the
LOGOFIND experience, the MDFO is currently improving its M&E system to adapt to the
requirements of its other financing facilities.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Environmental Safeguards and Social Safeguards. The Project complied with the
Bank's safeguards policies set forth in OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment). Procedures and
arrangements regarding safeguards were included in the updated Operations Manual. In addition,
training modules specifically on environmental management planning were developed and
delivered. Overall, the subprojects have not resulted in any significant adverse impact on the
environment during construction and early years of operation. The Project generally contributed
direct and indirect environmental benefits to the local communities and LGUs in terms of
improved health and well-being, protection of lives and property, preservation of natural wealth
and resource base, enhancement of economic activities, and reduced damages or rehabilitation
expenditures.

On the social safeguards, a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework was developed
and incorporated in the Operations Manual. In subprojects where OP 4.12 (Involuntary
Resettlement) was triggered, the Project generally followed the policies and procedures required
by the Operations Manual. In areas where indigenous peoples (IPs) are involved, the Project also
made adjustments in subproject designs to take into account the affected IP characteristics and
special needs. This was considered one of the best practices in this regard.

2.4.2 Financial Management (FM). The Project generally complied with the financial
covenants stated in the loan agreement but with recurrent delays. MDFO has a functioning FM
system, with adequate and skilled Finance and Administration staff handling the books of
accounts and accounting records. Separate books of accounts are maintained for the Project using
the New Government Accounting System (NGAS). The Project relied on NGAS' accounting and
reporting systems, supplemented by additional analysis, to provide FM reports. Overall, the FM
system had moderate shortcomings but these did not materially affect the system's capacity to
provide timely and reliable information for the management and monitoring of the Project. The
FM system was adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the Bank loan proceeds were
being used for the intended purposes.

2.4.3 Procurement. The Project generally complied with the specified procurement procedures,
both at the national and local levels. At the national level, there was no major procurement issues
recorded. At the local level, however, the Project encountered a number of challenges: (a) LGUs
are not familiar with the World Bank procurement Guidelines; (b) difficulties and delays in the
preparation of the standard bidding documents due largely to LGU lack of capacity to develop



                                                  11

detailed engineering designs and the bill of quantities; (c) MDFO did not have standards for
evaluating the reasonableness of bids given that there was no cost ceiling, thus, evaluation
became a tedious process; (d) considerable number of failed bids (therefore requiring re-bids that
magnified delays in subproject implementation); and (e) in many instances, few number of
bidders participating in the procurement process even if packages were advertised nationwide.
Yet, notwithstanding the desire to speed up procurement and pressure from local officials to
expedite bid awards, the Project did not compromise the integrity of procurement process. The
procurement training provided by the Project and close supervision of the PMO and the Task
Team significantly helped resolve issues before they became serious.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Towards the end of the Project, GOP contemplated a second LOGOFIND to build on the positive
experiences gained by the Project and to respond to increasing demand for subproject funding.
However, the lack of significant progress in policy reforms, particularly the transformation of the
MDFO to a corporate entity and other on-going reforms (e.g., performance based grants system
for LGUs) were key considerations that led the Bank not to continue the dialogue on the proposal.
Notwithstanding, Government continues to provide subproject financing to LGUs out of the
MDF (estimated at $278 million) and through several financing windows established with
support from other development partners.

The CAS recognizes the importance of the Bank continuing to engage in the dialogue with
Government regarding the development of an LGU credit system. A more comprehensive
program of capacity-building and technical assistance for project formulation and
implementation is needed to pursue the reforms not completed under LOGOFIND. In addition,
the Bank should consider developing a follow-on operation, focusing on resource mobilization in
LGUs to build on the achievements realized in the areas of real property taxes and business taxes.

The sustainability of the systems financed by the Project is likely because MDFO required the
LGUs to enact local ordinances regarding the O&M of the subprojects financed by the Project.
MDFO also encouraged participating LGUs to forge partnerships with various private and public
institutions (e.g., private sector, Department of Health, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation
(PhilHealth), Local School Boards, Department of Education, parents-teachers associations, etc)
for the implementation and maintenance of the subprojects.

MDFO intends to use the training modules developed and used under LOGOFIND in the
delivery of capacity building activities included in other lending operations. In addition, BLGF is
committed to expand the LGU Resource Mobilization and Performance Monitoring program and
is requesting the Bank to help in the development and implementation of an expanded program.
A project concept paper has been informally shared by BLGF with the Bank.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The Project was designed and approved in 1999. The project design and objectives remained
relevant throughout implementation and continue to support government's decentralization
program and the participation of low-income LGUs in the credit market. The PDO remains
consistent with the 2005 CAS, a major pillar of which is to support replicable successes in



                                                12

delivering public services and improving institutions at the local level. Further, discussions
regarding the preparation of the 2010 CAS retain the focus on supporting LGUs to improve
service delivery including the development of a performance and capacity building framework
encompassing revenue mobilization, planning and budgeting, and local service delivery.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Achievement of the first PDO of expanding basic infrastructure services and facilities of the
participating LGUs is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The total number of households estimated
to benefit from the 133 subprojects stood at 1.05 million, registering 160% increase from the
revised target of 653,000. Households from 3rd to 6th class LGUs should account for half of all
household beneficiaries and actual achievement is 100% of the target.

Achievement of the second PDO of strengthening LGUs' capacity in municipal governance,
investment planning, revenue generation and project development and implementation is rated
Satisfactory. Based on KPIs, the Project achieved four out of the five established KPIs, as
follows: (a) 51% of the 579 LGUs trained to develop the Local Revenue Code (LRC) actually
implemented their approved LRCs, exceeding the target of 40%; (b) LGUs participating in
component 3 achieved the 75% increase in RPTA collection; (c) revenue collection of all
participating LGUs increased by 67% compared to the target of 40%; and (d) 94% of the total
number of LGUs regularly submit SIE reports on an annual basis exceeding the target of 90%.
The Project partially achieved its target of increasing the proportion of the own-source revenue
to total revenue by 40%. The rate of increase could not catch up with the substantial increase in
internal revenue allotment (IRA) and the weak taxing powers and tax base of low-income LGUs.
The net effect of the increased local revenues to total revenues of participating LGUs only
accounted for 2% increase from the baseline.

Achievement of the third PDO of enhancing national capacity to provide technical support and
long-term financing to LGUs through the MDF is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Based on
original targets, processing time for subproject approval was substantially reduced from 19
months at the start of the Project (2000) to 3-6 months when the Project gained momentum.
Similarly, fund disbursement was reduced from 14 days to five days, registering a reduction rate
of 64%. On the reform side, the Project aimed at transforming the MDFO into a sustainable
financial intermediary for local government finance. The reform is to be realized through a two-
stage process: (i) creation and strengthening of MDFO, followed by (ii) "spinning off" of the
MDFO into a financial institution. The first stage was fully completed while the second stage
was carried out by the Project, i.e., a Municipal Finance Corporation (MFC) was created by a
Presidential Executive Order and incorporated under the Securities and Exchange Commission,
but was found to have legal infirmities and was therefore not sanctioned to operate.

Based on the revised targets, LOGOFIND also showed significant achievements in the third
PDO, as manifested by the following: (a) 119% of the target number of 462 LGUs accessing
long-term financing through the MDFO was achieved; and (b) 104% of the 405 3rd to 6th class
LGUs accessing long-term financing through the MDFO was also achieved. Work to update is
on-going based on the inputs generated from the LFF Conference held in 2007 and the Philippine
Development Forum Working Group on Decentralization and Local Government. Government
inter-agency working group has been established to monitor its implementation and impact on



                                                13

LGU borrowing patterns. As the LFF has been formally adopted by DOF, its implementation is
being supported through the Working Group.

Overall achievement of the PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Eight of the 10 KPIs were
fully met.

The achievements of the Project per component are presented below.

Component 1: LGU Subprojects (Original cost $95.7M, Actual cost $55.7M ­ IBRD $46M
and GOP $9.7M). Moderately Satisfactory. The Project was a major source of LGU
infrastructure financing especially for the 3rd to 6th class LGUs. The Project financed 133 LGU
subprojects: 48 education subprojects ($15.8 million), 28 health subprojects ($6.6 million), 34
environmental subprojects ($16.9 million), 17 revenue generating ($5.2 million) and six other
subprojects (e.g., heavy equipment, project preparation consultancy ($1.4 million)). It achieved
67% of the original target of 200 LGU subprojects and 128% of the revised target of 104. The
Project also substantially exceeded its end-of-project targets in KPI 1 and KPI 2 (refer to
discussion above). Actual disbursements were above the revised amount as loan proceeds were
reallocated in the later stages of the Project.

Component 2: LGU Training and Capacity-Building (Original cost $8.2M, Actual cost
$2.7M ­ IBRD $2.5M and GOP $0.2M). Satisfactory. The Project exceeded by six-fold its end-
of-project target of training 200 LGUs. It trained a combined total of 1,033 LGUs under the
MDFO and BLGF "mandatory" and "demand-driven" programs. Under the MDFO administered
mandatory program, the Project supported a total of 345 LGUs in improving key areas of project
development and implementation including logical framework formulation, procurement,
environmental management financial management, construction supervision, participatory
monitoring, subproject completion report development and subproject sustainability. Another
862 LGUs also received training from BLGF on resource mobilization, fiscal and financial
monitoring. In addition to the progress made in revenue generation, the ICR team assessed
additional outcomes: (a) approximately 30% of the 345 LGUs that participated in the mandatory
training program successfully implemented their priority infrastructure investments; and (b)
LOGOFIND training also helped LGUs prepare a useful tool for monitoring fiscal and financial
performance and investment planning. The high rate of compliance in the submission of
Statement of Income and Expenditure (SIE) reports indicate that LGUs are on track in improving
their capacity for investment planning.

Component 3: LGU Resource Mobilization and Performance Monitoring (Original cost
$16.5M, Actual cost $4.1M ­ IBRD $3.4M and GOP $0.7M). Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
Project supported 71 programs to expand RPTA and five BTE subprojects. However, the Project
did not fully utilize the component budget and was unable to reach the target of 524 RPTA
subprojects set at appraisal due to policy changes governing eligibility criteria for participating
LGUs and cost-sharing between National Government and LGUs, and from competition with
other financing facilities. However, an additional 254 LGUs implemented RPTA using other
sources of financing.




                                                 14

The Project also facilitated the establishment of the BLGF's system for monitoring fiscal
performance and supported efforts by BLGF to design and issue SIE. SIE indicators were
developed and reports are regularly disseminated to LGUs, national government agencies and
development institutions. The SIE reports are now the main source of data on LGU financial
performance for use by policy makers and researchers in monitoring trends in local public
expenditures management and financing and related issues. BLGF also uses it to monitor
indebtedness and ensure that LGUs stay below the 20% debt cap set in the law. In addition,
LOGOFIND supported the conduct of a BLGF re-engineering study to assess the institutional
and organizational requirements of this DOF bureau in relation to its mandate and evolving role
in LGU financing. However, DOF decided to subsume the recommendations under the
government's long-running Rationalization Program. Actual changes in functions, structures and
staffing under the program have yet to be initiated.

Component 4: MDF Reorganization and Strengthening (Original cost $12.3M, Actual cost
$5.1M ­ IBRD $4.3M and GOP $0.8M). Moderately Satisfactory. The first phase of
reorganizing and strengthening of the MDFO was fully completed. MDFO became operational.
It has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the MDF. It also continues to provide
financing services to assist LGUs in the delivery of basic services and other development
projects by opening new lending windows using MDF Second Generation Funds and other
external sources and used the processes and techniques for credit allocation and subproject
promotion developed under LOGOFIND. The second phase which required the transformation of
the MDFO into the MFC, however, was not achieved because of legal impediments not foreseen
at formulation of the executive branch issuance creating the MFC. In view of this development,
DOF decided to pursue other means of reinforcing the institutional backbone for LGU finance
provision. One such means was the DOF-Change Management Team Resolution adopted on
December 2, 2008 calling for the spin-off of the MDFO from a unit under the Office of the DOF
Secretary into a separate entity (a full line bureau, lined up as an organic unit in the formal
structure of the DOF), with such entity envisioned to enjoy more permanency and assurances of
sustained budget allocation for staff and operations. Another measure is the issuance of
Executive Order No. 742 in 2008 providing the MDFO resources to carry out its operation
effectively. Finally, MDFO has revised the LOGOFIND Operations Manual that it now adopted
as the MDFO Operations Manual in its administration of other funding facilities managed by
DOF.

3.3    Efficiency
At appraisal, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) of the entire
Project were estimated at 17% and PhP802 million, respectively. The ICR estimates that the
ERR of the entire Project at 35% and the NPV at PhP71.9 million. While both B/C analyses used
the same methodology, some caution should be observed in the comparison of the two ERRs
because of the different set of subprojects used for analysis at appraisal and at ICR. In addition,
at appraisal, it was envisioned that the interventions of the Project for the LGUs would come as a
package (i.e., each LGU subproject would consist of investment, training and resource
mobilization). As implemented, LGUs only received either subproject financing and training, or
resource mobilization and training, or training only. Therefore, it is more appropriate to compare
the ERR at the subproject level where costs and benefits can be properly imputed.




                                                 15

The average ERR at ICR for specific types of subprojects are as follows: health (29%), education
(51%) and environmental (44%). These values are higher than the ERR of 27%, 40% and 24%
computed at subproject appraisal, respectively. For revenue-generating subprojects, the average
Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) at ICR was computed at 8% which is substantially
lower compared to the FIRR of 18% computed at subproject appraisal and 30% at Project
appraisal. The low FIRR of revenue-generating subprojects can be attributed to lower benefits
than projected due to: (i) fees not being implemented as agreed, (ii) poor or lack of enforcement
of municipal ordinances that created adverse impact on the viability of operations, (iii) low
utilization rate or occupancy of the facilities, and (iv) change in priorities of the new local
administration as a result of election. In general, the high ERR of subprojects and Project as a
whole showed that the use of resources was efficient. The ERR/FIRR of subprojects remained
robust when subjected to sensitivity analysis (see Annex 3).

3.4.    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating - Moderately Satisfactory
The overall outcome of the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The development
objectives of LOGOFIND remain relevant to GOP's priorities and are consistent with the Bank's
current and planned CAS. The Project showed significant achievements toward its development
objectives. LOGOFIND achieved the first PDO based on the revised KPIs. It facilitated access of
1.05 million households (160% of the revised target) to basic environmental and social
infrastructure and services. It achieved 67% of the original target of 200 LGU subprojects and
128% of the revised target. The Project also satisfactorily achieved its second PDO as the targets
were achieved for most KPIs. It also delivered satisfactorily a capacity-building program that
covered 517% of the original target of 200 LGUs trained. LOGOFIND, however, only partially
achieved the third PDO. MDFO was established and is fully functional but its transformation
into a corporate entity was not achieved. Overall disbursement is 95% of the revised amount and
57% of the original. Finally, the Project showed that, in general, the use of resources was
efficient.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty alleviation was considered an indirect objective of the Project. The Project was designed
to target 3rd to 6th class LGUs whose incidences of poverty were higher than the national average.
Poor families were thus expected to benefit through access to the infrastructure and services,
mainly social and environmental, financed by the Project. The Project did not conduct a poverty
analysis at appraisal or during the ICR. While the Project did not also conduct any gender
analysis at appraisal, the relatively equal gender distribution among the beneficiaries resulted
from gender sensitivity mechanisms put in place and applied during the subproject design, social
assessment, appraisal and implementation phases. As a result the Gender and Development
(GAD) assessment conducted by the Bank in 2008 considered the Project as gender-responsive.
The Project was also seen as having contributed to the development of the GAD plan for the
Department of Finance in 2004.

The Project's requirement that LGUs' proposed investments be supported by local council
resolutions also have contributed to better stakeholder awareness and participation in decision
making. Obtaining the council's resolution required consultations with primary beneficiaries and
affected groups. This requirement was generally adhered to by LGUs during implementation
although the quality and extent of these consultations varies across LGUs.


                                                16

(b)     Institutional Strengthening
Institutional strengthening occurred at the local and national levels. At the local level, the
learning-by-doing approach was instrumental in strengthening the capacity of LGUs to plan,
develop and implement subprojects. LGU staff were trained in project development and
implementation including logical framework planning, detailed engineering and design, social
and environmental safeguards, procurement and financial management, and construction
supervision. Through the training conducted by the BLGF, LGU capacity to mobilize resources,
prepare and monitor their own fiscal and financial performance was also strengthened.

At the national level, the DOF established a new agency- the MDFO, and restructured the BLGF.
The MDFO has developed the capacity to allocate credit resources to 3rd to 6th class LGUs that
have substantial financing needs. Through the loans channeled through MDFO, the DOF has
helped these LGUs build good credit records and develop project management skills that enable
them to tap credit resources from the private and government capital markets. This is crucial to
the government's devolution program because it promotes local autonomy in planning and
allocating local public expenditures as envisaged by the Local Government Code. The BLGF's
role in monitoring local public sector fiscal and financial performance was also enhanced by the
development of a reliable and internally consistent information system for LGU receipts and
expenditures.

(c)     Other unintended impacts
There are unintended outcomes resulting from the Project, as follows:
1.    Because of the demonstrated capacity of LGUs to prepare and implement projects under
the LOGOFIND, they were able to mobilize additional resources from the provincial
governments and congressmen. The LGUs used these additional resources either for equity on
the subprojects and/or for ancillary facilities and investments.
2.    In conjunction with the health projects of LOGOFIND, the subprojects provided an
opportunity for participating LGUs to implement health insurance coverage for their constituents
by linking up with PhilHealth. This link contributed to sustainable operations of the health
facilities and to the improved health of the LGU constituents.
3.     For the environmental protection, the subprojects contributed to increasing local incomes
from real property and business taxes due to the stability created in previously at- risk areas, and
in cases involving resettlement, these subprojects even provided better living conditions to
affected communities that are relocated to resettlement areas.
4.    Computerization of resource mobilization efforts was found useful for other LGU functions
such as land use and physical planning.
5.    LOGOFIND was instrumental in the global piloting of the Design-Build- Operate scheme
which involves greater private sector participation in solid waste investments. The scheme is not
being adopted by other LGUs in the Philippines and elsewhere.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Please refer to Annex 6.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The risk to maintaining the Development Objectives is rated moderate. Subprojects generally
had sound technical design and were constructed with standard quality. In addition, the



                                                  17

participatory approach in selecting subprojects and the requirement for counterpart (equity)
funds promoted a strong sense of ownership of the subprojects among participating LGUs. Based
on the ICR findings during the site visits, various types of arrangements and partnerships were
forged between LGUs, national government agencies and other stakeholder groups to operate
and maintain the subprojects and were sustained even after subproject completion. LOGOFIND
also ensured that LGUs were well informed of various ways of maintaining and operating
subprojects by providing training on subproject sustainability. Sustainability of development
outcomes, however, can be affected by: (i) changes in administration at the local level that could
result in the new mayor being unwilling to provide maintenance support for subprojects or
abandon the subprojects altogether; (ii) lenient enforcement of local ordinances required by the
Project to protect the integrity of structures, impose market fees and charges, and enforce other
plans attached to the subproject such as transport plans; (iii) the quality of institutional
arrangements (and corresponding commitment) put in place during the operational phase; and
(iv) low FIRR for revenue-generating subprojects.

The effect of training on organizational development of the LGUs is likely to be sustainable. The
training activities that were sought by LGUs ensured that they would be able to comply with
Project rules, processes and reporting requirements. Based on ICR findings, most of the LGUs
also apply the knowledge learned from training in the development and implementation of
subprojects financed through own-source funds or through other donor support.

At the national level, GOP remains committed to supporting its decentralization agenda. DOF
formally adopted the LFF in 2007 and thus, it is still seen to provide the overall policy guidance
for LGU development. The continued support of GOP to the LFF is evident with the continuing
operation of the MDFO after loan closing. Government also issued Executive Order No. 742 in
2008 directing the MDFO-PGB to further enhance the function of the MDFO and restructure the
organization for its effective operation and administration and adopt policies for the collection of
fees and charges needed to defray its operation and administrative expenses.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1     Bank Performance
(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry - Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Team attempted to incorporate the results and recommendations of previous policy studies
and the lessons of previous MDPs into the project design. The design was responsive to the
needs of LGUs and consistent with the GOP decentralization agenda. However, preparation and
appraisal for program implementation were weak. The Bank appraisal team generally assumed
that the institutional arrangements adopted by previous MDPs would continue to work well
under LOGOFIND and did not fully assess the institutional impacts and requirements of the LFF.
Hence, the team failed to provide sound advice on the appropriate institutional arrangements for
implementing both the Project and the LFF. While the Team correctly identified the risks,
measures to mitigate them were not identified. Further, the PDOs were not consistently presented
in the PAD and the loan agreement, and KPIs were not developed to monitor the Project's
progress in achieving its development objectives.




                                                 18

(b)     Quality of Supervision - Moderately Satisfactory
The QAG review of quality of supervision (2002) rated the performance as satisfactory. As
noted by QAG, performance suffered from long delays in signing and effectiveness, insufficient
staffing of the PMO, slow initiation of implementation, and MDFO having to act as fund
channeling mechanism, for other projects. QAG also concluded that: (i) the Task Team made
the right decision of focusing on the critical issue of establishing adequate implementation
capacity at MDFO and enable it to launch the investment program; (ii) supervision of fiduciary
and safeguards aspects was carried out satisfactorily; and (iii) supervision inputs and processes
were adequate.

The Task Team was proactive in addressing implementation issues and sought alternative
approaches to solve them. Project supervision missions were conducted twice yearly with good
communications with Government between missions. These missions were adequately staffed,
with each mission, on average, comprising urban development, fiduciary, social and
environmental safeguards specialists. However, the failure to carry out a MTR of the Project as
planned was a missed opportunity especially considering that US$40 million of the loan was
cancelled shortly after a new administration took office in 2001. While the team was successful
in working with Government to develop a set of KPIs and an effective M&E system, the final
Results Framework was only submitted to the Bank in 2008. Finally, the fact that the Bank had
five different team leaders made developing an effective dialogue with Government and
consistent implementation plans very difficult.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance - Moderately Satisfactory
The rating for quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory while the rating for quality of
supervision was rated as moderately satisfactory. Since the overall project outcome is in the
satisfactory range, the ICR Guidelines indicate that the Bank's overall performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance
(a)     Government Performance - Moderately Satisfactory
Government strongly supported the Project during preparation and appraisal. During
implementation, it sustained its efforts to improve the policy framework for LGU finance (e.g.,
updating of LFF) and remained committed to facilitate LGU access to financing. The complexity
of project design and very high expectations for reform were not matched by the level of
decision-making established for resolving reform issues. For instance, the transformation of
MDFO into a separate entity (outside of DOF) had to be dealt by DOF largely and was not
subject to broader consensus building mechanism. Yet, the government persistently pursued the
reforms, with the leadership issuing an Executive Order to create the institution that the Project
aimed for. The change in administration in 2001 did see some wavering in support for the Project
and for MDFO. But after that, support to the objectives of the Project, particularly in providing
funding for municipal investments, skills upgrade and in the reform in MDFO remained steadfast.
In addition, while the DOF strongly supported the Project, the lack of sufficient budget
significantly affected the ability of MDFO to maintain its staff and for BLGF in implementing
activities to help LGUs improve their tax enhancement programs, although the budget problem
was borne by the fiscal position at the time and not because of lack of commitment to the Project.



                                                19

The legal impediments faced in operationalizing the MFC were being addressed by considering a
shift in strategy, i.e., initiating the drafting of a legislation to create the LGU financial institution.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance - Moderately Satisfactory
MDFO performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The MDFO was strongly committed to
achieve the PDOs. It generally complied with the fiduciary, social and environmental safeguards
specified in the Operations Manual. It initiated changes in the project operations to improve
implementation efficiency such as developing minimum design standards for common
infrastructure and raising the threshold for MDFO approval of subprojects. It also pursued
innovative means of securing the required budgetary allocation to ensure timely release of funds
for on-going LGU subprojects, despite fiscal constraints facing program implementation
government-wide. Issues related to the number and qualifications of staff, however, were a
recurrent theme. There were also some procedural flaws as far as certain project design
requirements were concerned. These include the decision by the PGB to extend LOGOFIND
resources as full loans (instead of grants) under component 3 (as agreed during appraisal).

BLGF performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. BLGF showed a commitment to achieving
the PDOs during preparation and appraisal. Given the successful implementation of the RPTA
programs under the previous projects, BLGF demonstrated readiness to implement the proposed
program. However, the new institutional arrangements introduced by the Project weakened its
accountability which resulted in an unclear assignment of tasks. While BLGF was instrumental
in the development of LGU fiscal performance monitoring system and delivery of training on
resource mobilization to about half of the LGUs nationwide, however, it provided less focus on
the implementation of the RPTA program.

LGUs. LGU performance is rated Satisfactory. The Project involved 165 LGUs (counting those
that implemented infrastructure and resource mobilization subprojects only). LGU performance,
in terms of quality of subprojects chosen, commitment, ability to implement and sustain the
supported investments, and compliance with project requirements, including fiduciary and
safeguard requirements, varies widely across LGUs. The LGUs selected much needed
investment subprojects, sanctioned by their respective councils. Commitment was strong.
Though many LGUs initially lacked the capacity to develop and implement these subprojects,
their skills have been upgraded through the training supported by LOGOFIND, especially as the
training activities are carried out in conjunction with the implementation of their subprojects (or
bolstered by the learning-by-doing approach of the project). There is general compliance with
project rules even if there was initial resistance (specifically regarding procurement and
resettlement policies).

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance - Moderately Satisfactory
On the basis of justification provided above, overall borrower performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned
The following lessons may be considered in shaping the design and implementation of future
projects of similar nature in the Philippines as well as other countries in the region:




                                                      20

(a)     An Adaptable Policy Loan (APL) would be a more appropriate instrument to
support the reform process aimed at improving the provision of LGU finance. The reforms
and institution building envisaged under LOGOFIND required time and sustained dialogue
within government. GOP and the Bank would have benefited from phased program, with a series
of loans funding activities but approved sequentially as progress of implementation of reforms
are made. Through APL, adjustments can be made as the reforms are carried out, unlike with the
regular investment lending. In the case of LOGOFIND, the attempt was to complete a rather
package of reforms that proved to be unrealistic given the institutional, economic and political
circumstance and the short timeframe for implementation. If it were pursued through an APL,
the first phase could have addressed the institutional and capacity requirements of the MDFO as
the implementing agency. The succeeding loans could have then covered the next phases of
MDFO reorganization and transformation into a separate entity. In this way, the institutions and
agencies that are assigned the responsibility for overseeing the reform process could also be
assisted and strengthened while allowing them to implement the reform agenda and they would
be more prepared to deal with more complex institutional reforms requiring actions like creation
of municipal financial entities.

(b)     Project design and desired outcomes should be kept realistic and achievable in an
environment where institutional capacity is established to be wanting, In line with the
suggested progressive implementation of reforms, project design should be kept simple,
preferably avoiding multiple objectives and the size of operations in the level that the agencies
can manage. The Project, while featuring innovative and pioneering activities, proved to be too
complex to be carried out at the time when several institutional issues were still being addressed.
It is necessary to carry out a careful assessment of institutional readiness of the agencies before
project implementation. Inadequate attention at preparation given to assessing DOF and LGUs
capacity resulted in high opportunity costs as benefits from the loan started to accrue only after
more than three years of implementation. The Bank could have made the creation and adequate
staffing of a project implementing unit a condition for loan effectiveness and these could have
helped ensure smooth transition from project preparation and appraisal to implementation.

Municipal funds projects should also continue to support sustained LGU capacity building. But
such projects should at the outset define the content, delivery mechanisms, institutional
arrangements, M&E system and sustainability mechanisms of the capacity-building components.
It should also promote the use of information communications technology (e.g. in distance
learning programs) to scale up the capacity-building activities particularly given the large
number of LGUs in the Philippines and their geographical spread. Participation of the
association of LGUs (i.e. the leagues of local governments) should be encouraged in the
identification and design of the training programs to ensure relevance and usefulness of delivered
training activities. Developing a national strategy for LGU capacity-building will also be very
helpful.

Grants can also be extended to encourage LGUs to perform better or "reward" those LGUs that
are already functioning well. This performance-based approach for funding provision would
have to feature capacity enhancement component to allow lagging LGUs to participate in such
programs.




                                                21

(c)     Funding support to LGUs should be viewed comprehensively and in overall context
of broader fiscal transfer policies. Efforts to increase own source revenues by LGUs must be
tied to a broader government program on local government finance. While many local officials
recognize the benefits of raising taxes to improve their own-source revenue position, they are
reluctant to do so because of perceived political costs associated with any additional taxes. And
if the fiscal environment also allows for increased transfers from the national government
(through the IRA process), any effort to encourage LGUs to increase own source revenues (such
as Component 3 of LOGOFIND) can be undermined. Design of municipal finance projects
should take this into account. National Government is also encouraged to calibrate policies to
encourage LGUs to exhaust all possibilities for raising local revenues.

(d)     Municipal finance projects should encourage development and implementation of
innovative projects. So far, financing has largely flowed to traditional infrastructure subprojects
(such as public markets, school buildings, etc). Due to lack of technical expertise, limited
financial capacity, and the risk-averse and inward-looking nature of many LGUs, traditional
infrastructure dominated the LOGOFIND portfolio. Investments in inter-LGU infrastructure such
as roads and bridges that enhance connectivity and production logistics for example have not
been encouraged. Such investments provide the scale for efficient service provision and possibly
even pooling of resources among poor LGUs and enable them to implement projects. The
institutional and capacity requirements should be taken into account or be part of the innovation.
Offering grants for these innovative activities can encourage LGUs to implement them.

(e)     LGU investment decisions are highly sensitive to the availability of "soft" loans and
grants. Quality of local government services is therefore greatly determined by the architecture
of financing created by projects such as LOGOFIND. The loan-grant-equity mix adopted by the
project that favored low-income class LGUs and social and environmental projects saw a large
proportion of project funds supporting construction of school buildings, health clinics, hospitals
and flood control infrastructure. Some LGUs maximized the availability of grant funding from
LOGOFIND and built a number of schools simultaneously, an investment decision that would
otherwise be cautiously taken, if at all, if such funding is not made available. (School building is
also a national government responsibility but the concessional funding availability encouraged
many LGUs to implement massive school construction activities, leading to increased enrolment
and cohort survival rates in those LGUs.) In contrast, the vacillation in extending grant funding
to modernize LGU tax systems has delayed implementation of computerization of business and
real property tax collection systems that would have improved the financial conditions in many
interested LGUs. Project design of future municipal finance projects will benefit from analyzing
the benefits and impacts of various financing schemes for LGUs, setting clear indicators for
assessing outcomes from the projects that are to be supported by such financing arrangements,
and the overall impact of the desired financing mechanisms in the fiscal position of National
Government if these were to be carried out on scaled up basis.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
Borrower/implementing agencies:       The Borrower's/implementing agency assessment of the

through strategies, innovations, and policies. Future LGU credit-financing projects need to learn
from the diverse lessons learned in LOGOFIND implementation, build on the initial successes of
the Project and work on developing capital markets accessible to LGUs in all income classes.

                               Annex 3. Economic Analysis

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not have precise estimates of economic and
financial rates of return for the Project inasmuch as investments were to be demand
driven and there were no pre-identified subprojects at appraisal. However, benefits were
estimated using as proxy a sample of similar type of subproject investments in previous
municipal development projects; project costs include subproject investments as well as
training, resource mobilization and technical assistance. The Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) of the entire Project at appraisal were estimated at
17% and P804.2 million, respectively. At the subproject level, the PAD estimated the
ERR of subprojects based on average rates of return. ERRs varied depending on type of
subprojects, as follows: markets (30%), bus terminals (27%), slaughterhouses (35%),
roads (49%), traffic management (41%), shore protection (45%) and sanitation facilities
(19%). No ERR was computed for social subprojects, e.g., school buildings and health
centers.

Adopting the same cost and benefit methodology used at appraisal, the Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) estimates that the ERR and NPV of the entire
Project are 35% and P71.9 million, respectively. The computed ERR is substantially
higher than the 17% estimated at appraisal due to higher stream of benefits accrued from
social and environmental projects, which comprise almost 80% of the total subproject
cost (or approximately 60% of the total Project cost). Caution, however, should be
applied in comparing the two ERRs because of the different menu of subprojects used in
the two computations. In addition, at appraisal, it was envisioned that the interventions of
the Project for the local government units (LGUs) would come as a package (i.e., each
LGU subproject would consist of investment, training and resource mobilization). As
implemented, LGUs only received either subproject financing and training, or resource
mobilization and training, or training only. Therefore, it is more appropriate to compare
the ERRs at the subproject level where costs and benefits can be properly imputed.

Recognizing that the demand-driven approach would result in different sets and types of
subprojects, the Local Government Finance & Development (LOGOFIND) Project
required that each proposals for subproject financing should provide a computation of
that subproject Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and/or ERR. At loan closing, the
Project funded 133 subprojects under component 1: 13% of which are revenue-generating,
57% social and, 25%, environmental subprojects. For the ICR, a sample of 14 subprojects
was chosen, representing all sub-sectors covered by the Project. The sample includes four
school buildings, three health centers, four environmental subprojects, and three public
markets. Under component 3, a sample of eight subprojects (from a total of 76 Real
Property Tax Administration (RPTA) and Business Tax Enhancement (BTE) subprojects),
is used as the basis for the economic analysis.

The ERR (for non-revenue generating) and FIRR (for revenue generating) of the sample
subprojects were re-computed using the same cost and benefit methodology, and the
results are to be called the ERR and FIRR at ICR. Project costs included actual



                                            29

investment costs, training cost, and updated operation and maintenance (O&M) costs
based on the initial years of operation of the facility. Investment cost was converted to
economic cost by deducting taxes and duties assumed to be 10% and applying the
shadow price of foreign exchange on the foreign component of the subproject where
appropriate. Majority of the subprojects in the sample involved new facilities/services
where there was none previously or where service levels were very low and therefore all
costs were considered incremental. In cases where there were existing services and the
subproject sought to improve or upgrade these services to a higher level, only incremental
costs were included. For example, in the case of a school building that replaced an old
school, salaries of teachers already employed were not included, only incremental costs
for O&M.

The identification and estimation of benefits were based on previously prepared
subproject appraisal reports approved by Municipal Development Fund Office's
(MDFO's) Policy Governing Board. Data was updated as necessary. `With' and `without'
project scenario analysis was then conducted. Flows were discounted at 15%, the social
discount rate used by the government, to estimate the NPV and ERR. Subprojects were
expected to provide benefits for at least 15 years for investments and 6 years for resource
mobilization subprojects. The detailed economic analysis of the sample subprojects can
be found in the full-length version of the LOGOFIND ICR Report filed in the IRIS.

Benefits come from reduced cases of morbidity and mortality and savings on laboratory
fees. Without the project, it was assumed that patients would have paid higher laboratory
fees in private health clinics. Costs included investment cost, training cost and operating
costs (i.e., personnel services (PS), maintenance & other operating expenses (MOOE)
and insurance costs). Adjustments in the estimation were made to take into account the
updated population projection.

The sample health subprojects are economically viable, with ERRs exceeding the social
discount rate of 15%. For these subprojects, the returns are more sensitive to a 5%
decrease in morbidity cases (Scenario 1) rather than a 20% increase in O&M costs
(Scenario 2).

Two methodologies are used in estimating benefits for education subprojects: The first
methodology measures the benefits in terms of potential value of earnings of students
who had access to education because of the project, with assumptions on drop out rates
throughout the year levels and ratio of students proceeding to college. Computation for
benefits was adjusted to take into account the updated projected enrolment rates and
assumes that only 60% of high school graduates would proceed to college and only 60%
of the college entrants would finish college. The second methodology estimates the
benefits based on savings in cost of education and transportation. Without the project,
students would have gone to private and other schools imposing higher fees and would
have spent more on transportation (assuming that the schools are constructed are closer to
the students). Subproject costs included investment costs, training costs, and operating
costs (i.e., personal services, insurance, utilities, repairs/maintenance and supplies).

All ERR estimates for the sample subprojects exceed the social discount rate of 15%. The
high rate of return of school buildings in Taguig City can be attributed to the high
utilization rate of classrooms. The classrooms were used for 2-3 shifts of classes a day.
The assumptions were then tested by: (i) a 20% decrease in projected benefits, and (ii) a
20% increase in O&M costs and 10% in PS. These subprojects remain viable given the
adverse changes in the assumptions.

For environment subprojects, benefits are derived from incremental income from fish
ponds and shrimp catch, incremental mangrove values, savings in property reinvestments
including institutional properties such as government buildings and public roads, averted
loss in taxable and saleable land due to erosion, and increased property values.
Subproject costs included as-built cost, training cost, O&M.

The results of the analysis show that environment subprojects are economically feasible.
Each estimate was then subjected to: (i) 20% decrease in projected benefits; and (ii) 50%
decrease in projected benefits. Apparently, a 50% decrease in benefits would still yield an
ERR estimate higher than 15% for subprojects in Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental and
Dipolog, Zamboanga del Norte. However, the outcome is different for New Washington,
Aklan and Plaridel, Quezon, in which ERR estimates stood below the social discount rate
and yielded negative NPV. At ICR, the computed average ERR for environment
subprojects is only a percent lower than the 45% estimated at appraisal.

The FIRR was computed for revenue generating subprojects such as public markets.
Revenue flows were mainly from lease fees and daily cash tickets from ambulant vendors,
and were validated based on the actual revenue acquired from the initial years of
operation. Costs were estimated in the form of as-built cost, training cost, and O&M costs.
It was assumed that the occupancy rate would be 70-100% and incremental costs would
increase from a range of 5-10% annually.

Based on the sample, the FIRR estimates are below the discount rate of 15% and have
negative NPV, with Jala-Jala, Rizal having a zero rate of return. The average FIRR at
ICR was computed at 8% which is substantially lower compared to the FIRR of 18%
computed at subproject appraisal and 30% at Project appraisal. The low FIRR of revenue-
generating subprojects can be attributed to lower benefits than projected due to: (a) fees
not being implemented as agreed, (b) poor or lack of enforcement of municipal
ordinances that created adverse impact on the viability of operations, (c) low utilization
rate or occupancy of the facilities, and (d) change in priorities of the new local
administration as a result of election (as in the case of Jala-Jala, Rizal where the public
transport routing was to be planned around the market and would therefore bring more
customers to the new facility, but was not carried out, affecting the viability of the
subproject). The result clearly demonstrates that non-compliance of required conditions
has serious effect on the operations and sustainability of the facility as a whole. Also, it is
important to note that the quality of preparation and analysis of subproject appraisal

reports is vital in the correct estimation of projected benefits. Feasibility studies should be
carefully analyzed and validated especially for revenue generating subprojects.

The benefits of RPTA and BTE subprojects are additional real property and business tax
revenues. Costs include investment, training and O&M costs. Revenue collection were
assumed to increase 20% in the second year of operation and 5% in succeeding years, and
operating cost to increase 5% annually. At ICR, the computation for cost was adjusted to
take into account the actual O&M costs, which is 10% of total PS & MOOE expenses in
2008.

RPTA and BTE subprojects are generally highly viable, especially for those that
introduced computerization. But only a few cities implemented computerized tax systems
under the project because of the perceived lumpy investment requirement (and that as
such, it would require a large number of real property units and business establishments
to make it cost effective). The modernization of the tax systems also created additional
benefits such as: (i) reduced processing time for tax filing and payment; (ii) use of
Geographic Information System (GIS) for land use planning, crime mapping, flood
mitigation and disaster reduction management efforts, and (iii) successful RPTA-B/BTE
subprojects being showcased for replication to other LGUs to encourage them to use such


                                               33

systems as a means of reducing red-tape and improving conduct of business with LGUs
(e.g., Sta. Rosa, Laguna becoming the pilot city for anti-red tape for Philippine Business
Registry because of its efficient administration of RPT and BT collection).

The financial viability of these subprojects do not seem to be affected by a reduction in
the assumed revenue increases (from the base case of 20% to 10% increase in RPT/BT
revenues, or from even from 20% to 5% increase).

In general, the high ERR/FIRR of subprojects and Project as a whole showed that the use
of resources was efficient. The ERR/FIRR of subprojects under components 1 and 3
remained robust when subjected to sensitivity analysis.

Moreover, these streams of benefits were validated during site visits. Further insights
about the process of subproject preparation, approval, implementation and operation were
generated from the site visits, interviews with LGU local chief executives and staff,
review of rapid assessment of emerging benefits, and discussions with LOGOFIND staff
to evaluate the sensitivity and sustainability of project benefits.

At the subproject level, the selection and planning of infrastructure investments was
found to be sound. The subprojects were a result of deliberation by local government
officials including the local council (legislature) based on the need of the constituents and
the socio-economic benefits of the investments. Where fees and charges were to be
imposed, a willingness-to-pay survey was conducted during subproject preparation. In
most cases, the subprojects were identified as development priorities by the participating
LGUs early on even prior to them being aware of the Project. However, the lack of funds
and the nature of the subprojects being largely non self-liquidating necessitated that these
gaps were either left unaddressed (e.g., for health centers/services, public markets) or
addressed on an intermittent, `piece meal' basis whenever limited funds were available as
grants from the provincial government and congressmen (e.g., for classrooms, water
supply). In the case of environmental projects (e.g., river protection, seawall), spending
took the form of annual recurrent costs, with temporary structures rebuilt as soon as they
were washed away by the next flooding or typhoon. The availability of financing as well
as substantial grants from the Project allowed the participating LGUs to address these
gaps with a long term view.

In planning for the investments, the maximum size of subprojects was based on: (a) the
LGU's borrowing capacity as defined by Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF)
subject to its willingness to borrow a certain amount, (b) its capacity to provide the
required counterpart funding, and (c) topped up with the grant based on the financing mix
specified according to type of project. At appraisal, the need for the subproject was
further reviewed and its scope determined based on an assessment of demand, including
ensuring non duplication of financing (grants) from national government agency
programs (e.g., Department of Education (DepEd) national school building program). In
many cases, the LGUs were able to mobilize additional resources from the provincial
government and/or congressmen for their equity, freeing up funds for other purposes.
Thus, in general, participating LGUs (particularly the lower income class municipalities)



                                              34

gave sufficient consideration to maximizing leverage from their limited resources for
substantial grants from the Project and for mobilizing additional resources from the
provincial government and congressmen to implement their subprojects.

Ensuring efficiency in the use of project resources at the subproject level, particularly
important given the significant grant component, was further strengthened by the
subproject appraisal and implementation policies that were developed by LOGOFIND
during project implementation. The appraisal required that the scope and design of the
subprojects were according to standards established by relevant national government
agencies (e.g., Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for public markets
and seawall/river protection projects, DPWH and DepEd for school buildings,
Department of Health (DOH) for health centers) and compared with actual costs of
completed subprojects. Subproject costs were further reduced through competitive
bidding. Any enhancement in design or scope was on the account of the LGU, as well as
any cost overruns resulting from reasons other than force majeure. In effect, this put a
tight lid on over or unnecessary spending particularly in the use of the grants and
provided a disincentive for overdesigned projects.

Coordination with relevant national government agencies at subproject appraisal stage
ensured institutional linkages critical to sustainability. For example, DepEd endorsement
of a school building project signaled its commitment to provide for teachers and an
annual O&M budget upon operation. Endorsement by DOH of a health center project
provided the opportunity for the proposed facility to be designed to provide for the
minimum number of services required for accreditation with DOH's Sentrong Sigla
(Center for Wellness) program, benefiting from free medicines and supplies.          This
coordination was done through a national level Policy Governing Board established by
the Project and composed of sectoral representatives.

                Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

An evaluation of the initial outcomes of the Local Government Finance & Development
(LOGOFIND) Project at the local government unit (LGU) and community levels was
conducted as part of the preparation of the Implementation Completion and Results
Report (ICR). The evaluation utilized four instruments: (a) review and analysis of project
implementation documents (feasibility studies, Subproject Completion Reports (SPCRs)
and Subproject Appraisal Reports, Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO)-Rapid
Appraisal of Emerging Benefits Document, Statement of Income and Expenditure (SIE),
training evaluation, etc.); (b) collection and analysis of financial data of participating
LGUs; (c) interviews and focus group discussions with LGU officials and staff and
community beneficiaries; and (d) case studies and interviews with beneficiaries in
selected project sites.

A total of 21 LGUs were visited from December 2008 to April 2009: 13 for subproject
implementation and eight for resource mobilization. These LGUs were also recipients of
the mandatory training program of the Project. Out of the 13 LGUs, eight were subjected
to case analysis (studies). An additional six LGUs that only availed themselves of the
Project's demand-driven training program were visited. The selection of the sample was
mainly based on the type of subprojects (social, environmental and revenue-generating),
type of training received, and geographical location of subprojects. Peace and order
situation was also a key consideration in the selection of subprojects to be visited.

A. LGU Subprojects: Case Studies

Dipolog City Sea Wall and Foreshore Development Subproject

Prior to the subproject, Dipolog City experienced soil erosion at a rate of about 0.2
hectares per year due to the weak capacity of the sea wall to buffer the strong waves and
current of Iligan Bay. This destructive natural force affected the productive value of the
foreshore areas to about less than half of the price of the land compared to those in the
nearby commercial and residential areas. It was thus important to reduce the further
destruction of the foreshore areas and promote sustained productive use of the valuable
area.

Other than environmental protection, the improvement of the sea wall and the foreshore
areas clearly provided an effective recreational facility for the residents of Dipolog City.
Before the subproject, residents conducted their recreation activities either in the city
plaza or in nearby schools. For the past two years, the celebrations for the Araw ng
Dipolog, held in June every year and attracting almost 100,000 people, have been held in
the area. Also, the area has attracted small business enterprises, particularly in the old sea
wall area, such as eateries, souvenir shops and small bars. The families relocated from the
subproject site, whose main livelihood included fishing and fish processing, are being
provided training in alternative livelihood by the Dipolog School of Fisheries and the



                                             39

local office of Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. Many of the
houses of the relocated families are made of concrete, compared to wood and galvanized
steel when they were still located in the sea wall area. There is a general feeling of
security among the residents since they are now located a safe distance from shore. The
relocation site has also provided the opportunity of some residents to engage in
productive enterprises such as bakeries, sari-sari stores, and small public transport.

Construction of Riverbank/Slope Protection Subproject in San Luis, Pampanga

San Luis was perennially flooded by the swelling of the Pampanga River. The most
damaging effect of this calamity was felt by the three barangays of the Poblacion area
which are also where the central business district, commercial strip, and educational
institutions are located. The constant erosion and flooding resulted in the further
destruction of valuable agricultural lands and the loss of lives and property. Furthermore,
local and outside investors' confidence was also significantly affected. Before the
subproject, the municipality experienced two major floods per year with an average
height of five feet thus significantly disrupting business and school activities. The floods
usually lasted for a week thus cutting off major business and service access. About 3,000
people would be evacuated during major flooding incidence. With an estimated annual
soil erosion rate of 238 sq. meters, the municipality needed to immediately act on
preserving its valuable land assets and stimulate local economic growth.

The main objective of the subproject was to minimize, if not totally arrest the continuous
flooding and erosion of land along the banks of the Pampanga River in order to provide
economic benefits in terms of foregone property damages, appreciation of the market
value of land within the area, and provide better prospects for investment and
employment opportunities.

The subproject greatly contributed to the security of the Poblacion and nearby barangays
from the disastrous swelling of the Pampanga River. Since the completion of the
subproject, no serious flooding has occurred. As a result, school activities are being
conducted regularly and student attendance in the schools located in the Poblacion area
has improved (San Luis Elementary School has about 1,000 students; A. Gonzales Sioco
High School has about 600 students). There is a general and overall feeling of security
with the improved protection of the riverbank. Social activities are now being conducted
regularly. The improved protection of the riverbank has noticeably encouraged the
establishment of new business ventures. For example, two gas stations and a major
hardware and construction store were established along the major road leading to the
central town area. It is noteworthy that local revenues have increased partly due to the
improved stability of the municipality. Revenues in 2005 increased by about PhP0.8M
compared to that in 2003 (local taxes, permits and licenses, business income and service
income totaled about PhP3.3M in 2005 and about PhP2.5M in 2003).

Design, Build and Operation of the San Fernando City Engineered Landfill Subproject




                                             40

Of the 59 barangays of San Fernando City, about 44% or 26 barangays are urban and
were serviced by an existing controlled dumpsite. The remaining 33 barangays are
located in the rural and distant areas and employ backyard dumping, composting and
burning as waste management methods. The daily average volume of garbage collected
in San Fernando city's 26 urban barangays is about 220 cubic meters. The existing
controlled disposal site covered an area of 6.4 hectares in barangay Mameltac.

With the expected increase in the daily volume of garbage of San Fernando City, the
existing dumpsite will not be adequate. Equally important, the Solid Waste Management
Act requires that landfills be the primary method for managing waste. The
construction/operation of an engineered sanitary landfill was expected to provide for the
preferred, environmentally responsible, socially acceptable, cost efficient and affordable
integrated solid waste management facility to serve the entire population of the city for
the next 15 to 20 years.

Integrated into the subproject was the formulation and implementation of a Social
Development Program (SDP) to address any socially adverse impacts that may result
from the subproject, particularly with regard to the families of waste-pickers working in
the old dumpsite. The SDP's livelihood support activities included the organization of the
waste-pickers into recognized laborers of the facility and the provision of trainings in
alternative livelihood/income generating activities. Because of this effort, some waste-
pickers have "graduated" to other livelihood/ employment activities such as tricycle
drivers and market vendors.

The subproject also contributed to the improved awareness of waste management among
the residents of the City. With the landfill facility, the city government has vigorously
advocated for the segregation of garbage at source or at the household level with its
"Nabubulok at Di-Nabubulok Program" to encourage recycling, reuse and composting of
solid waste. The effort intends to lessen the volume of garbage being dumped at the
landfill and provide opportunities for alternative livelihoods such as selling the
recyclables and the compost.

Another impact attributed to the subproject is the emergence of small/barangay-level
junk-yards that collect and process waste collected from the barangay recovery facilities.
These facilities have opened up opportunities for more effective and efficient ways of
collecting recyclables and other waste materials for composting thus increasing local
livelihood activities

Improvement and Expansion of Water Supply System in Panaon, Misamis Occidental

Before the subproject, the water supply system only serviced the households of barangays
Poblacion and Punta. The Level III water supply system and facility consisted of a
pumping station, transmission mains, distribution pipes and service connections. The
constant and sustained provision of water to the beneficiary households however was
very limited. Only about 20% of the beneficiary households enjoyed provision of water.
Moreover, water was only made available two hours daily. As a result, most of the



                                            41

facilities deteriorated and households had to get their water from deepwells and
communal systems. Thus, the subproject aimed to improve and provide adequate and safe
water to the major barangays of the municipality namely Poblacion, Lutao, Punta,
Sumasap, Villalin, Dela Paz and Map-an.

The water supply system is now servicing a wider area namely the targeted seven
barangays and a barangay from the adjacent municipality (Mohon, Aloran). Because of
the availability and constant supply of water 24 hours a day, household beneficiaries have
increased their savings since a household now only spends about PhP260/month for
continuous water supply compared to about PhP400/month under the old system. It has
been observed that there is now an increased awareness in the communities about water
use and management. Also, it has been generally felt that overall health condition in the
serviced areas has improved with reports of lower cases of gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and
amoebiasis.

It is clear that the beneficiary communities and households have experienced improved
productivity. For example, a hatchery facility installed with the new water supply system
increased its layer chickens from 1,000 heads to 4,000 heads because of the improved
opportunity to clean its livestock facilities thereby minimizing disease among the
livestock. Also, the municipality noted an increase in business establishments resulting
from the improved access to water. There were about 24 business establishments in
Poblacion in 2003. By 2008, there were 38 which included new prawn hatcheries and
livestock farming. In addition, a new lodging house catering to high school students has
built and restroom facilities in public schools were improved. Now, public school
classrooms have individual toilets.

Construction of Barangay Saoay Cluster Health Center (San Fernando, La Union)

The Barangay Saoay Cluster Health Center is part of a subproject that included the
establishment of Barangay Health Stations in Brgy. Apaleng and Brgy. Nagyubuyuban,
Cluster Health Centers in Brgy. Poro, Brgy. Sibuan-otong, and Bgy. Pao Sur and the
upgrading of the City Proper Health Office. Prior to the subproject, there were only 10
barangays with existing Barangay Health Center (BHC) structures, of which five are
located in urban and 5 in rural barangays. Rural Health Midwives and Rural Sanitary
Inspectors had difficulty in implementing health programs in areas without a BHC
considering that 62% of the city's barangays are located in the rural areas. The city had
four doctors, seven nurses, 22 midwives, eight sanitary inspectors, 366 Barangay Health
Workers (BHWs), 64 Barangay Nutrition Scholars (BNSs), and 64 Barangay Service
Point Officers. Their tasks included, among others, recording of the immunization service
administered, assisting pregnant women for pre-natal check-up, feeding of children, and
conduct of health education activities. The health infrastructure though was wanting.

All the health stations/centers are already operational. The Saoay Cluster Health Center is
composed of four BHWs, one BNS, and one resident nurse. Before the subproject, the
health and medical needs of the residents of barangay Saoay was provided by one nurse
and two BHWs in a room located in the barangay hall. This facility was open only once a



                                             42

week and had an average visit of about six patients. With the new facility, patient
visitations have increase to about 20 patients per day. The facility is open 24-hours daily,
seven days a week. It is the first facility-based (lying-in) health center (established before
the Department of Health (DOH) 2008 order) and is catering to almost 900 people from
eight barangays (Bangkusay, Abot, Bato, Saoay, Mameltak, Didanop, East Dalanguyan,
and Nantutan) whereas before only the residents of barangay Saoay were provided
medical assistance. The facility is now able to provide more medical services such as pap
smear tests, urinalysis, blood tests, dental examination, immunization, and the conduct of
medical missions from partner institutions. As a result, there has been observed reduction
in child birth mortalities (two in 2003; none in 2008), maternal mortality (five in 2005
and zero in 2008) and malnutrition (26 in 2003 to six in 2008) in the cluster area.

Construction of Health Center in Tuy, Batangas

The old municipal health center was located at the Poblacion and was situated beside the
Municipal hall. The building was built 20 years ago and was in a dilapidated condition. It
had very limited medical equipment and lacked the necessary facilities to offer basic
laboratory examinations and services. Records of the municipal health center showed that
a majority of the residents of Tuy suffered from respiratory diseases. Cardio vascular
disease is the leading cause of mortality and acute respiratory infections is the main cause
of death among infants.

The subproject has improved the delivery of expanded health care services such as the
introduction of new programs like urinalysis testing, complete blood count, maternal care,
etc. The facility has also enabled the municipality to provide Philippine Health Insurance
Corporation benefits to the community members (5,000 people from the municipality are
benefiting out of total population of 45,000) thus significantly reducing medical costs at
the household level. The health center has also enabled affiliations with partner
institutions such as University of Sto. Tomas thus providing regular medical missions
like dental and optical services. There is also improved linkage and network with major
health care facilities. Overall, mortality cases have almost remained constant while
morbidity cases have slightly increased in recent years. It is difficult at this point to be
certain if the improved provision of health care services has positively influenced the
economic productivity of the community members.

Construction of Science Building in South Central Elementary School (San Fernando, La
Union)

Most of San Fernando City's public schools are in bad condition with some of them
having been built in the 1940s. Compounding the worrisome structural condition of the
public schools, most have student-classroom ratio beyond the prescribed ratio determined
by the national government (Department of Education (DepEd) recommends a 35-40:1
student-classroom ratio). With an annual increase of enrollees at about 2% per year, it
was expected that classroom and teaching facilities would be lacking. In South Central
Elementary School, student classroom ratio was about 43:1 and had about 900 students in
2008. With the school's particular emphasis in science, having a reputation for producing



                                              43

outstanding students in science and math, it was determined that improvements in the
school's science facilities were needed. The main objectives of the subproject were to
improve the learning environment of students and teachers and to enhance the skills of
students and other faculty members in computer literacy and information technology.

A total of 10 one-storey, three-classroom buildings were built and were located at
Canaoay Elementary School, San Agustin Elementary School, Sevilla Elementary School,
Mameltac Elementary School, South Central Elementary School, Lingsat Elementary
School, Ilocanos Community School, Catbangen Central School, Sacyud High School,
and Cadaclan Elementary School. Science laboratories were built in South Central,
Lingsat, Catbangen and Ilocanos schools while the others had Home Economics rooms.
All the science buildings had additional 20 computers and a printer.

The subproject in South Central Elementary school eased the student classroom ratio for
science. Whereas before there was only one science classroom and laboratory for all
grades 1- 6 students, the subproject provided facilities for grades 1-3 students. There is no
recent and accurate data indicating impact on students' performance and grade in science
but it has been observed by the teachers that the new laboratory has facilitated effective
teaching of science and has also improved students' interest in science. The computer
rooms and computers have greatly increased students and teachers' exposure to computer
use and information technology. It is unclear at this point how much impact the facilities
have on student performance, especially for grade 1 to 3 students. What is evident though
is that the school has been able to sustain the high performance of its students in various
math and science competitions (students of the school are consistent winners in math and
science contests).

Construction of Taal Public Market Subproject

The subproject was aimed to provide its constituents better market facilities as
replacement to the old public market which was razed by fire on October 10, 2004. The
subproject was expected to enhance the local economic activities and promote better
trade opportunities for local producers and entrepreneurs, which will give the
municipality higher revenue generation and subsequent increase in income in the coming
years.

With more stalls (the new market accommodates about 50 more vendors than the old
market) and with improved access and sanitation, there has been an observed increase in
customers and clients coming from the municipality and neighboring areas. The
improved facility and increased clientele has relatively improved net income for some
vendors. For eatery owners, daily net income has improved from PhP700/day to
PhP1,000/day, meat vendors earn a net income from PhP250/day to PhP500/day, while
barong selling used to earn about PhP800/day to about PhP1,500/day. However, due to
the emergence of new market facilities in the neighboring areas (e.g., Lipa and Lemery),
some establishments have not experienced significant changes in their net income. For
example, net income from barong rental has remained at PhP500/day while net income
from selling vegetables remained at PhP1,500/ day.

B. LGU Training and Capacity-building: Focus Group Discussion (FGD) Results

Majority of the training participants interviewed were able to apply what they learned at
work as members of the Bid and Awards committee (BAC) (on procurement training) or
the technical departments (on construction supervision and punch-listing). Technical
knowledge, such as the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) for tax mapping and
data storage, was another key learning that participants remember and applied to their
work. Participants recorded either learning new material or being able to enhance their
existing knowledge of the subject matter (e.g. for detailed engineering design, and
construction supervision training for engineers and financial management for
accountants). In some instances, some LGUs noted significant differences between the
procurement process of the World Bank and that of Republic Act 9184.

In many cases, participants found the modules useful because of their application to
projects and activities outside LOGOFIND (Panaon used the Logical Framework
approach to identify projects to be funded by other donors) on the other hand, one LGU
(Occidental Mindoro) intends to apply the lessons learned in the Environmental
Management Plan and SPCR training events in the construction of another hospital.
Participants appreciated the combination of lectures and practical exercises. However,
better sequencing of modules would have been more effective (the Logical Framework
module was delivered after project identification and development).

Actual field visits or sharing of experiences also helped reinforce learning and the
possibility for replication. In terms of length of courses, participants commented that they
would have preferred adding an extra day rather than additional hours to complete the
lessons and exercises. Follow-up activities by LOGOFIND staff during scheduled visits
to the subproject sites to monitor the progress of subproject implementation were useful
in reinforcing skills learned. Participants stated that LOGOFIND staffs were always
available for technical assistance, especially in the preparation of reports which, in some
cases, included a review of training concepts.

Sustainability. Impact of training can be inferred from increases in local revenue
generation and adoption of the Local Revenue Code (for BLGF courses) and/or in
improvements in urban management practices, including the quality of sub-projects
(MDFO). There was some evidence from the field of positive outcomes. In Panaon, tax
mapping project contributed to an increase in real property units from 6,001 to 7,133 and
a corresponding increase in assessed values. In Valencia, prior to tax mapping, real
property units (RPUs) were only recorded at 16,000. After the tax mapping, this rose
to27,000. This translates to an increase in revenue from PhP 1.2 M to PhP 3.6 M. In Sta.
Rosa Laguna, FGD participants reported significant improvements in transaction time
after the introduction of the new software. With the new Real Property Tax
Administration (RPTA) system in place, the LGU posted a 15 percent increase in its
initial revenue collection in January 2009. In business licensing alone, it has already
collected some PhP 100 million in taxes.



                                              45

Similarly, a number of LGUs have started to mainstream tools and strategies acquired
from the courses in their regular duties. In San Ildefonso, the municipal accountant has
employed pro-forma documents from the training events to disburse funds of the
Commission on Election used during the last election. In Paluan, the municipality
included an item in the LGU's annual budget for the environmental guarantee fund. In
Oroquieta City, most of the tools in project implementation have been adopted by the
LGU in its operations. The mayor even issued a memorandum for project monitoring
patterned after World Bank standards. There was also an attempt to use pro-forma WB
documents because these included steps for easy monitoring of projects. The municipality
has used the Logical Framework approach in identifying projects and sourcing out funds
(i.e., fishport project funded by Land Bank of the Philippines). In Sta. Catalina, as part of
the LGU's effort to sustain the seawall project, an annual budget for the maintenance of
the structure was included in the municipality's investment plan.

The local chief executives strongly endorsed the World Bank-funded projects. LCEs
agreed not only to cover transport and allowances of participants to these events, they
encouraged their staff to scope out other future training events. Finally, while training
needs for each LGU varied, overall participants requested additional and refresher
courses on fund sourcing, computer literacy, AutoCAD (computer aided design) for
engineers, livelihood generation.

Key Recommendations for Future Events
(i.) Select participants who are end-users of training in addition to department heads
       who are decision-makers. In this way, the applicability of training's tools, concepts
       and strategies can be ensured.
(ii.) Organize training events by provinces and invite both provincial and municipal
       officials to the event. The training events can be a venue for them to discuss the
       development goals of the province vis-à-vis the development direction of its
       municipalities.
(iii.) Conduct the training events in proper sequence within the framework of a broader
       capacity building framework.
(iv.) Combine lecture and exercises with fieldwork if applicable. This will break the
       monotony of class room type of training and can bring new insights.

C. LGU Resource Mobilization

Based on the sample of subprojects visited, all LGUs (except for Minalin) with RPTA
subprojects showed significant increases in number of RPUs and locally-sourced
revenues.

However, it was not apparent how these additional revenues would influence future
expenditures of the LGUs and the likelihood of improved performance in delivery of
services. Most of the subprojects had been in operation for less than a year and have yet
to be reported in their financial statements and figure into the next planning cycle. It can
be inferred that these incremental revenues will directly increase LGU fiscal resources
that it can use for investments in the expansion of services and facilities.

Only two LGUs (cities) carried out the computerization sub-projects under this
component, mainly because of the perceived political implications of modernizing the
system as well as the increase in tax rates that such computerized programs introduce.
Some LGUs chose manual systems and refused computerization and GIS even when their
net borrowing capacity could accommodate additional investments.

The project introduced some important changes in the administrative systems and quality
of governance in participating LGUs:

(i.) Increased integrity of land records and business establishments which were used to
       produce updated and precise maps for use not only in tax administration but also for
       physical planning.
(ii.) LGU assessors discovering unrecorded tax units and reducing errors in computing
       RPT and business tax assessments.
(iii.) More consistent enforcement of the tax code since the mayor and other local
       executives could not grant exemptions for newly "discovered" and "corrected"
       assessments.
(iv.) Staffing plans of the office of the Municipal Treasurer and the Assessor were
       updated and led to request for hiring of additional staff with the right qualifications.

      Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Local Government Finance and Development (LOGOFIND) Project aims to: (i)
assist participating local government units (LGUs) in expanding and upgrading their
basic infrastructure, services and facilities; (ii) strengthen their capacities in municipal
governance, investment planning, revenue generation, and project development and
implementation; and (iii) enhance the capabilities at the national level to provide
technical support and long-term financing to local governments through the Municipal
Development Fund (MDF). The Project is composed of four components through which
the development goals and objectives will be attained: (a) LGU Subproject Financing, (b)
LGU Training and Capacity Building, (c) LGU Resource Mobilization and Performance
Monitoring, and (d) Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) Strengthening.

The Loan Agreement for the LOGOFIND Project was signed between Department of
Finance and the World Bank (WB) on September 8, 1999 with total project cost of
US$133.7 million (US$100 million from the loan proceed (WB Loan No. 4446-PH) and
US$33.7 million Government of the Philippines counterpart). The loan became effective
on 28 February 2000 and with an original closing date on 30 June 2006. In August 2001,
US$40 million was cancelled from the loan due to difficulties in building up the pipeline
of interested and qualified LGUs, registering a net commitment of US$60 million. On
August 18, 2005, the MDFO-Policy Governing Board (PGB) approved the realignment
of US$3M from Component 3 to Component 1 to cover funding gap. Due to
oversubscription of LGU under the subproject-financing component, the MDFO-PGB
approved the second fund realignment of US$4.3Million from Components 2, 3, & 4 to
Component1 to fill the budget shortfall.

A. Assessment of Performance Based on Project Development Objectives (PDOs)
in Relation to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
PDO1: Expanding and upgrading basic infrastructure services and facilities of LGUs.
This was primarily achieved through the various infrastructure projects implemented
under Component 1. The total number of households benefiting from the Project was
estimated at 1,054,142. Around half of which (534,685 households) come from 3rd-6th
income class LGUs.

PDO2: Strengthening LGUs' capacity in municipal governance, investment planning,
revenue generation and project development and implementation. The remarkable
outcome for the increase in revenue collection of the participating LGUs (PDO 2.1) is
attributable to the intervention of both the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF)
Central and Regional Offices in terms of effective training and other technical assistance
(mapping, recording, accounting). Also, with the development of the Statement of
Income and Expenditures (SIE), the LGUs are better equipped with information needed
to assess their fiscal performance for the previous years and are, therefore, able to plan
and execute improvements.

The target increase in the proportion of own source revenue of the participating LGU at
the end of Project life (PDO 2.2) was not achieved. Although there were 535 LGUs who



                                             48

were trained by BLGF, only 72 of these have implemented Real Property Tax
Administration (RPTA) (66 LGUs) and Business Tax Enhancement (BTE) (6 LGUs)
subprojects - the remaining LGUs were not able to update their existing sources of
revenue. Moreover, most of the participating LGUs are relying from the Internal Revenue
Allotment (IRA), which has substantially increased. This is very relevant because the
increase for cities alone is 37.11%, a number, which almost met the target but still is not
compliant notwithstanding the fact that cities have the broadest taxing powers under the
Local Government Code (LGC).

With the training on Resource Mobilization, the LGUs were able to maximize their
sources of revenues through improved techniques and strategies imparted to them
through the training. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the LGUs that participated in the LRC
workshop were able to implement their revised LRCs, hence, updated their schedule of
values and thus increasing their revenue collection. The percentage could have been
higher if the LGUs that underwent the process of revision have implemented their
updated LRCs but was constrained to do so due to economic or political reasons such as
fiscal crisis within their locality or change in administration.

With respect to the Training on Examination of Books of Accounts, its benefits were
further enhanced by the requisite SIE submission because the LGUs are able to monitor
their lapse and progress for the previous year, and are therefore better equipped to map
their courses of action for the coming year. The compliance rate for SIE submission
(PDO 2.4) is above satisfactory because, compared with the previous Budget Operating
Statement (BOS), the SIE is much simpler to accomplish. Further, the Legal Department
of the BLGF, observing due process, also imposes administrative sanctions for late or
non-submission of the SIE. The 6-7% delinquency in submission may be attributed to
postal delays. With regard to the real property tax (RPT) collection of the 72 LGUs who
participated in the subprojects (PDO 2.5), there is an increase of 76% attributable to the
discovery of new real property units, proper identification and classification of properties,
elimination of erroneous data, and the organization and harmonization of data from the
tax mapping and computerization respectively undertaken.

PDO3: Enhancing the borrower's capacity to support and finance local government
development and investment. In Year 2000, there were only 185 LGUs accessing long-
term financing through MDFO. This baseline value increased to 551 LGUs by project
end (Q4 2008). Thirty percent (30%) of these or 165 LGUs have accessed LOGOFIND
funding through Components 1 and 3. The increase in baseline value is 40% more than
the target LGUs.

In Year 2000, one hundred fifty-six (156) LGUs accessing long-term MDFO financing
belonged to 3rd-6th income class bracket. By project end, there were already 405 LGUs
belonging to the 3rd-6th income bracket accessing long-term MDFO financing, 18% more
than the target end-of-project value of 390 LGUs. Through Components 1 and 3,
LOGOFIND assisted 155 LGUs belonging to this income bracket, or 62% of the actual
increase in LGUs for this indicator.




                                               49

Based on the BLGF Database on Net Borrowing Capacity Issuance from 1994-2008, of
the 165 LGUs that availed of the LOGOFIND funding, 75 or 45% are first-time
borrowers. Of the 75 first-time borrowers, 74 or 99% belong to the lower income class
bracket (3rd-6th), only 1 or 1% belong to 1st-2nd income class. Note that this data does not
cover net borrowing capacity issuances prior to 1994, thus LOGOFIND LGUs that
availed of financial assistance prior to 1994 are still considered "first-time borrowers."

As an offshoot of the LGU Financing Framework, the National Government-LGU Cost-
sharing policy was revisited to adapt to changing situations. It incorporated lessons
learned from the LOGOFIND LGU credit financing. The policy is now being adopted
and followed by LGU credit financing projects since 2003.

B. Assessment of Outputs
Output 1: Improved basic infrastructure, services and facilities. The LOGOFIND
Project assisted 102 LGUs in the implementation of 141 subprojects under Component 1.
Out of these, 97 LGUs completed 133 subprojects. Component 1 fell short by 2 LGUs in
reaching the revised end-of-Project target of 104 LGUs. Despite this shortfall, it did not
prevent the Project from achieving its development objective of expanding and upgrading
basic infrastructure, services and facilities as it was able to accommodate about 1,054,142
household beneficiaries of all project-assisted LGU subprojects, more than the number of
households (532,028 households) targeted in Component 1.

The LOGOFIND Component 1 financed mostly social and environmental subprojects,
taking up 56% and 26%, respectively, of the total number of completed subprojects. In
terms of project distribution, subproject financing under Components 1 and 3 was fully
accessed by LGUs in all regions, with greatest concentration in Region 10 (Northern
Mindanao Region) of 39 LGUs.

Throughout the project cycle, interplay of various factors greatly influenced the overall
target output. Component 1 of the Project only met its end-of-the-year targets in two
years (2003 and 2004) out of the seven projected. A year's extension to the project life
proved crucial in beefing up actual output, which it did in 2008.

Output 2: Enhance LGU management capacity. The Project clearly exceeded its end-of-
project target value for 200 LGUs trained. When MDFO and BLGF took on training
implementation and delivery in April 2002, output shot up to as high as 900% (year
2005) more than the projected target. Despite the fact that several training modules were
not completely rolled out (e.g., Sustainability Training modules and Subproject
Completion Report modules) due to hindering factors in the project life, the component
met the target number of LGUs trained.

MDFO trained a total of 345 LGUs, without double count, while BLGF trained a total of
862 LGUs, also without double count. For purposes of consolidating project output,
however, the LGUs trained by both MDFO and BLGF are counted only as one trained
LGU output, thus coming up with a total of 1, 033 LGUs trained. The Project has trained
60% of the total LGUs (1,711) nationwide.



                                              50

Output 3: Improved ability to monitor LGU fiscal performance. The LOGOFIND
Project was able to successfully complete a fiscal information database through the
development of the SIE, later improved into Statement of Revenues and Expenditures
(SRE), which the LGUs are required to submit quarterly to the BLGF, which then
encodes and compiles the data for publication. The SIE publication for CYs 2004-2007,
however, was only carried out in 2008 due to lack of human resources. The government
had a freeze hiring policy then and the positions needed to be filled up did not reach the
level of consultancy, which is allowed by the Bank to be contracted out.

With the completion of this fiscal information database, the LGU credit rating system is
subsequently established. The system is envisioned to provide a gauge to measure the
ability of an LGU-borrower to meet its debt obligations on time. A study was done and a
system was developed for evaluating LGU credit risks. Moreover, a manual was also
produced in order to clearly explain the methodologies in determining the
creditworthiness of LGUs. This system is on its way to implementation after the
formulation of a Road Map/ Action Plan detailing the procedure to operationalize to
system and to address the hindrances and obstacles such as the determination of the
proper agency to rate the LGUs; coordination with the MDFO, Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas and other private agencies; information access; level of access; the general
effect of the system to an LGU's capacity to borrow and the possible limit of the 20% of
the annual regular income debt capacity ceiling provided under the LGC.

Output 4: Improved local resource mobilization. There were no LGUs that availed of the
resource mobilization financing from 2000-2006 because the financing mix of the
subproject was not favourable to LGUs. When subproject financing was first marketed by
the BLGF to LGUs prior to the LOGOFIND Project, the financing mix was still 60% to
80% grant, depending on the LGU income class. However, the Local Financing
Framework (LFF) was adopted by the National Government in the late 1990s (and at the
onset of LOGOFIND Operations) where grants for LGU subproject financing was
lowered to a maximum of 50% grant only for municipalities and almost 0% grant for
cities. BLGF found out that this grant did not attract LGU clients and that lower income
municipalities do not have adequate financial resources to come up with the required
equity. For the computerization subprojects, the implementation of the LFF meant that
essentially there would be 0% grant for cities. BLGF had to lobby to the PGB to increase
the grant subsidy to initially 25% and later to 50% just to attract more LGU interests in
the computerization subprojects of Component 3. The priorities of LGUs are basically
infrastructure projects that are far more visible and therefore more politically expedient.
Coupled with the lack of a more attractive incentive such as higher grant subsidies,
BLGF was hard pressed to look for client LGUs.

The Project funded and completed a total of 76 subprojects in 72 LGUs; 66 subprojects
for RPTA-A (manual); 5 for RPTA-B (computerization); and 5 for BTE subprojects.

Output 5: Enhanced institutional arrangement and capacity for MDF. At project
appraisal, it was planned that the MDF will be strengthened and reorganized in two



                                            51

phases under the LOGOFIND Project. The 1st phase, planned for a period of three years,
consists in the creation of the MDFO to be staffed with full-time professionals. The 2nd
phase involves the spin-off of the MDFO into an existing or new financial institution.
Only the 1st phase was achieved, albeit partially, since MDFO still has to fill up its vacant
personnel positions. The 2nd phase, the creation of the Municipal Finance Corporation
(MFC), was hampered by the legal impediment of transferring portion of the Second
Generation Fund to the MFC.

Notwithstanding the non-operation of the MFC, MDFO has continued to pursue its
mandate by providing relevant financing services to assist LGUs in their delivery of basic
services and other development projects through the implementation of the LOGOFIND
and Community-Based Resource Management Projects. It has likewise embarked on a
number of credit and financing programs such as, Program Lending, Millennium
Development Goals Achievement Fund, and the Philippine Water Revolving Fund. To
date the MDFO-PGB has approved and allotted P4.55Billion pesos for the
implementation of the financing facilities.

C. Assessment of Inputs
The Key Results framework identified expenditures by component as the project input
indicator.
   (a) Infrastructure, services and facilities subprojects. The LGU Subproject
         Financing (Component 1) registered 103% disbursement performance with a
         cumulative release of US$ 45.95 million to LGU clients. It exceeded its
         allocated fund of US$ 44.4 million. The budget shortfall in this component will
         come from the potential unutilized funds from Components 2, 3 and 4. However,
         regardless of this over-disbursement, the component was unable to reach its end-
         of-project target value of 104 LGUs. Several factors brought about this situation.
         For one, LGUs were allowed multiple subproject applications, either through
         one SPLA or subsequent loan applications. These LGUs are termed "repeater
         LGUs." A subsequent LGU application retained the number of LGUs, but
         increased the subloan and grant assistance disbursed by the project. Secondly,
         substantial amount of around US$1.8M (P89M) was already released to eight
         LGUs with partially completed subprojects. These are LGUs that still had a few
         remaining works, but substantially completed civil works.
   (b) LGU Training and Capacity Building. The LGU Training and Capacity
         Building component, funding training activities conducted by the LGA and
         MDFO, disbursed US$ 1.7 million of the allocated US$ 3.5 million. BLGF
         trainings were charged to the Component 3 allocation since these comprise of
         resource mobilization and financial reporting courses. Fifty percent (50%) of
         Component 2 allocation was undisbursed because some Component 2 activities
         planned at project inception did not push through, BLGF LGU trainings were
         charged to Component 3, some MDFO-conducted LGU trainings were not
         rolled-out as planned, and the trainings held were implemented through prudent
         spending. Planned activities that did not push through included the Distance
         Learning Program and sole sourcing for demand-driven trainings amounting to




                                            52

      approximately US$ 1 million (P48M) or 29% of the project allocation for this
      Component.
(c) Local Resource mobilization and LGU Performance Monitoring. LGU
      Resource Mobilization and Performance Monitoring component, on the other
      hand, has the second highest disbursement rate among the four components at
      81%. It disbursed US$ 4.22 million of the US$5.20 million allocated. Still it fell
      short of its target disbursements because it was unable to implement the required
      number of RPTA and BTE subprojects.
(d) Streamlined MDF Procedures and Approvals and Strengthened MDF. The
      MDFO Strengthening Component disbursed 75% of its allocated funds at
      US$ 4.32 million of the allocated fund of US$ 5.90 million. Component 4 did
      not disburse the entire amount allocated because spinning-off into an MFC did
      not push through.

D. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Output
The LOGOFIND Project underwent two extension periods as the implementing
agency experienced challenges in project implementation. Among the issues
encountered at the Project level are: (i) unfavorable lending rates, (ii) lack of a well-
defined coordinating and reporting functions and accountabilities between and among
implementing agencies, (iii) lack of budget cover at some periods during project
implementation, (iv) incomplete computerization/automation of the project's
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems, (v) election-related delays, (vi) limited
manpower, (vii) LGU unfamiliarity with WB procurement guidelines resulting in
delays in the procurement subproject stage, and (viii) non-inclusion of post-
implementation monitoring in the M&E design.

Since the Project components were independently implemented, these experienced
unique factors affecting specific component implementation. For example, the
implementation of the LGU infrastructure subproject component (Component 1) was
affected by facilitating factors such as (a) the adoption of strategies and innovations
to fast-track achievement of targets, (b) use of the Second Generation Fund as bridge
financing during the period the MDFO lacked budget cover, (c) conscientious PMO
assistance to LGUs, and (d) conduct of subproject progress monitoring. On the other
hand, reaching Component 1 targets within the original six-year period was hindered
by the following factors: (i) numerous LGU fallouts from the pipeline due to non-
conformity with Project standards, bid failures, changes in LGU priority and non-
compliance with Detailed Engineering Design subproject stage requirements, and (ii)
extension of financial and technical assistance to LGUs availing of LOGOFIND
funds for the second and third time, thereby beefing up disbursements but not
physical output accomplishments. The availability of approving bodies also affected
the rate of approval of subprojects that passed the development and appraisal
subproject stages.

Component 2 target physical output target was achieved mainly because the BLGF
utilized its regional offices in the conduct of resource mobilization demand-driven
trainings. However, the expenditure target was unmet because some Component 2



                                         53

   activities planned at inception did not push through, such as the Distance Learning
   Program and the sole source training provision, which was deemed not viable.

   The implementation of Component 3 was greatly affected by lack of LGU interest to
   apply for resource mobilization subprojects due to low grant component (25%)
   offered for the manual RPTA and zero grant offered for the computerized RPTA
   subprojects. Also, the prospective LGUs are on a "wait and see" attitude pending the
   actual implementation of the approved subprojects under RPTA Package A. On
   August 3, 2006, the MDFO-PGB approved a resolution allocating a grant component
   of 50% for RPTA-A and RPTA­B subprojects. Furthermore, the BLGF has
   intensified promotional activities in the region and key provinces. There was also
   delayed LGU submission and posting of SIE reports due to difficulty in preparation
   of the reports and the frequent turnover of local treasurers.

   The strengthening and reorganization of MDFO under Component 4 was originally
   planned to undergo two phases. The second phase was supposedly the spinning-off of
   the Office into an existing or new financial institution. This phase, however, was
   hampered by a Commission on Audit observation recommending instead, that the
   new financial institution be created through a legislative fiat. Nevertheless, the
   MDFO was able to put in place policies, procedures and drafted the MDFO
   Operations Manual. The MDFO-PGB, through Executive Order (EO) 742, is directed
   to further enhance the function of MDFO and restructure the organization for its
   effective operation and administration. The EO also allows the MDFO to adopt
   pertinent policies for the collection of fees and charges needed to defray the operation
   and administrative expenses of the office.

E. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
On the Project Design:
   (a) Critical assumptions and realities such as prior LGU financing mixes,
         institutional readiness, election-related delays, and legal impediments, not
         reflected in the project design occur as hindering factors in project
         implementation and hamper the achievement of outputs.
   (b) The availability of grants, provided together with credit, encouraged borrowings
         for specific subproject types. The number of social and environmental
         subprojects indicated that the provision of grant financing could direct
         investments in this type of subprojects and prove to be an effective means of
         promoting these sectors. However, given that the Project is demand-driven, it is
         critical to exercise careful evaluation and prudence to ensure that proposals for
         subprojects with large grants reflect the actual needs of LGUs rather than being
         influenced solely by the grant element. The LOGOFIND Project also proved
         that LGUs are willing to access loan financing and to cost-share for priority
         projects especially social and environmental subprojects provided the right
         matching grant is provided accordingly.
   (c) Financing for lower income class LGUs introduced them to alternative source of
         funding and provided them with options to pursue development projects and
         developed their familiarity with basic financing arrangements other than their



                                             54

        IRA and grants from the National Government. The voluntary repayment
        requirement also developed due diligence on the part of LGUs who were
        required to program their regular expenses and amortization thus instilling a
        sense of financial discipline.
   (d) National projects for local government units financed by Official Development
        Assistance, or otherwise, should adhere to the national policies particularly on
        the cost sharing arrangement. Provision of grant to LGUs for devolved projects
        with significant national interest could facilitate convergence of local and
        national financial resources in a particular sector.
   (e) Computerizing resource mobilization subprojects require larger concession rates
        to be attractive to lower income class LGUs. The priorities of LGUs are,
        basically, infrastructure projects that are more physically visible to the public
        and are therefore more politically expedient.
   (f)  The need for a well-defined coordinating and reporting functions and
        accountabilities should be addressed prior to start-up operations, otherwise, if
        enhancing the institutional capacity of the implementing agencies is
        simultaneously focused with the delivery of targets for the Project, the start-up
        operations will necessarily be put on hold.
   (g) The Project did not have control over the emerging benefits of the subprojects
        because the scope of the Project was designed to end at subproject completion
        which does not cover operation and maintenance. These were seen in the Rapid
        Appraisal of Emerging Benefits survey conducted by the PMO. It is thus
        recommended that Project intervention in the Operations and Maintenance
        phase be included in the Project design to ensure sustainability of the
        subprojects.
   (h) There is still a demand for the RPTA manual type of subprojects. In fact, there
        are still LGUs that have not undertaken tax mapping projects. At the same time,
        there are growing LGUs and newly created municipalities, cities and provinces
        that need to conduct tax mapping activities to account for recent changes in land
        activities within their jurisdiction.
   (i)  There is also a great demand for the computerization of local tax administration
        systems because a great number of LGUs have already implemented the tax
        mapping projects.
   (j)  There is still a huge demand for LGU trainings in the area of local government
        finance. As such, if a resource mobilization development project is to be
        designed and implemented anew, LGU trainings in local government finance
        have to be incorporated as a subcomponent.

On Project Implementation:
   (a) While orientation conferences and marketing activities were undertaken to
        develop the subproject pipeline, "word of mouth" promotion of mayors and
        LGU staff who have availed of LOGOFIND assistance proved to be very
        effective in enjoining other LGU applicants. Moreover, mayors tended to
        exhibit a "wait and see" attitude, hence, there was an increase in applications
        after the first set of subprojects were completed.




                                             55

     (b) LGUs are willing to comply with project requirements in accordance with
         existing national laws and standards if these are seen in the light of subproject
         sustainability, and beyond project requirements. The possibility of good
         governance is manifested in the LGUs that have committed to LOGOFIND
         subproject implementation. A crucial factor in facilitating the good governance
         aspect in LGU subproject implementation is earnest PMO support and
         assistance.
     (c) While the Project provided technical assistance through blended classroom
         training and onsite mentoring, there is recognition of the need to have a national
         framework for LGU capacity development. Such framework will rationalize the
         provision of technical to LGUs to facilitate harmonization, minimize
         duplication, effective allocation of resources, and more importantly, allow for
         the measurement of technical assistance outputs, outcomes and impact to better
         program and deliver such interventions.
     (d) Mandatory modules, or modules related to the processing and implementation
         of subprojects are more efficiently and effectively delivered by the PMO rather
         than by an external agency as modules may be developed to cater to the specific
         needs of the Project.
     (e) Component 3 was directly affected, both positively and negatively by the
         current BLGF organizational structure. BLGF relied in its regional offices for
         the marketing, processing and monitoring of the subprojects. The regional
         offices were more attuned to the needs of the LGUs because they have regular
         contact with the local treasury and assessment offices.
     (f) From the point of view of BLGF, the policy changes that were applied to the
         project during the middle of its implementation significantly affected the
         potential of the project to achieve the desired objectives. While such policy
         changes may be good for the over-all standing of the national government, there
         is a need for an assessment on the potential impacts to projects that were already
         in the middle or almost end of implementation.

F. Conclusions

Overall, the LOGOFIND Project is generally successful in achieving its target objectives.
It contributed to addressing the challenges facing local development and finance in
varying degrees. Although it experienced many factors adversely affecting its
implementation, the implementing agencies and the PMO addressed these through
strategies, innovations, and policies. Future LGU credit-financing projects need to learn
from the diverse lessons learned in LOGOFIND implementation, build on the initial
successes of the Project and work on developing capital markets accessible to LGUs in
all income classes.
