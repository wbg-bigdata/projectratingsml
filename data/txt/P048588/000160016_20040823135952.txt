L     It .[ --      '   E 1    INTRODUCTION
-1 'E.1  TheSWEEP6emonstrationSub-Project
In qrder to address the severely deficient solid waste management (SWM) situation in the country, the
GoVertiment of the P.hilippines (GOP) has sought assistance from the World Bank (the Bank) for t#e
imO!ementation of a comprehensive SWM.' project, referred to as the Solid Waste Ecological
,   tEnlyncemeni Project'(SWEEP): SWEEP takes a nation-wide approach that will raise the awareness
of key decision makers about the conditions and the needs for immediate actions, and improve
-   I         teclinical and administrative'capacities of the Government SWEEP is;lthe first major nation-wide
ff   endfvour to improve this sector which has direct impact on environment and quality of life in urban
*S       I     area1;.
The IS WEEP. comprises four components, of which Component 3 iicludes the provision of engineered
sanikaryj landfills to a selected number of Local Government Units (LGUs) as Demonstration Sub-
Procjcts. In 'order to aaisfy' ihe requirements of the World Bank and be eligible to apply for the
*-       ; fundng. to'implement the Demonstration Projects, the GOP/LGU's were required to prepare an
r    investment report (IR) for each facility.
The najor components of the IR are the Environmental Impact Assessment (LIA), Feasibility Study
-'     '      (FS)| a; plan for Closure and Rehabilitation of Existing Dumpsites and a Terms of Reference for
impcmentation. These are hereafter collectively referred to as 'EIA/FS' in this document. The
W..'-,         *         Depan'neni orEnvirownent and Natural Resources (DENR) is assisting the LGU's in the study process
in a ficilih3tion role.                                                  ;

Golddr Associates was retained by the GOP and the Bank in April, 1998i to cany oujt the ETA/FS in
:accordance %vith the above noted ToR for the City of San Femando, one of the LGUs participating in the
Dem   stration Sub-Projects. The funding for the EIA/FS was provided by the Canadian International
Develppnent Agency IndUstrial Cooperation Program (CIDA-INC).
E.1.2  K iCey Objectives of the ProposedProject
The overall objective of the proposed  project (i.e. the construction/operation of an engineered
sanita4' landfill) is the development of an Integrated waste management facility for the service of the
populadon of San Fernando, La-Union which provides for the preferred, environmentally responsible,
socially acceptabld, cost eWfective and affordable alternative(s) for a 1o to 20 yeal planning period and
q            qualifies for implementation fundingfrom the World Bank.
The ke objcthes of the proposed project are:
i   to determine the waste disposal requirements of the study area for the selected planning period;
*   to qary out a defensible and rational landfill siting process;
*   to rrepare a preliminary design for the facility, assess potential impacts qn the natural and socio-
economic environment and develop necessary mitigation measures; -
to jre!are a restoration plan, including preliminary design and estimates of associated costs, for
clo'ing andi rehanititatiag existing dump sites within the participating LGU's;

Ei     PROJECT APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES
El.l    Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
The EJA for the proposed San Fernando landfill, including the EIA Scoping, was prepared in
acc,rdance with the requireiments of the DENR EIA Procedural Manual and thosd presented in the
Wo'ld Bank guidelines for conducting EIAs. In addition, the EIA addresses the pertinent
.1r]      .    requirements of CIDA-INC (i.e. the Canadian Environniental Assessment requirements).
E.2.2 . Scope of,the EIA
The scope of the EIA is based on the ToR and the respective guidelines of the Bank and the GOP. In
sum nary, it comprised the,following;
i              (a)    Task 1- Project Description
(b)    Task 2 - Project Alternatives
(c)    Task 3 - Existing Environment and Baseline Conditions Data Coilection [physical, biological .

(g)    Task '7 - Resettlement/Rehabilitation Action Plan
,tV         S             The riesults of the above tasks are to be presented in a report.
E.24 ;Key Issues Relpted to Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
L           2             A numnber'of key issues have arisen from a review of the existing legal and administrative framework
pertaining to solid waste management in the Philippines. In brief, with respect to the disposal of
MSWZ the principal issues are:
tliere is no single entity at present responsible for implementing and/or enforcing existing
Ilgislation relating to the management of solid wastes;
s ;        t. 1    *        although directives are now in place (DAO 9849 and DAO 98-50), there are no specific guiding
-   0          - documents available for the overall construction, operation and management of solid waste

*V !while there are specibib provisions regarding the discharge of treated effluent or planned
iemissions of certain pollutants to air, there are no provisions which regulate the standards to
which solid waste disposal sites should be designed and operated;
q,_,; *                | there are no specific provisiors to regulate the quality of emissions to ground or to air, whether
2planned or otherwise, that are typically generated by the disposal and decomposition of MSW;
and
: following receipt of an Environment Clearance Certificate (ECC), there is no formal regulatory
iprocedure (monitoring, enforcement) to ensure thit the detailed design, construction and on-going
operation of a solid waste disposal facility confor's with the performance standards envisaged at
'the time of project preparation.
I 'ne of the purposes of SWEEP is to address the above issues through the development of appropriate
L                          ntechanisms to improve the present Solid Waste Management practices and regulations in the
,.Ptilipputes.
1SocialAcccptal?llity
The social acceptability of this project is high in the population of the LGU as a whole, and relatively
hiloh in the local affected population. The LGU has undertaken a considerable process of social
IL.         t          '    peparation, and public consultations have been held with various stakeholder groups throughout the
l        cc,minunity. A national NGO, the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM), was hired by
the {DENR to design and implement a thorough stakeholder consultation process to ensure the
,q           .   plnicipalion of!all social groups in the consultations on this project. In addition, the Mayor of San
F{nando La UInion, 'ith the assistance of the DENR Regional Office, has been actively engaged in
raising local awareness'about garbage, health and sanitation issues, and is developing plans for
.. A-            P omoting source recycling and micro-enterprise opportunities from garbage and recycling.

_-       -,      ,      The CRity of San Femando currently collects about 40 tonnes/day of residential and commercial waste
from the urban barangays and operates a disposal site on an approximately 4 hectare parcel of land
that c  Inmenced operations in 1997. In 1999 it has implemented operational practices that are moving
the site :from an open dumpsite towards a Controlled Landfill as described in DAO 98-49. There is
I  t          organ,zed recovery of recyclables from the disposal site by waste pickers.'
Tech4ical studies undertaken as part of this EIA demonstrate that tl1e existing disposal site is creating
unacc,eptable impacts on groundwater quality and surface water runoff.
Y J        n            Even pith enhancements to the waste diversion programs, in terms of both recovery of recyclables
clnd'c4ntralized composting of organics from the market, as well as public education initiatives, it is
-. tevidet, that there will still .be a significant quantity of residual solid waste requiring disposal in the
future l The current disposal! site does not have adequate land area for a reasonable planning period
l-4          *(mhri0.numn 10 years), and as noted above engineered controls would be required at the disposal site to
impro4e erivironmental p6rforn,ance during operationsland after closure.
_Disposal by means of landfilling is the only viable approach for the City to consider. The DAO 98-49
legislation requires disposal facilities in San Femando to be upgraded to a Controlled Dump by 2003

UJ                      presented in this EtA report, the City can be expected to meet these requirements wvell in advance of
the stipulated time frame.
A site election process was undertaken to identify the preferred location for a sanitary landfill for the
U) -<iplannisig period. The preferred site includes the combination of the existing disposal site in Barangay
l5#          Mameltac and an adjoining parcel of land in Barangay Dalangayan Oeste.. This represents the Study
*  '         Area fqr the EIA.
As par of the site selectibn process,lan extensive background (secondary) information review was
l  t         carried out to 'assist the City of San Fernando to identify Candidate Areas and subsequently potential
Candidate Sites. The results of this process was reported to the DENR as part of the docutnentation of
the site selection process, including: a summary of the background information; projected rates of
|11'nk'icl!,'31 solid waste generation; an estimate of required landfill site area; potential areas
recomn iended  for further consideration;. potential sites within the  preferred  area; and
tr                  !    recornn eendations regarding the techtnically preferred site for the landfill in accordance with the
|ri L   cree,nig criteria. iThe majority of the background information was proyided by the DENR
and the City. In addition, information obtained from the various government,agencies in the
5 Phi iipfip-l,I and the observations made during the site visits were used, where appropriate.
*           The tectinical recommendations from this site selection process were originally provided to the DENR
and :he C-i in.draft for their consideration, in order that ilvvy or.t.d confirmfidentify,potential sites
within t4ierecorimended areas. Subsequently, the potential sites proposed by the City were assessed
L            I           and a rlcommendation regarding the ranking of those sites was provided'! so that the City could
proceed to select the preferred site and complete the necessary contractual documentation with the
r|   landowdier(s) for subsequent purchase of the property, if required.

Surf ce' water drainage in the study area is influenced by the terraces of the farm lands in the area.
Ther, are no distinct draiiage'courses located within the area, even though temporary channels appear
to foa  ' during major storm events. Any significant runoff from the Study Area (e.g. during major
i  stornsreek flows voefland through the terraces and temporary and/or intermittent ditches/swales
towa e'       I to,the south and Creek 2-to the north, and eyentually drains ihto San Femando Bay
via C  latan Lagoon. Surface water drainage at the existing site flows mainly as overland (sheet) flow.

1   11l ' and a ong the existing pathways and roads. The North Parcel drains predominantly in a northeast
directon to-the lower northeast comer of the property where it flows offsite as overland flow onto the
adjaa nt,agricultural fields. The South Parcel drains mainly southWard and continues to flows offsite
as overland flow onto the adjacent agricultural fields.
__ *         E.5.8  Surface Water Quaiity
As the  are no pnier .ial L ITdce water courses present within the study area, it was not possible to
* . *            assess th'e sirface water quality within-the study area during the baseline data collection program.
t i      ~~Howe er as noted above, thq -drainage from the study area eVeIrttially enters Carlatan Lagoon;
v      therefare, water quality in this lagoon was analyzed as' part of the baseline data collection to provide
*            ^   '      an indi.ation of receiving water quality conditions.
E.5.9  9roundwater Usie
In the mmediate vicinity' of the site, water for 'both domestic (potable) purposes and irrigation is
obtainoe from dug or dule. wells that are typically completed at depths of about 10 to 20 metres
below4 round;surface: A number of these wells are located within both the agricultural and housing

en ,ieered bottom lirer and leachate collection system to prevent ongoing pontamination of the off-
sit groundwater, There is no potential for the current or proposed landfill activities to affect the main
.we ler supplies of the urban area of San Fernando.

* Biatogica! Environment: Biological environment is a potential issue only in the South Parcel that
fqrms about forty percent of the proposed site, as the landfill (i.e. open dump) already exists on
-he rem inctrr. Of this forty percent, about half has been cleared and is used for housing and
farming purposes.
l   ,       *   Hwrman (Socio-economic) Environment
It i important to note that the proposed engineered landfill incorporates most of the proposed
mit gation measures in its design and ,-pe.eiiuo.; in order to minimize most, if not all,.of the potential
!enviromnental impacts.  , ie impact analysis indicates that the provision of these measures is positive
ear.d v ill reduce the sig6ificance of those environmental impacts from the present high levels (due to
.           the l resence of the,dumpsite) to minimal/insignificant levels.
In  riying out this impact assessment, the potential impacts have been identified by comparing the
r                        currSn! baseline conditions (the existing dumpsite in operation on the North Parcel and
iund veloped/developed land on the South Parcel) to the Conceptual engineered landfill design and

U. <                   designed, appropriate monitoring of the construction and operation of the proposed landfill, including
-   *        . a contingency plan, is essential for its environmental acceptability. This aspect is discussed in the
| |  '  ]      Environmental Management Plan.

The proposed landfill development will significantly improve the envilronmental cqnditions at the site
I           I q  n        and its vicinity over and above the present conditions (i.e; dumpsite). Also, the engineered landfill
l;      ia ||          would at the same time rehabilitate the existing dump and provide a planned, environmentally safe
I 4 r   1      facility.  Therefore, as oppksed  to typical infrastructure projects,, most of the project
componentstmeasures in 'this case are designed to reduce/ minimize the potential impacts and will.
upgrade the existing Controlled Dump to an Engineered Sanitary Landfill. In addition to the projectl
|Li !components/measures, mitigation measures have been proposed as additional measures to furtherl
i -   8        reduce the significance of the potential residual environmental impacts, or where the potential impacts
L          I"! fi        may not be adequately addressed by the project components/measures.                        |

meastes, cost estimates, the institutional mechanisms for implementation and associated
a  agrqe nintslguarantees. The mitigation measures and the implTmentation plan were combined to form
;  ean el 'Trbnmental management program, which includes a Monitoring Plan. Due to the environmentall
- sgnif cance of landfill developments and the potential implications of failure to properly implement
,.      3           any o the proposed mitigation measures and implementation plan components as designed/planned,
S  the EFIP al-o included a Contingency Plan. This Plan sets out a sequence d6 actions tobe taken in the
evenl that ongoing monritoring and observations indicate that the site is not performing as designed or
L7      fl           expec ed. Also, recommendations regarding the establishment of an Environmental Monitoring and
GCuara tee Fund has beenlincorporated in the EMP.
[7      ^E.8.1             Social Development P'ogram
The E MP includes a Social Development Program  (SDP), which discusses the programs or
rcopo ents of the proposed project which are related to 'social development and addresses the
mitigatoi of potential nqgative impacts, especially those associated with resettlement, relocation,  '
[7                  incom  lossI etc. The SDP focuses on two main populations that are most directly impacted by the
d           project the waste pickers and the landowners or tenants of the additional land required for the
r7      |expansn of the current site [i.e. the Project Affected People (PAPs)]. Extensive detail on the SDP
(i.e. comnpensaion measures) is provided in the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). In summary, the
RAP is;de5igned to ensure that the population directly affected by the project are provided with the
means, pnd the procedures, to ensure that their quality of life after the project's implementation, is as
good as,or better thtan previously. The plan is to be implemented by the City, ('ihe project proponent),
L;                  and defines and describes the monitoring program to be followed, as well as grievance procedures for
the afte ted parties should ihey wish to contest the implementation."
E.8.2  Environmental Monitoring
Moniton n Requirements and Monitoring Plan
The bas  principles to assist in the design of an environmental monitoring system are clear
objectivei, appropriateness, institutional support, quality control, flexibility and sustainability. It is
anticipated that two fundamental types of inspection and monitoring will be undertaken on-site:
*  Moni ting of compliance of site development to any specified conditions, including adherence of
site o eerations and management to the principles incorporated in project design; and
*  Envir nmental monitoring to assess the impacts arising from on-going site development and
0opera1ion.
The site operations should comply, at all times, with relevant National and Local Regulations.
Enviromn+ntal clearance will be required annually froti the DENR for operating the facility. Landfill
constructiqn and operations will be monitored by the DENR, independently of any inspectipn and
supervisioi of the service contract performed by the LGU, in order to ensure compliance with
prevailing lnvironmental legislation. The implementation of the mitigation and monitoring plan will
be the respnisibility of both the LOU and the DENR.

.A M4ulti-Partite Monitoring ream (MMT) will oversee the monitoring of the project, including RAP,
anc wilt be composed bf representatives from the project proponent (LGU), affected communities and
. wo en, relevant local;governmeni units (barangay), and PENRO and/or CENRO in the project area.
Th funcujons ofthe MMT will incLude- monitoring the project for compliance, gathering information
if d lmage occurs or public qomplaints are raised, priparing and disseminating monitoring reports and
sub nitting recommendations to the DENR, and conducting relevant community information and
edu -ation campaigns. The DENR Regional office and the EMB will provide support to the MMT in
tecl nical aspects or evaluation and policy monitoring.
En    nmental monitoring provides data to help confirm predictions of the environmental impact
assqssrnents, identify any environmental pollution due to site operation, identify'any deviations from
acceptaible standards of site bperation, and formnulate proposals for site remediation or contingency
[       m    e       a       ures, as necessary. The Site Operator will be responsible for carrying out the routine monitoripig
L       with the documented results forwarded to the LGU and the MlT on a monthly basis for
insp ecton and review.
*             The appropriate Philippines (DENR) environmental standards which are currently prescribed with
resp ct to surface water quality, groundwater levels and quality, air quality and noise levels will be
use to assess the mo4itoring results. It is also suggested that, where applicable, available World
:          F a      .    Bank'and World Health Organization (WHO) standards'should be used, for purposes of comparison.
The jproposed monitoring program Includes monitpring locations, frequency and parameters and
'.     0           ~~~~~wou drequire ithat the monitoring results are presented in an annual report. The monitoring program
i                       will avereewill h   to be continued into the post-closurTe period, with appropriate modifications based on the
resul 'of the monitoring during the operational period.  The duration of the post-closure period
monitdring should be determined based on these results and through discussions among the
r           t            stakeholders.
L.t         -The annual cost of the implementation of the proposed environmental monitoring program is a
1-6 a         anticipated to be approximately P 1,000,000, excluding the cost of RAP related monitoring which ip '
rJ            inclu ied in the cost of RAP implementation. It should be noted, based on the results of the first year
mon4oring. it may be possible to reduce the extent of monitoring which in tum would reduce the
aainn lmonitoring cost.
E.8.3  Contingency Plan
A derailed contingency plan!would be prepared as part of the detailed design in order to address the
ir-~                       potential environmental impacts in the event of possible inadequate performance or failure of a landfill
comp nent(s). The potential iifipacts that would be considered are leachate impacts on downgradient
grounrwater, impacts on air quality, and surface water impacts on downstream lands. The Contingency
Plan Iould specify trigger mechanisms to activate the appropriate components of a conli., Cnlc remedial
*i     I     measqre(s). In order to address the uncertainties associated with the existing environmental conditions
qi           and tl ie project proposals, it is proposed that the contingency implementation plan should comprise a
phase approach, tied to the trigger mechanism.
r   The r ,i:ger Mechanism is based upon a three-tier process, with each tier establishing a trigger for the
L                         initiati on of further action. The Trigger Mechanism is based initially upon the results of the-
'igrounwater quality monitoring program because of the significanci of potential groundwater impacts
I11         in the lrea over the potential impacts on other environments (e.g. surface water, air). The Mechanism
r  lJ anaduidnele a number of trigger parameters, typically indicative of leachate impact on groundwater,
and trigger concentrations.

iE 1.4  Site Closure tnd Restoration
1...      Tb pro~posed Ernironnmental Management Plan should consider long range planning to mitigate both the
_  !h  -term and long-term impacts of the project. As the landfill site will not be suitable for
res dential/commercial use, It could be used for passive recreation or low intensity agriculture once it
isa      As such, carabao grass may be the suitable surface cover to prevent soil erosion and dtst
res spension.
i E.8 5: Proposal For An Environmental Guarantee Fund (EGF)
tTh DENR EIS Procedural Manual (1998) requires that an Environmental Guarantee Fund (EGF) should
b be t tup as part oftheWproject and outlines the protocol and requirements for setting up an EGF. The
EG~ Lhotld bhe set up by the project proponents to cover the cost to implement damage prevention
mea uies, environmental education, scientific or research studies, IEC, and training including social
r                        equity programs in the event such a damage occurs. The need and requirements of the EGF should be
discjFssed between the City of San Fernando and the DENR prior to the implementation of the
proposed landfill project in order to prepare a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the EGF.
E.9 1' INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTS
E.9.  ;    Current Institutional Arrangements
t   f  Under SWEEP, it has been recommended that a Waste Management Authority (WMA) be
set u within an appropriate agency with the task of assisting all local authorities in carrying out cost
effedive and efficient waste management The proposed role and functiorgs of the WMA reside with
the I roject Management Office of the PTFWM. It acts as the central controlling unit for SWM-
related activities of the LGUs.
Loca I tinder the current set up in the City of San Fernando, SWM is the responsibility of the City  t
Engi eer's office. A SWEEP-PMO was formed in San Femando to assist the City in the
-impi metation of the SWEEP activities. This SWEEP-PMO is comprised of the representatives of
the  ty (Mayor's office, Planning Officer and City Engineer), DENR (Regional Director, CENRO,
PE   0) and a number of other stakeholders.
E.9.2  1Contractual ArTangemenIs
U 111        Aller aivs Arrangements: The nature of the relationship between the regulatory'authority and the
proje  developer is influenced by the contractual arrangements under which the project is
imple ented. In this regard, although a large number of possibilities exist, three scenarios are
consi red to be most suitable: i) the LGU would act both as Project Proponept and as the Project'
Devel per; ii) the LGU would be the Project Proponent but the design, construction, operations,
mainte nce, restoration and after-care, would be let out under contract to one or more Private Sector
j t.^   l           ~~~~~Contr ctors (PSC); or iii) an appropriate combination of the above two (e.g. design and construction
and operation for a number of years by a PSC and subsequent operation and aftercare by the LGU).
On the!basis of the proposed project details, the third scenario is considered the most rejlihiic solution
if the Frdject is to be implemented successfully given the present level of experience and expertise
within the LGU with re pe et l'o the design, construction and operation of engineered sanitary landfills
and thd long-term cost implication of the involvement of a PSC. The PSC would be selected by the
LGU nn the basis of a competitive tender to provide the requisite services to execute the project
! t <                    proposls.

Re iulzaio of the ContractinjPartfes: On the basis of a service contract as suggested above, the LGU
wo Id be the owner of the landfill facility, while the PSC would be the occupier of the site. In this
sit ution there are two possibilities for regulation of the contracting parties: the regulatory authority
lice sps the Site Occupier to undertake specified works and operations at the site according to any
conditions attached to the license; or the regulatory authority licenses or permits the Site Owner to
und rfake specified works and operations-at the site! -the Site Owner is obliged to ensure that the Site
jOccupier complies with the conditions of the permit or license granted to the Site Owner. The latter
_,_       ;i      I   ' opti )n1is seen to be a more effective solution as it places greater responsibility on the Site Owner.

-ProposedOrganizational Structure
r  l . Asl YcA oject Proponent, it is proposed that the current organizational set-up in the City be expanded to
acco   odate the various activities related to the implementation of the engineered' landfill
development. It is anticipated that a Solid Waste Management Office, either as a separate department
or w,der the City's Engineering or Planning Departments, would be established and be responsible for
all adti"ities associated with solid waste management.
As ubted above, a Multipartite Monitoring Team (MMIT) will be created to oversee the public liaison
__ ,       tand               pnitoring activities.
l           9            E.9.4  Technical Assistance
11*1          Therc is growing awareness in the Philippines, including the City of San' Fernando, of the pressing
problems of solid waste management. However, the Project Proponent (the LGU) and the regulatory
L.                 ,     authoity (the DENR) have very limited expertise and experience with respect to the design an
l             operamin of engineered 'anitary landfills. It would be important to have experienced and qualified
X 1 -   |     perso nel in key positions both within the LGU and in the responsible section of the DENR in order
,lfor thproposed project to succeed. In view of this, it is recommended that appropriate technical
l '                       - assist nce be sought, at least during the initial stages of the project implementation.  ;
- ' The a bsence of experience in engineered landfills in the Philippines places considerable emphasis
upon ie need to train all concerned parties on all aspects of the construction and operation of an
.   enginiered sanitary landfill. In this regard and in response to the requirements of CIDA INC, a
-           .Training'and Human Resources Development Program has been prepared. Therefore, some form of
r                      *technial assistance is a pre-requisite for successful implementation of the project.
! ' 0 ! l A
,The urit appointed by the LGU to undertake project and construction management should encompass
'   appro iite technical expertise in the design and operation of modern landfills. This expertise is
presemly a nilable only from i'temational sources, from either individual consultants or consulting
enginers. Thiis is indicated by the inclusion of an Independent Third Party Consultant in the
propos¶d organizational structure.

1.1    Projecl Background
I     1.1.1  - The Solid Waste Ecological Enhancement Project (SWEEP)
The olid Waste Managemnent (SWM) sector in the Philippines is in a critical condition. Deficient
S     severely constraints urban productivity in the Philippines. Urban areas l ... face increased
press reito improve SWM, as urban populations have grown rapidly, especially in many secondary i
cities nthe Philippines. Projections for the next 15 years indicate -that an additiohal 12 million people
in citi will generate solid waste, which will further worsen the situation.
L          t3           In ord r to address the above SWM situation, the Government of the Philippines (GOP) has sought
assis  ce from the World Bank (the Bank) for the implementation of a comprehensive SWM project,
Cra                     referre to as the Solid Waste Ecological Enhancemenit Project (SWEEP).. SWEEP takes a nation-
-   w ;ide a proach that will raise the awareness of key decision-makers about the conditions and the needs
for imn  iate actions, and improve technical and administrative capacities of the Government.
' I                     SWErE' is the first mrajor:nation-wide endeavor to improve this sector, which has direct impact on
enviro ment and quality of life in urban areas. Through continuous discussions between the Bank
r         jand of acis of the GOP, the scope of SWEEP was identified in'1997.
The ob ectives of SWEEP have been defined as follows:
*  As 115 panicip3iing Local Govemment Units (LGUs) to undertake pilot projects that are based on
slrjiegki plaruning of integrated SWM.systems and have demonstration impacts; and
Es bfish national and local support mechanisms in the sector in order to safeguard the
env ronment and encourage private sector involvement.
Inorder to achieve the above objectives, SWEEP is comprised of the following components:
. CON PONENT 1. NATIONAL POLICY FORMULATION: This compgnent will assist the GOP in
forr ulat ing and implementing a national policy framework for solid waste,management;

'L1.2  j Management o° Munlcipa Solid Wastes
The Local Government Code (Republic Act 7160 of '1991) places overall responsibility for solid
wast management (SWM)vryith the LOUs. These,responsibilities include collection, storage and
dispo al of the municipal solid waste (MSW). The LGUs are responsible for the environmentally
sount management of the solid waste collected within their jurisdiction under the Sanitation Code
(PD  5q of 1975) ar,d the Pollution Control Act (PD 984 of 1978).
The   ost prevalent method of disposal of MSW currently used in the Philippines is open dumping.
Open UmpS, however, impact the environment by generating leachate, landfill gas and contaminated
L         |            runo  and as a result have the potential to affect public health and the safety of the population. Some
of the signiffcantenvironmental impacts from open dumps are as follows:
* ai quality degradation due to smoke, dust and foul odours
*  d gradation of sanitation apd aesthetic conditions due to the presence of insects and vermin, and
p tential vectors that may spread diseases
l*  de ,radation of surface water and groundwater quality

1.1.3  Nalld2nal Strategy to Improve Solid Waste Management
In re ognition of the problems besetting SWM in the Philippines, Uinder Presidential Administrative
|   ~;      Orda No. 90 (signed October 1993), an integrated National Solid Waste Management Systems
From  aork (INSWMSF) was adopted under the auspices of the Project Management Office (PMOI
of th Presidential Task Force on Waste Management (PTFWi.
One i n4cipal objective of the INSWMSF is the secure disposal of solid waste, at the highest level of
prote4 ion to public health and safety and to the environment as a whole, commensurate with what is
|  afforc Ole. b  A medium-ternn goal of this aspect of the INS WMSF is the phased closure of all Open
dump sites and their replacement by more environmentally secure methods of waste disposal.
1.1.4  The Demonstration Sub-Project in San Fernando City
| l     .    As a art of Component 3 of SWEEP, i.e. the Demonstration Sub-Project, the World Bank has
propo ed to loan the Government of the Philippines (GOP) the funds required to implement modern
5 t t        solid zya1ste management facilities (landfills) for selected LGU's within the seven regions of the,
- countrb. In order to satisfy the requirements of the World Bank and be eligible to apply for the
e- '~   i         .fundinl, the GOPILGU's were required to catty out demonstration suLiLprojects and prepare an
|'investnent report (IR) for each facility.
I                i,      l             ! i
Thue n yor comnponents of the IR are the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Feasibility Study
I(I5.S), t  sure and Rehabilitation of Existing Dumpsites and a Terms of Reference for implementation.
These  ehereafwr collectively referred to as 'EIAIFS' in this docuinent. The DENR is assisting the
II LU' i the study process in a facilitation role. The GOP's and Bank's Terms of Reference (ToR) for
the E IF5 is included as Appendix A. 1
{  The D:I) R conducted a detailed process to select suitable candidate LGUs to participate in the SWEEP
detn    on project.  At the initial stages of the SWEEP activities (I.e. late 1997), 4 LGUs were
Iidentified da suitable (i.e. willing and able) participants. These LGUs, with the assistance of the GOP,
|retaine I  consultant to prepare the EIAWFS for the proposed landfill development. Substquetly, in
Ierly l 98, two additional , LGUs, including San Fernando, La Union (refer to Figure 1.1 for location),
were idtnhfied to participate in the demonstration projects.

L,      ^             The FS (Stage 1) has identified a number of project elements for development, for which preliminary
d!signs (Conceptual Design) have been prepared, particularly for the works required to upgrade the

pr fefrred landfill site. These essentially comprise Tasks I to 6 described in the World-Bank ToR under
fie n V  Feasibiliiy Siud).  These technical taskststiidies provided the 'informiation on existing
en ironmental/baseline condiiors needed to prepare the preliminary design and subsequently perform
lhi  mpact assessment, and included:
^  V            *| Obtain available topographic mapping and carry out a topographic survey on the site to prepare a
.abe plan of the site.
l                     * .  tqarry out detailed site reconnaissance.
.   The drilling of 5detailed boreholes with groundwater monitor installations to determine the nature
of the subsurface conditions (soil and groundwater) and hydrogeology (depth to water, horizontal
and vertical gradients, groundwater flow direction and flow rates) on the site. A number of existing
test pits was .,examined to better'visually observe and exatnine the upper 4 metres of the subsurface
conditions. Geotechnical laboratory testing was carried out tor characterize the physical properties'of
dtie soils. A limited number of groundwater and surface water samnple~,1were recovered and analyzed
for general chemical characteristics. The nature of groundwater usage in the area of the site was also
detemiintd frol  ei.i inf,)iiration and discussions with residents ofthe study area.

EIA Reportl,
K             The EIA report was prepared;in a form that is suitable for submission to the Philippine agencies for
r        M            app al and to the World Bank for financing approval. It includes a project description, project
altern tives (i.e., sites, routes, technologies) and associated analysis and decision making processes
and p o'vides a summary of the significant environmental issues and proposed. mitigative measures,
[     U           ' ; o inclu ng a discussion of.the way in which public participation had been accounted for in the decision
*  maki  j rocess. The more detailed specific component investigations and studies that formed the
basis or the EIA are provided in the form of appendices in an accompanying volume, with a
sumr    of relevant findings provided in the EIA report.
;13.4  The Study Area
The p Posed engineered landfill is to service the City of San Fernando (refer to Figure 1.1,' for
* oat ioCi) and therefore its benefits will encompass the entire City. However, for the purposes of the
ElA, t e tstudy area is specifically that which would be directly affected by the proposed landfill
constr eion and operation activities. This area is considered to include the proposed site and its
: immed e vicinity, ipcluding the'access roads (refer to Scoping Report in Appendix B). Where
appropriate, envirofunental and social issues associated with the proposed development were
L         Q          iaddresjd in this EIA if they are considered to be a direct result of this development.
It shoul be noted that, as part of the site selection process discussed below (refer lo Section 3.5),
altern   areas within the City were initially evaluated to come up with a preferred area for further
gr^  . '    conside tion.  This eva4uation was carried out as a screening level assessment of potential
rt1        environ bentai impacts, using a 'number of screening criteria and a compatible baseline data collection

1.3.   Integration of the EIM and the Feasibility Study
_ ' ;  The redominant components of a engineered sanitary landfill-are essentially engineered measures to
avoi or minimize;potential environmental impacts, unlike most typical infirastructure development
proji cts such as a road development. Therefore, the technical studies associated with the FS, such as
..       ,   the h  tainment design, have to be closely integrated with the ETA. In view of this, the concept
desi  of ihe landfill and the associated field investigation and public consultation activities for the FS
iL          -         ,- wer conducted in conjunction with the baseline data collection, public consultation and impact
as  sment, mitigation anrd monitoring plan development activities.

MThe EJA for the proposed San Fernando landfill, including the EIA Scoping, was prepared in
'acco dance with the requirements of the DENR EIA Procedural Manual and those presented in the
r          uWan d Bank guidelines for conducting ElAs.              In addition, the EIA addresses the pertinent
requ riements of CIDA-INC (i.e. the Canadian Environmentgl Assessment requirements). The details
of tl e ~IA Scoping are presented in a Scoping Report, dated.March, 1999 (refer to Appendix B).
: The CIDA-INC requirements specifically include assessments of Gender Equality and Training
Nee s,' These CIDA-INC assessments are not requirements of the World Bank or the Philippines EIS
proc ss, but have been included here as they contribute to the thoroughness and strength of the overall
imp ct'assessment.

1.4.2  National Level Scoping
As nvied above, the subject landfill project is a demonstration component of SWEEP, a nationwide
so id 0%aste management program. In order to meet the demonstration aspect of the project objective,
a natinal level scoping meeting was held in January, 1998, prior to the involvement of Golder
Asso iates in SWEEP, between the DENR representatives (EMB and PTFWM), EIARC members
and 'e preparers of thel ETA for four of the original six LGU demonstration landfill projects. The
detail 3 df this meeting were presented in the EIA report for the proposed Iloilo landfill.
M  j  .  At the national level scoping meeting, DENR introduced the Scoping Guidelines as part of the
DENRk's Procedural Manual for ElAs in the Philippines.
The f llowing major environmental issues arising from the proposed demonstration sub-projects were
identi led during the national level scoping meeting:
.   Tle potential impacts on surface water and groundwater; and
a*  Ptentiai impacts on the livelihood of the waste pickers in the existing dump sites of the
q t  w  !        re¶pective LGUs.
L                   The alove issues were incorporated in the scope of the proposed San Fernando landfill EIA, as
descriled below.
1A t vL Scoping Meeting with EIARC and DENR
lThe D,NR Procedural Manual recommqnds that the EIA Scoping should be conducted in three
l  S t   hss re-scoping, scoping and post-scoping. The pre-scoping involves the following steps:

22.    POLICY, LEGAL AND AI        tIN lSTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
42.    Introduction
TI isSrciicn presents .he policy, le, di and a.!:nio.r4ihe framework goveming environmental
-mt         ,   m nagement ii iha Philippinies, with!  Liu.ular reference to the'reguaii'ons governing SWM and the
ureiurements for Environmental Im  IAssessment (EIA). The specific procedures for project
-f <   !  t     evaluation and approval are also disc ussed.
* a;       eP,rc jtst prtptsals must comply wiih applicable environmental policies, legislation,' regulations and
gui elines of the Govemnment of the Philippines and the World Bank. Specifically, before an
engineered (sanitary) landfill can be Implemented in the City of San Fernando (La Union), an EIA of
the project proposals must be prepared, evaluated and approved in accordance with prevailing
en: irionmental pollciesand associalted regulations and guidelines.
-:In lditio to the above, the preparation of the EIA was supported'also by the Canadian International
De elopment Agency Industrial Cooperation Program (CIDA-INC) and, therefore, the EIA was also
pr lared in general accord,ance with the applicable requirements of CIDA-INC (e.g. the Canadian
'Environnental AssessmeritAct).- in particular, tle socio-economic assessment included the carrying
.out orasseismenis and thepreparation of additional reports ongenderequality and trainingneeds.
2.2    LegalFramework
i 7              ' 2.2.:  The Philippine Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) System
The Philippine Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) System was implemented in 1979 by virtue of
Presiderllial Decree (PD) 11a. 1586 and has undergone several refinements and revisions since that
date DEN;R Administraiive Order (AO) No. 37, Series of 1996 (DAO 96-37), replacing DAO 92-21,
sets ut the current legal framework for ELA in the Philippines.
. C                .s.5i... ....
-: | '   'l  ',The  IA process requires that an EIS, must be prepared for all projects or undertakings within the
cate ry of Environmentally Critical Projects (ECP), regardless of their location. ECPs are those
proje Is deemed to have a high potential for negative environmental impacts as listed under PD No.
2146 Steries of 1981 and PD No. 803, Series of 1996. In addition, the President may designate a
proje t as an ECP in accordance with Section 4 of PD No. 1586, The agency responsible for the
' :            !          . imple mentation of the EIS system for ECPs Is the Environmental Managetpent Bureau (EMB) of the

The~ development of the proposed MSW  disposal component of the preferred waste management
syst m for San Femnando has been guided by the provisions of both new DAOs. In San Fernando
City~ the conversion of its open dump site into a Controlled Dump was completed i-n late 1998, ahead
ofeshed Iprescri~ed in DAQ, 98-49. The proposed conversion of this Controlled Dump to an
erii ere snitrylandfill, e%pi~:Id to be implemented in 2001,adheres to DAC)9849. Sim-ilarly,
-   the roposed sitefor the engineered landfill was identified using the site selection process stipulated in
Thc) oerning body responsible for the quality of water is the DENR. Freshi surface waters are
classl fld into five sub-categories (AA, A, B, C   and D) according    to their potential
benef'calIdesignated use, while coastal and marine waters are classified into four sub-categories (SA,
r                  ~~~~~~~SB,  and SD), again according to their potentieal beneficial/designated use.
Class s AA and SA generally have the most stringent water quality criteria requirements and Classes
D an SD generally the least stringent waiter quality requirements. Section 69 of DAO 90-34 specifies
year average values, or in soine Instances the mnaximum value, of a range of physical, biological and
chemi al parameters for each class of water. -,Pcilable water supply (Class AA or Class A) should

The qi~al'ity of any effluent or waste discharged from any mianufacturing planit, industrial plant or

The D ENR is the inain government agency involved in solid waste management in the Phiiippines. It,
[         a            Is the ;rimary agency responsible for the conservation, management, development and proper use of
the co intry's environment and natural resources.

r          qi          The E MB is the main office concerned with waste management within DENR. Besides being a
regula ory agency concerned with the implementation of the policy to maintain a reasonable standard
r                      . for air and water quality, the functions of EMB include the formulation of rules and regulations for the
prope disposal of solid wastes and toxicand hazardous substances.
r One u it:within EMB has direct responsibility for waste management issues. The Chemicals and
Waste   anagement Section supervises the implementation of the "Toxic, Hazardous Substances and
r                       Nucle r Wastes Control Act of 1990" (Republic Act 6969). The Section is also responsible for
providjng draft policy guidelines to the DENR on hazardous waste management and technical
assista ice to industry, regional offices, NGOs and other public and private entities. This Section was
i            i          -also or ginally active in SWM, but these activities were transferred to the PMO-PTFWM when it was

2.3.3  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
Waste l ianagement has not been a priority within the DTI in the past since most of the emphasis has
been o  attracting industry through incentive programs; waste treatment regulations have been
consieed generally to be a disincentive to private sector investments. However, the supporting
-t^                   memor¶ fda to AO No. 90 setting up the PMO-PTFWM     explicitly tasked the DTI to prepare

A pubiic hearing is a valpable mechanism for communicating the aims of the projev-t and allowing
*  residu4l public concerns to be voiced and discussed. A public hearing can signifi-antly mininmize
socio:conomic impacts and reduce.. jcct risl-s during implementation.

r   Following the issne of an- ECC, the detailed design of -the proposed development would require a
building/develnprnent permnit from the LGU (including consultation with the Local Air Transport
Office" as nece.;saryl. In addition, all industries, establishments or facilities which- have need to
discharge ireate] ehfluent or wastewater or emit pollutants to air must obtain a Permit to Operawe
r  (P/) upon completion of each such facility. The PlO is issued by the DENR Regional Office up. o
echieving confurmance to the relevant emission and/or discharge standards.
2'6      jSlimmary of Key Issues
l     of key issues have arisen from a review of the existing legal and administrative fra: ework
pertaining to solid waste management. In brief, with respect to the disposal of MSW, the p1 incipal
|issues are:
*  theie is' no single entity at present responsible for implementing and/or enforcing existing
lxegiIation relating to the management of solid wastes;                               <
- r            i       . | .  alih IMigh directives are now in place (DAO 9849 and DAO 98-50). there are no specitL: g, l ling

In Solid Wasle Management EIA's, "Alternatives To" includes the Do-Nothing aitemative (i.e.,
maintaij the current silu3tion) as %ell as alternalive strategies or Lechnolggies to the three main
components of a solid waste management system- waste collection, diversion of materials from
dispossl, and dispos3l of rosidual waste. The alternative strategies and technologies are.evaluated on
the basis oravailaLi:iry, technical feasibility and economics. The preferred combination of these three
main components defines the preferred waste management system.
MA1ternatives For' the undertaking. In this case the preferred waste matnagement systent, refers to the
altemative ways for implermenting the system, and selection of the app bach1 that optimizes the
s System. The preferred altetatives are those that result'in acceptable envirotinental impacts and are
___; '       l techni1lly and economically viable. For example, in terms-of engineered landfill sites, this includes 
the site seleclion process and the preferred approach to design and operations that optimizes the

barangaysiis very low compared to Jih. urban barangays. Where there is no collection, due to both the
distance and absence of all, weather .oac.s in the interiolr barangays, solid waste (garbage) management
consists of small scale burning and burial. 
3.2.3  'Waste Composition
___          The City's planning document presents al roximate composition of the solid waste collected in the
City. It is predominantly organic (about .)%) with the rest made up of plastics, paper, glass, etc.
Also, the majority of the waste comes fron the domestic/residential area antd a significant amount of'
the organic waste being collected in the Ci' y rnarket area.
j-i U'e  3  teriz it:'ai studies have not been conducted in the City and, therefore, no City specific
waste composition data is available. Hiowever, for, the purposes of the ETA and the FS, it is
i considered sufficient to use waste composition data available for other similar municipalities in the
Philippines. A summary of waste composition to date for a number of Philippino cities and the City
of Comlubo, Sri Lanka is presented in Table 3.1.
32.4   Waste Generation
The rate of solid waste generation in the City was estimated by the City in 1997 at'14 tonnesJday.
-isi         This was considered low for the area covered and the population served compared to the information
'aila   for other Phiippines cities and in published literatureX  Therefore, the City commenced a
program in 1998 to monitor the amouit of solid waste that was being disposed at the dump site by
. keepirig records of the number of trucks that bring the waste to'the dump (i.e. truck counts).
The City has recorded truck counts since August, 1998 and these data indicate that approximately 200
m3/d.i of solid waste is being presently collected. At an uncompacted density of approximately 200
kIg/m'and' a solid waste capacity of the trucks of approximately 8 n3/truck,' this translates to a
collectlion rate of about 40 tonnes/day.
As tlhe existing waste generation data are limited, the future wasteigeneration/collection rates were
predicted using other available information for site selection and landfill design purposes, as described
in Section 3.3. This prediction suggests the 1998 waste generation rate should have been about 35
tonneslday,,wwhich is comparable to the estimate based on truck counts, i.e. 40 tonnes/day.

life' As discussed during the initial visit, this is proposed as a minimntand, providing there is
available land, an even longer planning penod of say IS to 20 years could be considered during the
detailed design phase.
An assessment of present and future waste quantities for the City of San Femnao was carried as
described below:
InformationprovidedbythepElR and/or CitvofSanFernando. LaUnion:-
*  City populition in '1995 was 91,943. The Urban barangay pbpulation was 67, 913 and that in the
,4 fi!      .rural barangays was 24,030 (refer to Table 1, Appendix C);  !
*2Av&rage annual populaton growth rate is 1.59%;
r  Approximately 200 m' of solid waste per day is being-disposed at the existing dump site (based
on ru ck counts, as noted above). This volume inchitdes the materials that are being recycled at
thelsite by the waste pickers;
*. Rat of solid waste generation commonly used for cities in the Philippines by solid waste
mapagement practitioners is 0.5 kg/capitalday. This rate is based on the results of studies carried
out f,r cities in the Philippines, including that for Metro Manila (this rate is also comparable to
that presented fMr developing countries in published literature);
Assumptions:
The following assumptions have beer, made in estimating the waste generat on rate for the proposed
qw  Z       *   The proposed engineered landfill will commence operation in year 2001;
*   The waste already being disposed in the existing dump site (from 1997) will be incorporated in
the proposed engineered landfill facility. It is noted that, based on infornation available
regarding present collection coverage and observations made at the dump site, the estimated
*  q            qubntity of the waste that has already been disposed at the dump is expected to be larger than the
*   actually disposed quantity;

*   Waste collection will cover the entire urban Barangay area (refer to Figure 6, Appendix C, for
approximate location of urban area). It should be noted that, the collection resources presently
available to the City are not sufficient to effectively cover the entire urban Barangays;
*  No waste diversion will be practiced during the landfill life. However, some waste diversion is
presently being practiced it the site (e.g. recycling by waste pickers), effectively reducing the
waste disposed at the dump. The City intends to continue this practice, together with compost, rn-
of separable organic materials, as part of the proposed landfill operation; and
*  No increase in solid waste collection beyond the urban Barangay areas is planned through .ie
landfill life.
Based on the above information and assumptions, an estimnate of waste generation was prep. ed as
presented in Table 2a, Appendix C (no waste diversion). In order to demonstrate the effects of u ture
waste diversion efforts by the City (through recycling, composting, etc.) on the required landfi a ea,
t            w           this area was estimated assuming 10%, 20% and 30% 'waste diversion rates and the resu ts are
presented in, Tables 2b (10% waste diversion), 2c (20% waste diversion) and 2d (30%/b waste
diversibn) in Appendix C. The results of these estimates are also shown on Chart 1. Appendix
it should be noted that these estimates are based on a number of what were considered cons, rvative
assumptions as noted above and, therefore, resulted in conservative values for.the predict, i waste
generajion rate.
U           3.4     Alternative Waste Management Systems
r                        3.4.1 Ilntroduction
As decribed previously, the main components of any solid waste management system are waste
clulecdioii, diversion of materials from becoming waste, and waste disposal.
The CiiN of San Fernando is currently generating approximately 40 tonnes of waste per day and
collecting and disposing it at their landfill site. The objective of reducing the quantity of waste
-<     I    niateriaisl requiring final disposal (through the 3R's- reduce, re-use and recycle) is recognized world
r wide, and has been incorporated by the GOP into their principles of Ecological Waste Management to
address, the increasing waste management problem in the Philippines. However, it must be recognized
that regardless of the waste management components selected and their implementation, there will
r              4           always be a need for final disposal of some quantity of material that cannot be diverted. Collection of

'   |     materialsi requires a certain amount of equipment and manpower in order to achieve the collection
objectives with acceptable frequency and efficiency, but the main limiting factor in collection is the
-t ~  J   presence prabsence of all-weather roads and travel distance between the source and the disposal site.
x    I
In: San Fernando, and similarly for many other LGU's in the Philippines, it is reasonable to work
I towards achieving a certain percentage of diversiorn (either at source or at the disposal facility) and
then piati accordingly and implement an environrnentally sound approach for disposal. Once a
*         4         sustainable approach for collection and disposal is in place for the planning period, additional efforts
r         X         can be difected at increasing the diversion of materials.
The DAO 98-49 sets out the characteristics of four different types of wastelldisposal facilities for
X:        d         implemesjtation in the Philippines, ranging from Open Dumpsites. through Controlled Landfills to
Sanitary iandfills Level I and II. It is important to recognize that the requirements or cornponents
i|needed t develop .'a particular site to meet acceptable environmental standards is site specific,
depending in large part on the site setting, supsurface coqditions and the nature of the adjacent land
, r       |         use. Therefore, it is not necessary that all sites of a - :nicuiar type incorporate all of the features set
out in the DAO 98-49. RatIher, it is important that each site be assessed individually and that the
appropriate features be incorporated to achieve an acceptable and affordable level'of environmental
r                   planning, design and management of the disposal facility.
*l u                3.4.2- The "Do Nothing" Alternative
The 'do-nothing" alternative is that the existing site in San Femando would continue to be used for
disposal of wastes, and waste diversion through the removable of recyclables would continue by
waste pick ing in the landfill when the mateial is tipped from the collection vehicles.
In terms of wvaste collection, the waste ctnrrently being collected originates from the urban barangays,
and due to the lack of all weather roads and the travel distances it is not proposed under the evaluation
of "alternatiyes to" to collect,waste from the mountainous barangays for disposal at the current site.
Therefore, from a collection perspective under the "do-nothing" scenario, the proposed service area
within the City wiU remain essentially the same as the present situation, although there could be some
improvements made to the collection operations in terms of efficiency and coverage.

There afe two maia factors o be considered in the evaluation of the 'do-nothing" option and its
sustainability in both the shoii term and long term:
7                       1. The present site is only a :tually 3.3 hectares in area. There is currently no developn.e.ut plan on
which to base the expect. XI life of the site. However, based on the waste generatio!i projections
_an4 assuning an orderly  taping of the available portion for waste disposal, it is rxpected that
:with continued utilization * f the site it would be filled in a few years time. This would not
*p Frovide sound solid waste m  sp *men.lr planning for the City, since they would be faced relatively
soon with having to establish at 'other disposal site.
2. Asi discussed fully in Section 6.( of this report, there are significant environmental concerns with
the existing disposal p,actices. 'I -, is evidence that the dumping of the waste without adequate
enyiromnnental controls has begun to adversely affect groundwater qtn. ir, beneath and
downgradient from the c6irreit tispo 31 area. 4It. is noted that there art irrigation wells
l immediately downgradient of the site that are in use (which are showing evldence of leachate
effeci). andsomewhatfurther awayyarewellsusedforwatersupply. Also,.dusingwetterperiods
.t ofih: year there,is runoffofsE'il_'c water that has been contamninated.by :;, tiill leachate onto
th adjacent agricultural lands to the north. Continued use of the site under its present operational
tractices will result in increased degradation of groundwater and surface water quality beyond the
limits of the property, causing pollution and degradation of adjacent land use and possibly land
value. Depending on the degree of adverse effects on water quality in the future, it could become
L,            S               necessary for the City to provide altemative water supply for irrigation and drinking purposes
*3 ' ' from a further distance away and pipe the water to the residents and/or land users.
Aiihou',lh the City has undertaken meaningful improvements to the operation of its current disposal
site  " it is apparent that continuation of the current practices does not represent sound, longer term

It is concluded that the '"do-notliinge alternative is not the approach for the City of San Femanrdo to
adopt for the long term, enviramnentally acceptable approach to management of their municipal waste
into ihe future.
3.43   WasteDiversion
jThis' important component of the waste management system aims at achieving the maximum
4 * reduction in the amount of waste material being sent to disposal. This has beneficial environrmiental
effects and as shown in Section 3.3 also can significantly extend the life of the landfill site. The
pnrmay components that comprise waste diversion are each discussed-below as they relate to the San
Fernando situation.
fRedActio.n
Waste reduction has the most beneficial effect on the environment since it eliminates the need to
develop and utilize other waste management activities to manage the waste. It has been shown that of
the jR's, waste reduction should be given the highest priority. Both household generators of waste
and'generators in the industrial, commercial and institutional (ICI) sectors can undertake waste
e"              treduction initiatives.
.   Waqse reduction initiatives, at the residential household level initially requires public education, in'
*   order that the consumer makes purchases that will ultimately result in the reduction of the amount of
residual or waste after the goods have been used. Examples include goods that are more durable,
goob that are designed to be reused (i.e., are not one-time use or disposable) and purchasing goods
s     s  , ~thatae less packaging. Ai ICI establishments, waste reduction primarily involves changes to theirX
!prozsses and their approach to purchasing.
It his been shown' throughout the world that waste generation rates increase as urban development
occurs, urbanization increases, and the standard of living rises. Urbanization is increasing in the City
of San Fernando, as more development occurs within the poblacion (City center) and the population
increases. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the waste generation rate per capita will increase to
some degree above the current rate. Even if the rate remains similar to that which currently exists, the
total, quantity of waste generated will increase as the population increases.

The City,of San Fernando, at both the City: 5x ernienr and barangay government levels, is interested
in providing educational programs aimed at waste minirmization, in order to reduce the amount of
waste generated overall, with particular emphasis on the portions of the City to be served by the waste
managenient system.   Specific educatica,al programs will be developed and implemented in
association with the SWEEP dernonstrailo;-
Reuse
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reuse can be defined as the return of a product to use by either reusing it or by finding a new use for
;it without;modifying it. Reuse of materials is the second priority in the 3R's, below reduction but
abbve rec"cling. Increasing the amount of materials that are reused also depends greatly on public
education and attitude, convenience and economics (simjlar to waste reduction). This component of
the 3R's can also be implemented to the extent possible as part of the public educational programs
described above. For example, the economic attractiveness of material reuse could be increased by
implementing a user pay system for household (and commercial) waste collection.
gRecoVery and Recycling
-'         i     l t  Waste recycling involves the sorting, c:.l:rrr and processing of waste material so that it can be used
for a similar or different purpose. Recovery and recycling is less desirable than reduction and reuse
since it consumes energy and resources., However, in the Philippines and other dc. el.;pi  countries,
'  cycliiig is an important source of livelihood and income for a certain sector of the p.- liii q- n who
are involved in scavenging/waste,picking and the sale of the recycled items. This is also true of San
Femando, and is an important socioeconomic factor in ;the development of the waste management
Fi,          43      I   system antl Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) as discussed later in the EIA report.
There are two main approaches to recycling. The first is termed direct particip'ation and involves the
separation of the recyclable items at the source (at the home or business), which then requires
:1        ii minimum processing of the recyclable materials before marketing them. The second is indirect
participation where there is minimal source separation and a much higher level of energy needs to be
expended to separate the recyclables from the mixed wastes and process them for marketing.
The City of San Femando currently has an organized recovery and recycling practice at the existing
disposal'site. In brief, the recycling concession is given for a fee to one person (at present the

- Barahgay captain), who organizes the waste pici ers, pays them for the recyclable materials that they
recover from the collection vehicles after they ar dumped at the disposal site, and then markets the 1
Trecydable materials. Glass, metal, polyethylen -, paper of various grades and cardboard are the
primary items thiat are currently recovered and ma:keted.
Althoigh this indirect approach to recycling is e fective to a degree in reducing the amount of waste
for disposal, it is considered that there could b a highet level of materials recovery for recy4.;.
achieved. However, in countries where waste management is developing, the implementation of
forrnal systems has often been less successful than hoped for two main reasops. Firstly, the use of
mechanized systems for tnaterials iet rr ..'.... 1 has a very high capital cost and is expensive to operate
and maintain ct . 1.3. i ;o the ir..Jii: r .l approach to mantual waste picking. Secondly, the economic
viability of recycling is highly dependent on the ..B i.i:i:i:, and  .-I.a:; h c,f markets for the
recovered materials, which are quite variable over time.  i
Consideration can also be given to implementing source separation, however this requires a char ge in
household approaches and practices, separation and storage of materials at the home/busines and a
*           change in the collection practices and perhaps the collection vehicles to segregate the recyclal,. es from
the waste. Source- separation would also have an adverse economic impact on ihose wb. re;y on
waste picking for their income, unless those involved in waste picking are incorporated into - te source
f7~~-
separation activities. As an example, in the City of Dumaguete, Negros Oriental a numt,.:r of the
waste pickers were proyided by the City with carts for the door-to-door collection of i.:cydlable
mate;ials in certain,barangays. They pay the individual householders for the rrtaterials, the Chy pays
the c6llector and the City is then responsible for the marketing of the materials. This type o0 initiative
could also be organized as an individual enterprise under an agreement with the City, sim lar to the
currerst recycling activity.
It is considered that an appropriate approach to further developing the recycling efforts in San
r- Fernando is to build on the existing system rather than trying to replace it, although some degree of
sourc,e separation would be beneficial.. This should protect existing income derived from the
recycling activities, increase the amount diverted from disposal and reduce the overall costs of waste
management. The specific approach proposed is aimed at implementing operational procedures to
improve, the hygienic conditions of work for the waste pickers, and is discussed in greater detail later
in this EIA report.

Conpostiig
Composting is the controlled biological and chemic,.' decomposition of the organic fraction of the
- I         solid waste stream, resulting in a humus-like product *nat can be used for soil conditioning.'
Composting can be practiced simply and inexpensi ;ely at either the individual residence or by
transpprting the compostable material to a centralizeu facility. It is important to recognize that the
L,         I           materias that can be r,; ipostel in this way are limite. to organic kitchen and yard type wastes (fruit
and vegetable peelings, leaves, grass, plants, etc.). l'he approach' involves the placement of these
||                materials in piles, windrows or vessels and tuming them either manually or with equipment to aerate
them; water may also be added, as well as additives to accelerate the decomposition process and/or to
'-g ||   j  c9ntrol:odour. Cor.- - ilig of the entire decomposable portion of the waste streatn (i.e., all "wet"
Wa-les )tpiallv req'dis sophisticated and expensive mechanical digestion systems that are fully
enclosed to accomplish aerobic or anaerobic biodegradation of these materials in order to avoid
problemns with odours, contaminated surface water runoff and uncontrolled bio-gas production. 'The
source separation and collection of wet wastes and construction of a sophisticated biodegradation
plant'is not considered, to be a realistic approach for the City of San Femando.
Considering that greater than half of the waste stream of San Femando consists of organic materials,
l            d      ,   including a ;ni ii|:  volume originating from the market, the implementation of c..mrp..ltit has the
potential to significantly reduce the volume of waste going to disposal. 'IThe implementation of
Cindividt'al household composting may be problematic in general due to the lack of space in individual
L.           |      .   properties; similarly the sejaration of kitchen and yard wastes at the source for separate collection and
transfer1to a centralized composting facility may also present a problem due to lack of space, limited
availability of collection vehicles and unpleasant odours until it is collected.
.The most el[ec&  approach to composting for San Femando would be: I) for the City to provide the
public with education regarding backyard composting so that it could be implemented by interested
residents where possible, and 2) to concentrate on the separation of organic wastes at the market and
the setup of a pilot composting area at the disposal facility. Leaves and other yard cleanup collected

product could bh t;eveloped in 30 to 60 da Is. The compost could be distributed or sold by the City

for thd,'fina lIan. i. i cover. This has been s  cessfully carried out in other cities in the Philippines and

With a high deSjt of success with thi  '. . .:!:1 composting approach, it is considered that the

0M             lhzardous industrial waste (as opposed to non-hazardous municipal solid vwaste) requiring a,

For all of the above reasons, it is considered that incineration is not the appropriate approach for San
t  -         Femando to take in satisfyin, their longer term SWM  needs.  This is consistent with that
recontimendd in the DAO rs-  as well as the Clean Air Act that effectively prohibits incineration in

In developirig countries where open dumping and burning is typically practiced, the move to
engineered landfiil facilities is recognized as being more expensiVe. However, the continued use of
open dumping will result in increasing amounts of pollution and publici concem/opposition, creating
unsustainable conditions into the future. This has been clearly recognized in developed countries, and
is also clearly stated in the legislation and guidelines currently in effect in the Philippines and
-           ~        demonstrated in their interest in undertaking SWEEP. In developed countries, landfill technology has
been proven successfuil.
L.                    It is considered that landfilling using appropriate modem approaches is the only technically and
economically feasible altemative approach to disposal to be considered for San Femando that can be
integrated with waste diversion and is capable of dealing with all the residual from the solid waste
stream. Depending on the size and population of the service area, as well as the road network, it can
sometimes be preferable to have more than one disposal site. However, for San Femando's situation,
only one disposal site is considered necessary.

__         3.5.3  Required Area
,J j        QThe required area for the       . v    landfill was predicted as part of the site selection process in order
to select an appropriately sized site. This area was based on the predicted waste generation rates
(refer td Section 3.3) and the following assumptions-  -
-           ,    ~     *   The landfill footprint will be rectangular with a 2:1 length to width ratio. It should be noted that
'4 i9       !actual configuration will depend on site specific conditions;
*  A buffer zone of approximately 50m on each side of the landfill will be required for support
-              f i3cilities 'such as leacIite treatment facility, surface water drainage structures, on-site access
roads, recycled material storage, composting, office, etc.;
*  Th4 long-term volume of the landfill is estimated using a factor known as Air-space Utilization
Factor (AUF). AUF is a factor commonly used to estimate the actual volume of landfill that will
be occupied by the waste during operation and/or after closure. It includes an allowance for daily
cover volume and is based on actual values of waste tonnage and corresponding surveyed landfill
:volotmes; AUF for Ontario (Canada) landfills ranges from 0.65 to 0.7 t/m3; and a conservative
AUF of 0.5 tVm3 has been used to represent conditions in the City; and               4
*  An iaVerage waste thickness of ISm can be achieved in the proposed landfill; it should be noted
that actual value will depend on site specific conditions.
In order tb demonstrate the effects of future waste diversion efforts by the City (through recycling,
composfing, etc.) on the required landfill area, this area was estimated assuming 10%, 20% and 30%
waste diversion rates and the results are presented in Appendix C. The estimates were also prepared
for an alverage landfill thickness of lOim, for purposes of comparison. The estimates indicate that an
increase in waste diversion or an increase in average waste thickness will reduce the required area for
the landfill site (in other words, for a fixed site area, this will increase the landhill life).

-1        #3)fortieproposed sn. '   r1- 'P" inaccordancewith theDENR'ssite-selectioncriteria (refer to
,l     !   Figure S, Al, A .esl; C, for,locations), and these sites were automatically 'included in the screening
jI         process.
Brief dest riptions of the Candidate Sites are presented in Appendix C.
The three sites included, (I) Site #1, the existing dwnpsite, (2) Site #2, located immediately adjacent
r ~        to and on t ie west side -of the existing dumpsite, and Site #3, located immediately adjacent to and on
the south tside of the existing dump site.

Based on discussions with the City and the DENR and observations made during the site visits, an
adI i n1 vtwo sites were identified for consideration. Site #4 is a combination of the existing dump
site (Site #1) and the adjacent property to the west (Site #2). It has been included as a potential site
based on the results-of the preliminary screening process, particularly because the three sites identified
by the City did not appear to have the required area to meet even the Absolute Criteria required by
the DENR (i.e. 5 year landrill life). Site #2 and Site #3 have very limited land area (i.e. do not have
the land area required to accommodate the minimum required area); and the area available within Site
#1 is ndt sufficient to accommodate the minimum required area -unless significantly engineered (e.g.
deep excavation with multi-layer containment systems which is likely to increase the landfill cost
substanially). Site #5 is a combination of the existing dump site (Site #1) and the adjacent property to
the souai,Sitc #3). it was included asa petential site for the same reasons as that for Site #4, above.
3.5.5  Comparative Assessment of Sites
-     I   The detaili and results of the comparative assessment (screening) process are presented in Appendix
C and, therefore, only a summary is presented here.
The baclkground information was examined, interpreted and compiled onto appropriate base mapping
of the C.ity for purposes of presenting the physical characteristics (refer to Appendix C). It is clear
that, together with protection of groundwater resources, identification and ,protection. of significant
- iologic! resources is a very important aspect of landfill siting in the Philippines. In order to assist in

sanitary landfill; As noted1 above, Site #5 is a combination of the existing dump site (Site #1) and the
adjacerit propr  to the south (Site #3).
3.6   i Sumiaary
A systelmmi  approach to the identification and evaluation of the alternative waste management
system| components was completed and, togetler with public consultation, the preferred wvaste
e L.                       management system approach was identified.
The City of San Fernando currently collects about 40 tonnes/day of residential and commercial waste
from the urban barangays and operates a disposal site on a 4.5 hectare parcel of land that commenced
operations in 1997. In 1999 it has implemented operational practices that are moving the site from an
open Lipsite towards a! Controlled Landfill as described in DAO 98-49. There is organized
recovery of recyclables from the disposal site by waste pickers.
Technical studies undertaken as part of this EIA demonstrate that the disposal site is having
unacce?table effects on groundwater quality and surface water runoff.
l    L
Even with enhancements tp the waste diversion programs, in terms of both recovery of recyclables
and centralized composting for organics from the market, as well as public education initiatives, it is
evident'that there will still be a significant quantity of residual solid waste requiring disposal in the
future. The current disposal site does not have adequate land area for a reasonable planning period

The wo en waste pickers who participated in the focused group dis,dssion held on 23 March 1999 at
*          Baratng,a B  Canaoay, San Fernando City raised the following issues and concerns:
a  Health Risks in. Waste'Pic g. Waste picking activities at the site expose them to heat, dust and
foul odour. They ha,veto endure these conditions while waste picking. They also attribute the
'development.of respiratory diseases l  cough p'd colds and of influenza to the fact that
wa,e pickers are not able t'change their sweaty clothes Immediately. They hope to have better
impleiments like masks and boots if the City Governnent will still allow such activity in the
proposed Materia4s Recovery Center. They also ask for regular check ups by the city health
service.     '
*   Excessi'e ll'asle Picking Charges. The Mameltac Barangay Captain operates the junk shop at the
r                .ji          site ania e:clusively purchases all recyclab1ls recovered. He is required,to pay PhPSOOO pesos to
the City GJovernment as a service fee. However, he gets 25% of the waste pickers' total daily
,  ^,  sales. 1I e waste pickers consider'this burdensome since they also spend almost PhP50.00 daily
for.their Lransportation expe,ses and refreshlnents. They therefore request that the operator -lower
thelre' :nlageloalleast10o%toomakeitfir and af1ordable.
LI           .'..........They als.  . .nioned that the buying price of several materials in the landfill is l ower than the price
outside.  ';nce the operator has exclusive rights to the recovered items, thy cannot bring the
recycla, cs   ronm the landfill site without buying it from the Captain or without permission. They
hope tl 1' buyingjrice of materials in the landfill be made equal to or higler than outside prices.
rMoreo-    :aste pickers also'fear that, with the expansion of landfill, sotmeone else, such as the
DaLanga * Oeste Barangay Captain, will take over the operation and will prevent thern from picking
U d        'in or en,' i  'the landfill site.
Overall a  a aste pickers are!requesting that they will still be allowed to collect recyclables and that a
fair and. .  stem of recovering waste at the site will be implemented.

5.1.1  Tbe SWEEP Demonstration'Sub-project
,The o4ral; objectivc for each city participating in Component 3 of SWEEP, the demonstration
sub-project, is to develop and implement an environ4nentally sound andiaffordable solid waste
J!   managztmCnt system that hicorporates the principles o,,ecological waste managem ent In broader
terms, Pp.   is also to develop a,successful methodology for solid waste planning that will

Cerliricatc (ECC), in order that this methodology calt be followed in future by other Philippine.
cities to upfgrae thefir current waste disposal practices.
In order to de% elop a successfu'l methodology and develop and implement a reasible solution, it
is importazfl to addressseveral key issues:
Realization that landfilling is the only feasible'alternative for'waste disposal at this time in
the Philippines;                                     '

There is a need to promote and adopt the principles of ecological waste management as set
out by the PTFWM and DENR, in order to attain as much diversion of materials as practical
from Phe waste streant, thereby reducing the amount of waste to be landfilled. The
implementation of sustainable diversion initiatives and corresponding enterpri,es can also
potentially provide employment opportunities and a source of income for a number of
families.
Fez 5.1.2. General Description ofPropc,sed Project
The rationale followed during the de elopmenr of the preferred %'aste management ststem for
San Femando has been discussed .n Section 3.4 of this document, and considered the existing
solid waste situation in San Fernando, the anticipated future demands, the results of public
consultation and what are considered modifications and upgrades that are expected to be
practical and reasonably achievable b; the LGU.
In cneral, the proposed project consists of the following main components:
a*  iaintain collection (with increased eficiency) from the urban ponion of the City onhN;
I Increase %kaste diNersior. through a combination of public educaLion, centralized cormpoSting
of organic wastes from the market (at a specified location at the landfill site) and
smodifications to the present waite picking practices. In addition, the initiation of source
Iseparation programs will be considered;
o  Continued use and modification of the nxi.ting disposal site to create a modem landfill, and
expansion onto an adjacent parcel of land for development of additional s3nitary laiidfiil
capacity to accommodate a reasonable planning period of about 10 years; and
Upgrading of landrill operational practices to control potential nuisance effects (noise, dust,
!odours, vermnin) on adjacent lands, as %%ell as control ad%erse effects on groundwater and

5.2  1 'Projected Demand f?r Sound Waste Management Services
'As presented in Section 3.3 and in Appendix C, the demand for waste managenent services,.
particularly the future Waste generation and landfill capacity requirements, was projected as part
!of the site selection process.' ;This projection incorporated the growth in p6pulation during the
period, ,as 'predicted in' the City planning documents, and what are considered
reasonable but somewhat conservative waste generation rgtes. These values were used in the
design of the proposed landfilL.
Basedj on the above ,noted predictions, the miniimurn land area required to meet the DENR
cnLeia,' a,ugmented as d, scused above (i.e. 10 year service life; 15 m average waste thickness, a
c'wastel gcnerate' o'f'k gl  prscapita/day, an AUF of 0.5 tonnem' 50m buffer zone, no waste
'  diversion, tc Lai coUe-ction in urban arela, tet.), was estirnated during the siting study to be
t3      ~~~appro uim:e ',. 7.10 hectares., -
It should '_ noted that:these estimates are based on a number of assumipt1ions as noted in
'Appendix C and, therefore, result in an approximation of the required landfill area. As
a !;demonstrst  by, the estiat presented in Section 3.3, an increase in waste diversion or an,
increase in ayerage waste thickness will reduce the required area for the landfill site (in other
e   words, for  i:xed site area, this will increase the landfilllife). Therefore, the City's intentions to
impkic en wvaste diversion measures as part of'the proposed landfill development is expected to
increas: tu  aradfill life or allow,for some limited expansion of waste collection area coverage
withi the', '', if warranted.
As d  ribe 'in Section3.6,the preferred disposal site selected consists of the existing site and
the adjoironn 'snd to the south, with an originally proposed total land area of about 7.0 hectares.
Following, operty negotiations and a site.survey, the total site area is actually only 5.8 hectares,
highlightin  h'I.importance of site optimization and diversion to maximize the life of the
disposal s e. It %as been estimated that with little waste diversion, a landfill air space of someI

The development of the sanitary landfill to meet the disposal needs,of San Fernando, as well as
implementation of a number of diversion initiatives, is proposed to,itake place by the
modi0cation of the existing disposal site in Barangay Mameltac and development of the adjacent
land to the south in Barangay Dalangayan Oeste. A description of the existing site conditions is

The alteatives considered and the proposed conceptual design of each of the-key components
that det,eFnine or comprise the engineered sanitary landfill are presented below. In this concept,
it has bee iassun.e 1 that the placement of wastes will continue in a similar fashion to the present
until this proposal is approved and implemented in 2001.
In the foljowing discussion, the, existing site is termed the "North Parcel" and the newly acquired
site the "South I ,rcel".
5.3.2  E%is 'y Site Conditions and Constraints
There are i r.um  er of constraints or features associated with the site that are fundamental to the
developmrien of the, most appropriate site design, as follows:
-   -13  . * . The topogrn phy of the-site is sloping, which has a significant effect on the approach to be
taken to la ,ot,and. geometry. of the landfill cells, leachate management and drainage. The
-site(com'oincd North and South Parcels) has a high point at the midpoint of the west
boundar, from which the land slopes down towards the east, northeast and south. The

it is ifnportant for paty reasons that the finished ground stuface ofthe landfill is separated
at least 12 metres fromrthe power line. This has been fully respected in the cqncepwal site
,desi. 'Also, it'is essential that an adequate setback between the tower and any excavation
'    ' or other activity,associated with the landfill development be maintained such that there is no
.   adverse effect on the tower foundations. Information received from Napocor indicates that

have a hard to stiff corsiscency. Grain.size distribution curves indicate that the soil has greater

At about 4.5 to 6.5 metre deptU the clay soh transitions into a weathered brown to grey brown
'shale edrock zone'wbich spmehimnes contains zones of completely weathered shale in the formn
of   .utar clay. With depth the degree of weathering gets less and the bedrock consists of fresh
to faintly weathered dark grey shale. The bedrock!was penetrated for. some 4 to 7.5 metres in
most of the borings, although borehole 99-1 on the high ground was terminated after some 17
metres inito the rock.
h;e grour dwater level in borehole 99-1 on the high. ground along the west boundary was at

4   cover components. This includes the volume of mixed waste and soil material on the North
;Parcel, which by the end of the year 2000 could be some 85,000 cubic metres.
Because of the presence of the NAPOCOR tower, it will be necessary tocreate two separate
landfill icells- one on the North Parcel and one on the South Parcel. These will not result in the
most effective use of the land area (since the intermediate area cannot be incorporated into the
landfill space), however there is no dpparent alternative short of moving the tower.
The deqign capacity is also governed by:
*  the geometry of each parcei, in this case rectangular,
;  *the: need to provide an ecological waste management area, access roads and leachate
' treatnent and stormvnter management facilities;
*  thei need to provide adequate buffer zones between the disposal cells and the adjacent
perties/residences. It is proposed that the minimum buffer width be 10 metres where the
sztq is adjacent to non-residential land uses, and increased to at least 20 metres where the site
borders existiig residences. In addition, it is necessary to provide a 3 metre wide access to

h   th underlying soil mass 'and liner system, and for the final -cover the ability to support
-       | ' ' vegetation and resist erosion. For the setting at this site, maximum slope inclinations of 3

the lowest excavation depth should be planned to generally terminate iri th!: soil above the

In orier that the leachate generated at the site is prevented from entering the groundwater system
and flung off-sitc   moving off-site as surface water discharge, engineered containment
measures will be required. These can be described as a low penneability bottom liner, a leachate
'colel'tion and removal system and a final cover system.
eeab,ility bottom liner typically consists of a layer of fine grained soil, such as clay,
'   which can range from about 6i0 mm to a few metres in thickness; a synthetic plastic
geomembimne such as 60 to 80 miluthick high density polyethylene (HDPE); or, a combination of
'Xthese mat-als to form a composite liner. At the San Fernando site, apd in the area of the city
wheri cldy soils are plentiful, it is proposed that a clay liner be considered for purposes of this
.desig   1 e cisy liner would be constructed by excavating the ciay, spreading it in the proposed
!4        I~~iner area, in IS0mm  thick'~layers and compacting each layer un'til the total design thickness is
achieved; the,compactiori is achieved using a heay.sheepsfoot or padfoot roller, and the layers
are bor. I together by scarifying them with a farm disc or harrow. The final surface is rolled
smootlh ,vith a drum roller. 'In this way, a minimum, liner hydraulic conductivity of lxlO'7 cm/s
shou41 b achievale.. In the South Parcel where excavation will be into virgin ground it is
r; excp,ed that nearly all of the excavated clay will be usable for this purpose. In the North Parcel
qeJ  t  '.  ;  however . is expected that part of the excavated matarial will consist of mixed waste and soil,
and.only ' ',e undisturbed clay will be separated out for re-use for bottom liner o0 final top cover
purposes. As such, it may be necessary for the City to locate a source of suitable clay and haul it
-to thg site '-*r construction purposes.
lThe le7 .hate collection systemi is constructed above the bottom liner and gen -rally consists of a
layer if highly permeableigranular material (such as gravel) such that the leachate can be
effir iently removed by gravity drainage from, above the liner to a low poit from wbere it can be
dr     nedor pumpedan  removed from the landfill cell for subsequent treatment. The granular
reachate collction layer often contains a series of perforated pipes at spa ing of 30 to 60 metres
to most effect    _onvey the leachate (as described in the DENR Guidelines on Sanitary
r                    ! 1 " i.  Landrlills). Hc  .., the successful operation of these pipes requires them to be maintained by
regular cleanin -; in developed countries this is typically perforned using remote sewver flushing
equipment. T nLs is seen as being problematic in San Femando and 'perhaps other parts of the

It is proposed that the leachate collected from'the landfill will be treated in a passive natural
treatmept1system. The sytem will comprise three lagoons in series followed by a wetland. The
treated effluent from'the wetland will discharge to the stormwater management pond located at
,,,                      the northeast corner of the North Cell and eventually onto the agricultural lands to the north, as is
the case with current storm runoff. 'The natural grade of the area has been made use of to provide
i ' '  gravity flow thrugli the system, Le. from the first lagoon to the pond, via the second and third
lagoons and the wc land;'¶his avoids the need for any mechanical pumping.in'the treatment
system. 10ff-site dh chargT is expected to occur only during storm events.
The lagjon system has been designed to treat the influent leachate to applicable standards. In
, ]   |          this case,'as the *ischarge is expected to flow onto the downstream agicultural lands (to the
q   northeat of lb, site), tho criteria spccificd in tho DENR AO No. 35 (Effluent Quality
Regulatons) &pp "Ablc fOr discharges to Class D waters (for agriculture, irrigation, livestock

was usel as ti, d charge criteria in the design.'
r                         The details of &j  design, including the design paramneters, are presente,d in Appendix G. It
r  1       should be noted hat the three lagoon cells are expected to treat the leachate to the required
Leffluent|quality mder conditions expected based on presebtly available information.  The
wetlandd tl?e ond will provide additignal 4polishing" through mixing, retention, plant uptake,
L:etc.;n iidditi'or the wetland will act as a contingency facility to minimize the potential for off-
L              !          site discharge  effluent of unacceptable quality during unusualunanticipated leachate loading

The lagoons will be constructed of earthnci (on-sitc clay) berms with concrete facing and a 0.3m'
to 0.5m thick compacted clay liner (refer to Figure 5.10). The wetland will be of similar
construction Put without the concrete facing and will be vlgetated usirg appropriate local plants.
* fi43   If the existing topography, space limitations and/or soil conditions wanrant, some of the walls of
_             .D          the lagoons may have to be constructed of reinforced concrete; the oped for such construction
should be determined during the detailed design phase. The flow will be conveyed between the
lagoqnslwetland through appropriateiy located connectortoutflow pipes. Alternatively, simple
weir'tctures could be built into the berms.
Prov sions ha ve been made in the design to recirculate the leachate to the landfill, if required.
Recirculation will be uiseful to minimize off-site discharge, if strategically implemented. For
example, spr.ying the treated effluent from the wetland onto the closedlcovered portion of the
__           "landfill dtrring dry season would enhance the removal of the water from the system through
*D           evapfratioi . 'Iternatively,'the farmers downstream can alcake use of the effluent to irrigate casp
crop$ such ;, -obacco, provided the effluent quality meets the ibove noted DENM criteria. Also,
the offlue.  ould be used to. add moisture to the waste in the coiposting process (i.e. as a

froni the la ,c *ns on a regular (e.g. once a year) basis; the sludge could becdisposed in the
landfill. Also  t is important to maintain the plants in the wetland. The operation of the landfill
should incorl iate some or all of the alternative effluent disposal measures presented above in

The final landfill cover is proposed to consist of a layer of corlpacted clay of 500 mm thickness

and provide erosion resistance. Although not illustrated on the cross-section on Figure 5.5, it

melre long sections and con,tain.a gravel lined swale leading to spillways. These benches would

In v :ew of thedlimited landfill gas (methane) generation and utilization potential of the site, it is

5.4.2  ' ehabilitation of the Existing Disposal Area
It is anticipated that the pzacement of waste will continue on the existing disposal site until the
sanitary, landfill project is implemented, assumed to be near the end of 2010. As discussed
previously, the site is currently operated similar to a Controlled Dumpsite. This will continue,
althougo waste placement should be shifted to the southern end of the site'and set up to basicaly
conforn1 to the proposed horizoital and vertical limits of the Ndorth Cell top surface contours
(Figure 5.3). In t .is southern end of the North Cell, the site would not beexcavated as indicated
on Figure 5.4, but rather the waste'would be placed above the existing grade. As discussed under
Section,.5.4.4, waste placement in this fashion will stop when the South Cell is prepared to
receive waste.
The reh  . li a' i of the North Cell to receive waste will take place during the operational period
qi '       of the 9uth (.11. -Tis will only be able'to happen just in advance of the preparation of the
North Cell t receive Waste, since otherwise a large excavation would be, left open and
'  managei ll atmnent of leachate affected water would be needed for a prolonged period of
time. Howcv ., in the interim, measures should be implemented in order to minimize adverse !
environmenta. effects that the. dumpsite is currently having on the off-site groundwater and
surfacel water 'nviromnent. Once the treatment facility is built, this could simply consist of
relativ9ly sh tllJ v ditch s along thle north and east sides of the disposal area to intercept
. .s    contamninate I ni- off and direct it via pumping and temporary overland piping for treatment in
the lagoorn ,.
I    Prior   relocatiug thc material, the surface, of the waste in the south portion of the North Cell
sho'  L lshaped such th,at it slopes towards the north at a grade of about 2 to 3 percent, and the
. anular le .chate collection layer constructed. Although this will not'prevent the ongoing
leaching fru m the waste that is left in place below the leachate collection layer, it is expected that
.: ,     this en'iii zred measure will serve to manage the leachate generated by the relocated waste by
conne tin-, the granular layer into the leachate collection layer in the remainder. of the North
Cell. Th s is il,1.strated on Figure 5.12. Once the mixed soil and waste have been removed and
shaped c forrim the south, part of theiNoriti Cell final georuetry, this area should receive the final
closure c ivqr.as described ij~ Section 5.4.1.

ij1   It is proposed to integrate ecological waste management projects at the site to increase waste
diversioq quantities and to provide sustainable income for the waste pickers.
Although ecological waste managemzenL activities are an essential component of thle preferred      A
w|aste management system, it is important first and foreniost that the required disposal capacit)
or ine iplanning petiod and related modem sanit   landfill facilities be yrovided. Te site is
relatively limited in area,' and the allocation of land to specific on-site ecological waste
Q  ,      management components 'needs to be carefully considered, recognizing that it may be possible
(if necessary),to carry out some of these activities on City owned or leased land off-site.
.d              ji      The main ccological w-aste inanagement area is proposcd lo be located on the central portion of
tIhc overall property, on tl e northern portion of the South Parcel (see Figure 5.2). An area to the
L                i      north ol the Naprocor lowcr has been shomn for storage of recyclables and-for operation of a

In order to avoid odour and vemrin problems, only fruit and %egetable %%astcs should be

operations is %ery imporLant in this regard. The composting would take placc in s%indro0%s (or

- Phase I will consist 'of the south half of the South Cell. This will minimize the area of
engineered cell to be prepared initially, provide a source of on-site construction material and at
the samef,i -lrgalow the commencement of sanitary landflling as soon as possible. It is
y   estimaled that Phase I will provide approximately 35,000 cubic metres of air space for
landfilling, wh.lh will correspond to about 1 year of disposal capacity commencing in 2001.
Phase 2 w-   onsist of the remaining north half of the South Cell, which will also provide
approximately 35,000 cubic metres of air space for landfilling, which will correspond to about
1.5 to g years Xf disposal capacity for 2002 and until about mid 2003.
PhaseT will 'onsist of the relocation of the mixed waste and soil in the North Parcel into the
southern por tion of the North Cell footprint and the construction and filling of the remainder of
the North '_ell. It is estimated that the volume of material to'be relocated could be of the order
of 55,pr U? cubic metres. This will result in a net air, space in Phase 3 of about 120,000 cubic
metreZ that will accommodate waste disposal for a period of about 4V2 to 5 years, or to the end of
F1          200'1 to nil J 2(8.

Stora*e of recyclables will also continue in the portion or tde existing building at the northwest
e                         comef of the site. In view of what is really a litnited volume of garbage delivered daily to the
site, and the area limitations, the adoption of mechanized sorting or ctnveyor type systems for
initial dumping and waste picking of collected materials outside the disposal area is not bein'
proposed at the site. It is envisaged that the waste pickers be provided with suitable protective
- '       ' clothing, gloves, masks and footwear and continue to sort through the garbage on the disposal
area. The regular placement and spre'ding of covpr soil over the garbage adjacent to the active
'7jj  {    area will provide a place for the- ollection trucks to dump initially and the picking of recyclable
items tb occur; the waste can then be pushed into the active disposal area.
-    There is other 'and area available adjacent to the Napocor tower that could be used, for exarnple,
for t,he tempor sry storage of suspect hazardous or toxic wastes (until their classification can be
confirmedr X I the appropriate disposal option identified). It may also be necessary to use part of

Each layer of ww&e hould be dumped.initially onto an area where soil cover has been placed
adjacent to the active area, in order tha recovery of recyclable items can take place. The
residual waste woul then .b pushed into the disposal location. Each layer shall be compacted
using a large steel-l heeled landfill compactot. ThorVugh compaction of each layer is essential
to optimize the uSf, of the available air space. The number of passes over each layer depends on
the weight/size of vompa tor. The greatest degree of compaction is achieyed by ramping the
new waste up ag.:i.  an initial waste s            of lifts is significanit in that the use of
too thi¶k a lift wil .esult in an unacceptably low degree of;compaction, while too thin a lift wvill I
result in; the exc&v :ive use of cover material. A reasonable ii.t thickness once above the initial
lift is aot 1.2 to 1.5 metres. After compaction, and at the end of each day, the waste must be.

As noted in Sectc -. 3.5, the proposed sile comprises the existing dump siLe and a parcel of land
to the south of th; dump site (refer to Figures 3.2 and 5.1); the total area of the proposed site is
approximately 5. ha.
;  I          The baseline .i& i collection was based on the results of Cie sccping process (refer to Section
*      1.4); partic. . ay, the issues raised during public consultation and the "N1WST' criteria agreed
upon with th; r .4R and the EIARC (refer to Scoping Report, Appendix B). Also, the data

.6.23 i Site Reconnsissaince
X " 11The eisting municipal solid waste disposal site (existing dump) has been in use for about two
years (refer to Figure 3.2 for' location). It is comprised of approximately a 3.3 hectare fenced
parcel of land with a concrete access road from the City.
.'  .
As noted above, the proposed site consists of the existing dump site and a parcel of land adjacent
to it. A brief description of the site conditions observed during the various site reconnaissance'
visits conducted between May, 1998 and March, 1999 is presented below.
*  The dunip site had solid waste spread over much of the site in 1997 and 1998. In 1999 in
some areas the waste was spread over the ground, while in other portions holes or trenches
have been excavated and filled with the solid waste;
*  The waste was not being covered (e:g. using a daily cover material) and no equipment (e.g.
bulldozer)-to place the waste in a desired /confined location was present during the May
1998 visit. However, the waste was being covered using soil from the site using an
excavator and a bi "dozer during the October, 1998 and February, 1999 visits;
*  An uncovered dug well was present at the low northeast comer of the,dumpsite and is
considered to be downgradient of the waste;
L..     2,         *  Thie surficial soil appears to be a fine grained (clayey) weathered rock. It appears to,
maintain its'or ,ginal structure, with discontinuities or fracturing due to weathering;
r                  .  Local resident. - -3ort that the water table is 7 to 10 metres below the lowest point of land;
;  *  These apparent soil characteristics have the potehtial for use in an engineered landfill design
as' a compaL .e '1 clay liner or clay cover. The available soil maps show that the Province of
1. Union is de minated by clayey soil;
i  I_,      *' The Baranga3 Captain indicated that the water samples from a number of deeper wells
located in the 4icinity of jhe dump site area were analyzed for 'potability' and were reported
to be potable;   l
' i    i a         *  The site is n'Ji rovided with any surface water drainage structures, such as diversion ditches,
forthe mariagement of surface drainage; and
*  About 8 waste pickers were observed collecting recyclable materials. They are organized by
the Ma meltac Barmngay Captain, who assists them with the sale of the picked recyclable
*   '           materials. Bags of tliese materials were seen stored in an on-site building.

The rest of the proposed site is located immediately adjaxient to and on' the south side of the
'It                                               I
existing dump site. It 'is comprised of about a 2.5 hectare parcel'of land and has the'same access
road from the City' as that for the existing dump site. The observations made during the site visits
related to this parcel of land are summarized below:
*  The northern property boundary of this parcel of land is the same as the southernnost
Boundary of the 'e*isting dump site;
*  The northern part of this site is unused and covere4 with vegetation. The rest of the site
comprises dwellings or farmland;  ,
It is well screened visually and covered by trees and bushes;
*  it has good surfafe drainage (Note: a significant component of landfill site design is
-   s  5        diversion of suirface water away from the garbage so that it remains clean and doesn't require
treatment); and
*  The water table appears to be relatively deep, based on water levels observed in an adjacent
dug well (inferred shallow water table at about 5 m below ground level).
6.2.4' Site Topography and Land Use
The existing dumpsite slopes towards the northeast at an approximate grade of 5%. The adjacent
-propc,rty slopes towards the pouth at an approximate grade of 8%. The highest point is at the
southwest corner of the existing dump site, which is the same as the northwest corner of the
-   Ia! Ps  ! adjacent property. the topographyof the site is shown on Figure 5.1.
* As noted above, the northern portion (about :i ha) of the proposed site is presently used to
dispse the City's s'olid waste (i.e. the dumpsite). The predominant portion of the adjacent
propety is unused and covered with vegetation and tbe rest of it comprises dwellings or'

6.2.8  Visibility   J
The ite: is -located in a relatively' high location in the general area. As the dump site is
predominantly cleared open land, the lands to the north are visible from the high points of the
site. The visibility to the areas to the west, south and east of the dump site is limited due to the
presence of thick vegetation (bushes and trees). The farmlands to the south are visible from the

6.3.2 1Regional Climatic Setting
San 'Fe ando City is chaacterized by a Type I climate of the Modified Coronas system of
climate'classirication as indicated in Figure 6.2, with two pronounced seasons, being generally
'dry' from December to Mlay and 'wet' from June to Novemter. The strongly seasonal nature of
the climate is dictated by the NE'and SW monsoons. The NE mboisoon (Amihan)pis co-incident          !
with thd dr season and afects the area during'NovemXber to April. The SW monsoon (Habagat),
'dominates the area- from May to September, the rainfall is moderate when compared, for
C r                exampl6 io the SW mponsoon of western Luzon.
6.3.3  Ral3fall
'             ,    The mean annual rainfall (moderate) recorded at San Femando City, based on records for Station
222 for t' e period of 1961 - 1995, is 2430 mm (Table 6.1). The highest rnonthly rainfalls are
*                  recorded between April and October when the mean monthly rainfalls are in excess of 130 mm,
Nw  } Q    with ,g .,ust being the wettest month with a mean monthly rainfall of 698 mm. The driest
rmonths occur after the cessation of the SW monsoon; mean monthly rainfall totals.are typically
below 100 mm from November to April and above I QO mm from May to October.
The raiifall data indicatep that the number of rainy days (classified as a day with at least 0.1 mm
Dof rai -11) ranged from I day in January, April and December to 21 days in August, iLh
Februuy and March having no rainy days. On average, there are 16 to 21 rainy days per month
in the wet season throughout the months of June to September inclusive. The mean annual

Not only is the rainfall highly seasonal but the paterm of rainfall distribution indicates that a
significant proportion of the monthly rainfall may result from a single or a few rainfall events.
Table 6.3 summarizes thfic,fequency of 24-hour rainfall of various magnitudes, from 50 mm up
to, and exceeding, 300 mm per day. On average, there are nine days per annum where the 24-
hour rainfall is between 50 mm and 100 mm. More extreme rainfall events are less frequent,
with 24-hour rainfali:                            i
*  in excess of 100 mm experienced, on average, once every year,  1
*  in exce'ss.of 200 mm experienced, on average, once every pine years;:and  -"
*  in excess of 300 mm once every twenty years.

The greatest daily rainfall recorded in the San Fernando City area since records began in 1903 is
594 mm and occurred in July 18, 1920 (Table 6.2). In absolute terms, the greatest daily rainfalls
tend to be experielnced1between May tolNovember when the SW monsoon is active; these
extreme high magnitude rainfall events typically produce between 60% and 90% of the mean
monthly rainfall in a singlqe event. In. contrast, although of comparatively lower magnitude,
extreme rainfralls recorded during the dry season may produce between 200% and 300% of the
mean monthly rainfall.
63.4   Temperature
The ainyalimean temperature is 27.1- OC (fable 6.1). January, the'coldest month, has a mean
daily airtemperature of25.4 PC while May, the warmest month, has a mean daily temperature of
'jreater than 28.9 °C.
The highest monthly maR;imum temperature is 31.2 0C in the month of October while the lowest
monthly minimum temperature is 20.90C in the month of January. The mean diurnal variation of
temperature is 7.10C. The highest air temperature recorded in San Fernando is 39.3 °C (October
17,195 1) while'the lowest air temperature observed is i3.5 IC (January 4,1986) (Table 6.2).

6.3.8  Meteorological Hazards
Other synoptic systems or hzards affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall in
-these areas and in the country as a whole' include thunderstorms, cold front, intertropical
convergence zone (ITC), easterly wave, tornado (Buhawi), and the northeast tAmihan) and
southwest (Habagat)-monsoons. The following sections give brief discussions on these natural
hazards.
Thundersto,rms develop in areas with high relative humidity and atmospheric instability usually
q'          triggered by localized heating of land masses.  The presence of moisture and unstable
atmosphere coupled with orographic lifting starts the process of cumulus convection which'
j  * EF!     ultiately ilead to the development of a cumulonim,us cloud or a thunderstorm cloud, bringing
I' .  '        substantial rainfall of short duration usually during the summer months.
In the period from Janu?.ry to March, the country is affected by the cold front as a result of the
intrusion of cold air, mass towards the tropics where it meets with the warmeair mass. Since the
cold air is heavier and denser, it remains close to the suwface and as it advances, the warm air
tAI         glides'over the cold air, brought to higher levels forming thunderstorm clouds which bring rains
in the northeastern portions of the country. '
Li3         The inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) affects the Philippines from April to October
bringing widespread cloludiness, rainfall, lightning, thunder and moderate to strong winds. The
ITCZ poscillates' nbrth to south of the country. It moves northward in May reaching its northem-
| 8            most position in July or August, and moves in the southem positions during the months of
November to April.
About once or twice a week during summer, a weak westward propagating disturbance (with a
'lifespan of one week) in the basic easterly wind flow affects the country. This elsterly wave is
associ!ated with alternative regions of fair weather and enhanced cloudiness due to connective,
activity with resulting rainfall.

Occasionally weak tornadoes occur in the Philippines, in relation to severe thunderstorms and
tropical cyclones. The location of the country in the! low latitudes is fortunate since temperature
.,   ! La    variation is small along t vertical and coriolis force in the area is weak, hence tornadoes are
also weak and short-lived.
L   Iii            During the winter season of the northern hemisphere, the snow coyered Asiatic mainland
-      g      ,   develops a high pressure system and the cold dry wind flQw towards the Philippines comes from
the noz$heast directlon. The northeast monsoon (Amihan) season occurs from October to March,
and is most active during the months of January and February. As the cold dry air mass passes
over the Pacific Ocean, it absorbs moisture and dumps rain ii, the eastern section of the country.
:'-                In summer, the Tibetan Plateau serves as an elevated heat source, a low pressure system
develops, and because of, the large-scale upward air movements towards the low pressure,
rsurfacf airmass transport1 is triggered, such that a cross-equatorial flow of air commences. The
wind flovw passes over the Ihdian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, and ultimately the South China Sea,
arriving in ithe Philippines f1om the southwest (Habagat) directions loaded with moisture,
bringing torrential rain in, the westem portions of the country during the months of June to
l tv n l ~October.

The Rosario Fm. is tihtly f9lded along a roughly north-south axis, producing the north to south
trending hills. The Philip ine Fault lZone, a major fault extending from Mindinao to Luzon,
splays iqto a: series of northwest trending faults near the San Femando area. Several are
considered potentially active failts.       I
r'   ~          The Quaternary alluvial 1eposits comprise a variety of marine sands, lagoon and estuary
deposits, river chareil and floodplain deposits, and deltaic deposits. Most of these are medium
to coarse grained, snds, silts and silty clays.
The Groundwater Availability Map -of the Philippines (DENR, 1997) indicates that the San
Cp       Fernando area is situated within an area characterized by 'local and less productive aquifers'.
The important groundwater resources are in the aliuvial deposits of the river valleys and
coastline. Groundwater r,echarge in the alluvial sediments is facilitated since the alluvial
sediments are relatively medium to coarse grained, and occur in low topographic positions.
Groundwater flow in the upland areas is generally characterized by lower storativity and yield,
based on',the presence of fincr-grained sediments. Wells in the upland areas tend to be in excess
of 2Q m deep below ground surface, while wells in the shallow sediments are generally less than
20 m below ground su': face.

To a depth of about 4.5 to 6.5 metres below original ground surface, a layer*of brown weathered
silty clay to clay spil is present This soil layer, which is derived from the underlying bedrock,
I   |  ,     was observed to retain a portion of the joint and bedding 'plane structure that characterizes the,
bedrock, with the amount of remnant structure increasing with depth. The clay soil is of
|| generally high plasticity and has a hard to stiff consistency. Two laboratory permeability tests
-                                 sam carried out on undisur   samplep of the clay gave results 'bf about Ix 1iO  cm/s, indicating a
r2           low permeability soil.i However the presence of discontinuities in the clay due to both the
induwed weathering and the secondary remnant joint structure, as described above, suggests that
the actual permeability of the clay is probably 'about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher,
corresponding to a moderate permeability soil.
r              From laboratory testing carried out on the clay, it is concluded that the clay soil deposits on the
- 3          site are at or near their optimum moisture. Thus, this c!ay could be excavated and used for the
construction of a low permeability bottom liner for the landfill to prevent leachate contaminatiod
|iv N        of the groundwater, and also for use as a final cover when landfilling is complete to minimize the
quantity of leachate generation.
At about 4.5 to 6.5 m depth the clay soil transitions into a weathered brown to grey brown shale
bedrock zone which sometimes contains zones of completely weathered shale in the form of
nodular clay. With depth the degree of weathering gets less ana the bedrock consists of fresh to
I     faintly weathered dark grey shale.
.6.4.4 Seismicity
The Philipl *ne Islands are located in a seismically and volcanically active zone as a part of the
Circu-P;n  iflc Belt  Earthquakes are often classified into!tectonic and volcanic. For the
proposed engineered landfill, the major concern is from tectonic-earthquakes as they are the
destructive:ones. - denerally, earthquakes occur when the tectonic stress exceeds the frictional
_ -        <. strengii of the fault/subduction walls, thus resulting into slippage of opposite walls/sides. Slip
movenients alonig fault surface's could be either strike-slip or lateral movement, up.dip/do%wn-dip
or thrus'Inormal, oblique, rotational or hinge-fault.1

Located on the western section of the northern Philippines Island known, Ls Luzon, the Province
V|              of LaWnion has a predominantly hilly terrain which gradually rises eastward from the shorelines
of Lingayen Gulf (refer. to Figure 5 of Site Selection Report, Appendix C). The western border
of the province is a coastal plain of raised coral and alluvium (sand/clay deposited by flowing
water) which overlays previously deposited sedimenet.
About i(0 percent of the t?tal land area of the province is certified alienable and disposable. This
s  tj   refers tlo iand of public domain, which has been subject to the present system of classification
and declared as not'n,eeded for forest purposes. Alienable and disposable land in La Union
Proyince includes a)'protection land; b) production land; c) fishing grounds/fisheries; d) built-up
areas; a) industrial areas; and e) tourism areas. The remaining 20 percent of lands have been
'VLS  |          classified as  tlands. These forestlands are lands of public domaii, which have not been
declard alienable artd disposable and includes a) public/production forests; b) forest reserves; c)
timberlands; d) grazi-ig linds; e) game refuge, and f) bird sanctuaries.

Surface drainage, classjfied according to its directional flows, can be represented by four basins
corresponding to the four quadrants towards which the suiface drains, i.e., towards San Fernando
L, ,  |Bay, towards the municipality of San Juan, towardslthe municipality of Naguilian and Bauang,
and towards the sea south of San Fernando Bay (refer to Figure 3.1 and Appendix C). The
|           largest-basin is found in the northwestem quadrant, with its drainage network flowing towards
San Fernando Bay; the second largest is found on the southeastern interior rise to about one
j !        hundred metres above sea level. The highest elevated area is found in the northeastert quadrant
near the boundary with altitudes reaching over 400 metres (refer to Figure 5 in Appendix C).

6.6.4  Surface WaterDrainage at the Project Site
Surface water drainage at thp existing site flows mainly as overland (sheet) flow. There are no
distinct drainage courses on or near the site, however, during significant rainfall (storm) events
interrnittent streams develop in some of the gullies and along the existing pathways and roads.
Based on the limited topographic information available for the area, it appears that the site is
located on the drainage divide between Creek I (about 1.5 km nbt*Inortheast) and Creek 2
(about 1.5 km south) (refer to Figure 6.1 and Figure 5 in Appendix C), resulting in two distinct
drainage areas within the site. The northern' portion of the site, the existing dumpsite, drains
predominately in a northeast direction to the lower northeast corner of the property where it
flows offsite as overland flow onto the adjacent agricultural fields. The 'southem portion of the
site, the adjacent property, drains mainly southward aAd continues to flow offsite as overland
flow onto: the adjacent agricultural fields. Both the existing dumpsite and the adjacent property
(predominantly vegetated land) provide significant potential for surface storage in small
depressions created during landfill and/or agricultural terracing.
It is noted that, because of thp prevailing drainage conditions at the existing dumpsite (i.e. no
proper dr,inage management), garbage and/or leachate impacted storm runoff flows overland
:   I
onto the adjacent agricultural fields to the north during storm events. This has been raised as a
significant issue by the vaiious stakeholders during the consultations and, therefore, has been
addressed in the design of the landfill.
6.6.5  Surface Water Quality
As there   no perennial surface water courses present within the study area, it was not possible
to assess. the surface:water quality within the study area during the baseliqe data collection
prograrm. However, an indication of receiving water quality in the general area was obtained by
sampling the waterbody within this area that is closest to and downstream from the proposed
site, the Carlatan Lagoon. As noted above, the runoff from the proposed site eventually drains
into Carlatan Lagoon during major storm events. A sample was collected, !'rom Carlatan La goon
|J      . at location SW-2 (refer to Figure 6.1) on April 11, 1999 and analysed for a suite of pararneters
represenlative of municipal landfill leachate. The results of this analysis are presented isi Table

6.7.2  Groundwater Occu    nce and Use at the Site and Immediate Vicinity
: -       The.general hydrogeological setting in-the City has bpen described in Section 6.4.2. The urban
portioi of the City obtains its water supply from four shallow or deep drilled wells, the closest of
which is located about 2 km south of the subject site; water is also obtained via a pipeline from a
I         - spring located in the! mountainous terrain of the easterd portion of the City, greater than 5 km
inland, om the subject:site. The location of these water supply sources are shown on Figure 4
ii        aia  a Metro La Union Water District report on the City's water supply (demand, ctc), presented
* in Appondix J.
1i       In the immediate vicinity pf the site, water for both domestic (potable) purposes and irrigation is
- obtained from dug or drilled wells that are typically completed at depths of about 10 to 20 .m
below gigoiind' surface. ,A numl1ber of these wells are Iqcated within both the agricultural and
housing areas that surround the existing and prg,posed landfill site pro,?ei-ties. One well to the
west of the new site in Dalangayan Oeste is reportedly drilled to about 50 In depth. Based on the
results of the drilling investigation'on the site, it is indicated that these we . derive the majority
of their water from i''e bedrock. These local wells provide water to tht desired location via

small diameter overland pipelines, typically by means of surface suction lift pumps. The
groundwater level reported by owners and/or measured in several of these wells in February
___ '        1999 was at about,5.5 to 10 m below ground surface. In addition, there is q dug well in the low-
lying northeast portion of the existing landfill site; the static level in this well was measured at
about 4 m below grotind surface.':
-    u           The groundwater elevations measured in the five groundwater monitors,99-1 to 99-5 are given in
Table 6.6, together with the corresponding groundiwater elevations. The groundwater levels
recorded over the March to May 1999 period are relatively consistent, and are considered to
repreient stabilized groundwater conditions. The groundwater level in borehole 99-1 on the-high
i   ^         ground along the west boundary was at about 19 netre depth below ground surface during March
to May 1999, and it is expected that it is relatively deep in the bedrock at this location throughout
much of the year. In the other monitors the water level was at about 6 to 8.5 metre depth and
- _              located pear or slightly brlow the soil to weathered shale zone transition; it is expected that these
water levels may be somewhat higher during wetter periods of the year.
As described in Section 6.4.3, a layer of weathered clay soil underlies the site. It would typically
be expected that in these fine grained soil conditions the groundwater level would be shallower
than measured in the groundwater monitors (say within I to. 2 metres of ground surface),
especially in the low lying lands; that comprise the southern portion of the South Parcel and the
norther;porp n of the Tohth Parcel. The measured water levels at 6 to 8.5 metre depth in these
areas are considered to indicate that the discontinui;ies in the clay created by weathering action
land the remnant joint structure in the clay deposit increase its permneability and allows some
__     !   drainap of the spils to occur, resulting in the measured water levels. This also indicates the
need to compact the on-site clay to form low permeability engineered b6ttom liners for the
A    l°         landfill cells (as discussed in Section 5.3:6), if leachate containment is to be achieved.
L         Groundwater flow patterns typically reflect the ground surface,topography, i.e., groundwater
' fr  g9        should; flow from higher land to lower land. .As such, on the subject site, it would be expected
that the highest groundwater elevations should be on the high point of the site along the west
-    g:         central oauundary, and that groundwater flow would radiate out in the south, east and northeast
directions. This expected situation is indicated to hold true for the groundwater elevations

measured in monitors 99-2 to 99-5. However, the groundwater elevatiop in monitor 99-1 at the
high point of the site is lower than those measured elsewhere on the North Parcel, but higher than
that measured at monitor. 99-2, which is the lowest value; this is unexpected. One possible
explanation ;for this unexpectedly low water level in monitor 99-1 is that the monitor is
completed quite deep in the bedrock compared to the other monitors, and as such may not be

representative of the same groundwater (piezometric) zone as the other monitors.
The interpreted generalized groundwater flow directions on the site are indicated on Figure 6.4.
Fps       It is ipterpreted, considering the data.in,.monitor 99.1, that there may be a groundwater divide
present that is somewhat to the north of the topographic divide that exists approximately along
the boundary between the North and South Parcels. Existing water supply (domestic or
irrigation) wells located to the north, south and east of the existing and proposed landfill site
Parcels, are considered to be potentially downgradient from the landfill cells in terms of
groundwater flow. Wells to the west of the South-Parcel are not indicated to be directly
downgradieDt, bat hather cross-gradient in terms of groundwater flow.
6.7.3  Groundwater Quality at the Site and Immediate Vicinity
Groundwater samples were recovered from the five on-site monitors 99-1 to 99-5, as well as
from existing wells located to the west of the South Parcel (GW-1, GW-2 and GW-3), to the
northwest of the North Parcel (GW-4), to the northeast of th,e North Parcel (GW-5), and GW-6
S         which is the on-site dug well. These sampling locations are shown on Figure 6.3.
I         $;ampling was carried out iritially at the above locations on March 10 to 15, 1999 and submitted
to a private laboratory fog a,nalysis of a selected suite of chemical and bacteriological parameters.
These parameters were selected to provide information on general water chemistry as it relates to
the applicable Class AA Water Usage Criteria ayd. parameters that typically characterize
municipal landfill leachate. After review of the analytical data, a number of the results were
considered suspect. Therefore, monitors 99-1 to 99-5 were resampled again on May 19, 1999,
and reanalyzed for certairi parameters.

In evaluating groundwater chemistry data in the vicinity of a potential contaminant source such
.- !            as the existing waste disposal site, it is- important to frst consider the position of the groundwater
sampling locations relative to the potential contaminanit source. Based on projected groundwater
flow direction, it is possible to categorize the-sampling locations as follows:
. i                                                  . .
1            .  Backgrowud ITatei Quality: upgradient locations wvhere the groundwater,does not or could
not be affected by the landfill
:  ||.*            Leachate Source Quality: locations beneath the landfill where the groundwater qpality has
beer degraded by the landfill leachate. This is- typically reflected by higher dissolved
concentrations ofthe;leachate constituents in the grpundwater
r               . .  Dow,ngpad1ent Water Quality: locations downgradient that could possibly be affected by the
flow or. migration of leachate affected water and its mixing with natural water. This is
termed the groundwater "leachate plume", which represents the distance beyond the source
(the waste disposal area) where groundwater has been affected. The size or extent of the
'  plume is variableover time, and generally increases over time. The rate at which the plume
-                  advances is differcht -for different contauninants, and depends largely on the groundwater
flow velocity and- the concentration and type: of dissolved--contaminant in the leachate
i o'  w        affected -roundwater.  -
Based on tfie physical hydrogeology- as described in Section '6.7.2, the following groundwater

Downgradient'Water Quality:             Wells GW-5 and GW-6
|-Z. J       The;general water quality chemistry in the. vicinity of the study area can be characterized by the
analytical results in *ie background locations GWN-I to GW-4 and monitors 99-1 and 99-2, as
shown on Table 6.5 and discussed below:
*  There is an apparent difference between operating supply wells GW-I to GW-4 and monitors
99-1 and 99-2, in that the wells are much lower in BOD, iron, manganese and aluminum.
This is considered more to reflect the difference in development and ongoing use of the well
water in GW-1 to GW-4'compared to monitors 99-1 and 99-2, rather than significant
differences in the real groundwater quality;
'  *  The water is relatively low in dissolved oxygen, -with typical measured values of 2 to 4
mgL;. I
The presence of nitrate-nitrogen in GW-2, GW-3 gand GW-4 indicates some alteration of the
groundwater quality,, likely related to nitrogen fertilizer or from human- sanitary waste.
'U tConcentrations of up to about 3 mg/L exceed the Class AA criteria of I mg/L, but are well
below the WHO criteria of 11.3 mg/L (i.e. 50 mg/L as nitrate);
All of these locations had very elevated.total and fecal coliform counts, typically in the 10,000 to
1,000,000 MPN/100 ml range. These are very high counts and not indicative of natural waters
and, if in fact true values, ind,icate very significant contamination of the groundwater. Although
Ole% ated values compared to the Class AA criteria may be present, these analytical results are
considered suspect. Th? City was advised of these results at the time and it was recommended
that the wells be resampled and analyzed for bacteria.
E3         The characteristics of the leachate source quality monitors 99-3, 99-4 and 99-5 can be
established by examining the differences between these locations and the background quality
Elocations for those ,henical parameters that are typical of municipal landfill leachate. This is
illustrated by the grouping of data as shown in Table 6.7, The "leachate affected monitors" have
elevated BOD, TDS, hardness, chloride, sulphate, conductivity, iron and manganese compared to

l w | ~~the natural background'quality; all of these are typi'cal of' landfiUl leachate. It is noted that thel
heavy metals are not elevated'in the leachate, also typical of municipal solid waste leachate.
Also, the groundwater in monitor 99-3 located near the north.boundary, of the. existing disposal
site is the most affectedipf the three monitors, reflecting that this location is beneath the area
|          where waste disposal commenced and hence where leachate geperation has been ongoing for the
longest time. It should be realized that this chemistry is leachate affected groundwater of
Ielatively weak strength (low.concentrations) compared to pure full strength leachate such as that
to be collected from above an engineered bottom liner system.
The effects of the existing waste disposal activities since 1997 on off-site groundwater can be
studied by examining the water quality in existing wells GW-5 and GW-6 that are located,
respectively, about 20 metres north (downgradient) and at the nqrtheast corner of the existing
dumpsiie. 'As,indicated in Table 6.7, these two wells have elevated TDS,, hardness, chloride and
_conductiv,y compared to the batckground wells, but at lower concentrations than in the leachate
source locations. These ,chemical parameters are typical of the leading edge or front of the
leachate plume development, aid are interpreted to demonstrate that the groundwater has already
been altered by waste disposal for a distance of greater than 20 metres off-site onto the
agricultural lands to the north.
These results demonstrate the need for the implementation of an engineered bottom liner and
leachate collection system to prevent ongoing contamination of the off-site groundwater. As
additional,waste is placed there will be higher dissolved concentrations of contaminanti in the
grpundwater beneath the source (the waste). Without an engineered liner and leachate collection
-          system, this would otherwise result in higher concentrations in the off-site leachate plume and
expansion of the plume as it moves in the groundwater flow direction.
There is the potential for off-site ,wells- in the, low,v lying agricultural lands to the north of the
,   ; '    existing disposal site to beconle affected or more,affected by the present and ongoing waste
disposal activities until such time that the engineered landfill is implemented. Off-site wells
adjacent so the South Parcel should not be affected by the future engineered landfill
development. Also, tiere is no potential for the current or proposed landfill activities to affect
the main water supplies of the urban area of San Femando.

6.8.1  Introduction
The study of biologital baseline conditions, which includes the present dumpsite activities, has
been carried out to provide a basis of comparison for the subsequent impact assessment on
biological resources associated with the proposed sanitary landfill.
The study area includes the immediate vicinity of ihe existing San Fernando landfill site and the
landfill expansion area.  There will be no impact to:aquatic resources, as there are no
waterbodies within the study area. Therefore, it will notbe discussed as part of this biological
baseline assessment.  :

ornamental species of plants such as Birds of Paradise, Gutnamela, Golden Box plants, Mayana,
VietnTn Rose, San Frincisco, White Kalachuchi and Morning Glory have also been planted.
Table 6.9 provides a listing of the plants identified Within the existing landfill sife, and Figure
6.5 is the vegetation map of the area.
The 25 species of plant identified in the existing landfill area are mostly ornamental and of high
economic importance,as either fruit-bearing trees or high quality wood sources. Nine (9) species
Of identified non-dipterocarp trees are ecologically important as sources of food for birds. lThese
include Annona muricata (guyabano), Pil.becelloblum dulce (kanachile), Tama-indus indicd
w ~~(taniarind), Puteria campechiana (chesa), MangfJera indica (mango), Spondiats purpurea
(sineguelas), Musa sapentium (banana) and Annona squamosa (atis). A number of insects also
use th:ese noli-diptemcarp, trees for food (flowers) and-assist in pollination. Notable insect food
plants are Moringa oleffe'rt (malunggay), Delonix regia (flaimc tree) and Gliricidia sepium
i lii(kakawate. Birds' an insects also use most of these planits as temporary shelter from extreme
% eather conditions.  In the existing landfill site, most stands of non-dipterocarp trees in the
%eslern section are in mature stages and could be sources of food as well as shelter. Most of
these mature trees have a diameter at breast height (DBH) of more than 10 cm and are assumed
to be more than 6 years old.. However, it appears that these plants are utilized minimally by local
fauna due to disturbance from human activities (garbage sorters) and vehicular noise from the
adjacent municipal coutcrete road on the west side of the landfill. Furthermore, stands of these
trees are limited in number and are have been planted in a row against the west perimeter wall of
1thc existing landfill site. The younger stands of bees in the eastern section of the existing
L    q -       landfil site contain individuals of on~ly 4 cm to 8 cm DBH and' are non fruit-bearing at present.
Although some of these plantis have also been identified as having medicinal properties, the
limited number of these trees makes them not economical to harvest. The majority of the
vegetation present within the project area is introduced and are non-endemic species of little
natural heritage value.

Proposed Landfill Extension Area
~J tWithin the proposed sanitary landfill expansion site, 30 species of plants were identified: 22
non-dipterocarps, 4 bamboos and 4 grasses.
During the five day-sampling period (13-14 and 18-20 March 1999), 208 plant samples were
collected. Table 6.10 preseiqts the list of identified plant samples and their common names,
frequency, relative density and species diversity. The non- dipterocarps are the most dominant
species in the study area. Among these, GlIric1i1a sepium, Psidium guajava, Leucaena
leucocephala, and Tamarindus indica are the most abundant.
Most of the 22 species of non-dipterocarp plants in the vicinity of the landfill site are of high
|         economic importance. As discussed earlier, most fruit-bearing trees in the area are ecologically
important as sources of food and shelter for birds and insects.! HoI% ever, since these fruit-bearing
plants are not mature, they are not utilized by 'wildlife. The economic importance of each
species is presented in Tables 6.11 and 6.12. Despite their high economic importance, the
'  l  ' |     number'of stands of these plants is very limited and they are relatively small in terms of size.
Furthermnore, these plants are growing in an unproductive and uncultivated area.
Four species of bamboo were observed in the landfill expansion area. Most of these bamboo.
plants were relatively young, with only 5-6 basal stands with an average height of 3 m. In
_             gngeral, bamboos are an hnportant group of plants to the economy of the rural areas in the
Southeast Asia, as is evi4ent from the fact that all parts of the bamboo are extensively used by
local people.
Within the project site, local people find little use for bamboo plants. Those located near' houses
are sometimes used as fencing material. However, very few families indicated this practice. In
an interview with local r?sidents, whenever they find young shoots that can be used for food,
these are cut from the basal! section of the tree and cooked as a vegetable. Thick stands of
bamboo are often used by birde for nesting. During vegetation surveys, however, inspection of
e   l|         bamboo stands reveale, that there were no bird nests in the area.

Four species of grasses, dominated by Imperata cylindrica were found in the proposed landfill
site.: Based on an interview with local people, the area is often used as a grazing zone for
animals such as goats, carabaos and cows. Grasses and other fodder plants in the area serve as
feed for domestic herbivpres. Most of these plants belong to the families Gramineae and
Leguininosae, although other herbaceous and woody plants are also eaten by animals. Grassland
and fodder plants are collectively called forages. iForages can be defined as feed for herbivores
and are usually lower in nutrient concentration and digestibility than concentrates, such as grain.
Forage plants can dczur in the wild and are commonly found in grasslands, in tree crop
plantations or in open spaces in and near forests and along roads and canals. In tropical areas
with high rainfall, grasslands are usually sub-climax vegetation communities, because the natural
climax is almost always closed canopy forests. These sub-climax grasslands haye been formed
through human clearing of forests for agricultural purposes and are maintained as sub-climax
e            communities by the grazing and burning of abandoned croplands (Whyte, 1974). Visual
inspection of the grass ,tands in tl e landfill expansion area indiI,atcd no utilization of the grasses
as nesting areas for birds. i
In general, the presence, relative abundance or coverage, and relative size of the various species
in a secondary forest, such as the landfill expansion area, are indicative of the health of the local
forest ecosystem and, tlus may serve as indicators of site quality. In this pase, the very limited
biodiversity of plants in the landfill extension area and its vicinity indicate low soil fertility. The
correlation may or may not be apparent because vegetation also reflects the effect of events and
.*S          factors that are unrelated to site quality, i.e., plant competition and mutualisin, herbivory, low
*            light conditions in the understory or past events in the history of the v getation such as drought,
insect outbreaks and hluman disturbance. This last factor has considerably affected vegetation
and wildlife in-the proj ct site. Nevertheless, site characteristics are sufficiently reflected in the
vegetation to make it a successful index of site quality in many instances. The plants them!jelves
are used a measure of the quality of the site as they integrate the effects of many climatic and
soil factors that are difficult to measure directly.
Tree species are usefu indicators because they are lotng-lived, relatively-unaffected by stand
density and easily identified in all seasons. of the year. Some species have sucL a narrow
ecological range that their occurrence is 'indicative of a particular site characteristi;. Most trees,

however, have a wide ecological range and may occur and thrive in a wide variety of
environments. Thus, their presence is of little value as indicators of sitd quality. Within the
X1           proposed project site, the characteristic tree species were similar to those found in other sections
of San Fernando City. This implies homogeniety of climate and soil conditions in the area.
Plant species of the shrub, herb and moss-lichen layers (termed ground!flora or ground cover) of
forest communities may be more useful than tree species as indicators of environmental quality.
However, as they were not observed throughout the study area, they could not be used to
- |          evaluate site conditions.
* During the rainy season, local people observed no additional species of significance growing in the
proposed landfill expan,ion area. This could be attributed to the homogeneity of climatic and soil
characteristics of the area.
Surrounding Landfill Area
Visual inspection within a 10 km radius of the proposed project site indicated that the vegetation
was comprised nmostly of secondary growth species. This can be attributed to existing land use.
Twenty two (22) species of plants were identified outside the study area. Of these, 17 species were
* r |        non-dipterocarps, 3 were bamboos and 2 were gra'ses. This limited pumbee of plant species
outside the study area wps a reflection of the prefereoces of the residents around the area for fruit-
bearing and ornamental plants.
Of ecological importance, 10 species of these non-dipterocarp trees are used by birds and insects as
sources of food and sbelter. Most of the tree species in this area are mature. However, the scarcity
of these -stands severely restricts the number of bird and insect species that they are able to support.
Psidium guajava is the most abundant tree species in this area, but stands ofthis tree were relatively
L   a          young land non-fruit-bearing. The same was true for stands of Gliricidia sepium. (kakawate) and
Tqianri7ndus indica (tamarind). Funhermnore, most of theso-stands were found along the road in the
northetn section of the proposed landfill site expansion, indicating that these trees were planted.

Insects i
During the study period, only; three species of insects were observed in the project site:
AIopolus tamulus (s40ort-4orned grasshopper), Praying Mantis, and Tereglyllus testaceous
(brown cricket). Most of these insects are residents of grasslands, kaingin or cultivated lands.
However, the number of collected insects may not represent thp actual number in the project site.
Only seven (7) short hprned grasshopper, three (3) Praying Mantis ,ad three (3) brqwn crickets
were noted during the study. Most of these insects are preyed upon by bir'M.
Mammals,
No mamnwals were trapped in the proposed landfill site However, local residents have observed
Kurarapnit, or the short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis luzoniensis), during early
evening. This could be attributed to the presence of a number of fruit-bearing trees within the
project site and its vicinity. The short-nosed fruit bat was sighted only rarely by local residents,
likely as a r '- of the limited number of trees and that most are non-fruit-bearing.

Actual on-site noise levelJdetermination was undertaken to establish baseline noise levels on
March 9 and 10, 1999 as there are rio available data of ambient noise levels in the project area.
Using a portable' Sound Level Meter, measurements were made at six sampling stations. At              H
Station 1, which is adjacent'to a more densely populated area, diurnal sampling was conducted.'
Seven readings were recqrded at each sampling point, for which the maximum, minimutn and
mean values were recorded. At the time of sampling the wind speed was 1.0 n/s blowing from
the NNE direction.
6.9.2  Measurement Locations
The locations of noise level measuremi ents are shown on Figure 6.3. These locations are the
same as those used for ambient air measurements.  For additional information refer to
photographs in Appendix K   ,

The total traffic, flows aL the site entrance were obtained by summing these two counts.
Considering the aggregate traffic flow, the principal fundings of the survey at ,TI are as follows:
*  motorized traffic represents approximately 62% of the total recorded traffic flow;  !
* peak traffic flows, both total and motorized traffic, occur between 07:00 and 09:00 hours.
From 09:OQ until 11:00 hours there is a build-up of traffic flows and after 11:00 hours traffic
flows are relatively constant, diminishing somewhat between 13:00 and 15:00 hours. After
19:00 hours, and afteu 22:00 until 05:00 hours there is very little traffic flow. Between 01:00
hnd 04:00 hours no traffic movements were recorded;
*  pedestrians constitute the most significant component of the traffic flow, accounting for
approximately 31% of the total traffic flow. The majority of the pedestrians are waste
|  z    .       pickers and their relatives entering and leaving the dump site;
*  tricycles and motorcycles are the major component of the motorised traffic flow recorded,
representing approxinmately 17% of the total measured flows and about 27% of the total
motorised traffic flow,
*  another significant component of the traffic are vans, trucks ,and dump trucks which
comprise 13% of the total traffic flow and approximately 21% of the total motorised flow.
Approximately 66°e of the dunp trucks, vans and truck traffic is involved in the delivery of
MSW to the site; and
*           *   light vehicles, fncluding public utility jeeps and private vehicles, comprise approximately
31 % of the total traffic flow and around 51% of the total motorised traffic. Approximately
24% of private vehicle traffic is involved in the delivery of MSW to the site.
The only traffic entering the dumpsite comprises pedestrians, dump trucks and private vehicles;
r                       the latter two categories are used in the delivery of MSW to the site. At the time of the survey
waste. deliveries were restricted, in the main, to daylight hours (primarily between 06:00 andc
17:00: hours), with three periods of peak traffic flow recorded (see,,below). But on actual
observations, it was observed that dump trucks were still in operation up to 24:00 hours.

The last census in 1995 put the population of San Femando at 91,943 inhabitants, *shich was the
result of a 1.59°%o per year growth rate since 1990. Based on this growth rate, the City Planning
and Developmnent Office projected the 1999 population to be 97,95 1. The total land area of the
LGU is 10,688 hectares, which gives a popul3tion density of just over 9 people per hectare, or
916 inhabitants per square kilometre. The prOject site, i%hich is the site of tile current landrill, is

populated, witlh population densities ranging fromi 5-8 persons per hectire. Population densities
of Mameltac and Dalangayan Este although higher than Dalangayan Oeste and Saoay are still
moderately low-density, ranging from 10-12 persons per hectare.
!  For the purposes of the project and the preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), the
Project Affected People are identified as of the date of the baseline surveys, March 17 -24, 1999.
These are 13 waste picker households and 15 households affected by the,land acquisition for
expansion of the current site, for a'tptal of 144 individuals. These constitute the primary impact
group. Only 4 waste picker households are located in Barangay Mameltac, a majority of therg
(nine - 69.3%) occur in Barangays Cabaroan, Canaoay and San Vicente where the old dumpsite
was located. Barangays Canaoay and San Vicente are approximately 10 knm away from the
project site, to the south of the urban area. Eleven (84.6%) land ow,ners and occupants
hquseholds reside on the land, which will be acquired by the City Government for the project
(Dalangayan Oeste), while two land-owners live ih Dalangayan Este. Out of the I 5 respondepta
covered by the Perception Survey for the secondary impact zone households, 31.3% reside' in
Barangay Mameltac, 30.4% from Barangay Dalangayan Oeste, 25.5%)o from Dalangayan Este and
13.0% from Barangay Saoay.                                        ,
Waste pickers and residents within the Impact Zones are a mixture of migrants and locally bom
people. A greater proportion of respondents were born locally: 53.8% of the waste pickers,
84.6% of the landowners, and 60.9% of those from other households. Less than half of the
respondents from other households (39.1%) and among waste pickers (46.2%) are migrants'frqm
* the other barangays in San Fernando City, other parts of the province of La llnion, the provinces
ofithe llocos Region and some are even from the Quezon Province, whereas only :15% of the,
land owners and occupants are migrants.
Migratory patterns show that those not born in the survey, area transferred most frequently
because they married a resident. This is prevalent among waste pickers another common reason.
for transferring is that they have acquired a house and lot in the area. Since the majority of the
households within the primary and secondary impact zones are locally-born, a large percentage
of them have lived in the area for more than 10 years: 76.9% of the' waste pickers households,
--    84% of the landowners households and 80% of the other households.

group. The economically active population for San Fernando as a whole is 72.2% (CPDO
documents). This implies a higher dependency raitio among the waste pickers households, such
that more people are dependent on each wage earner amongst those families. Waste picker
households are also larger than those of the other groups.
For San Fernando as a whole, women slightly outnumber men (50.6% to 49.4%) although in the
urban Barangays men outnumber women (52.6% to 47.4%). There is a slight preponderance of
male members in waste pickers and'landowners/occupants households while there are almost in
equal number of genders among the other households where 50.9%f are male and 49.1% are
females. There are more single members in the waste pickers households (65.8%) compared to

6.12.7 Gender Antalysis
It 'was found that in the wastepicking group of women, general considerations of poverty,
education and access to resources were of primary importance. In the productive sector, there is
little or no difference between men and women as regards the division of labour and rewards
involved in the pickiih,g of waste. The domain in which gender subordination seems to be most
evident is the reprocouctive one and the pattern of inequality is consistent with the general
domestic situation of women in the Philippines. That is, the women are responsible for most of
the hlousehold chores and child-care duties. .
In the landowners/tenairt group, poverty is less pervasive and therefore less definitive, however,
in the productive sector gander does not play a determining role. Both men and women share the
samne rewards and responsibilities with respect to their properties. Again, it is in the reproductive

In the impact zones, Inany households get their drinking water from wells: 46.2% of the-waste
pickers households, 61.53o jof the lazdownerstoccupants households and 53.9% of the secondary
impact zone households. Most of 'them. also use the communal pitcher pumps installed by the
*   : government, i.e. 38.5% ofthe waste pickers households, 53.8% of theland owners/occupants.'and
35.7% of the other households. Some households also have their own pitcher pumps; 15.4% of
l      '   ' waste' pickers houseliolds, 7.7% of land-ownersloccupants households and 15.7% of other
households. For! daily cooking, LPG is widely used among the respondents: 50% of waste
pickers households, 61.5% of land owners/occupants households and 67.0% of other households.

,  w  '  households ,use open pits and/or communal toilets.
Garbage collection services' of the City cover only the city proper. Therefore h6useholds within
-''the four barangr)s iddn:ilied in the impact zones dispose their garbage by burning,'disposing in
, rashcans, or'burying mixed, waste., Exceptions to this are some waste pickers,who live in
Barangay Canaoay, which is covered by garbage collection services. There are more households
within the secondary impact zones who burn their garbage (92;2%), than landoyvners/occupanjs
(84.6%) and other households (69.2%). A small number of households sell their recyclables to
junlkshop operators., Sore of them also reuse their garbage by composting and feeding it to pets

,  X      !  -    diffiPUlt- for them t? breathe and sleep at night. When asked in the survey about perceived
environmental changes over the past S years, approximately 14% of tfie respondents believed
there was less, ai, and noise pollution as-a result of, improvements to the landfill management
practices. Forty-six percent, however, believed there has been more air and noise pollutirn.

dala6,of the cnviroinment surrounding the project site. In brief, the principal observations are
considered as followvs:
*  Residential settlements occur in the periphery. of the 'existing dumpsite and within tile
*' -          .proposed for. expansion. Residential structures are located 'in all 4' of:the barangays
surrounding the site, and ,specially along the primary haulage route. These communities are
considered likely to be affected, directly and indire  by the project proposals.
_  .  Most of the population hit the ,irea fall under the low-income group and.some households rely
in whole or in part on waste picking activities and in tilling the land.
'   Other than these lsettlements and the neighboring integrated farm, the. surrounding area is
-                     .     classified as agricultural land where tobacco is grown dyring the dry months and rice during

Operafions: The City is presently using the dumpsitel? dispose of garbage. The predominant
site operations pomprise earth moving, garbage pliacemnt .and daily (temporary) cover
placement. In additiop, about 15 waste pickers collect recyclable materials from the freshly
disposed garbage; the collected material is stored on site and subsequently sold to outside
L ~~~~~~recycling businessies;`,-. j' 
Meteorology: San Fernando City is characterizqd by a Type I climate of the Modified Coronas
system of climate classification, with two pronounced seasons, being generally 'dry' :from
December to.May and 'wet' from June to November. The strongly seasonal nature of the climate
is dictated by the NE and SW monsoons. The mean annual rainfall recorded in the San Fernando
r                  ; .',City area. is 2430 mm and the monthly evaporation rate ranges from 140 mm to 217 mm. The
. project-area is affected by the north wind from October to May, the south wind flow from June to
September, and the trade ,winds in between monsbons. The annual prevailing, wind direction! in
the area is northward. Other synoptic systems or hazards affectipg the teniporal and s'patial
distributioin of rainfalli in these areas and in the country as a whole include thunderstonns, cold
r: ~.  ..   fjroot, int rtropical cdcnvergence zone (ITCZ), easterly wave, tornado (Buhawi), and the northeast
(A.mihan) and .iouth%est (Habagat).monsoons.
Geodogyc:dThageologic setting of -the San Fernando areWais dominated by the presence of upland
'  bedrock-dominated't-eraii,lgwith alluvial sediments in the lowlands along the coast and in major
I   I.-   0    .,I
r'.iver vatleys. The results of a subsurface investigation indicate that the natural subsurface
profile on the study site appears to be fairly uniform and consists essentially of a weathered
bedrock sequence, with the upper portion being complet6ly weathered to clay soil and the degree
of weathering decreasing with depth until intact fresh bfdro6k is encountered.' On th existing
dumpsite there has been waste placed over much of the property,' by dumping, spreading it
and/or in excavatod holes and trenches.

,  Soil: There are se.en ¶7) types of soil found in the area. Thses are Bauang Clay, the Barcelona
Clay, the Bolinao Clay, the Sjn Manuel Silt Loam, Annam Clay Loam, Hydrosol and San
Manuel Sand. The deposits likely comprise weathered bedrock materials. The soil type in the
area'f the sile is identifie d'as'Bauang clay.
Land Use: The lan,d use within the study area is predominantly agricultural. The areas along the
roads are predominantly residential
Swtface Water Drainage: Surface water drainage in the study area is influenced by the terraces of
the farm: lands in the area. There are no distinct drainage courses located within the area, e4en
though. temporary, channels appear to form during major storn events. The nearest drainage
courses are indicated t?obe seasonal and are located about I km north and 1 km south of the site.
Any significant runff from the Study Area (e.g. during major stormn events) flows overland
through the terTaces an4d temporary and/or intermittent ditches/swales towards Creek .1 to the
south and Creek .2 to thl, north, and eventually drains into San Fernando Bay via Carlatan
Lagoon. Surface water drainage at the existing site flows mainly as overland (sheet) flow.
During significant rainfall (storn) events intermittent streams develop at the site in some of the
gullies and along the existing pathways and roads. The North Parcel drains predominately in a
'',  '.  -  . jle  e.a
northeasi direction to the lower northeast corner of the property where' it flows offsite as
overland flow'onto the adjacent agricultural-fields. Thp, South Parcel drains mainly southward
and continues to flow offsite as overland flow onto the adjacent agricultural fields.
Stuface iJ'ater Qiualiiy; As there are no perennial surface water courses present within the study
area, it X%as not possible to assess the surface water quality within the study area during the
baseline 1ata. collection program.
Giy, undwater Use: In the immediate vicinity of the site, water for both domestic (potable)
-'      l      purpo,ses and irrigation, is obtained from dug or drilled wells that are typically completed at
depths of about I 0 to 20,metres belosm ground surface. A number of these wells are located
-- ithin boLh the agricultural and housing areas that surround the existing and proposed landfill
site properties.

Groundwater Flow: There may be a groundwater divide prescnt that is somewhat to the north of
tlte ;topographic divide that exists approximately along the boundary between the North and
South Parcels. Groundwater flow directions art froto this divide northeastward across the North
Parcel and generally, southward across the South Parcel. Existing water supply wells located to
the north, south.and east of the existing and proposed landfill site Parcels are considered to be
potentially do aigradient from the landfill cells in terms of groundwater flow. Wells to the west
,of the South  arcel are, not. indicated to be directly downgradient, but rather cross-gradient in
>   ->  r terms of groundwater flow.
Groundwater Quality: The groundwater monitorihg results demonstrate that the groundwater
quality has already been altered by leachate from the-waste disposal for a distance of greater than
20 'metres off-site onto the agricultural lands to the.north. These results demonstrate the need for
, the 'nplenientation of an engineered bottom liner and leachate collection' syste*m to- prevent
ongoing contanmination of the off-sjte.groundvater. There is no,potential for the current or
". ,',  :  proposed landfill actiyities to affect the main water supplies of the urban area of San Fernando.
Ecology: The.study.area includes the immediate;vicinity of the existing duppsite and-the South
Parcel of land. There will be no impact to aquatic resources, as there are no waterbodies within
in   ,  .,,'  the study area. jlhe majority of te vegetation present within the project area is introduced Ind
consists of non-endemic species of little natural heritage value.' Altogether, i7 species of pla.nts
were identified in the existing landfill site, the expansion area and the surrounding vicinity.
However, only S species were common to all these three sites. No threatened,'endangered or rare
species were identiried within the project site and in the surrounding vicinity.  '
Noise: Although during sampling time there were activities at the existing dump, site, still the
- .   j . T  , obser,ed noise -evels; throughout the sampling day were very much lower than the applicable
DEttR standard.'  I

Traffic: Categonzed [counts of vehicular and pedestrian traffic movements were conducted
manually at two locations along Dalangayan Qeste Road leading to the project site. The only
traffic entering te'dupipsite comprises pedestrians, dump trucks and private vehicles; the latter
two categones are responsible for the delivery of MSW to the site. Larger vehicle  c
accounts for about 14% of the total traffic flow on the concrete municipal access road in front of
the site, of which about hal f is involved in the delivery of solid waste to the existing landfill. At
the times of the teys,-no traffi cproblems wererep.orted or observed.
'Soclo-economics: For the 'ppse of identifying impacts, the study area has been classified into
a Primary Impact Zone, a Secondary Impact Zone, an Additional Secondary Impact.Zone, and
General Area (City of San Fernando, La Union),. bitsd on the likely degree of socio-economic
irnpact of the projject pr,posals. The data collection included a baseline survey, RAP survey, a
Socio-conomic and Perception Survey of Waste Pickers,'Land Owners/Occupants Households
'and Cther..Households 'wjthin ;the hrnpact Zone, Focused Group Discussions. and public
consultations. A number of,key observations have been noted as a consequence of the collecti n
of baseline data of the environmebt surrounding the pro'ct site. In brief, ihe principidl
observations are considered ;as follows: i) Residential settlements occur in the periphery of the
-  .I -.4; eexisting dunrpsite and within the ate proposed for expansion; and ii) Residential structures are
locaied in all 4 of tbe barangays surrounding the site, and especially alohg the p-.imary haulage
route., These conrunies Lle .considered likely.to be;affected, directly and indir' ctly to varying
degree, bj.tlie project'proposal;. .MaIst of the population in the area could be considered to fall
i under the low-income group and some households rely, in whole or in part on waste picking
activities and in filling4tle land.'

7.0'   ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
7.1    Introduction
7.1.1  Methodology of Impact Assessment
As a result of the comprehensive scoping process, a clear understanding of the importance of
environmental/social concerns (impacts, effects, etc.) related to the proposed landfill
development was developed and the critical information required to address those concerns was
identified (refer to Appendix B) . Based on this understanding, a list of issues arid potential
impacts and the studies to be undertaken to address those issues/poteptiai impacts for this
Li Jspecific EIA were prepared for discussion during the fuist level scoping meeting and the formal
scoping session. As noted above, these were presented in the Scoping Report that also outlined
the-studies to be undertaken together with proposed methodology. In particular, the DENR
Scope and Coverage form presents the details of the Agreed Upon -Muse, Criteria for the
j   l                     proposed rnethodology for the impact assessment.
The 'descriptions of the issues/potential impacts and the study methodologies undertaken are
presented below' under the respective issues. It is noted that the studies and documentation also
satisfy the detailed World Bank Terms of Reference for Component 3 (EIA and FS) of the  0
F                        project.
t  r                    In carrying out this impact assessment, the Rotential impacts of the pzroposed proiect have been
identified by comparing the current baseline conditions (the existing dumpsite in operation on
the North Parcel and 'undeveloped/developed land on the South Parcel) described in Section 6 to
the impacts that might be expected to arise from the construction and operation of the engineered
landfill described in Section 5. Potential impacts were generally evaluated as to their potential
significance in a qualitative manner-(although quantitative analyses were done where possible)
using the followng descriptors:
High: proposed project causes a substantial change to the environment
* Moderate: proposed project causes a moderate change to the environment
* Minimal (Low): proposed project causes a minimal change to the previronment
* None: proposed project has negligible identifiable change to the environment

STEEP, San Fernando La Union Sanitary Landfill EMI
The alternative approach is a quantitative or numerical impact assessment;  i  relative
importance of each of the impacts is assigned a weight, which is multiplied by UI ,oring of the
significance and then totalled. The quantitative assessment is considered most useful when
comparing, for example, two sites or two different site development proposals. In this case,
where the impact of the preferred waste management system and proposed site development
proposal is being evaluated, a quantitative evaluation is appropriate and most easily understood.
Impacts have also been assessed as to whether they are of short-term or longer-term duration and
whether they are irreversible (pernanent) or reversible (temporary).
The following definitions have been used in the assessment of the significance of the potential
impacts:
* Baseline Conditions: existing dumpsite in operation on the North Parcel and
undeveloped/developed land on the South Parcel (i.e., dwellings, agricultural land,
NAPOCOR tower, etc.).
*  lhe Project: development of an engineered sanitary landfill at the preferred site for the
management of municipal solid waste generated and collected within the City of San
Fernando, La Union; the preferred site is the existing controlled dumpsite in Barangay
Mameltac and an adjacent parcel of land to the south, located in Barangay Dalangayan
Oeste. The project includes a number of engineered components and measures (design
features) such as bottom liners, final covers, leachate collection/treatment system, gas
management system, surface water management system, operational controls (i.e., daily
L       -             cover), etc. (refer to Section 5). It is noted that some of the design features are essentially
components/measures that will effectively reduce/minimize or eliminate many of the
t               ~~~~~~potential impacts to the environrnent (i.e., the proposed liner., will significantly reduce
groundwater contamination by leachate).
\ k"'                *  impact. a project-derived consequence on the physical, biological and/or human
environment. The impact can be a direct or ipdirect consequence; either positive or
negative; either reversible or irreversible; and either short-term or long-term.

*  Mitigation: an Iaction that prevents, eliminates, reduces, or compensates for a negative
impact    It is noted that the project components/measures, which by design will
reduce/minimize the potential for environmental impact, are not considered mitigation
measures for the purposes of this impact assessment. Where required, additional rneasures
-have been proppsed to mitigate potential impacts that may not be adequately addressed by
the project components/measures. For example, implementation of a mutually acceptable
rehabilitation plan (RAP) has been included as a mitigation measure to address loss of
physical assets and/or livelihood for the occupants of the dwellings presently located in, the
- _                           South Parcel of land (refer to Section 8).
* Reversible impacts: the impact will not cause a net change in the environment in the vicinity
of the project site and the change will not last beyond the project duration (i.e. 10 yrs) -
short-term.
j  Irreversible impacts: the impact will cause a net change in the environment in tlle vicinity of
the project site and the change will last beyond the project duration (i.e. 10 yrs) -- long-termn.
*  Short-term impacts: impacts that are expected not to last beyond the design operating life of
the proposed landfill (i.e. 10 years). This definition is considered appropriate for the
following reasons: i) engineered landfills behave as 'treatment systems' with an extremely
slow process rate in stabilizing the solid wastes (i.e. the duration for complete stabilization,
i.e. landfill life, is typically several decades); ii) the potential for impact on groundwater,
widely accepted as the most sigrificant of all landfill environmental impacts, typically exists
well beyond (a few decades) the operating life of the landfill; and iii) most other landfill
environmental impacts are of concern only during the operating period (e.g. surface water

impact on each environment, together withl other appropriate environment/issue specific
factors (e.g. stakeholder concerns).
*  Long-term impacts: impacts that are expected to last beyond the design operating life of the
proposed landfill (i.e. 10 years). As noted above, the duration of the potential impact has
been defined based on the overal 'process life' of the landfill and this definition for "Long-
GT                        term" impacts was used as general guidance to assess the significance of tbe potential impact
on each environment, togetber with otber appropriate environmentfissue-specific factors.
It is not considered necessary to assess positive impacts with regard to whether they are or are
not reversible: Ihpacts of potential significance are identified as key issues to be addressed
|rt                  through monitoring and mitigation measures. Ilt this regard, it is reiterated that the primary
purpose of the various design and operational components/features of the proposed engineered
landfill (refer to Secticon 5) is to minimize most, if not all, of the potential environmental impacts
associated with the operation of the open/controlled dumpsite (baseline coniditions). The purpose
of the impact analysis presented in- this section is to assess the effectiveness of these
components/features in reducing the significance of those potential environmental impacts frorp
the present high levels (due to the presence of the dumpsite) to minimalUinsignificant levels.
S  L                 Therefore, the overall environmentatl impact of the proposed engineerea landfill is expected to be
positive relative to existing (bas6line) conditions.

The issues and potential impacts related to the physical environment at the site and its vicinity
due to the proposed landfill development are presented iti Matrix I in Appendix B. In this
regard, the following should be noted:
*  Air Quality: As municipal landfills generate landfill gas (i.e. methane) it is important to
address its impact on ambient air quality. In addition, dust and/or odour may impact ambient
air during the construction and operation phases.
*  Groundwater: As municipal landfills generate leachate that could potentially enter the
subsurface, if adequate containment is not provided, it is important to address this impact in

require the closure of an access pathway to residents of Baran,ay Dalangavan Oeste. The loss of
this access is a potential negative ihniact to the re:eniits blong the east and,west sideq of the'
propose, SLF.. In response to requests from the-: residerts, a 3 m access corridor has been
designed around the propotsd facility, Residents, along the west side wilf have access similar to
their current situation. These access orriors will b better constructed than the present access
pathay. Residents long the east side mill have a small increase in distance to reach their
t , residences via the access corridor along'the ptorth and east sides of the current facility. As the
proposed access corridlor will better serve tlie residents than the existing path%, ay, the residents
are in support of this change. This represents a nepgative inipact of'a long-termn, irreversible
nature but of minimal significance for a small number of families  ,            I

impacts have been noticed with. -ct to air pollution from smoke and odours, surface and
groundwater contamination in the immediate vicinity, and noise pollution.
The City Mayor has implemented several activities designed to minimize the impacts of the

Mayor has ordere4 the personnel in charge of the landfill to cover the garbage daily with dirt to
minimize the odor coming from the wast' . .Beautification prdjects (e.g., plantin;g trees'and

The construction of the North Cell will also similarly involve at grade or below ground works in
the north portion, however the relocation of the mixed wastes and soil to the final landfill
conflguration in the south part of the North Cell will rise to some 15 m above ground surface and
be visible to some of the residents in the vicinity of the site. This visual effect is seen to be
negative since it wilf. involve the view of wasten'material, however it will be temporary (short-
term) and last for onl . as long as it takes to reloc8te and shape the waste (less than a month; i.e.
reversible). Thel'relo.-ated waste will thei immediately have!he final cover soi layer placed on
it,, wvhich will then be revegetated ald retinmed to ainaturtil appearaqce. Even these temporary
visual iffects can be minimized by first placing the relocated waste such that it forms a screening
benn on the south, west and east perimeter of the area for each layer; the remainder of the waste
relocation can'then be carried out within the berm, such that it would only be visible from the
north side which is prfmarily farm fields.
Wiih the use of the above measures, the potentially' negative visual effect from construction of
the site are coasidered to be initniial o 'none for residents adjacen't to the site, and only
temporary (short-term) at worst.

* Installation of a solid fence to 2,to 2.5 m height around the entirJ site perimeter, which will
effectively block the view of ihe site from persons/residents when they are at ground level.
The fence will also help to control litter blowing;'
*  Use of portable litter fences ar~ound the active dispoial; area to reduce blow'ing litter,
*  Progressive placement of the soil final cover layer as W final grades are reached.

At present the waste disposal activities are at or below ground surface level on the North Parcel,
and Ias such are virtually not v'isible from off-site with the exception of from the low lying
agricultural fields to the north. The proposed landfill development involves placement and
shaping of waste in a sloped mound to an average height of about 20 to 25 m above the ground
surface.
In the South Cell, filling operations will be screened from the view of the adjacent residents for
11               '       tnost of its operating period, with the exception. of die upper; portion of Phase 2 which is the

perspective, alfi.2ilgh the presence of off-site natural trees and xegefation will partially screen the
South Cell when viewed from a distance.,
'  Fill ,ng acei*X.s in the North CellIwill 'hav c limrinad visibility to residents that live adjacent to the
South Cell. They will however continut to be -kible from the low lying agricultural lands to the

immediate northwest and east of the North Parcel. 'However, the appearance will be much

On-site operations will not be visible 'from the concrete municipal road due to the preseneq of
tree cover between the road and the west'side of the sito.'
With the use of the operational piocedures proposed, the ptential negative visual effects of site
operations are expected fto be minimal and short term/reversible. The final appearance of the
clo'sed landfill areas will actually be an improvement compared to the curreht conditions on the

As ii' ±strated by the cross-sections on Figure5.5, the proposal engineered landfill site
devlc. i ment includes significant changes to the landscape of the site. On the South Parcel there
will b: a disitinct mound rising to about 5 to 10 m above the adjacent land. On the North Parcel,
the n;d iral ridge of the existing high ground along the west side, of the site will be shifted
eastwti r.i and raised in height by about 10 to 15 m, sloping off gradually towards the north and
eastu .iieslopes will be not ,e overly steep, at about 18 degrees (3 horizontal:1 vertical).
Alth l' the proposed landfill development will alter the landscape of the site, it will be similar
to the ge ;ral rolling to hilly topography of this portion of San Fernando which is transitional
between the coastal r lain an the mountainous areas further inland. Once the site is closed and
the final cover layer is placed and vegetated, the disposal areas will resemble natural hills. The
significance of the visual impact from development of the site as proposed is considered to be
j                      irreversible and loa.g-term but minimal in terms of potential negative effects, and a moderate
improvement ove: the current situation on the North Parcel as a Controlled Dumpsite.

* Placement of laily, intermediate and final soil cover layers; and
* Incorporation of benches into the final 3H:IV slopes with a network of swales and spillways
to control a nd direct surface runoff to the stormwater management facilities.
At present the,re is little potential for erosion on the South Parcel (with the possible exception of
the clay surf3ced Balangay road ailowance); there is some potential from the dumpsite on the
North Parcel, although tihere- is little evidence that any significant erosion is occurring. All of
r                      these activi'ies may potentially increase the atnqunt of surface erosion on the site and transport
of the sedi, . .?i ofT-site.
l.<                    The potential for erosion is highest during the site preparation and construction works, but will
remain greater than the present situation throughout the operational period. Because there are no
surface water courses on or adjacent to the site where inicreased suspended solids loading would
be undesirable, the potential adverse effects of increased erosibn from the site is minimal to none
r                      save from the loss of usable soil and washing of sediments onto adjacent land.
i'>-       The proposed site development includes several features to control erosion and the loss of
sedinients frbni the site:
r                      .   Stormwater ditches to shorten runoff flow paths and reduce runoff velocity, thereby reducing
erosion;
*  The use of solid, perimeter fences, which %kiil prevent transporned sef iments from being
l.          - -            washed off-site but rather direct them to the surf.'ce drainage system;
* The use of a coarse granular leachate colleetion layer which, is inherently erosion resistant;1

*  Construction of the stormwater detention and swale/wetland areas at the start of constrtiction
such that, together with appropriate silt traps and silt fences, they are ion place and
operational prior to the majority of the on-site works; and
*  Excavation, and placement of the clay will only be practical during t,he drier summer period,
therefore potential erosion from precipitation will also be reduced.
These design measures and construction sequencing will assist in reducing the potential for
! erosion and the off-site transport of sediments. Their efieetiheness will, however, depend on a
high degree of planning and proper installation and maintenance. The potential impact is
l con,sidered to be tiegative but reversible and short-term and of minimal environmental
significance in this setting.
7.5.2 Slope and Foundation Instability
The, proposed landffll development contemplates the placement of a significant thickness of
waste and daily cover soil, within an air space volume that is a combination of excavation to near
the base of the stiff weathered clay and grade raise above the ground surface.
K                      The on-site soils are quite stiff and can support significant' load without undergoing excessive
deformation. Furthermore, the landfill cell areas will be excavated! 'aown to near the weathered
bedrock, which together with the remnant clay will form the subgrade for the landfill areas.
Altnough detailed stabiljty analyses should be completed for the final configuration during the
final design; the available geotechnical information indicates that a landflll configuration at the
heights and sideslopes proposed should belstablel
l                      The other significant geotechnical feature on the site is the approximately 50 m high Napocor
high voltage tower. In the conceptuai design; a minimnum setback of 25 m1 hps been provided on
a1l sides of the tower. For final design:purposes.it will benecessary to confirm the details of the
tower foundations (type, allo%vable design bearing pressure, founding level) with'Napocor and
possibly by means of site specific investigalions, to ensure that ihe de% elopmeni of the site takes
whatever measures are necessary to ensure adequate support for the tower foundations.

Provided the above two 'itemns are cafried out during the site final design and site devel9pmeni,
the potential impacts, although negative, are considered to be reversible and short-term an 1
therefore, minimal.
7.5.3  Enviroumental Effects from Sources of Imported Materials
Dlevelopment of the r -oposed landfill will require quantities of several types of natural soi; n.d
rock material to be iniported from off-site sources. The' excavation and operation of the soI! rnes
of these materials could have potential adverse enviromnental effects at their source loc tion.
The conceptual design has attempted to maximize the use of on-site tihaterials by utilizing t!: on-
site excavated clay for bottom liner, daily cover and final cover construction and for constrl ion
of the leachate i e,ntrnent and drainage facilities and other site grading. The typte and
approxirnate qu2 tihy of imported m aterials are as follows:
*  Granular materials for access roads: 650 cubic metres
* Granular materiaq for leachate collection layer and gas venting: 12,600 cubic metres
* Clay soil for a portion of the daily cover and final cover for Phase 3: 422,500 cubic metres
*, Possible granular material to use for the construction of temporary all weather access roads
for collection vehicles over the landfill areas during rainy weather conditions (qc in.u;
unknown)
It is assumed that the granular material sources will be existing or future DENR- approved
quarry sites as close as possible to the site. In this way, the environmental impacts associated
with the quarrying or aggregate exiraction and processing should have been already addressed in
the conditions of approval for the quarry deve!lopment. This potentially negative impact is
L                      considered to be of minimal significance.    .      *
Calculations indicate that that there will not be enough clay on the site,, and that it will be
necessary to import the above quantity of this materig from an off-site source. Locating suitable
clay in the San Fernando area should not present 'a problem since it is so plentiful, but it will
mean that a new borrow area may b -required to be opened for the project. te City-could either
acquire a clay borrow source, or alternatively purchase the clay-from a privately owned source.
In either case it will1 or may be necessary to obtain the approval of DENR to cany this out.

7.6.2. Loss of PM xductive Land
As noted above, the loss of productive land use due to the development of a landfill on the South
Parcel is minima, !'ut is of long-term irreversible nature. The RAP inciudes provision for
compensation of feumilies who will lose the productive benefit of the land. The environmental
r                      benefits associated 1-vith the provision of an engineered landfill are considered tp far outweigh
any issues in regard to the loss of a small area of productive land. As such, the loss of
productive land is considered to be negative but of minimal significance.

There will be no loss of topsoil on. the North Parcel, since it has all virtually been already
removed for th.e existing dumpsite. The site works to prepare the South Parcel for landfill
development will involve the removal of topsoil. The topsoil will be stripped and stockpiled and
subsequently re-used on the site as a medium to promote vegetative growth in ditches, in the
detention areas and/or the final cover.
The removal of topsoil from a portion of the site is a short-term/reversible nepaiive effect of
minimal significance.
7.6.4 Reinstatement of Sbil Profile and Productive Land Use
The proposed site development involves the construction of a final cover over bothjthe North and
South Cells, which will include a layer of clay, topped with an organic, medium capable of
supporting vegetative root growth, The organic: medium could consist of a 'dcmbination of
compost from the on-site facility that is worked into the clay as a soil conditioqeier-and imported
topsoil. This is similar to the current sitoalicn o, ihe Soulh Parcel, while on ahe orth Parcel it

low due to nn.ur. '.egra. '  * processes prevalent in the landfill enviromnent

Results
The modeling for the closure period resulted in an average yearly leachate generation of
approximately 560 mm per square metre of landfill (corresponding to about 23 percent of the
average annual precipitation) of which approximately 450 mm would be collected through the
leachate collection blanket. The remaining 110 mm (about 4.5 percent of ihe average annual
precipitation) would leak through the compacted clay liner. The closure conditions represent the
worst case scenario for leachate generation since all landfilled areas are contributing.
Furthermore, the presence of vegetation on the final cover, which is essential for stability and
erosion resistance of the cover soil, increases the potential for infiltration, the main component in
leachate generation. Considering that the landfill phases will only be open for a limited number
of years, it is not expected that the waste would have reached its steady state moisture content at
the time of closure; is such the above results gives conservative values.
The modeling of leachate generation during the operational period resulted in a.yearly leachate
generation of approximately 8 mm per square metre of landfill (less' than j j1percent! of
precipitation), of which approximately 3 mm would be collected through the leachate collection
blanket. The remaining 5 mm would leak through the compacted clay linef. Theinignificant
difference between tlhe operationali and closure conditions is- attributed tohilgh3r non-inpacLted
runoff during operation due to a lack of vegetatioii on the :clayey daily cover and the high
potentifal for storage of w5ter in the waste due to the relatively low initial moisture content of the
waste during placement. Additionally, the volume of leachate generated would be lower since
there will only be portions of the landfill contributing at any given time.

For both the closure and operational periods there will be considerable seasonal lifferences
ranging from less than 10 mm of leachate generation per month during the .3ry season

(May to October). The actual volumes and leachate generation rates were estimated I y applying

7.7.2  Expected Leachate Quality
As engineered landfill facilities are not common in the Philippines, infobrr stion regarding
leachate quality thit is representative of landfill conditions there is limi. Ad. Therefor:,
information available on representative leachate quality in the Philippines and sr milar count- ies
was reviewed. Among the inorganic leachate constituents that are important regarding potc ntial
groundwater and surface water impacts are BOD, TSS, inorganic nitrogen cow ?outzds
(particularly ammonia), chloride and iron. There can also be certain organic compound. (such as
'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
hydrocarbons or constituents of solvents) present.
The chemical composition of leachate will vary greatly depending on the age ce landfill, the
composition of waste input and climatic conditions. Published data for typical I adfill leachate
quality indicates that the concentrations of the! leachate parameters of coneei  could vary by
r                      orders of magnitude. However, these data represent conditions in developed cour tries where the
L                      waste composition is known to differ considerably from that in the developing ,ountries. The
limited available data for countries with conditions comparable to those expt rienced in the
Philippines (e.g. climatic conditions, waste stream) indicate that the leachate r uality in these
countries would be at the low end of the range provided in p  lished typical data.
The results of the leachate quality review are presented in Table 7.1. It shoN. the physico-

Philippines (that serves a portion of Metro Manila) based on the limited data ava ilable on quality

7.7.3  Leachate Contaminue-on of Groundwater Resources
One of ihe fundareqigal obje *. es, of implementing an engineered sanitary landfill is to prevent
*   lepchatV, generated by the waste from having an adverse effect on groundwater resources. It is
recognized that the landfil' may have an adverse effect on groundwater beneath the landfill itself,
howe'rer the owner (in this case the City) is in control of the' use of groundwater beneath their
site and can ensure that ,wells are not drilled on the site. It is essenti'al that the landfill does not
have an adverse e;ffec on groundwater resources off-site; however, if such adA erse effects do
occur, the owner o thq landfill must be prepared to provide the affected Parties with an
alternative supply c. v kiter of acce'ptable quality. Furthermore, once polluted it is difficult and
expensive to reme rte contaminated groundwater, it is therefore very important that it not
become polluted in the fist place.
The establishmen' oG baseline conditions in the vicinity of the site, as described in Section 6.7,
indicates the follovw,ing key points:
*  Groundwater is generally available for both irrigation and domestic use from wells drilled to
typical deptlhs of 10 to 20 m. Natural background water is generally favourable, however
sampling results ilndicate significant bacteriological colifoffn counts in all wells sampled;
.  The disposal of waste on the North Parcel since 1997 has had an adverse effect on
groundwater beneath the disposal area and for a distance of at least 20 m off-site into the low  4
lying agricultural lands to the north;

faci' i are implemented, after which the degree of impact will lessen over time;
*  Ther. Is no potential for the current or proposed landfill activities to affect the mai . vater
rl                        supf 'e of the urban awea of San Fernando.
The potential adverse imrrpacts on groundwater from landfill leachate depend on the follc Ning:
*  The rate at whicnl leachate is generated, which depends mainly on the mete.rological
. conditions and the footprint area of the waste disposal area;
*   The leachate source stzength, which depends knostly on the thickn:ess of the waste;
.   The potential lea hate attenuation or retardation properties of the hydrogeologica conditions
that underlie the site;
*  The natural qua.. y otthe groundwater.
In the site design, it is recognized that an engineered bottom liner and les ' a collectioi system
is a basic requirement to control potential impacts on groundwater to ac. ritcble le' els. The
proposed engineered features include:                * ;

*  A highly permeable granular leachate collection blanket with a significant b, t om slope to
effectively transmit the leachate to sumps for removal, from the: landfill cell. "'his is very
important in order to minimize the leachate depth (or head) above the liner, since it is the

As described in' Section 7.7.1, the pr oduction of leachate is typically qu'ite variable over the life
(i.e. operation and post-closi ire periods) of the landfill, depending on a number of factors. The
analyses carried out indica  that d tring the operational period of the South and North Cell the
potential leakage through th, liner whrill be minimal (less than ,1 percent of prec?ipitation), and will
potentially increase to a fev. percent post- closure.' It should be recognized that it would take a
number-of years (greater tha i the operating period or tbe proposed landfill) beform the leachate
front (as indicated by conser ative constituents such s-chlo0ride) would actually advance (leak)
through to the underside of he liner. These constituents would then have to migrate down
through the natural moderate  rmeabilitr clay and weathered bedrock to reach the groundwater
table, and would then dissolve c ithe groundwater and travel at the rate of and in the direction of
groundwater flow. It should be Jiiderstood that the migration of landfill leachate contaminants
through a low tperneability linee is by the mechanism of diffusion of cqncentration gradient
(constituents move from areas of high conceritrations, i.e., in the leachate above the liner, to
zones of lower concentration, i.e., natural groundwater below the liner); the quantity of actual
flow of water carrying contaninants with it throug the iiner is very'small.  I;
Although ,cqnsemvativa leachate constituents such as chloride will be transmitted fastest through
I  -     V
the liner, clay soils have significant ability to retard (slow down) the transpott of metals and
many organic constituents. At this specific site where the clay has a significant organic fraction
of 2 to 4 percent, th'eretirdation effects will al4o have a significant positive effect by reducing
the rate of passage of certain leachate constituents through the liner.
The construction of Fhe landfill will include a high degree of quality control on the construction
of the engineered containment components. Leachate levels within the ceils can be monitored

The hydrogeological conditions in the general vicinity of the: San Fernando landfill site are
-           indicated to be geneally favourable for locaa,ng\u aier suipplies for domestic and irrigation uses.
In the unexpected event that off-site water wells become adversely affected by the landfill, it will
be possible to abandon theuse of the well, drill a new.replacement well at a more distant location
and provide a small diameter overland pipe to carry water to the desired location.

In view of these fac.o :s, the potential leakage of leachate constituents through the bottom liner
proposed for Phases 1 to 3 will control the leachate leakage and contaminant rate to an
acceptably low valu . -(d as such the potential negative impact on groundwater is considered to
be of long-tern' btl, r veriible nature and is expected to be minimal compared to the baseline
conditions ofthe coiit ied dumn--;te. Although the relocated.mixed waste and soil will not be

7.7A:. Leachate Ca   4mination of Surface Water Resources
During the. opera, ion of the proposed landfill, leachate has the potential to contarainate surface
runoff at the site. The following points outline various ways in which leachate can affect surface
water:        ,
* Rainwate.' may wash;exposed waste onto adjacent agricultural and residential lands, as
presently is 'the case.,
*  Prior to h . insiallation of the proposed final cover system, rainfall during the wet season could
infiltrats through the site surfaces and cause leachate to build up1An the waste. The resulting
hydrosta & pressgye may force the leachate to break-out from the platform, side slopes and
areas with thin (daily) soil cover and then run down the slopes of the landfill onto adjacent
agric- ltural lands.'
*  During the re-location of the landfilled wastes at the existing dump site, the waste may be
L                |          exposedi In the .event. of a rainfall, rainwater which runs over the exposed waste will be
contam'inatd resulting inimnpacts on the surface runoff at the site.
Ai described in 'Section 5.0, the 'proposed engineered facil9ties for surface water management at the

There exists a potential for downstream lands to be flooded during the poft-closure period
because the existing'sile top igraphy and drainage conditions Will be changedo'. i tO the presence
of the proposed landfill. i.ks noted in Section 5.0, the proposed surface ww er management
system (ditches/swales and ponds) has been designed to prevent such flood:. g by providing
adequate attenuation'detent.In/ retention) during high runoffperiods (i.e. storm.  ' ents). This is
achieved by carrying out s. iple, but comprehensive, hydrological modeling i: mulate post-
development (i.e. post-closur s) conditions and using the results of this assessmk; i- to design the
management system (refer to Appendix G, for hydrological, modeling details). As a result, the
storm runoff conditions relate. to the potential for flooding in downstream lands luring the post-
closure period is expected to  e approximately 'the same as currently prevaiis (;.e. temporary
flooding occurs duriitg major storm events). Therefore, relative to existing c- 2oi s, the risk
of flooding in the site vicinity due to the presence of the proposed landfill s of short-term,
reversible nature and is considered minimal.
7.7.7  Modification of Water Storage Capacity
The subject site is located mainly on the upper to sloping portion of top6graphically high land,
and is underlain by modlrate to lo v permeability %"eatliared cla3. soils., Precipitatioti that fall son
the site under its natural condition would be expected td largely run off, especially considering
that much of the annual rainfall is in the form of heavy stormns.a As such, the site does represent a
groundwater recharge area. Also, the site does not provide flood storige c3pac iL. for itself or the
adjacent lands that are-low lying.
The proposed site development is therefore not expected to have any impacts with regard to
water storage capacity.

7.8.1  Ecological Effects on Vegetation                         -
With the proposed development and expansion of the sanitary landfill, the existing biodiversity
of grasses, weeds and non-dipterocarp trees are likely to remain the same, although their overall
abundance will likely decrease as patches or stands of these plants will be removed. Planting of
trees will take place in available areas, especially ornamental ones that are locally available,

within the project site. These plants. are expected to increase the aesthetic Mai te of the project
site and of nearby-siteS ;tHMill beI re sied .ii'.lace dwsuoyedjuvenile.,  and wildlife
habitat. As indicated by the mayor of San Fernando City, the city goveniment nui  r, il ll likely
' J                      provide the necessary trees required by the sanitary landfill project.
Most of the identified plant species in the study area are considered economic ti'ly important.
However, only small patches of vegetation will be affected. It is estimated that the;  iative cover
in the existing landfill site it'only about 15% of the,area and in the landfill extensio site, vegetative
cover is about 30%. No significant negative impacts are expected in terms of vei atative cover as
only a small section o Ithe project site is covered with low density plant populatiot . Most of these
plant species are grasses, weeds and non-dipterocarp trees considered secondary grc wth vegetation.
Mpst of these plants are situated along the perimeter fence of the existing lan, fil, as yvell as
adjacent to the road in the landfill extension area. Therefore only negligible effects are expected to
juvenile birds and insects inhabiting this vegetation. The existing road around LTAd within tie
landfill area has already resulted in disturbance of the secondary vegeta1ion within. e piojpct site.
As humus is rapidly dlestroyed by exposure to the sun and the ground in the stuo area receives
little cultivatioti and no frerltlizai!oh, Vee -Sil has b.ecbr'me impoverished 'anfd infortile. Weeds
have become increasingly difficult to conitrol.  i
Forest clearance causpes drastic changes in microclimate, which has important effects on the soil.
-               -        The soil surface temperature rises, and exposure to sun and rain quickly changes the physicaland
chemical properties of its superficial horizons. Much of its reserves of organic matter are
destroyed and large amounts of nutrients are released in soluble forms,' especially when
r:                       clearance is followed by burning. Within the proposed laidfill site, people often bring their
animals for grazing and cultivate plants for local use. E'.entui!ly. these practices will lead to
some forrn of slash and burn activity that will degrade soil conditions -in the vicinity of the
project site. It is expectpd that slash and burn cultivation at the landfill expansion site will be
1* _stopped and therefore improvements to the microclimate of the area are expected.

During the operational stage of the landfill, it is anticipated that dust restsuspen-icai will not
significantly affect the vegetation. Visual inspection 'of plants withir the existin g landfill site,
!where operational activities are on going, indicated that there were no significa>it impacts from
dust.
For reasons cited above, the potential ecological effects'on vegetation are co- sidered short-term,
reversible and of minimal significance.
7.8.2 Ecological Effects ou Wildlife
The changes in the terran of the proposed landfill site expansion will likely affect wildlife in the
area. However, based on interviews with local residents and the results of the field investigation
a very limited number of birds, insects and mammals inhabit the area. Due to the low iiversity
and abundance of animals, it is expected that the proJect will have no significant ecologicall
impact on wildlife species. The project will not affect wildlife foraging areas locited beyond the
landfill area. Therefore, the potential ecological effects on wildlife' are considered short-t -nn,
reversible and of minimal significance.

* continued disposal of MSW; "
*  composting of organic waste; and
* operation of leachate treatment facilities and leachate management practices.,
Project proposals include the excavation of an estimated 55,000 mS of mixed v, aste and soil
existing at the site to be relocated into the southern portion of the North Cell (  e 3). This
activity is part of the measures proposed to remediate the existing waste on site. .Xcavation of
wastes that are only partly decomposed will give rise to odours, at least temporari l. However,

Of the average traffic count along the access road and junction with Dalangayan Este Road,
motorised vehicles (PUJ, Private Vehicle, Dump Truck, Motorcycle/Tricycle, l'ruck and V'an)
comprised al-out 87%A, whilUe irk fiont of the entiance to tle siie, rnotorized vehicles comprised
about 730  'rafffic 'etering and exiting the s-te i. abo-t 27% of motorized vehicles.
_                              I       ,. 
Based on two-24 hr traflic counts conducted on March 9-10, 1999 and March 13-14, 1999, there
were about 51 and 58 vehicles, respectively, that entered inIto the dump site. Only 50% of these
vehicles were loaded with solid waile, the rther half .ere hauling the recyclable/sotted materials
for end us*rs. '
Presently,'waste delivery traffic to the sile involves 13 vehicles of various capacities and
ownership. Five are government-o-nei vehicles of "hch t%%o are compactor trucls (5 and 8m'
capacity), while the rest are privately o%trned. These vehki les which,have, varying capacities, are
transporting an esti,mated solid waste ol about 45 mo/d. It is proposed that te.future waste
collection vehicles increise by one.packer t ".1 l    . ....
On this basis, the estimated (increase' in) irafic- fIow's arising from the project'proposal is
assessed to be of no significance.
This estimate is believed, however, to be a signific;nt understatement asl it 'fails to take into
account the following factors:
*  any growth in traffic flows resulting from on-going and'planned developments. Assuming a
_,                          conservative growvth rate of 1.59 percent per annum for, population, total motorized traffic
t1o.v on the Dalangayan Oeste Road i'ould increase by approxiuiately the same growth rate
as Lhe population iricreases, which 'voild approximaie about 57 motorized iehilc1i of all
types, of which only asmall number are waste hauling vehicles.:,.,
_  the magnitude of any increase in traffic flows resulting from construction traffic will be
temporary. jButl. n the operation starts it cin be said that as far at the collection vehicles
are concerned, it will not cause an increase in traffic volume. Any3.eetage of traffic
increase will comefrom the private and pt'blk celiicles 1tp ass in front of the landfill site.

With or without fthe project, therefore, there will be no significant change in traffe flows on

Impacts of potential significance are identified as key issues to be addressed through monitoring
and mitigation measures. The following environmental aspecets/factors were considered:
*  Physical Environment: Air quality, groundwater quality; surface water drainage and quality,
iraeffc conditi: ,i: and noise.
|i61                    0*   Biologc41l Eirfronirnent. Bioloki-al r niriment is a polential issue only in thl South Parcel
that forms abotut forty percent of t,e proposed site, as the landfill (i.e. openi dtimp) already
Cexists on the rsmainder. Of this fotr, perment, about half hias been cleared and is used for
5                     ~~~~~~~~~housing and f irhiing, purposes.:
*  iunnt (Soc;i!-economic) Environnett
It is important to note that the proposed enGirieered landfill in'corporates most of the propdsed
mitigation mneasures in its design and oper;ions in order to minimize most, if not alt, of the
potential environ'mental impacts.  Ihe impact analyeis indicates that the pro%iWion of these
measures 'is p sitive arnd will reduce the significance of ihose environmental inipacs from the
preseut high.levels.(dueto the,presence of dhe dlump;ite) to minimal/insignificant levels.
I . -
In carrying out this impact assessment, the potential impacts have been identified by comparing
the current baseline conditions (the existing dunpsite in operation on the North Parcel and
L                        undeveloped/developed land on the South Pa cel) to the ConceptUai engineered iandfill design
and operations. Potential impacts were generally evaluated as to their potential si-nificance in a
qualitalive manncr, based on quantitati% c anal3ses -,%hre possible.

8.2    Sh,-      a Improx ements to San Fernando Disposal Operations
The San Fernand, dumpsite has progressed in 1999 towards a Controlled Dun i ;ite, from the
Open, Dumping ti; i.7 ,was carrid out in the previous two years since in commc r ed receipt of
wastes from the'' *.. In viev' of the proposed engineered landfill deVelopmn:; there are a
number of issues i can be ad, ressed by the City and improvements to operat 3n 3 made in the
interim before th  * oject is impl mented, as follows:
* Commence tbv separation of o, J,anic wastes from the market, and select a -unverient, soil-
covered loc. tion on the current disposal site where a pilot composting c ):ration can be
implementt d;
*  Commenc;. public education in atives in regard to solid waste;
*  Try to ini lernent more hygien. approaches to waste picking, in terms of pr. tective clothing
and picki ..g on top of a cov,. red waste area outside of the disposal area;
*  Avoid fP tire deep excavations to dispose of solid waste all over the site, ince these will
r'                          create  .n more irregular'ties in the subsurface that will have to be addres. d and waste to
, be relocated during futur-, construction of the Phase 3 cell. It is recomti ended that the
approximate limits of the )roposed south portion of the Phase 3 cell be sur. - !d and marked
out on the site, and that .vaste placement is carried out within the proposec; final contours
during the interim period. This will minimize the quantity of iniixed waste inc soil to be
relocated. It should be p ssible to place the waste in areas of limited size an-1 in 'ayers of I
to 1.5 m thick, and begi. to place regular layers of cover soil. This shoctid reduce the
r                          amount of cover soil neede 1; it should be possible to locate an area on the s, w}:ere cover
soil can be obtained and hau;ed for daily coveIr to the working area;
* Consider the excavation of a ihallow (I to 1.5 m deep) trench along the low eastern portion
L:                         at the north end of the site in which a pump could be placed to tempo.arily intercept
contaminated' water during p riods of high rainfal/runoff and minimize lie amount that
'flows onto the adjacent agricultural lands to the north. The water would he pumped back
upgradient to a temporary holding area in the uphill portion of the fill arez. where garbage
has already been placed, created by a combination of excavating into the waste and berming
the excavated material up around the perimeter of the temporary discharge/holding area;
*  Implement the baseline groundwater and surface water monitoring programs described in

A family-level survey was conducted for the RAP to identify all Project Affected Persons
(PAPs)lProject Affected Families (PAFs). The RAP also has proposed a series of principles to
govern appropriate levels of compensation and rehabilitation assistance for the PAPs and PAFs
(by the LGU as the Project Proponent) as follows:
r
,  For the loss of productive land, the compensation for any easement or temporary acquisition
will be at replac   ent cost.                '
* For the loss of agricultural land, the compensation would be in the form of a replacement
land of equivalent quality and productive capacity at a location acceptable -to the
PAFs/PAPs. In case the suitable replacement land is not available, or at the informed request
of the PAPs, cash compensation equivalent to the replacement cost will be given.
* Replacement of klamaged or lost crops at market value will be incorporated in determining
the replacement cost of land and its improvement.
*  For the loss of means of livelihood and income, financial assistance will be given and
rehabilitation measures and income restoration programs implemented. These inclu'de
alternative livelihood training, other job opportunities and other assistance for self-
employment as determined suitable for the FA;FsPAPs and will be given especially to those
who will be seveiely affected.                                                                    l

*  In.case the whole structure is affected, the PAP household will be compensated in cash for
the entire affected strqcture and other fixed assets at replacement cost, without depreciation
L                    }      regardless of absence of legal right to the lot where the structure is situated.
*  Transportation allowance or transportation assistance will be provided to those who will be
L_,                         relocated.
* PAPs/PAFs whose land is temporarily taken by the works under the Project, will be
compensated at replacement cost for their net loss of, income and damaged assets, as the case

.3.2   Resettleatent Action Plan: Principal Measnres
The RAP provids for the mitigation of the negative impacts on the PAPs, which when
implemented sha uld completely eliminate thie negative impacts.  The RAP provides for
--grievance and coplpaint procedures, monitoring, and reporting to ensure that affected people
and! families do no suffer from the implementation of the program. Additional assistance
1]                        programs and .    nienditions for the restructuring of the waste picking system offer the
potential to improve the economic base of waste pickers. In sum, the residual iegative impacts
should be minimal, and the various positive impacts should be widely shared although not high
for any particular group.
8.4    Potential Aesthetic (Visual) Impacts
The aesthetic conditions at the site presently reflect conditions typically found at dump sites
(even thotsgh the San Femando site is essentially operated as a Controlled Dumpsite) and are not
considered acceptable by modem standards. The development plan for the proposed engineered
landfili will include measures that would address these deficiencies so that the aesthetic
conditions at the site will be significantly improved. As noted in Sections 5 and 6, these
measures will include: daily cover, vegetative coyer on closed portions of the landfill, vegetative
screen (i.e., trees) around some parts of the landfill site, engineered site facilities such as service
roads, ditches/swales, ponds and wetlands and a designated procedure for waste picking.
The change is landscape character is assessed as a moderately significant environmental impact.
The significaince of this impact is dependent on the perception/acceptability of the residents in
the site vicinity. It is noted that these residents are highly supportive!'of the proposed
development because it will significantly improve the present situation (i.e. dumpsite) and, as
discu-sed in Section 7, the post-closure landscape would be compatible with the surrounding
area landscape. Therefore, provision of mitigation measures that would promote beneficial land
use.is; expected to minimize the negative effects of the change in landscape character. These
mitigation measures will include, but not be limited to, provision in the closure plan for after-
r                       uses such as parkland, agricultural land, etc. This will assist in making the landscape more
acceptable to the residents in the area, thus reducing the significance of the residual impact.

It is important t. note that the measures included in the proposed landfill development will
significantly imp  y ve the aesthetic conditions at the site and its vicinity from that encountered
under present cor( 'tions and the overall residual visual impaets are not considered to be an issue

-L                       8.5   Potentiz. i ;,'eological and Geotechnjcal Impacts
Af described i :' -lions 5.3.4 and 6.4.3, the site is underlain by weathered clay soil deposits to a
depth of about'  6 m below original ground, overlying shale bedrock. The development plan
for the site will involve earthworks within these subsurface conditions, essentially the excavation
r                       of soil to crcate the fandfill disposal cell and re-use of the excavated material for the engineered
containmenit components, for the daily and final cover and other site grading works. Potential
geological and geotechnical impacts described in Section 7.5 include:
Erosion during construction and operational periods. Proposed mitigation measures include
the, uase of temporary silt fencing and ditching in addition to the design features such as the
use of solid perii eter fencing; the construction of the stormwater management and treatment
rJ                          sysfem at the start of construction, and; the benching and vegetation of final cover slopes;
*  Slope and foundation stability, both for the proposed landfill development features and the
waste mounds, and to ensure that the proposed site works do not have an adverse effect on
the foundations for the Napocor tower. These aspects have been considered in the design
concept, and will be studied in additional detail during the final design phase; and
r Environmental effects on sources of imported materials needed for coaistruction, which
LJ                        I include both granular aggregate and clay soil. These required materials would come from
currently licensed or future licensed sources, whose potential environmental effects will be
L                           taken into account by the conditions of issuance of their permit to operate by the DENR.
The potential negative effects of these aspects are seen to bo minimal and will- be adequately
mitigated as part of the development as proposed. Therefore, the residual impacts are considered
insignificant.

8.6     otential Pedol glcal and Land Use Impacts
As described in Sectihn .6, there will be no change in land use on the North Parcel that is
already the City du-. ipsite.  The change in land use on the South Parcel from
residentia agriculturat  ill be mifigr d by the requirements of the RAP.  The loss of
agricultura land on the ;juth Parcel is minimal. On completion of the waste placement in the
disposal cell areas, the haped waste areas will be revegetated and the. land can be returned to
appropriate uses such a s passive recreation or low intensity agriculture.
The positive enviror. mental benefits associated with the provision of an engineered landfill are
seen to far outweith any potentially negative issues associated yyith changes in land or soil
usage. Therefore, the overall residual impacts are not considered to be an issue compared to
prepent conditions J          -
8.7    Potentil Impacts on Water Resources
_        !  8.7.1  Grount lwater Resources
As shown in Iectidn 7.7.3, the potential for landfill leachate impacts on off-site groundwater
resources dur , the operational and post closure periods is assessed to be minimal in view of the
pAoposed engineered containment systems and collected leachate treatment and handling.
Compared to the present situation. of the dumpsite, which, is known to be having an adverse
effect on groundwater quality in the low lying agricultural lands just to the north, the proposed
development will have a significant positive effect. As described in Section 5.0, the following
natural and engineeTd components of the proposed site development will reduce/minimize the
potential leakage of leadhate to the groundwater regimne during the operational and post closure
r                        life of the landfill site:
The natural hydrogeological conditions are suited to the siting and development of an
engineered landfill;
* Provision of a low permeability compacted clay liner and highly permeable leachate
,                         collection system;                       :
*  Use of a leachate collection system below the proposed area for relocation of the mixed
waste and soil as part of the rehabilitation of the existing dumpsite; and

*  Use of clayey soil daily and final cover.
In addition, the hydrogeologic conditions in the general vicinity of the San Fernando landfill site
are indicated to be generally favourable for locating water supplies for domestic and irrigation
uses. In the unexpected event that off-site water wells become adversely affected by the landfill,
fl                        as a contingency measure it will be possible to abandon the use of the well, drill a new
replacement well at a more distant location and provide a small diameter overland pipe to carry
water to the desired location. Therefore, the overall residual impacts on groutidwater resources
are not considered to be an issue compared to present conditions.
The proposed measures will significantly improve the protection of the quality of groundwater
resources in the vicinity of the site compared tb the present conditions.
8.7.2  Surface Water Resources
As.noted in Section 7.7.4, the potential for leachate impacts on surface water during landfill
operation and post closurepri   consitered ltinimai because of the' proposed surface water
r                        management structures. In fact, the proposed landfill development will have a significant
V,                       positive impact on the surface water runoff in the area; partcularly the downstream agricultural
lands to 'the north which presently receive leachate impacted runoff from, the existing dump
during storm events. As noted in Section 5, these structures comprise the foliowing measures
that would prevent clean storm runoff from coming into contact with solid waste and/or leachate
(except in the operating phase of the landfill), dtring the post-closure phases (refer to Figure
5.2):                                                    M
r  Perimeter ditches/swales, which will collect runoff from closed portions of the landfill and
the runoff onto the landfill'site from off-site drainage areas;
*  A system of stormwater retentioni ponds aid %'etdand. (hat will collect the runoff from the
above ditches/swales. in order to attenuate the flow conditions to pre-development (i.e.
current) conditioris. This is important u ith regard to the prevention of flooding in the
downstream lands during storm events. The ponds will also remove typical storrnwater
pollutants such as suspended solids, if present in the runoff. Particularly, the proposed
CG                                                                 -    Is . i

L                        It is important to iote that the proposed measures *ill significantly improve the surface water
conditions (iu'e1  ' as well as drainage) in the vicinity of the site from the present conditions.
Therefore, mhii- t; , measures beyond jthe project components/ measures are not connidered
necessary and the overall residual iinpacts on surface water resources are not considered so be an

8.8    Potential Ecological,Impacts
During site preparation and road development on the landfill site, the following measures Are
recommended to mitigate disturbance of vegetation and wildlife:
*  W4ere space allows, in order. to protect larger trees (with a diameter >20 cm) the final
position of the roads 'will be planned, if possible, to be away from each tree by at least 2 m.
If th.e road is to be constructed of concrete, all roots that will be covered should be cut
without killing the tree. This can be done by cutting the end sections of the roots (about 20
percent) to allow for growth in other sections. Pruning of branches may be done to reduce
the requirements for water from the roots.'
*  For any tree with a diameter <20 cm, transplantation is recommended. This can be
accomplished by digging at least -1.5mi around the tree to expose the roots. Soil will remain
on the roots to facilitate successful transplantation. The tree should be planted in a nearby
area wvith similar environmental conditions.  ;
*  As described previously, the vegetative planting proposed around the site perimeter and
lagoon/composting' areas for mitigation of air, dust and noise impacts will compensate
adequately for the loss of vegetation associated with site development. The revegetation will
utilize indigenous plant species wherever possible.

It is noted that the present air quality in the site vicinity doesn't appear to be measurably
impacted due to the presence of the Controlled Dump; the proposed measures for landfill gas

present conditions.    i'
8.10   Potential Noise Impacts
The previous section on Assessr'ient of Potential Environmental Impacts (Section 7) identifies
and discusses the potential noise impacts that could arise out of the construction and operation of
the proposed engineered landfill. It is recommended that the proposed mitigation measures be

It should be noted that a number of significant measures have been incorporated in the project.
This section therefore identifies additional (mitigation) measures deemed necessary to ensure
that the project has the least impact on the site and adjacent areas due to noise.

8.11   Potential Off-Site Traffic Impacts
At present, no traffic problem is being experienced with regard 'to traffic along the access road to
the site. During the project period, it is unlikely that the volume of traffic will increase due to
the proposed landfill development, even though an overall increase of motorized vehicles (public
and private) servicing the residents in the site area is anticipated. ln spite of this, it may be
necessary to assign a City traffic enforcer to direct traffic at the entrance to the project site,

particularly during heavy traffic periods. Therefore, the overall residual traffic impacts are
considered to be insignificant compared to present conditions.
8.12   Summary ef Environmental Mitigation Measures
As described in this Section, the proposed landfill development will significantly improve the
environmental cot- .'  at the site and its vicinity over and above the present conditions (i.e.
dumpsite). Also, the engineered landfill would at the same,time rehabilitate the existing du!mp
and provide a planned, environmentally safe facility.  TherefOre, as opposed to typical
infrastructure projects, most of the project components/measures in this case are designed to
reduce/ minimize the potential impacts and will upgrade the existing Controlled Dump to an
En- neered Sanitary Liandfill. In addition to the project components/measures, mitigation
-7                        measures havce been proposed as additional measures to further reduce the significance of the
potential resie,ual environmental iimpacts, or where the potential impacts may not be adequately
addressed by the project components/measures.
This section presents a summary of the proposed mitigation measures, together with measures
incorporated in the design of the proposed landfill,'to address the potential environmental
impacts associated with landfilling of municipal solid wastes. The physical, biological and
human (socio-economic) environments were considered in the formulation of the mitigation
measures. A sunimary of the project components (design features) and mitigation measures is
presented below:  I

9.0 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
9.1   Introduction
The DENR Procedural Manual for EIS preparation outlines the requirements of an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP). It indicates that the EMP should be based on the
identified impacts and mitigation/enhancement measures and, at the minimum, the EMP should
include the following for each project activity per project phase (pre-construction, construction,
operation and post closure):
*  project impact and corresponding mitigation and/or enhancement measures:
*  cost estimates which may be in the form of a program or equipment purchase;
*  the institutional mechanisms for implementing the proposed measures or programs; and
* the type of agreenients or guarantees that will ensure the realization of such programs.
The mitigation measures and the implementation plan are combined to form an environmental
management program. The proposed mitigation measures are discussed in Section 8.0 and the
proposed implementation plan is discussed in Section 5.0.
As part of the EMP, a Monitoring,Plan has been developed. This Plan is discussed in detail in the
subsequent sections and iincludes the following information as it relates to the proposed
development:
r  parameters of the affected envirorimental condition(s) to be monitored;
a  location of m9nitoring activity;
*  frequency of monitoring activity-,
*  cost of monitoring activity; and
*  implementing or responsible group
Due to the environmental significance of landfill developments and the potential implications of
failure to implement any of the proposed mitigation mneasures and implementation plan
components as . designed/planned, an EMP for a landfill project should also include a
Contingency Plan. A Contingency Plan sets out a sequence of actions to be taken in the event

The DENR Pr. ceduroal Manual for the EIS requires that the Environmental Management Plan
incluces a Social Develcpment Program (SDP), which discusses all programs or components of
the  roposed project which are related to social development. These usually address the
mitigation of potential negative impacts, especially those associated with resettlement,
relocation, income los-, etc.
The SDP for the S3in Fernando SLF project has focused on two main populations that are those
most directly impt cted by, the project. These are the waste pickers, who depend on their
0                      activities in the cu, rent dump for family income, and the landowners or tenants of the additional
land required for the expansion of the current site. These two groups constitute the Project
Affected People (PAOs). The intent of these measures is to ensure that those groups potentially
negatively impacted by the project will maintain or improve their standards of living and
economic opportunities.  This policy is consistent with World Bank, Government of the
Philippines, and international best practice standards.
Specific design features of the project, or mitigation measures for remaining impacts, have been
developed to address both of these groups. Those measures incorporated into project design are
identified in Sections S and 7. Section 8 describes the additional measures taken to mitigate
those impacts that can not be addressed by the project design, in particular the direct impacts on
the PAPs. Extensive detail on the compensation measures and various entitlements for this
population is provided in the Resettlement Action Plan (Appendix M).
9.2.1  Social Development Measures for Waste Pickers
The principal concern for the waste pickers is to be able to continue or improve their current
activities of waste diversion and collection of recyclables. This project design has incorporated
l -                    this consideration into the planning by a staged development process which will allow the waste

pickers to continue their activities on part of the site while other parts are being transformed into
a SLF. At no point does design of the construction require that waste picking activities would be
disrupted.
Further consideration has been given to the work conditions of the waste pickers, and the
provision of more saritary conditions under which to work. A principal waste management area
will be provided in the middle of the proposed site. It will provide a site for temporary storage
of recyclables, and a conrposting area., and training of the waste pickers in the improved
management of their activities.
The baseline resparch on the waste pickers identified a generalized povqrty, and a higher than
average dependency ratio within these families. The RAP includes a numnber of potential steps
that can be taken to improvo the income of waste pickers, restructure their activities to retain
more of the profit, and provide additional training to waste pickers to enhance family incorne
through other activities, whether associated with waste picking or not.
9.2.2  Social Development Measures for, Families Affected by Land Acquisition
The. landowners, residents, and tenants of the land to be acquired by the City will be the most  ,
severely affected by the project. Although the City plans to acquire all of the land through
market transactions rather than forced acquisition, the residents and owners will lose both
income and subsistence opportunities, and a number of facilities and structures will also be lost.
In the absence of mitigating programs, this population could experiencelconsiderable negative
impacts from the project.
The social development and quality of life of this group'has been addressed through the
preparation of the RAP, a requirement of the World Bank for all projects involving involuntary
resettlement or the loss of livelihood from project implementation. The RAP provides for
compensation for all economic assets, structures, and houses on the basis of replacement value
without depreciation, restoration of' livelihoods affected by the project, restoration of resettled
people to an equivalent or improved standard oe lihing. full compensation for lost crops, lost
income and disturbance compensation, as well as assistance to relocate. The full details of the
RAP compensation patkage are provided in Appendix M.

In summary, the RAP is designed to ensure that the population directly affected by the project
are provided with the means, and the procedures, to ensure that their quality of life after the
project's implementation, is as good or better than previously. The plan is to be implemented by
the City, the project proponent, and defines and describes both the monitoring program to be
followed, as well, as grievance procedures for the affected parties should they wish to contest the
implementation.
9.3    Monitoring Requirements and Monitoring Plan
93.1    Introduction                                           !'
Poor standards of sitq operation and/or inadequate site management have the potential to cause
unacceptable nuisance to, or significant impacts on, the environment around the site.. It is
essential, if the landfill is, to function as an en ineered sanitary landfill, that the mitigation
measures incorporated in project design are implemented in full.. This requires not only proper
and adequate site management (i.e. an experienced contractor/operator) but also a system of
inspection to ensure compliance to the conditions specified in the ECC for,the project.
The World Banlk's Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (1999) sets out the following
basic principles to assist in the design of an environmental monitoring system:      I

Accordingly, it is anticipated that two fundamental tylpes of inspection and monitoring will be
undertaken on-site:
*  Monitoring of compliance of site development to, any specified conditions, including
adherence of site operations and management to the principles incorporated in project
design; sid
* Environmental monitoring to assess the imphcts arising from on-going site development and
operation.
9.3.2  Minimum Monitoring Provisions
The site operations should comply, at all times, with relevant National and Local Regulations.
The objective cf good sanitary landfill design and operating practice is to minimize the impacte of
[_           --     *   project activities on the surrounding environment. It is necessary, therefore,, to undertake
monitoring on a regular basis during all phases of site development, and upon completion of site
activities.      l
Environmental clearance will be required annually from the DENR for operating the facility.
Landfill construction and operations will be monitored by the DENR, independently of any
inspection and supervision of the service contract performed by the LGU, in order to ensure
compliance with prevailing environmental legislation. It is envisaged, tl1erefore, that two levels
of monitoring/inspection will be undertaken to oversee site construction and operation, the scope
r                       of which is set out in the mitigation and monitoring plai} as presented below. The Operator will
L                       be required to fulfill the obligations set out under the plan thrqughout the period under which the
service contract with the LOU is in operation.
The implementation of the mitigation and monitoring plan will fall to both the LGU and the
r                      DENR. This places considerable emphasis upon the need for institutional strengthening of
LGU's SWM organization and the DENR, in terms of staffing, training and availability of
equipment and resources, in order to enable thern to provide the required degree of monitoring
and control respectively.

9.3.3 Multi-Partite Monitoring Team (MNMI)
Article IV of DAO 96-37, Section 10-12 provides for the monitoring of the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) as part of the EIS System. The EMP shall be monitored by the Multi-
Partite Monitoring Team (MMT) composed of representatives from the:
*   project proponent (LGU);
*   affected communities and women;
* relevant local government units (barangay); and
* PENRO and/or CENRO in the project area.
The functions of the MMT as identified in DAO 96-37 are as follows:
*  monitor project compliance with the EMP and condition in the EqC;
*   gather information if damage occurs or public complaints are raised about the project;
*  prepare and disseminate monitoring reports and submit recommendations to the DENR; and
*   conduct relevant convmunity information and education campaigns regarding the project and
its impact on the environment.
The EMP includes the RAP, and according to DAO 96-37, the RAP shall also be monitored by
the MMT.
The DEMR Regional office and the EMB will provide support to the MMT in technical aspects
or evaluation and policy monitoring.
93.4 Monitoring RAP Implementation
The staff of the MMT! will be responsible for monitoring activities.  They will collect
information every month from all concerned LGUs (barangay, city or provincial), the PAPs, and
the DENR PENRO/CENRO. Based on the data collected, they will maintain a database of
resettlement monitoring information in the MMT, which will be successively updated every
month.   A 'ronthly' report will be prepared and submitted to the CSDC Head of RAP
implementation.

3. Grievance procedures;
4. House demolition and transport and shifting assistance;
5. The provision of buffer trees;
6. Employment of appropriate PAPs at the SLF;
7. Provision of training and allowances;
8. The linkage of compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation with the commencement of
civil works.'
A monitoring report will be submitted by the MfT to the World Banlk every three months.

information to allow improved environmental management at the site, including the assessmertt
of the need for the implementation of the contingency plan, if required. The Site Operator will
be responsible for carrying out the routine monitoring program, with the documented results
forwarded to the LGU and the MMT on a monthly basis for inspection and review. In addition,

9.43   Envir6nmental Monitoring Programs
Groundwater
In the development of a groundwater monitoring program, it is important to recognize the
fundamental difference between groundwater flow and surface water flow: Surface water moves
through open channels at a relatively fast rate, depending on the volume of water it is carrying
and the bottom grade and dimensions of the channel. On the other hand, groundwater travels
through the pores of the soil or the fractures in soil and bedrock, and therefore at a much slower
rate than surface water. The rate depends mostly on the type of soii or rock and the hydraulic
gradient (slope of the water table). Considering that the contaminants travel in dissolved form in
the gIoundwater, tho potential effects when contaminated water mixes with natural groundwater
quiality *-:ouid take place at a very griidual rate. In terms of moniitoring for the potential effects
L   of a contaminant source -(such as ;a landfill) Ion groundwater quality, the frequency of
groundwater monitoring can be much less thait that required to check on potential changes to
F                      surface water. It is alpo appropriate to plan the frequency of groundwater monitoring to reflect
the annual precipitation conditions, in this case to reflect the dry and wet seasqns of the year.
l.                     As part of the baseline studies, five groundwater monitoring wells were installed at the site. Of
these, monitor 99-2 will havp to be properly abandoned during the development of Phase I of the
r F                   landfill, jand similarly for monitors 99-4 and 99-5 during the devel'opment of Phase 3. It will
however be possibe t continue  use these three monitors to collect baseline data until they
have to be abandoned.! Monitors 99-1 and 99-3 are located outside of the proposed landfill areas
,                    !~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,  I 
and canIbe maintained intact and incorporated, together with additional new monitors and
existing off-site water wells, into the groundwater,monitoring program. Baseline data collection
L ;                   in monitor 99-3 and the off-site wells to the north will also serve to monitor the environmental
effects of the present tdnengineered disposal site operations on off-site groundwater quality. The
fl rexisting dug well, GW-6, at the northeast corner of the existing dumpsite should be properly
l  t '                abandoned.
! L                   The proposed groundwater monitoring program locations are shown on Figure 9.1, and the
program is described below:

SWEEP, San Fernando La Union Sanitary LandfJll EI
Groundwater Levels and Monitor Development: The first task in monitoring is the measurement
of the static water level relative to the top of the monitor well casing, or a similar reference point
on a water supply well. The elevation of a reference point at each groundwater monitoring
location be surveyed to geodetic datum. After measuring the water level, and pripr to sampling,
the monitor must be developed by the removal of at least three standing volumes of water. After
the water recovers, sampling can be carried out.
Baseline Monitoring: Groundwater monitors 99-1 to 99-5, off-site wells GW-l to GW-5 and the
next closest existing Bell (in the low lying agricultural lands to the north) that is north of GW-5
(referred to as Gt1Y-7 on Figure 9.1)
Operations MonitorJng:Groundwater monitors 99-1 to 99-5 as long as they can remain in servicp;
off-site wells GW-1 to GW-5 and GW-7; and four new 'roundwater monitor locations as
designated by M-6 to M-9 on Figure 9.1. The new groundwater m'bnitors should be installed
with their screen to intercept the upper portion of the water, table zone, and be monitored at least
twd times prior to the'commencennent of engineered landfill implementation.
Monitoring Frequency. Two times per year, once in the dry period (April-June) and once in the
wet season (October-November).
Parameters: It is proposed that the groundwater samples should be anaiyse d for the following
parameters, which includes leachate indicator parameters as well as those' regulated by the
DENR standards applicable here, ie. Class AA Water! Usage/Water Quality Criteria- Public
Water Supply Class I (refer to Section 6.7.3): pH, temperature, conductivity, chloride, sodium,
hardness, iron, manganese, boron, colour, dissolved oxygen, BOD,S TDS, N03-N, chromium
(IV), Oil and Grease, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and total and fecal coliforms.
In order to have meaningful monitoring results, it is essential that a repeatable protocol for
monitor development, sampling and sample preparation be developed and rigorously followed by
the field personnel.

SWEEP, San Fernando La Union Sanitary Landfill EL9
The monitoring parameters and frequency sh6uld be modified based on an assessment of the
baseline data and tho results of the two years of operational monitoring. If the water quality
meets the applicable criteria, then the monitoring frequency could be reduced accordingly. Also,
if the leachate quality indicates that some of the parameters are not present in the leachate, then
those parameters could be dropped from the monitoring program. For example, it is not
expected that the heavy metals listed above will be encountered in the leachate.
Post-Closure Monitoring: The above described monitoring parameters and frequency should be
modified for the post-closure period based on an assessment of the results of the monitoring
during operation.  It is anticipated that the post-closure monitoring requirements can be
significantly reduced at some point as the leachate so'urce strength declines over time. A detailed
monitoring plan should be included in the landfill closure plan that would be prepared towards
the end ofthe landfill life.
Surfsice Water 
As noted in the previous sections, thete are no perennial (flowing, permanent) water bodies
located within about one kilometre of the proposed site and surface water drains from the site
oveiland via the downstream agricultural lands to both north and south following no defined  k
pathways. Therefir, it is rot possible to establish baseline locations for surface water
monitoring within this area that could be monitored during the proposed lazwdfill development.
However, it will be possible and necessary to monitor surface water at strategic locations on the
Li                       site (e.g. the outlets of the proposed leachate and surface water management struCtures). The
monitoring program proposed in this regard is summarized below.
If possible, during the period prior to implementation it is recommended that some general
baseline data be collected, recognizing that this will only likely be possible during the wet
(rainy) season. Three locations are identified - one in each.of the surface water courses about
one km north and south of the site (i.e. Creek I and Creek 2; refer to Figure 6.2), and the third to
the north of the northeast corner of the existing dump site when contaminated runoff occurs onto
the agricultural lands.

it is proposed that surfac e water should be monitored at the following locations to assess qualitv
of the stormwater runoff;
*  Out'et structure of the pond at the southeast corner, adjacent to the South Cell; and
*  Outlet structure of the pond at the northeast corner, adjacent to the North Cell.
It is proposed that surface water (i.e. effluent) should be monitored at the following locations to
monitor/assess the qualii ' of the influent leachate and the treated leachate effluent:
r                        .  Inlet structure of e first (anaerobic) leachate lagoon;

assessing treatrnent facility operation.
The proposed mornitoring locations are shown on Figure 9. 1.
Parameters: It is proposed that all the water samples described above should be monitored for
the following parameters, includes leachate indicator parameters as well as those regulated Iy
the DENR standards applicable here, i.e. Class SA and/or Class D (reer to Sections 6.6 and 7.7):

coliformn  It should be iAoted ;liat ihe Class D criteria (applicable to agricultural use) requires
monitoring for only BOD5, TSS, TDS and total coliform.
Frequency: The following frequency is proposed for the site development and operation periods:
*  Stormwater Pond Discharge: on a quarterly basis (once every three months, including at
least once during the wet season);
* Raw leachate influent on a monthly basis;
*  Treated Leachate Effluent: on a monthly basis; and

The monitoring parameters and frequency should be modified based on an assessment of the
results of the first year monitoring. If the water quality meets the applicable DENR criteria, then
the monitoring frequency should be reduced (e.g. from monthly to quarterly). Also, if the
leachate quality indicates that some of the parameters are not present in the leachate, then those
parameters could be dropped frpmithe monitoring program. For example, it is tiot expected that
the heavy metals listed above will be found in leachate.
Post-Closure Monitoring The above d'scribed monitoring parameters and frequency should be
modified for the post-closure period based on an assessment of the results of the monitoring
during operation.  it is anticipated that the post-closure monitoring requirements for the
L.                      stormwater pond discharge can be significantly reduced during this period because the entire
landfill would have been covered and landscaped and the.potential for leachate to impact storm
runoff during this period would be significantly less than that expected during the landfill
operation period. A detailed monitoring plan should be included in the landflll closure plan that
-*                      would be prepared towards the end of the landfill life.
rNoise
It is proposed that a program of regular monitoring and inspection be adopted to ensure that any j
potential negative impacts are minimized within practicable limits.
It is recommended that one of the key parameters to be monitored regularly is the level of noise,
at the periphery of the project site and the closest sensitive areas to the project.
An overview of the proposed monitoring program is presented below and the proposed locations
for monitoring are illustrated on Figure 9.1.

Air
It is proposed that a program of regular monitoring be adopted to ensure that any potential
negative impacts are minimised within practicable limits.
It isrecommended that two of the key parameters to be monitored regularly are Total Suspended
Particulate (TSP) and.methane concentrations, at ihe periphery of the project site and at the
closest sensitive areas to the project. Air quality monitoring for TSP is recommepded to be taken
at the 'same sampling stations used for noise level monitoring, and the methane concentrations in
the areas of waste filling and at the TSP monitoring locations.
An overview of the proposed monitoring program is presented below and the proposed locations
for monitoring illustrated on Figure 9.1.

The number and location of monitoring stations are shown on Figure 9.1 and have been selected
from a consideration of the following factors:
*  the location and proximity of sensitive receptors to the site boundary;
*  the nature of the site activities in the proximity of sensitive receptors;
.  the location of baseline measurements made for this report; and            E
the desire to establish baseline levels throughout the site in advance of commencing site
works in any part of the site.
l                   Although there are no basements in houses/settlements adjacent to the proposed landfil), it is
recommended that methane concentration should be monitored in the airspace of any enclosed
building/structures at and adjacent to the site and in the airspace of any nearby groundwater
extraction wells as part of the above proposed monitoring program.
It is recommended that the monitoring program be established around the existing dumpsite at
least one month prior to commencing any new works, on site in order to confirm baseline
conditions.
If the site operator receives specific complaints, additional monitoring should be carried out to  4
identify more accurately the scale of the impact at the particular location. Additional mitigation
measures should be corksidered for application on the basis of these measurements.
Traffic
Monitoring will be dode to determine air quality and noise levels due to vehicle movement. This
will initially be carried out at least, monthly, then adjusted based on findings after the first 3
months of full operation. The proposed monitoring point is at the entrance area to the landfill as
shown on Figure 9.1.

9.4.4  Estimated Cost of the Environmental Monitoring Program
:_                     It is assumed that the monitoring of the various environments will be carried out at the same time
as much as possible, Also, the results of the monitoring will be presented in a single annual
monitoring report. The site operations staff (e.g. site foreman) should assist in conducting the
monitoring after some training by appropriate specialists (e.g. staff from the DENR Regional
Offico, outside monitoring consultant) during the first round of monitoring. For example, the
site staffcan-carry c.i 'ia noise level monitoring with a noise level meter dedicated to the site.

Reporting
As noted above, the results of the monitoring will be presented in a factual report on an annual
basis. The estimated annual cost of the preparation of this report. is estimated to be
approximately P200,000, including staffing and materials (copying, printing, etc.).
Surnmar
Based on the above1 estimates, the. annual cost of environmental monitoring is anticipated to be
approximately P 1,000,000. It should be noted, based on the results of the first year monitoring,
it may be possible to reduce the extent of monitoring which in turn would reduce the annual
monitoring cost
9.5'   Contingency Plan
A detailed contingency plan would be prepared as part of the detailed design in order to address the
potential environmental impacts in the event of possible inadequate performance or failure of a
landfill component(s). The potential impacts that would be considered are as follows:
* Potential leachate impacts on downgradient groundwater: this may occur as a result of ,;
inadequate bottom containment (due to improper construction quality control, unanticipated
geological features, etc.);
* Potential impacts of air quality: this may occur as a result of inadequate gas venting practices
((due to improper construction quality control, disposal of unanticipated types of wastes in the
landfill, etc.); and
* Potential surface water impacts on downstream lands: this may occur,as a result of inadequate
surface water conveyance/retention (due to improper construction quality control, unanticipated
storm events, etc.) or inadequate treatment of the collected leachate (malfunction of the
lagoon).
The Contingency Plan would be reviewed on a regular basis during the implementation period and,
if necessary, modified to incorporate the results of new monitoring inforiiiation. Therefore, if
environmental. conditiong change (for example, the locations or water extraction rates of the
groundwater wells are altered) or if new infornation is available (for example, more representative

waste composition data, more accurate information on surface water drainage in the landfill area),
the Contingency Plan could be modified to provide an appropriate response to new information.
The Contingency Plan would specify trigger mechanisms to activate the appropriate components of
the contingency remedial measures.
9.5.1  Contingency Measures
Preliminary suggestions regarding contingency measures are presehted in this section. It is
suggested that the use of trigger mechanisms based on comprehensive assessment of monitoring
data would determine the "compliance" status. These assessments would be performed at regular
L                       intervals using the results of the Monitoring Programn. The assessment and reporting intervals
would be tied to site-specific conditions, and has teen specified in the Monitoring Program. This
suggested approach recognizes the lack of information regarding the hydrologic and hydrogeologic
regime in the site vicinity, allows for assessment of variability inherent in the chemical analytical
data obtained from the monitoring program, and also provides for "early warning!' of a potential
i                      "out-of-compliance" status. This approach is preferred over a less comprehensivo approach which
identifies compliance based solely on trigger (i.e. maximum allowable) concentrations of chemical
r                     . parameters at specific monitoring points. The less comprehensive approach generally fails to
Ls                      adequately account for the variability of laboratory chemical data obtained in similar environments,
and generally necessitates complex, time-consuming and inefficient reporting and re-
:  l                   sampling/analysis protocols in the event that a trigger concentration is detected during groundwater
monitoring.
.  C                   The existing situation regarding groundwater and surface water in the site vicinity is as follows:
1. Groundwater - A hydrogeologic assessment of available data indicates that groundwater in the
shallow aquifer at or beyond the boundary of the existing dump contains one or more landfill-
* ,                    related contaminants at eleyated concentrations.
2. Surace water - A hydrologic assessment of available data indicates that surface water in the
area is impacted by landfill-related contaminants during storm events.

SWEEP, San Fernando La Union Sanitary LandfdlEIA
A phased set of contingency remedial measures, tied to the above noted trigger mechanisms, is
proposed, based on the presently available information.
For groundwater, the proposed contingency measures are:
*  Expand the Assessment Area by the installation of a, ditionl groundwater monitors and
sanpling, including the provision for an alternate domestic water supply to the affected areas as
necessary;     !
*  If the leachate collection system is not effectively removing leachate, install wells with
submersible pumps through the waste to remove the leachate from the disposal areas; and/or
*  Institute a more stringent engineered control on the landfill (e.g. tighter cover, such as, a
geomembrane).
For surface water, the proposed contingency measures are:
*  Institute an engineered control Don the landfill (e.g. remediatelrectify areas of the source of
surface water impacts, provide more extensive surface water management structures, such as
additional/deeper ditches/ponds, etc.), then
*  Re-evaluate the pdtential for landfill-related impacts on the surface runoff to eventually impair
the receiving waters (e.g. Carlatan Lagoon).
It is proposed that the contingency implementation plan should comprise a phased approach, tied to
the trigger mechanism.
9.5.2 Trigger Mec4anism
The Tri ger Mechanism is based upon a three-tier process, with each tier establishing a trigger
for the initiation of further action. The Trigger Mechanism is based initially upon the results of
the groundwater quality monitoring program because of the significance of potential
groundwater impacts in the area over the potential impacts on other environments (e.g. surface
water, air).

parameters are observed through monitoring, they therefore provide the first indication that
landfill leachate is having an adverse effect on groundwater quality. By setting a Trigger
Concentration below the applicable criteria, in this case the Class AA criteria for groundwater,
J  '       monitoring will indicate that some action should be taken before the criteria is actually exceeded.
With reference to Figure 9.1, the primary Trigger Monitoring Locations are the perimeter
groundwater monitors 99-3, M-8, M-6 and M-7 and off-site water wells PW-5, GW-2 and
GW-3. These are located at downgradient positions near the landfill site boundary in terrns of
groundwater flow.
One of the problems rith using this approach for the North Cell is that the historic placement of
waste on the site has already degraded the water quality in excess of what would be a desirable
trigger concentration. For those trigger locations, i.e.,. 99-3 and GW-5, all that can be done is to
carry out the baseline monitoring to establish the concentrations of the parar,peters up until the
engineered landfill is implemented in the North Cell, and then observe their concentration
patterns over time as' operations continue. the main concem off-site to the north is therefore
interference due to leachate effects on water well use, therefore the continued monitoring of
wells GW-5 and GW-7 will be the deciding factors as to the need for contingency actions.

The whole project can be a showcase of environmental protection if proper measures to safeguard
the ecological condition of the area are given primary consideration. As sections become filled
over time, they should be covered with vegetation to prevent soil erosion and dust resuspension.

The "En Aironmental Management PlanI for the proposed San Fernando Landfill expansion should
consideer long range planning to mitigate both the short-term and long-termn impacts of the projecI
.   As the  ndfill site will not be suitable for residential/comrnercial use, it could be used for
passiv, ireawion or low intensity agriculture once it is capped. As such, carabao grass may be
the suiftable surface cover to prevent soil erosion and dust resuspension. In such a case, very
minima} use of fertilizers, pesticide and herbicides should be allowed for the maintenance of the

pestici.ies.
9.7 Proposal For an Environmental Guarantee Fund (EGF)
L ,                      The Enviromnental Guarantee Fund (EGF) is a fund that project proponents are expected to commit
to establish when an ECC is issued for projects or undertakings determined by DENR to pose
significant risk to answer for damage to life, health, property, and the environment caused by such
risk, or requiring rehabilitation or restoration measures. It shall also be used to implement damage
prevention measures, environmental education, scientific or research studies, IEC, and training
l,                      including social equity programs.- The DENR Procedural Manual (1998) outlines the protocol and
requiremenis for setting up an EGF.
The purpose of the establishment and use of the EGF is as follows:
*  the immediate rehabilitation of areas affected by damage to the environment and the resulting
deterioration of environmental quality as a direct consequence of project construction,
operation, and abandonment; :
*  the just compensation of parties and communities affected by the negative impacts of the
I  project;
*  the conduct of scientific or research studies that will aid in the prevention or rehabilitation of
-                           accidents and/or environmental damages; or
* for contingency clean-14p activities, environmental enhancement measures, damage prevention
r                           program and social equity measures (e.g. livelihood, social development programs) including
the necessary IEC and capability building activities.

The need and requirements of the EGF should be discussed between the City of San Fernando
and the DENR prior to the implementation of the proposed landfill project. As part of the
application fot- an ECC, the City should prepare a Draft Memorandum of Understanding (MOA)
on EGF in consultation with the DENR.
9.8   Summary
An Environmental Management Plan (UMP) was prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the DENR Procedural Manual for EIS. The EMP was based on the identified impacts and
mitigation/enhancement measures and addresses project impacts and corresponding mitigation
measures, cost estimates, the iristitutional mechanisms  for implementation and associated
agreenents/guarantees. The mitigation measures and the implementation plan were combined to
form an environmental management program, which included a Monitoring Plan. Due to the
*   environmental significance of landfill developments and the potential implications of failure to
properly implement any of the proposed mitigation measures and implementation plan
components as designed/planned, the EMP also included a Contingency Plan. This Plan sets out
a sequence of actions to be taken in the event that ongoing monitoring and observations indicate
that the site is not performning as designed or expected. Also, recommendations regarding the
establishment of an Environmental Monitoring and Guarantee Fund has been incorporated in the
EMP.
Social Development Prograrn
The EMP includes a Social Development Program (SDP), which discusses the programs or
components of the proposed project which are related to social development and addresses the
mitigation of potential negative impacts, especially those associated with resettlement,
relocation, income loss, etc. The SDP focuses on two main populations that are most directly
impacted by the project, the waste pickers and the landowners or tenants of the additional land
required for the expansion of the current site [i.e. the Project Affected People (PAPs)].
Extensive detail on the SDP (i.e. compensation measures) is provided in the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP). In summary, the RAP is designed to ensure that the popuiation directly affected by
the project are provided with the means, and the procedures, to ensure that their quality of life
after the project's implementation, is as good as or better than previously. The plan is to be-

implemented by the City, (the project proponent), and defines and describes the monitoring
progra,m to be followel, as well as grievance procedures for the affected parties should they wish
fl                     to contest the implementation.
Monitoring Requirements and Monitoring Plan
The basic principles to assist in the design of an environmental monitoring system are clear
objectives, appropriateness, institutional support, quality control, flexibility and sustainability. It
is anticipated that Iwo fundamental types of inspection and monitoring will be undertaken on-
site:.
*  Monitoring of compliance of site development to any specified conditions, including
adherence of site operations and management to the principles incorporated in project
design; an, i
* ,Environrtmntal monitoring to assess the impacts arising from on-going site development and
' F                        operation.
The site operations should comply, at all times, with relevant Nation'al and Local Regulations.
Environmental clearance will be required annually from the DENR for operating the facility.
Landfill construction and operations will be monitored by the DENR, independently of any
inspection and supervision of the service contract performed by the LGU, in order to ensure
r                      compliance with prevailing environmental legislation. The implementation of the mitigation and
monitoring plan will be the responsibility of both the LGU and the DENR.
A Multi-Partite Monitoring Team (MMT) will oversee the monitoring of the project, including
RAP, and will be composed of representatives from the project proponent (LGU), affected
C                      communities and women, relevant local government units (barangay), and PENRO and/or
CENRO in the project area. The functions of the MMT will include: monitoring the project for
compliance, gathering information if dainage occurs or public complaints are raised, preparing
and disseminating mopitoring reports and submitting recommendations to the DENR, and
conducting relevant community information and education campaigns. The DENR Regional

office and the EMB will provide support to the MMT in technical aspects or evaluation and
policy monitoring.
Environmental Monitoring
The environmental monitoring provides the mechanism to assess th'e overall environmental
impacts, identify any environmentat pollution due -to site operation, identify any deviations from
acceptable standards of site operation, and formulate proposals for site remediation or
contingency measures, as necessary. The Site Operator will be responsible for carrying out the
Lk.                         routine monitoring program, with the documented results forwarded to the LGU and the MMT
on a monthly basis'for inspection and review.
The appropriate Philippines (DENR) environmental standards which are currently prescribed
with respect to surface water quality, groundwater levels and quality, air quality and noise levels
will be used to assess the monitoring results. It is also suggested that, where applicable,
available World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO) standards should be used, for
purposes of comparison.
The proposed monitoring program includes monitoring locations, frequency and paramete,rs at'd
would require that the monitoring resiults are presented in an annual report. The monitoring
program will have to be continued into the post-closure period, with appropriate modifications
based on the res'ults of the 1xonitoring during the operational period. The duration of the post-
closure period monitoring should be determined based on these results and through discussions
L                             among the stakeholders.
The annual cost of the implementation of the proposed environmental monitoring program is
anticipated to be approximately P 1,000,000, excluding the cost of RAP related monitoring
which is included in the cost of RAP implementation. It should be noted, based on the results of
the first year monitoring, it may be possible to reduce the extent of monitoring which in turn
would reduce the annual monitoring cost.

* i                       ContiL I.ency Plan 
A detr I d contingency plan would be prepared as part of the detailed design in order to address the
potent; i environmental impacts in the event of possible inadequate performance or failure of a
landfi`  omponent(s). The potential impacts that would be considered ares leachate impacts on
downL.s i ent groundwater, impacts on air quality, and surface water impacts on. downstream lands.
The Co.    .ncy Plan would specify trigger mechanisms to activate the appropriate components of
a contin -ncy remedial measure(s). In order to address the uncertainties associated with the
exist'   environmental conditions and the project proposals, it is proposed that the contingency
implei M atation plan should comprise a phased approach, tied to the trigger mechanism.
The nri ger Mechanism is based upon a three-tier process, with each tier establishing a trigger
for tlhe initiation of further action. The Trigger Mechanism is based initially upon the results of
the I ,ount er quality monitoring program   because of the significance of potential
L                          groun.dwater impacts in the area over the potential impacts on other environments (e.g. surface
water, air). The Mechanism would include a number of trigger parameters, typically indicative
of leachate impact on groundwater, and trigger concentrations.
Site Closurti and Restoration
The proposed Environmental Management Plan' should consider long range planning to mitigate
both the short-term and long-term impacts of the project. As the landfill site will not be suitable
for residential/comntercial use, it could be used for passive recreation or low intensity agriculture
once it is capped. As such, carabao grass may be the suitable surfice cover to prevent soil
erosion and dust resuspension.

Q10.0                         INSTlTUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
10.1   Current Institutional Arrangements                                            -
10.1.1 National
Under Component I of SWEEP, the Consultants have suggested that a Waste Management
Authority (V/MA) be set up within an appropriate agency with the task of assisting all local
authorities in carrying out cost effective and efficient waste collection, trinsfer and disposal,
while giving full consideration to alternative waste management technologies, including waste
reduction, re-use/recycling and composting.  While the review  of the IConsultant's -
recommendations is on-going, the proposed role and functions of the V/MA resides with the
Project Management Office of the Presidential Task Force on Waste Management (PMO-
PTFWM), a unit attached to the Environmental Management Bureau of the DENR. It acts as the
central controlling unit for SWM-related activities of the LGUs. It is also in charge of
promoting and co-ordinating SWEEP and other related activities.
10.1.2 Local
Under the current set up in the City of San Fernando, SWM is the responsibility of the City
Engineer's office. The City Planning and Development Office provides assistance on an as
required basis.
r
A SMTECP-PMO was formed in San Fernando to assist the City in the implementation of the
SWEEP activities, including the EIA/FS. This SWEEP-PMO is comprised of the representatives
of the City (Mayor's office, Planning Officer and City Engineer), DENR (Regional Director,
CENRO, PENiO) and a number of other stakeholders.
'  10.2  Contractual Arrangements
10.2.1 Alternative Arrangements
The nature of the relationship between the regulatory authority and the project developer is
influenced by the contractual arrangements under which the project is implemented. In this
regard, although a large number of possibilities exist, three scenarios are considered to be most
suitable:

* the LGU would act both as Project Proponent and as the Project Developer. The LGU would
design and construct the site and would underiake site operations;
*  the LGU would be the Project Proponent but the design, construction, operations
maintenance, rest6oration and after-care, would be let out under contract to one or more
Private Sector Contractors (PSC), under one or a series of individual contracts; or
'an appropriate combination of the above two (e.g. design and construction and operation for
a number of years by a PSC and subsequent operation and aftercare by the LGU). It is
anticipated that the LGU personnel would receive training and hands-on experience in the
operation and maintenance of the engineered landfill during the design, construction and
operation period under the PSC.
The key design and operational aspects of the project proposals are discussed in Section 5. The
level of site engineering and site operations proposed -for the site has been fonnulated on the
basis of site specific considerations. In attempting to establish the appropriate level of
engineering and site operations, it was noted that the technical capacity required for site
construction and operation was not available within the LGU and, accordingly, there is a
requirement for access to specialist engineering works and skills at least during the construction
and operating lifetime of the site.
r m                   On the basis of this analysis, the third scenario is considered the most realistic solution if the
project is to be implemented successfully given the present level of experience and expertise
within. the LGU with respect to the design, construction and operation of engineered sanitary
landfills and the long-term cost implication of the involvement of a PSC. It is recommended,
therefore, that the private sector should be contracted to design, construct and operate for a pre-
determnined number of years the proposed engineered landfill facility. It should be recognized
that the conceptual design proposes the site development in three phases.. There is therefore the
potential to develop a contract for the entire project over an extended period of time, or
alternatively to divide the project into a series of two or more contracts. In view of an
anticipated site life of 10 or more years, the latter approach is considered to be the more
C                     appropriate in this situation.

SWEEP, San Fernando La Union Sanitary Lan dfll EM
The 'PSC would be 'selected by the LGU on the basis of a competitive tender to provide the
requisite services to execute the project proposals. Having selected the preferred PSC, the
wLGU's role and responsibilities would center on supervising the contract and ensuring that the
J                         contractor conforms to the performance standards, requirements and warranties stipulated in the
Conditions of Contract. In addition, the City should ensure that the City's SWM personnel
involved get adequate hands-on training during the period of the PSC's involvement.
102.2 Regulation of the Contracting Parties
)I the basis of a service contract as outlined above, the LGU would be the owner of the landfill
facility, while the PSC would be the occupier of the site. In this situation there are two
poss:ibilities for regulation of the contracting parties:
e .                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I                         V
--   e    dr- regulatory authority licenses the Site Occupier to undertake specified works and
'operations at the site according to any conditions attached to the license. Thie Site Owner is,
l*~~ '~       '      therefore, effectively excluded from any regulation of the environmental performance of the
-       *-facility operated on his behalf, other than under the Conditionsof Contract under which the
service contract is executed; or
*   the regulatory atthority licenses or permits the Site Owner to undertake specified works and ,
op.lru3ionis at the site according to any conditions attached to the pertnit or license. Since the
Site Owner and Site Occupier are not the same party, the Site Owner is obliged to ensure that
the Site Occupier complies with the conditions of the permit or license granted to the Site
'Owner. This is best achieved by incorporating the permits/license conditions into the
Conditions 6f Contract.
L                         The latter option is seen to be a more effective solutioni since it places greater responsibility on
the Site Owner to ensure the site is constructed, operated and managed to appropriate standards
and, in particular, the standards to which the site has been designebd. This will more directly
involve the LGU in the day-to-day operations at the site, which is key to ensuring that the site is
-' Mperforming as intended and responding in a timely fashion to any situation that may arise. Thus,
E_                       the onus would be on the LGU, as the Site Owner and Client, to take appropriate action if the
PSC is not able to satisfy the prescribed/stipulated requirements set out in the Contract. It must

10.3   Proposed Organizational Structure
l, '                    103,1, Proposed LGU Set-Up
As Project Proponent, it is proposed that the c6uffent organizational set-up be expanded to
accommodate the various activities, related to the Implementation of the engineered landfill
development. These activities are divided into two components, namely:
*  Resettlement Action Plan, as required by the World Bank, before,the construction and
development activities commence (,r.r :l1iX M); and
r                      n   Coastrucli.n and Project Management during the project preparation, project development,
project operation and project closure/post-closure stages.
The proposed-organizational set-up in the engineered landfill development is presented in
Figure 10.1. It is anticipated that a Solid Waste Management Office, either as a separate
!  t                   departnent or under the City's Engineering or Plaining Departments, -would be established and
be responsible for all activities (collection, diversion, disposal) associated with solid waste
management.
The'activities envisaged in respect ofthe RAP are as follows:
*  assessment and payment of compensation;
*  rehabilitation of PAPs/PAFs; and
* public participation and consultation.
The activities envisaged under design, construction and project management are as follows:
r  technical review of detailed engineeting designs;
*  supervision and commissioning;
*  contract management;
*  construction quality assurance and quality control (QAIQC);

* supervision of operation and maintenance;
* record keeping;
*  restoration and closure; and
* aftercare.
10.3.2 Public Liaison and Monitoring
The ¶Consultants are presently under contract to provide technical assistance to the Project
Proponent during the preparation of FS and ETA studies for the proposed' landfill facility in San
Fernando to ensure that the facility is developed in full accordance with the requirements of the
DENR and other concerned agencies, including the World Bank. In this regard, the EMP and
associated Monitoring Plan establishes the framework for project implementation.
As noted in Section 9.3.3 and Figure 10.1, it is proposed that a Multipartite Monitoring Teamn
(MMT).be created. I~he intentions of setting up such a loeal monitoring committee is to ensure
that.the operator of the landfill, whether a private or public entity:
* at a minimum, fulfills their contractual obligations for environmental protection throughout
the lifetime of the,site; and
*  takes all reasonable measures to protect the quality of the local environrhent throughout the
lifetime of the site.
It is recommended that the MMtT, in fulfilling its overseeing role, also has the authority to
identify and recommend further measures to the Project Proponent that they feel are required to
protect the quality of their local environment The Project Proponent can then balance these
concerns with other faictors (specifically the likely operational and cost implications) and decide
whether it is necessary to enter irito contractual discussions with the site operator on these
matters.
The full and satisfactoty development of the proposed landfill facility will represent a significant
step towards improving the environment and protecting public health in San Fernando, and
fulfills one of the goals of SWEEP by providing a successful demonstration project to the
country as a whole.

While there is growing awareness in San Fernando of the pressing problems of waste collection
and waste disposal, there is, as of yet, limited comprehension amongst the various officials,
agencies and citizens of the immediate need to resolve the problem or of the most appropriate
solution. With respect to disposal of waste, there is limited knowledge and no experience of the
concept of engineered landfills. This holds true both for the Project Proponent (the LGU) and
the regulatory authority (the DENR), both of whom have very limited expertise and experience
with respect to the design an operation of engineered sanitary landfills.
As a minimum, it is necessary to have experienced and qualified personnel in key positions both
within the LGU and in the responsible section of the DENR. It is recommended that, with
respect to the LGU, the engineer(s) responsible for the engineered landfill (such as the person at
the head of the SWM1Office) should preferably be civil engineers with experience in the design,
construction and contract supervision of large engineering projects, preferably irrigation or civil
(earthworks and waterlwastewater treatment) projIects.
The absence of experience in engineered landfills in San Fernando or elsewhere in Philippines
places considerable emphasis upon the need to train all concerned parties on all aspects of the  '
construction and operation of an engineered sanitary landfill. In this regard and in response to
the requirements of CIDA INC, a Training and Human Resources Development Programl has
been prepared (refer to Appendix P). Therefore, some forn of technical assistance is a pre-
requisite for successful implementation of the project.
i r                      Technical Assistance nteeds fall into two categories:
*  the requirement to impact knowledge and expertise to key personnel (both supervisory and
regulatory) through training and the transfer of technology; and
*  in, the short-term,,management and technical assistance during the initial stages of project
implementation.

It is recommended that relevant LOU and DENR personnel be trained in landfill construction
techniques and in sanitary landfill operational practices through a mixture of seminars,
workshops and site visits, allied with frequent 'hands-on' experience and training during the
various phases of the engineered landfill development.
The unit appointed by the LGU to undertake 'project and construction management should
encompass appropriate technical expertise in modem landfill design, construction supervision,
construction management, lining system installatiQn, drainage works, landfill operations, landfill
gas management, site remediation and contract managemeiit. This expertise, where it relates
specifically to landfill engineering, is available currentli, q6ly from intemational sources, from
either individual consultants or consulting engineers exr, renerf n' the design, construction and
operation of modem engineered landfills; On Figure 10. 1, this is indiketed by the inclusion of an
Independent Third Party Consultant in the proposed organizational structure, who could assist
and provide guidance to the LGU and interface on behalf of the LGU with the PSC and the
MMT.
10.5   Summary
ZCurrep$t Istitiitirmal ATanopm rafe : 
National: Under SWEEP, it has been recommended that a Waste Management Authority (WMA)
be set up within an appropriate agency with the task of asisti'ng all local authorities in carrying
out cost effective and efficient waste management.- Thep`posed role and'functions of the
WMA reside with the Project Management Office of th,C PMTW'NM. It acts as the central
controlling unit for SWM-related activities of the LCUs.
Local: Under the current set up in the City of San ' ln'nd, SWM is the responsibility of the
City Engineer's office. A SWEEP-PMO was Frnrri in'San Fernando to assist the City in the
implementation of the SWEEP activities. This SV&EEP-PMO is comprised of the representatives
of the City, DENR and a number of other stakeholders.

Technlical Assistance'
There is growing awareness in the  A t- , in-It 1i.-ig the City of San Fernando, of the
pressing problems of solid waste management. However, the Project Proponent (the LGU) arld
the regulatory authority (the DENR) have very limited expertise and,experience with respect to
the design an operation of engineered sanitary landfills. It would be important to have
experienced and qualified personnel in key positions both within the LGU and in the responsible
section of the DENR in order for the proposed project to succeed. In view of this, it is
recommended that appropriate technical assistance be sought, at least during the initial stages of
the project implementation.
_  --       The absence of experience in engineered landfills in the Philippines places considerable
ernphasis upon the need to train all concerned parties on all aspects of the construction and
operation of an engineered sanitary landfill. In this regard and in response to the requirements of
CIDA INC, a Training and Human Resources Development Program has been prepared.
Therefore, sorne form of technical assistance is a pre-requisite for successful implementation of
the project.
f~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The unit appointed by the LGU to undertake project and construction management should  '
encompass appropriate technical expertise in the design and operation of modern landfills. This
expertise is presently available only from international sources, from either individual
consultants or consulting engineers. This is indicated by the inclusion of an Independent Third
L~~~~~~~~~
Party Consultant in the proposed o;ganizational structure.

Contractual Arrangements
Alternative Arrangements: Three possible scenarios are considered to be most suitable for the
proposed contractual arrangement i) the LGU would act as both Project Proponent and Project
Developer; ii) the LGU would be the Project Proponent but the design, construction, operations,
maintenance, restoration and after-care, would be let out under contract to one or- more Private
Sector Contractors (PSC); or iii) an appropriate combipation of the above. On the basis of the
proposed project details, the third scenario is considered thd snost realistic solution if the project
is to be implemented successfully given the present level of experi¶,ce and expertise within the
LGU with respect to the design, construction and operation of engineered sanitary landfills and
the long-term cost inmiplication of the involvement of a DSC, \'Aio would be selected by the LGU.
Regulation of the Contracting Parties: On the basis of a service contract as suggested above, the
LGU would be the owner of the landfill facility, while the PSC would be the occupier of the site.
In t14is situation there are two possibilities for regulation of the contracting parties: the
regulatory authority licenses the Site Occupier to undertake specified wotks and operations at the
site according LU any conditio-rs attached to the license; or the regilatory umillorit- licenses or
permits the Site Owner to undertake specified works anl'oratlionRt the site - the Site Owner is
_                         obliged to ensure that the Site Uccupier complies with thel6onditions of the permit or license
granted to the Site Owner. The latter option is seen to be a more effective solution as it places
greaterresponsibility on the Site Owner.
Proposed Organizational Structure
As Project Proponent, it is proposed that the current organizational set-up in the City be
expanded to accommodate the various activities related to the implementation of the engineered
landfill development. It is anticipated that a Solid Waste Managemient Office would be
established and be responsible for all activities associated with solid waste management.
As noted in Section 9, a Multipartite Monitoring Team (MMIT) will be created to oversee the
public liaison and monitoring activities.
