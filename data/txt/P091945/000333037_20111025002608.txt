                                       Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT, Loan Number 7359-EGT P091945 will
   be extended from October 30, 2011 until April 30, 2012.

2. This new six month extension will bring the cumulative closing date extension to 1 year as
   the first six month extension from April 30, 2011 to October 30, 2011 was approved on April
   20, 2011.

3. In making this request we confirm that: (i) the objectives of the Project have been completely
   achieved and (ii) the Project continues to be implemented satisfactorily. We can also confirm
   that (i) this Credit is not subject to an ongoing suspension of disbursements, and (ii) no audit
   reports are outstanding

4. Construction and commission of El-Tebbin power plant has been completed. The plant
   consists of two identical units of 350 MW and these two units have passed the reliability and
   performance tests. Performance tests were successfully concluded in December 2010. The
   average daily energy production from the two units is 13,516 MWH, resulting in an average
   output of 281 MW per unit to date. Unit #1 was commissioned on August 28, 2010 and unit
   #2 on September 17, 2010. Of the total US$259.60 million amount of the Loan, US$246 has
   been disbursed to date.

5. Procurement under the project has been completed. The project continues to maintain sound
   financial management arrangements, including stability of staff, consistent application of
   internal controls and smooth process of flow of funds. All previous FMRs and audit reports
   were timely received, reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank. Therefore, the project
   FM arrangements are “Satisfactory?.

6. Justification for the extension; The proposed extension is necessary to acquire spare parts
   and to complete project activities under contracts for supply and installation of switchyard
   (CP104), steam generator and auxiliaries (CP105), steam turbine generator (CP106), and

                                                1
contract for circulating water pump (CP109A) financed by the World Bank loan. The
preparation and agreement of spare parts took some extra time during the operation phase to
confirm between contractor and employer the most optimum list. Several packages of the
spare parts already are on site and the extension request is to complete the list and give
adequate time for shipping. The main reasons for need for extension are:

   a. During the political crisis all experts left Tebbin site for at least two months and when
      they came back the working hours were too short due to the safety. It was difficult to
      arrange with the contractors to prepare the final spare parts lists so the schedule of
      delivery of spare parts was delayed.
   b. Many spare parts were delivered but not paid for because it is still under inspection.
   c. Due to closing of the contracts the last amendment normally takes more time to settle
      pending items.
