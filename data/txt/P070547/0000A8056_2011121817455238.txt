                         examples tested during implementation to assist in the development of policy measures and local actions. They build on specific assignments that have: I) developed and tested
                         methodologies for the valuation of groundwater; II) developed a regional vulnerability map and interactive platform; III) made recommendations for design of an integrated
                         groundwater monitoring network; and, IV) integrated these elements in a series of support guidelines to assist policy makers and communities in strengthening resilience to

                         Pilot interventions to increase the resilience of local communities to drought in the Limpopo River basin have been substantially completed. These interventions within seven pilot
                         communities test the application and replicability of methods for decreasing the vulnerability of local communities and groundwater dependent ecosystems to the effects of
                         groundwater droughts. These interventions benefit more than 100,000 families in the Limpopo River basin. The lessons learnt from the pilot interventions are now well documented

                         The Groundwater Management Institute has been formally established. The GMI is considered central to long-term applied research, information and knowledge management,
                         coordination, awareness and capacity building in the SADC region. The process of reaching consensus among the SADC Member States in selecting a relevant institution and
                         defining the legal modality of such entity was a long one. The final selection was endorsed by the head of states of the SADC Member States and going forward, the GMI will require
                         continued support to ensure it fulfills its mandate as a ➢? center of excellence➢? in groundwater management in the southern Africa region.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Sustainability of pilot interventions and the SADC Groundwater Management Institute remain critical items that will require commitment from communities, national agencies and the
                         SADC Water Division to ensure long-term success.

                         The lessons learnt from the pilot interventions are now well documented for the SADC Member States to apply in similar circumstances to increase the resilience of local communities
                         to climate variability.

                         Given the focus of the interventions was on increasing resilience to climatic variability, the measure of success can only be fully assessed when the areas and communities face a
                         drought period. This will require concerted effort by the relevant stakeholder to ensure that the system established to monitor interventions are maintained and respond to changing
                         circumstances.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
