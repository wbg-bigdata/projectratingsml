POLYTECHNIC PROJECT
1. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND M4ANPOWER IMPLICATIONS
Development Pattern and Strategy
1.01    Under Indonesia's First Development Plan (Repelita I, 1969/70-1973/74)
substantial rehabilitation of infrastructure was achieved and economic
growth averaged 7.5% per annum. Development objectives for the Repelita II
period (1974/75-1978/79) focused on a continuing high rate of economic
growth and a more equitable distribution of services and incomes. Progress
towards these objectives has been mixed. While further improvements have
been made in the country's physical. and social infrastructure (transportation,
communication, power, education, and family planning), the economic growth
rate has slackened. It appears that the Repelita II target for GNP growth of
7.5% a year will not be reached and employment generation - a key strategy
for improving general welfare - is likely to have been less than anticipated.
Unemployment/underemployment of unskilled workers has continued to be a
problem: real wages for unskilled labor have not increased appreciably and
recent estimates suggest that about 40% of the population survives on consumption
expenditures of only US$0.25 (in 1976 prices) per day per capita. Investment
during the period, largely concentrated in modern sector activities (natural
resource exploitation, infrastructure, industry), has, however, created
increased requirements for skilled manpower.
1.02    Efforts are now underway to complete the preparation of Repelita III
(1979/80-1983/84) and broad development objectives for growth and equity are
not expected to be substantially altered. Continued emphasis will be placed
on the need to create new employment opportunities; and renewed emphasis will
be attached to increasing food production to meet domestic demand. Progress
towards increased food production and employment will require expansion and
strengthening of agricultural support services and expansion of labor inten-
sive industries. A general strengthening of Government institutions and
management, major efforts towards public sector resource mobilization and
restraint on new capital intensive investments would be necessary.
1.03    An economic growth rate of about 6.5% has been set as a target for
the Repelita III period. The agricultural sector is expected to grow at an
average rate of 3.5% per annum; mining at 4.0%; manufacturing at 11%; and
other non-agricultural sectors at 8% to 10%. An increased input of skilled
manpower would be required to achieve these growth targets - in particular
to develop the country's agricultural infrastructure, to expand the traditional
manufacturing industries (foods, tobacco, textiles, wood and wood products)
and to obtain greater efficiency in the newer, heavier industries (chemicals
including oil derivatives, basic metals, non-metallic minerals). Since the
manufacturing sector employs the largest proportion of skilled manpower,
most of this demand in the near future would be concentrated in six of
Indonesia's provinces that currently account for about 90% of all large- and
medium-scale industry, as shown in Table 1.1 below:

Demand for Higher Level Technical Manpower
1.04      Manpower requirements are difficult to project in any country, but
in Indonesia, the process is further complicated by data lacunae: employment
statistics are incomplete, sectoral growth rates are imprecise, aid comprehen-
sive education/occupation profiles are lacking. Moreover, effective demand
for manpower can be expected to differ from economic requirements due, for
example, to gcvernment budget constraints. With these reservations in mind,
the manpower forecasts presented below should be viewed as indicators of broad
priorities and magnitudes rather than precise projections.
1.05      For macro planning purposes, four broad types and levels of skills
are distinguished, namely (a) professionals, (b) technicians, (c) skilled
workers, and (d) semiskilled and unskilled workers. The education profile for
each of these groups has been mixed in the past, but increasingly professionals
are expected to hold university degrees, technicians to have received some
postsecondary training, skilled workers to have completed 9-12 years of
schooling, and semiskilled and unskilled workers to have received a basic
education. Nonagricultural employment is disaggregated by these broad levels
as follows:

Technician                             540        700      1,330          4.4
Skilled worker                       1,450      2,050     4,960          6.1

Note: Figures do not add to totals due to rounding.
/a Data for 1971 were estimated from census tabulations of the occupational
and educational structure of the labor force and additional information
provided by a previous Bank education sector survey mission (World Bank,
Indonesia Education Sector Survey Report, Report No. 443a-IND, 1975,
Appendix B, p. 26). The estimate for 1975 and the projections for 1990
are based on the assumption that the proportion of total nonagricultural
employment represented by the professional and technician skill categories
would remain constant, and that the skilled workers as a proportion of
total nonagricultural employment would rise from the 10% observed in 1971
to 11% in 1975 and 14% in 1990.



- 4 -
These aggregate estimates suggest that demand for higher level manpower
(professionals and technicians) would increase at approximately 4% p.a.
through 1990. New nonagricultural employees required to replace retirees
and expand the stock of workers would reach 2.5 million per year by 1990, as
follows:

1.06      Over the past decade, the Government has supported expansion and
improved quality of technical training, mainly at the skilled worker level,
in an attempt to meet the growing demand for trained technical manpower./l
More recently, it has begun to focus attention on meeting increased demands
on, and requirements for, tertiary level manpower in technical and managerial
fields, in particular in engineering and accountancy.
1.07      Disaggregated demand for manpower in the fields of engineering

1990 are shown in Table 1.4.  Cross-sectionally derived estimates suggest
that medium-term demand for engineering graduates, both degree and technician
level (or equivalents), would approximate 7% annual growth through 1990. The
demand for degree level (or equivalent) accountants is more difficult to
estimate. Comparative data from other countries show considerable variation,
and Indonesia has in any case been making use of extremely small numbers of
accountants - fewer than 5,000 at present (of which about 1,300 are "regis-
tered") with annual increments of approximately 8% of stock. Of new accoun-
tants entering the labor force, the largest share (about 70 per year) is
absorbed by the Ministry of Finance.  The estimated growth of demand for
degree level accountants - about 9% annually - is based on observations that
recent entrants have not satisfied economic requirements. Better estimates
of demand can only be made on the basis of an improved manpower data base.
(Determining demand for subprofessional accountancy staff, not estimated
here, would be more problematic still due to the absence of a classification
system for the numerous subprofessional accountancy occupations and the lack
of related information on present stocks.)

1.08      It is estimated that by 1990 all engineers and accountants entering
into employment would be degree holders and that some 75% of newly recruited
engineering technicians would have completed diploma level programs. In 1975,
output from the formal education sector accounted for the following approximate
proportions of new stock: engineers, 75%; accountants, 90%; engineering
technicians, 55%. On this basis, output from the formal education system
would need to expand as follows:

2. HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION
Overview
2.01      Higher technical education suffers from problems common to tertiary
education in Indonesia. Most important among these are:
(a) low efficiency manifested in high repeater and wastage rates, and
small, uneconomical institutions;
(b) inadequate expenditure evidenced by the poor average quality of
training, low formal qualifications of staff, and insufficient
provision of equipment and teaching materials;
(c) inequitable distribution of institutions, and access to, higher
education evident in the concentration of training opportunities in
Java and the disproportionate representation of middle class students;
and



- 7 -
(d) excessive reliance on degree level training with inadequate importance
attached to other types of postsecondary training.
2.02      The key elements of a development strategy for higher education
generally, and technical training specifically, should address these problems
and aim to:
(a) increase internal efficiency by introducing more discriminating
admission and more appropriate graduation requirements, providing
student loans/scholarships and consolidating small, uneconomical
institutions;
(b) improve the quality of instruction through staff upgrading and
provision of adequate learning materials, equipment and facilities
and
(c) rationalize the structure and distribution of higher education by
directing future efforts to meet national and regional development
needs and by diversifying the types and duration of postsecondary
training programs.
Such a strategy would attach overall priority to improving and redesigning
the training provided by existing institutions and would require increased
expenditure on higher education. However, investment should also be directed
towards expansion of capacity in technical fields to meet identified economic
needs. Forecasted requirements indicate a need for expanding enrollments and
outputs in technician level engineering in the immediate future (para. 1.08)
and in degree level engineering and accountancy towards the mid-1980s.
Dimensions and Prospects of Higher Education
2.03      Structure.  Tertiary schooling is diverse and in a state of transi-
tion.  The principal degree course (sarlana) is planned as a five-year program.
An intermediate degree (sarjana muda) is awarded upon completion of a three-
year program. In addition a four-year baccalaureate has recently been intro-
duced. Two to three year diploma level courses are also given. In practice
the number of calendar years specified for a degree or diploma program is
generally exceeded due both to repetition and part-time study.
2.04      There are five main types of tertiary level institutions at
present:
(a) universities, which have a number of semi-autonomous faculties
offering the _arjana, sarjana muda and a limited number of diploma
programs;
(b) institutes, which comprise a number of faculties in a single
professional field and offer the _ariana and sariana muda degrees;
(c)  teacher training colleges, which also offer the sarana and sarjana
muda degrees;



(d) academies, which consist of a single faculty and grant a diploma/
certificate for technician level courses; and
(e)  other postsecondary schools, which also provide diploma level
courses.
Technical training is provided in each type of school.
2.05      Administration and Organization.  Higher education and training are
provided by virtually all government agencies, but eight are predominant: the
Departments of Education, Religious Affairs, Health, Home Affairs, Industry,
Manpower, Agriculture and the National Institute of Administration (LAN).
Presidential Decree No. 34 of 1972 assigns overall authority for education
and training, including higher education, to the DEC but divides operational
responsibility among the DEC (general and vocational education), the Department
of Manpower (specialized and technical training) and LAN (civil service
training). The decree authorizes the DEC to define the functional working
relationships of the three agencies and to regulate education and training
programs of all other government and nongovernment institutions.
2.06      The DEC directly controls 40 universities, institutes and teacher
training colleges but has no direct authority over 80 public academies and
other postsecondary institutions operated by other departments to provide
in-service training not available elsewhere. (The implementation of Decree
No. 34 is incomplete and the future management of these institutions has not
yet been determined). Roughly 340 private institutions are loosely administered
by the DEC's Coordinator for Private Higher Education and an unknown number of
unregistered private institutions operate without government supervision. Thus
administrative effectiveness of the DEC (based in Jakarta) is reduced by wide
geographic dispersion and autonomy of institutions.
2.07      Administrative inefficiency is further experienced at individual
institutions. At public universities, individual faculties enjoy substantial
autonomy and the institutions have considerable independence from the DEC.
As a result, there is duplication of administrative services, courses, facili-
ties and research among and within institutions. Personnel policies are also
inefficient. Chief administrators of universities (viz., rectors and deans)
are rotated on a regular basis, thus allowing for little consistency in insti-
tutional operation or policy and preventing long-range institutional planning.
Less frequent rotation of administrative staff and introduction of training
programs in educational administration could improve this situation.
2.08      As an initial step towards strengthening administration, the Govern-
ment has begun a series of reforms to promote greater comparability among
university courses. The basic rationalizing element would be a system of
semester credits (e.g., the sarIana degree would require 140-160 credits),
backed by a more rigorous system of institutional classification/accreditation
and a system of nationwide examinations to "certify" semester credit achieve-
ments. (The latter, still at a planning stage, is to be assisted by Unesco.)
In addition, the DEC supports information exchanges, particularly on curricular
matters, through subject-oriented consortia which meet regularly throughout



- 9 -
the year./I The groups are composed of representatives from both public and
private institutions of higher education, and they also serve as advisors to
the DEC. In view of the need to rationalize the organization and improve the
overall management of higher education, however, a more comprehensive approach
to long-term development of the subsector should be adopted.
2.09      Planning.  In general, planning, evaluation and related research for
the higher education subsector have been limited. Since 1967, central educa-
tional planning has been the responsibility of the DEC's Office of Educational
and Cultural Research and Development (BP3K) and the National Planning Agency
(Bappenas). However, other responsibilities have left their personnel with
insufficient time for long-term planning. Although efforts were initiated in
1975 to systematize collection of university statistics, no such effort has
been made for other postsecondary training institutions, and manpower data for
educational planning are lacking (paras. 1.04 and 1.08). The Government has
attached increasing emphasis to the need to strengthen the data base for
further planning in the higher education subsector. Since development of
higher education is to be carried out on a regional basis, future data collec-
tion efforts need to be region specific in order to determine requirements
(and thereby types and levels of supplier institutions) in accordance with
local development priorities.
2.10      Improved planning and management should also focus on systematic
evaluation and monitoring of ongoing programs and projects; analysis of the
extent and causes of internal inefficiencies; improved definition of responsi-
bilities among agencies involved in higher education; and better coordination
among formal training programs and between formal and nonformal training
programs. A recent government decision to expand public technician training
has increased the need for improved coordination at this level.
2.11      Enrollment Trends.  In 1976 some 285,000 students, 2% of the
relevant age cohort, were enrolled in about 460 postsecondary institutions as
shown in Table 2.1. Two-thirds of these students attended public institutions,
one-third private schools. Roughly 55% of students were enrolled in degree
granting institutions and 45% in diploma granting institutions.
2.12      Enrollments at the tertiary level are concentrated in the social
sciences and humanities and reflect limited emphasis on the sciences, in
particular the basic sciences (including mathematics) as shown in Table 2.2.
/1 Among these are consortia for technology, science, economics, agriculture
and education.

2.13      The training of engineers (nonagricultural) is carried out mainly
in faculties of technology (engineering) and mining, and in specialized
academies at the diploma level. Accountants are trained mainly in faculties
of economics, the Ministry of Finance's State School for Government Accountants
and in academi3s. In 1976, the nearly 87,000 students enrolled in these two
fields (degree and diploma programs) accounted for 30% of total tertiary
enrollments and were distributed as follows:

These figures reveal a strikingly low level of development of training programs
for technician level engineers by comparison with those for degree level
engineers and in view of projected demand (para. 1.08).
2.14      Though recent expansion of tertiary enrollments (estimated at about
4% p.a. since 1970) has contributed to both efficiency and quality problems,
it has not yet solved problems of equity - either spatial or socioeconomic.
The five largest universities in Indonesia are located in Java and together
account for about half of all enrollments. While most provinces now have a
public university, technical faculties are more common in the older institu-
tions. Thus access to science and technology faculties remains limited for



- 12 -
secondary school graduates outside Java. In addition to these inequalities,
enrollments reflect the usual disparities in sex, socioeconomic background and
location: 71% of tertiary level students are male; children of white-collar
parents are ten times more heavily represented in the student body than are
their parents in the work force; and even in Java some provinces have a
proportion of the age cohort enrolled which is four times greater than that of
other provinces. (Since fees are charged, even at public institutions, these
outcomes are not surprising: there are few public scholarships.)
2.15      By the late 1980s and early 1990s, severe pressure will be felt by
the Government to provide additional student places in universities as a result
of the ongoing INPRES primary school building program; this was --roduced in
1973/74 and had added 2.6 million places by 1975/76. Recent growth trends in
upper secondary school enrollments (estimated at 8% p.a. between 1967 and
1976, about twice the recent growth rate in tertiary enrollments) suggest that
social pressures are already mounting for additional postsecondary places. In
order to meet economic needs in 1984, and without a change in internal effi-
ciency of the tertiary level system, enrollments in higher education would
need to increase by about 140,000 during Rep,lita III (1979-1983). Increases
in internal efficiency, from a 40% completion rate to 80%, would double
outputs without increasing enrollments. If these improvements were achieved,
the aggregate demand for degree and diploma graduates would likely be satisfied
through 1989 and 1986, respectively, without increased enrollments. Degree
level enrollments would need to expand from 1985 (at 5% p.a.) and diploma
level enrollments from 1983 (at 8% p.a.) to meet manpower demands beyond 1989
and 1986 respectively. At both levels, planned expansion should emphasize
technical training to alleviate anticipated manpower shortages in fields
crucial for development (i.e., science, mathematics, engineering, health,
economics and teacher training). The Government has already directed
attention to planning for systematic expansion of diploma level engineering
training for which inadequate capacity exists (paras. 1.08 and 2.13).
2.16      Financing.  Central government expenditure on education rose sharply
during the recent past, from around 1% of GNP a decade ago to 3% in 1975.
(If private expenditure is included, expenditure on education amounted to
nearly 4% of GNP in 1975). Repelita II has seen an unprecedented investment
thrust in education; planned allocations of development (capital) funds to
the DEC increased 18-fold - to US$1.6 billion - over the Repelita I allocation,
the greatest increase for any major sector. While the rate of growth will likely
slow significantly, the Repelita III allocation is expected to increase at
8% p.a. in real terms for development expenditure on education, and total
public expenditure on education (capital and recurrent) should rise by around
15% annually in real terms during the plan period. However, higher education
has received a very low proportion of total education expenditure in the past.
By comparison with eight other Asian countries, higher education expenditure
in Indonesia is lowest, as shown in Table 2.4. In 1975, total expenditure on
higher education in Indonesia amounted to about 0.2% of GNP, whereas the average
for the eight other Asian countries was three times greater (0.6%). Capital
expenditure, at an estimated US$7.0 million equivalent, was negligible. Total
government expenditure per student in public universities is only about US$125
equivalent; fee collection raises the amount by about 25%. Largely as a result
of inadequate expenditure, the average quality of postsecondary training is
poor (para. 2.01). Increased expenditure would improve the quality and
internal efficiency of higher education.

Issues in Higher Education
2.17      The most striking problems in higher education are low internal
efficiency and poor average quality. Of the public institutions, probably
fewer than 10 are viable economic units providing a consistent standard of
degree qualifications; prime among these are the five largest institutions,
designated by the Government as "centers of excellence" or Class A institutions
in 1970. These are the University of Indonesia in Jakarta, the University of
Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta, Airlangga University in Surabaya, the Institute of
Agriculture in Bogor and the Institute of Technology in Bandung. Of the remain-
ing public universities, 20 are grouped at an intermediate level, Class B, and
16 fall into the lowest category, Class C. Public and private academies (as
well as diploma level programs within the public universities /1) have an
average enrollment of about 200 students. Most of these are uneconomic
units, though the quality of training at a small number of non-DEC public
and private academies is adequate.
2.18      Efficiency.  Degree level graduates represent only 5% of university
enrollments in any one year. This low internal efficiency is attributed to
poor student selection, relatively high fees, poor student motivation, tedious
teaching methodology, lengthy courses of study and general student neglect.
The requirement that students write a thesis represents an additional barrier.
While the high dropout doubles the cost per graduate, student demand for
fee-paying places still exceeds the availability of places (by about 2:1 for
some small private universities and 10:1 for the bigger public universities).
/1 A deliberate policy to improve efficiency led to the phasing out of roughly
85 DEC academies between 1973 and 1975. A small number, in the fields of
engineering and accountancy, were absorbed into the universities.



- 14 -
There is thus little incentive for universities to improve their internal
efficiency. For nondegree programs, both public and private, the dropout
figures are generally lower and motivation is higher since most programs can
be completed in two to three years and are directly related to employment
opportunities.
2.19      Despite recent adjustments in the civil service salary scale (which
applies to salaries for faculty of public institutions of higher education),
staff regularly hold several appointments in different faculties or institu-
tions. This necessitates adjustment of teaching loads, i.e., one lecture
course per term on average. Students, likewise, can be considered part-time:
many hold jobs and engage in other income-earning activities. Ab a result,
the average time required to complete a degree (nominally five years) is eight
years and to complete a diploma level course (nominally two to three years) is
five years (para. 2.03).
2.20      Quality.  The lack of efficiency in higher education is closely
linked with weaknesses in quality. The low per student expenditure on higher
education undercuts the quality and relevance of training and is reflected in
underqualified staff, inadequate teaching materials and limited practical
training facilities. Many universities share laboratory facilities and some
students do their practical work at training centers established by government
departments. Even the five centers of excellence are poorly equipped in some
faculties. For example, Gadjah Mada lacks engineering equipment, and the
University of Indonesia has no civil engineering laboratory (its students do
their laboratory work at the Institute of Technology in Bandung). The supply
of textbooks in Bahasa Indonesia is also seriously inadequate and reinforces
the already strong inclination toward lecture courses and rote learning.
Individual study and use of written instructional materials to supplement
classroom work are usually not part of the teaching process. Library stocks
are also limited and little attempt is made to incorporate library assignments
into course work.
2.21      Staff qualifications are generally low in the higher education
system: more than a third hold only a sariana muda degree, and about half
report themselves unqualified to teach all the courses they presently give.
Staff qualifications vary widely among the three categories of universities:
approximately 10% of staff at Class A institutions hold doctorate degrees,
about 2% at Class B, and less than 1% at Class C. The technology consortium
reports the same disparities for professors of engineering subjects with no
engineering instructor in the Class C universities holding a doctor's degree.
2.22      The problems of dropout, poor quality, prolonged periods of study,
inefficient use of staff and duplication of programs are largely the result of
current financial and administrative practices. Possible solutions to these
problems include: more discriminating student selection and better orientation;
lowering immediate financial burdens on students/parents by introducing a
loan/scholarship program; further reform of staff emoluments; staff upgrading;
increased expenditure per pupil on textbooks, equipment and facilities; and
consolidation (or expansion) of small, inefficient institutions to create
viable economic units. Such improvements would entail substantial increases
in annual cost per student but could decrease the cost per graduate and/or per
unit of student achievement.

Engineering and Accountancy Education
2.23      Degree Level Engineering.  Engineering degrees are awarded
to approximately 1,000 graduates each year from the 16 public universities
that have engineering programs, and to an additional 550 graduates from
private universities. The two major engineering institutes (the Institutes
of Technology at Bandung and Surabaya - ITB and ITS) together enroll over
one third of the total engineering student population. ITB, the oldest
technical institute in the country, has a strong degree program and sets
comparatively high examination standards. Nearly 10% of its staff have
doctoral degrees; it is now beginning to conduct post-sarjana programs, some
of which lead to doctoral degrees. Its routine budget averages Rp 300,000
(US$720) p.a. per student, and it receives a higher annual development
budget (Rp 1.2 billion or US$2.9 million) and more capital aid from other
sources than other engineering faculties or institutes. (ITS spends only a
third as much per student annually.) As a result, ITB's facilities are
generally better equipped than those of other institutions. Nonetheless,
ITB's laboratory equipment in a number of fields is inadequate; much of the
institute is housed in buildings originally intended as temporary quarters;
and planned expansion of enrollment cannot be realized without new construc-
tion. ITS is presently improving its physical plant under a campus develop-
ment project assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
2.24      ITB and ITS have both embarked upon programs aimed at improving
internal efficiency, and ITB indicates that it has reduced its dropout rate to
under 20%. Its sarjana program has been reduced from 5 to 4-1/2 years, and
there is a maximum limit of 7-1/2 years during which every completing student
must graduate. (The average student now takes 5-1/2 to 6 years.) ITS indicates
that it has reduced its dropout rate from 70% to 30% over the past five years
and expects to reduce it further to 25% next year. ITS has a five-year sarjana
program, but the average student takes eight to nine years to complete his
studies.
2.25      Gadjah Mada and the University of Indonesia also have engineering
faculties, though neither has an engineering degree program comparable to those
of ITB or ITS. A few other institutions are gradually strengthening their
engineering faculties, primarily the Hasanuddin University, the University
of North Sumatera and Brawijaya University. However, their budgets, staff and
programs will need substantial assistance if they are to produce degree
graduates of the quality of ITB and ITS.  Hasanuddin is beginning such a
development program with the assistance of the ADB.
2.26      Quality improvements are needed in all engineering training programs:
buildings, equipment, libraries and teaching materials require upgrading;
staff development, through both domestic and foreign fellowships, would upgrade
the quality of teaching and management; and salary levels should be linked to
a minimum number of working hours per week. More assistance should be extended
to universities based on local manpower needs (para. 2.09), and assistance to
upgrade engineering faculties at private institutions should also be considered.
2.27      Engineering Technicians.  Engineering technicians play an important
role in most manufacturing and construction industries. They occupy a mid-level



- 16 -
position between the engineer and the skilled worker and apply/supervise known
technologies in a particular engineering field. The training of technicians
should thus combine the fundamentals of a broad engineering field within a range
of industry specific options in related skills areas. No coherent system to
train engineering technicians exists in Indonesia. Rather, postsecondary
engineering technicians are trained in a variety of institutions and programs,
most of them small (para. 2.17), responsibility for which is dispersed among
the DEC and other government departments whose prime functions are not
training.  The Department of Industry operates six postsecondary institutions
and enrolled about 2,600 students in 1977. One school provides postgraduate
training for industrial management and five (with about 2,300 trainees in
1977) provide three-year diploma level training in the fields of chemical
analysis, leather and textile technology, and industrial management.
(Graduate output was about 300 in 1976.) These institutions are efficiently
operated and provide high quality specialized training on an in-service
basis to Department of Industry employees. Similarly the Department of
Public Works sponsors specialized two- and three-year diploma level training
programs for its staff to meet its urgent need for subprofessional engineers.
These programs, which enrolled 800 students in 1977, are carried out under
contract by the ITB and, beginning in 1978, by the ITS and Gadjah Mada
University. (Output of graduates in 1976 was 125.)
2.28     Prior to Presidential Decree No. 34 of 1972, most DEC technician
training was carried out in eight public technical academies which enrolled
6,600 students in 1972. By contrast with the programs of the Departments of
Industry and Public Works, these academies provided poor quality training
and were inefficient. The Government phased out the eight academies but
transferred their programs to nearby universities, since these programs
provided technicians to help fill the technical skill gap between the graduate
engineer and the skilled worker (the latter trained in senior secondary
technical schools, STMs). In 1976 these diploma level programs (Pendidikan
Ahli Tecnik, PAT) enrolled some 3,000 technician trainees in the fields of
chemical, civil, mechanical, electrical and shipbuilding engineering. However,
quality problems experienced in the academies have persisted: facilities,
often rented space in STMs, are inadequate; equipment for practical work is
lacking; and staff, for whom there is no regular training program, are under-
qualified or excessively academic.
2.29      There are an additional 3,000 students enrolled in private technical
academies which generally experience the same quality problems as the PATs.
Two exceptions are the Swiss-assisted polytechnic in Bandung and a Jesuit-run
academy in Solo. These institutions provide three-year postsecondary training
geared towards production of specialized skilled workers (rather than higher
technicians). Demand for output from these institutions is high and students
often receive offers of employment prior to graduation. In addition, some
semi-public and private industries have initiated in-service technician train-
ing programs; these include the training institutions of the State Railways,
the PUSRI Fertilizer Company, the Electricity Authority (PLN), Krakatau Steel
and PT Bharata (machines). While some of these training programs have been
developed to meet the special needs of these enterprises, others have been
introduced to compensate for the general shortage of graduates from formal
technician training programs.



- 17 -
2.30      The overriding problems in these existing formal engineering
technician training programs are inadequate capacity-(para. 2.13), poor
average quality and lack of coherence, viz. there is no technician training
system. The Government now plans to strengthen and expand public diploma
training for engineering technicians by establishment of a system within
existing universities whenever possible to provide training in the funda-
mentals of civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. Training would
emphasize practical skills required by industry and more effective instruc-
tional methods should be developed to better meet the economy's manpower
requirements. Close working relations with regional business and industry
would link classroom training to future job experience. Provision of better
laboratory equipment and teacher training and/or upgrading would also be
required. Appropriate administrative structures both at universities and in
the DEC should be developed to support the diploma programs and coordinate
their output with other sources of supply for technicians (including non-
formal and the on-the-job programs).
2.31      Accountancy Training.  Most degree level training in accounting is
provided by departments of accounting within the university faculties of
economics through programs that start during the third or fourth year. About
half of the 26,000 economics students in public institutions concentrate on
accounting, but recent output is estimated at only 300-350 per year; the
other half focus on general economics or business administration. Accounting
departments exist at six state universities (the Universities of Indonesia,
Gadjah Mada, North Sumatera, Airlangga, Pajajaran, Sriwijaya) and three
private universities (Parahyangan, Trisakti and Nomensen) and are being set
up at the universities of Syiah Kuda, Brawijaya and Diponegoro. Government
accounting (degree and diploma level) is offered at the Ministry of Finance's
State School for Government Accountants (Sekolah Tinggi Akuntansi Negara, STAN)
in Jakarta which enrolls about 500 students. Only graduates from state
universities and STAN, after serving a minimum of three years with the
Government, are recognized as registered accountants. Law No. 34 of 1954
established a Committee of Experts to confer the title of certified accountant.
This committee has the authority to set qualifying examinations for candidates
for the title who have not studied at STAN or one of the six state institutions.
Plans for holding this examination on a regular basis exist but have yet to
be implemented. (Reportedly only one such examination has been given to
date.)
2.32      The prevailing accountancy degree program in Indonesia emphasizes
financial accounting and auditing but offers limited scope for intensive
specialization. The teaching methodology tends to be void of domestic cases,
texts, and seminars/workshops. Books and periodicals are insufficient,
and few useful, current materials have been translated into Bahasa Indonesia.
The existing staff need upgrading: most have been theoretically trained and
have had limited experience in the application of accounting methods, but few
have specialized in such areas as controllership, accounting systems, budgeting,
management and industrial accounting, computer accounting and auditing, and
government and public enterprise accounting. Student contact hours and
guidance are minimal, due in large part to multiple job holding by nominally
full-time staff members. Teaching assistants are scarce. Course outlines,
coordination between courses and administrative control over staff are inade-
quate. While public and private universities provide the same programs, the
average quality of faculty and students is lower at the private institutions.



- 18 -
2.33      Technician level accountancy training is carried out largely by
private academies and postsecondary schools which enrolled nearly 13,000
students in 1976 in economics-related courses. Another 5,000 students
attended non-DEC public institutions. (The number of these students following
accountancy courses is not available, para. 2.13). As with technician
training for engineers, a number of public (DEC) accountancy academies were
absorbed into the universities after 1972. These programs (Pendidikan Ahli
Administrasi Perusahaan, PAAP), enrolling some 5,000 students in 1976,
suffer from the same problems as the engineering programs, the most signifi-
cant of which is poor quality.  Teaching staff, materials and facilities
tend to be deficient in both the public and private institutions. Standardi-
zation of the variety of programs and examinations is still unsatisfactory,
and there is a lack of coordination among middle level institutions.
Transfer to universities is virtually excluded. Secondary level accountancy
(bookkeeping) courses also require updating.
2.34      Estimated manpower requirements suggest that the need for degree
level accountants will rise toward the mid-1980s (paras. 1.08 and 2.15).
Until then, the most severe constraints on the effectiveness of accountancy
training at both degree and diploma levels are the limited numbers of trained
faculty and the lack of appropriate teaching materials. The Government
attaches increasing importance to the need to provide an improved quality of
accountants for both public and private sector enterprises and plans to
strengthen accountancy and related training at secondary and tertiary education
levels.
2.35    Major requirements for strengthening accountancy training would
include effective staff training; development of more practical and relevant
courses and programs with greater opportunity for specialization at upper and
even middle accountancy levels; more effective teaching materials and aids,
including accounting "laboratories" with some mechanized facilities (e.g.
on-line computer set ups); encouragement of research, writing and translation
of foreign texts and articles; and creation of postgraduate (post-sariana)
accountancy training programs.
2.36    In addition, information on accountancy training programs and the
profession should be improved. An inventory of accounting manpower needs
and a related accounting development plan should be initiated. The Consortium
of Economic Sciences is considering a "Survey on Needs for Accountants in
Indonesia;" this or a similar survey should be conducted as soon as possible.
It should reflect manpower supply and demand projections (including public and
private sector demands specified by regions, branches, types, functions,
levels and specializations of accountants) and thus permit an examination
of the existing and future balance between the two (para. 1.07).
2.37      More effective coordination of accountancy education and moderniz-
ation of practices at all levels, in the government and private sector,
appear necessary. The Government is now considering establishing an accoun-
tancy development advisory council with representatives from the Depart-
ment of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Finance, Bappenas, universities,
the professional accounting body (Ikatan Akuntan Indonesia), STAN and other
educational institutions.



- 19 -
2.38      The present government bookkeeping system is still the single
entry system inherited from the colonial administration, which is inadequate
for modern public administration. As an indication of the inadequacy of
present accounting practices, summary financial statements lag by at least
two years and have not been prepared for most fiscal years. The Government
now plans to undertake a study to determine means to modernize the government
accounting system and procedures. It plans to complement this with another
study for business management education to develop a national strategy in
this area.
Education Sector Strategy
2.39      Government Strategy.  Throughout the First and Second Plan periods
the Government attached general priority to improving and expanding primary
and secondary education and, during Repelita II, to providing nonformal
education. As Repelita II draws to a close, inefficiency, low output, and the
generally poor quality of teaching at the tertiary level represent urgent
problems that must also be addressed because of their constraining effect on
manpower supply for other development efforts. The Government has thus placed
increasing emphasis on the need for rationalizing the development of higher
education by better defining areas of administrative responsibility, by
guiding development of the subsector on the basis of an improved information
system, and by improving coordination among institutions of higher education.
The Government further plans to base development on regional needs and
improve internal efficiency by diversifying training options, by shortening
the average length of training and by consolidating uneconomical institutions.
Particular emphasis is placed on increasing the output and improving the
quality and efficiency of higher technical training on which the industrial
sector will increasingly depend. Within this category investment is to be
directed towards engineering, economics and the sciences.
2.40      Investment Requirements and Gaps.  In order to satisfy social
demand for primary schooling and demand for secondary and tertiary level
manpower, total capital investment required (in 1974 prices) to expand the
education system would be about Rp 700 billion (US$1,700 million) during the
Repelita III period. Incremental recurrent costs (also in 1974 prices)
would be Rp 70 billion (US$170 million) per year, as shown in Table 2.5. If
estimated costs to provide replacement for DEC and INPRES programs are
added, the total investment requirement would rise to Rp 880 billion
(US$2,100 million) and incremental operating costs would represent Rp 80 bil-
lion (US$190 million).
2.41      A comparison of educational financing requirements with trend line
budgets (combined capital and recurrent) suggests that the total resource
gap (in 1974 prices) in the education sector could reach Rp 600 billion
(US$1,500 million) during the Repelita III period. The figures indicate that
even with substantial effort by the Government, investment in human resource
development during Repelita III would tend to lag behind economic needs.
Part of the national deficit could be met through increased spending by local
governments and on private education, and part through external assistance.

2.42      Bank Group Participation.  The Bank Group has extended six loans/
credits, totalling US$95.4 million, for the education sector in Indonesia.
The Bank Group's investment program in education has pursued three main
objectives, namely meeting manpower requirements, improving quality and, more
recently, increasing equity. The Bank Group began assisting the education
sector, in the absence of a comprehensive analysis of the education sector,
through relatively small projects directed towards meeting clearly evident
educational and manpower needs. Under the First Education Project (Credit
219-IND of 1970), US$4.6 million was extended to establish five centralized
workshops for use by higher secondary technical school students. This
project was completed on schedule in 1976 the centralized workshops introduced
under the project have proved successful in providing an improved quality of
skills training in a cost-effective manner. The Second Education Project
(Credit 288-IND of 1971) provided US$6.3 million to support expansion of
middle level agricultural manpower and was completed with a year's delay in
late 1977. The final evaluation of the agricultural training project indicates
that it has had an important institution-building impact through creation of
a national agriculture training agency and has expanded the capacity and
output of agricultural training institutions. The execution of both projects
could, however, have benefited from more advanced preparation at the time of
commitment of credit funds.ll The Third Education Project (Credit 387-IND of
/1 Details are contained in the completion reports prepared for these
projects.



- 21 -
1973), assisted by a Credit of US$13.5 million, is directed towards improving
primary and secondary education through provision of textbooks and in-service
teacher training. Thus far 80 million textbooks have been produced and
380,000 teachers trained under this project.
2.43      Subsequent projects were identified on the basis of the Government's
National Assessment Study of Education (completed in 1973) and the Bank's
comprehensive education sector survey (Report No. 433a-IND of 1975). The
Fourth Project (Loan 1237-IND of 1976) provided US$37 million to help meet
manpower requirements in the vocational/technical and public administration
fields. The Fifth Project (Loan 1433 of 1977) provided US$19 million for
improving primary and secondary teacher training and the Sixth Project (Loan
1486 of 1977) provided US$15 million, to strengthen nonformal education.
Aggregate Bank lending is shown on Table 2.6 by level and type of education.
Except for technical teacher training, virtually no financing has been
provided for higher education.
2.44      In response to growing shortages of higher level manpower the
Bank conducted a subsector survey on higher technical education in 1977.
This survey identified two priority areas for investment, viz. the need
to introduce a system for training middle level technicians and to improve
degree level technical training (mainly in engineering, science and the
management sciences including accountancy). The proposed polytechnic
project primarily addresses the first of these two needs. A second project
to improve degree level technical training is being prepared. In addition,
in the future it is expected that the Bank will pursue a consolidation and
extension of achievements through repeater projects in such priority subsectors
as agricultural training, textbooks, teacher training and nonformal education.

3. THE PROJECT
Overview
3.01      The proposed project would pursue the following three objectives:
(a) to establish a new system for training engineering technicians;
(b) to improve the quality of accountancy training and practices; and
(c) to assist in strengthening education planning and management.
3.02      The first objective would be achieved through establishment of six
polytechnics and accompanying management and program supports. The second
would be pursued through a program of instructor training, materials development
and research for accountancy, including a study to develop an improved government
accounting system. The final objective would be sought through support of a
series of associated studies centering on manpower analysis and planning for
higher technical training and through assistance with education project
monitoring and implementation.

3.03      Objectives and Scope.  This component would support development of
a new system for training engineering technicians. It would address present
weaknesses in technician training (paras. 2.27 and 2.30) by helping to
introduce:
(a) unit for management of diploma programs;
(b) a technician education development center to carry out curriculum,
materials and staff development for industrial technician training; and
(c) six polytechnics to provide new training places for some 4,320
engineering technicians.



- 24 -
3.04      Under the project, financing would be provided for:
(a) civil works, furniture and equipment for a technician education
development center and six polytechnics;
(b) program development (curriculum, materials, staff training,
planning and management, and evaluation) for the polytechnics;
and
(c)  related technical assistance.
3.05      Organization and Management.  The management structure for the
technician training component is shown in Chart 3.1. Under the project the
Unit for Management of Diploma Programs (UMDP) which has been established
within the DGHE to manage all diploma programs, would be provided subunits
related to polytechnic programs for: planning, programming and evaluation;
budgeting and accounting; recruitment and personnel; and liaison. The UMDP
would be responsible for formulating policy and setting standards and
procedures for development of technician training, including that provided
by project polytechnics. In addition its liaison unit would conduct manpower
analyses related to diploma level training and would maintain international
and national liaison on technician training developments.
3.06      The Technician Education Development Center (TEDC) would be located
on the ITB campus; it would report directly to the DGHE through the planning
and programming unit of the UMDP. The TEDC would be responsible for the
planning and programming of engineering technician training at the polytechnics
through:
(a) development of curriculum and materials for the polytechnics;
(b) provision of pre- and in-service training for polytechnic staff;
(c) monitoring polytechnic operations and carrying out employment and
manpower research related to industrial technicians; and
(d) informing the public and industry about the polytechnic programs.
In order to ensure the relevance of ttaining provided to the job market
(para. 2.30) an industrial advisory board, which is expected to comprise
representatives from the National Chamber of Commerce, the National Industrial
Development Board and public and private enterprises, would be created. This
board would provide information on broad industrial manpower requirements and
advise on educational policy for the polytechnics.
3.07      The polytechnics would be new three-year post-secondary school insti-
tutions giving industrial technician training leading to a diploma in civil,
mechanical and electrical engineering. They would be located within universi-
ties, but their training objectives would be distinct from those of university
departments of engineering. Their structure has been designed to elicit uni-
versity administrative support while allowing for independent programming and
operations. The polytechnic director would report directly to the university

rector for administrative matters and to the TEDC for pedagogic matters.
Each polytechnic would comprise a director, an assistant director and four
functional units with responsibility for administration, teaching programs,
student services and liaison with industry. A function of the last unit
would be to provide engineering consultant services, including design and
production of prototypes, to facilitate transfer of technology. A local
advisory board similar to that for the TEDC would be established for each
polytechnic. It would include provincial representatives from the Chamber of
Commerce, the Industrial Development Board and industry. The Board would
provide liaison with local industry for matters such as advising on program
development, assisting in arranging short-term, on-the-job training for
polytechnic students in local industries, and providing part-time instructors
from industry. During negotiations the Government provided assurances
that it would establish, within six months of the opening of the TEDC and
each polytechnic, an industrial advisory board for the TEDC and for each
polytechnic with functions and composition acceptable to the Association.
3.08      Locations.  The polytechnics would be located in four provinces in
Java and in two provinces in Sumatera at the universities of Indonesia
(Jakarta), Brawijaya (East Java), Diponegoro (Central Java), North Sumatera
(Medan), Sriwijaya (South Sumatera) and the ITB (West Java). The number and
locations of the institutions were chosen by the Government on the basis of
industrial density (para. 1.03). Locating the polytechnics in these
provinces should maximize achievement of project objectives: the quality
and relevance of training would be enhanced by cooperation between the
polytechnics and nearby industries (in terms of course development and
ability to attract instructors with practical experience, para. 2.30);
polytechnic graduates would be more likely to obtain immediate employment in
these provinces; and recruitment of qualified teachers would be less difficult
than in more remote provinces. South Sumatera, which by comparison with the
other five provinces is less industrialized, has been included because of
rapid growth in the recent past of relatively capital-intensive industries
(including petrochemicals). Such growth is projected to continue. However,
the polytechnic there would initially be smaller than the others.
3.09      Enrollments.  Four of the polytechnics would admit about 300
students annually, 100 in each of three major engineering fields (civil,
electrical, mechanical); the polytechnic in South Sumatera would admit 200
students annually, 100 in each of two (civil, mechanical) fields and the
polytechnic in Bandung would admit 150 students annually, 50 in each of three
major engineering fields (civil, electrical, mechanical). The maximum enroll-
ment capacity for the three polytechnicl models would be about 900, 600 and
450, respectively. Facilities would be flexibly designed to allow for future
expansion. It is anticipated that internal efficiency would be substantially
greater than the present average for universities (para. 2.18). The TEDC
would open in 1981 and the opening of the six polytechnics would be phased
over the years 1982-84 such that an enrollment of about 4,320 would be
reached in 1985. Of this enrollment about 1,550 students would be in the
first year course, 1,440 in the second and 1,330 in the third./l
/1 An average annual rate of dropout of about 9% is assumed for planning
purposes. However, the Government will attempt to achieve a dropout
rate lower than this.



- 27 -
3.10      Measures to obtain a higher degree of internal efficiency as
planned would include the development of selection procedures that seek to
match student aptitude to program requirements; the provision (outside of
the diploma courses proper) of remedial courses; and the provision of
student bursaries for about 15% of the student body (para. 2.22). From 600
to 700 bursaries would be financed annually under the project. Students
recruited to the polytechnics would be graduates of upper secondary schools,
both general secondary (SMAs) and secondary technical schools (STMs).
Selection would be based on the results of a national entrance examination
taken locally, an interview and possibly an aptitude test. The educational
backgrounds of SMA and STM graduates vary widely and the scientific and
mathematical backgrounds of SMA graduates are generally superior. Regional
variations are also evident. If experience shows that remedial courses are
necessary, they would be provided at the polytechnics until improved quality
could be effected at the secondary level. The TEDC would be responsible for
establishing requirements for student entrance, promotion, and repetition,
and for control of entrance examinations and award of bursuries.
3.11      Staff Recruitment.  About 680 new positions would need to be
created between 1978 and 1984 to staff the TEDC and polytechnics as shown
below:

Subtotal                    30      242    226   181         679
3.12      In view of competing demands for trained technical manpower, both
full- and part-time personnel would be recruited to meet polytechnic staffing
requirements.  Most full-time teaching staff would be recruited directly from
postsecondary training programs. As an incentive the Government plans to
recruit such staff prior to their final year of formal training and to provide
one year bursaries to enable them to accelerate completion of the various
programs. Financing for these bursaries is included under the project. Upon
appointment to a polytechnic, bursary recipients would be expected to serve
for a minimum of two years. Experienced part-time staff would be drawn from
industry and universities. The TEDC would coordinate all staff recruitment.
Selection of polytechnic staff would be the responsibility of the DGHE in
cooperation with TEDC and the individual university.



- 28 -
3.13      Staff Training.  Three types of training programs would prepare
managers and teachers for their new functions under the project: fellowships,
preservice training and in-service training. About 70 man years of fellow-
ships would be provided under the project (Table 3.3) nearly 45% of which
would be local fellowships. This fellowship training for key staff of the
Unit for Management of Diploma Programs, TEDC staff and polytechnic adminis-
trators would be conducted in institutions with training programs and
objectives similar to those envisaged for the polytechnics. Study content
would be geared towards the functional responsibilities of the staff member.

3.14      The 30 teacher trainers with TEDC would undergo 15 months of
preservice training, 12 months training in manual skills, including
laboratory and workshop techniques, as well as in pedagogy. For this train-
ing special courses would be organized with assistance from existing local
institutions (e.g., the Swiss-assisted polytechnic, technical teacher training
colleges) or from institutions in nearby countries (e.g., the Colombo Plan
Staff College for Technician Education in Singapore). A final three months of
training would be taken abroad. Preservice training would also be given
systematically to staff recruited for full-time teaching appointments at the
polytechnics. This training would be developed and conducted by TEDC teacher
trainers in cooperation with technical specialists (para. 3.32). The training
would aim to upgrade the qualifications of the teachers in their respective
fields of study, to orient them to the purpose of the polytechnic and to
enable them to plan and utilize effectively project facilities. In order to



- 29 -
allow prospective personnel to undertake preservice training, TEDC and poly-
technic staff would be recruited at least 12 months in advance of appointment.
Preservice training of polytechnic staff (average duration one year) would be
provided beginning in 1981, and thereafter as necessary to fill vacancies or
to meet new demand,/1 as follows:

Appointment of staff to the polytechnics would follow in May of each year as
the training course is completed (viz. 256 staff would be appointed in May
1982, 238 in May 1983, and 182 in May 1984).
3.15      An important element of the training program would be continuous
in-service training for full- and part-time polytechnic teaching staff. This
short-term training would begin with first year operations at project institu-
tions. It would mainly take the form of a minimum of two workshops per year
conducted by TEDC staff at the polytechnics. Training would focus on orienting
part-time staff and assisting all teaching staff to plan courses for the next
semester. During the workshops, teaching staff would be assisted in developing
course outlines, daily lesson plans, laboratory experiments, workshop projects,
homework assignments, laboratory and workshop instructions for students, and
examinations/proficiency tests. The project would finance the costs of pre-
and in-service training of polytechnic instructors. During negotiations,
agreement was reached on the schedule (para. 3.14) of appointment and training
for polytechnic staff.
3.16      Teaching Programs.  Polytechnic training programs would be designed
to produce personnel for middle level technical positions in industry and
construction./2 The curriculum would. cover civil, electrical and mechanical
/   To meet actual staffing requirements (Table 3.2) and to allow for normal
wastage, up to 10% more staff than required would be trained. This
effort would, however, be reduced to the extent that experienced part-time
staff could be recruited.
/2  Programs would be consistent with the functions of technicians which include,
inter alia, erecting and commissioning engineering equipment and structures,
and supervising such work; engineering and building drawing; inspecting and
testing engineering and building construction and equipment (quality and
stock control); use of surveying equipment in setting out works and making
site plans; operating, maintaining and repairing engineering machinery, and
supervising such activities (plant and engineering services); and activities
concerned with research and development, testing of materials and components,
and equipment servicing.



- 30 -
engineering (para. 2.30). It would give adequate emphasis to practical
training with projects in workshops and laboratories occupying at least 40% of
student time. General courses, accounting for 15% of time, would consist of
mathematics, civics, English., and the principles of organization and management
(appropriate to middle level management tasks); costing, quality and stock
control and technological theory would account for 45% of time. There would
be six study options with enrollments projected as shown on Table 3.4:
Within each main field, basic courses would be taught during the first two
years with options chosen for the second and third year. It is anticipated
that three years of study would be necessary to meet required skill levels;
however, the type and duration of polytechnic programs could be modified as
manpower requirements change. Overall responsibility for curriculum develop-
ment rests with the TEDC. Initial assistance would be provided by a team
of expert advisors to be financed under the project; polytechnic staff
would also participate in this process through workshops and by testing
prototype materials.

electrical engineering.
3.17      Materials Development.  The development of teaching materials for
the polytechnics, to be coordinated by the TEDC, would be conducted in two
phases. The first phase would consist largely of selecting, importing and
adapting technician training textbooks and teaching manuals from materials



- 31 -
available abroad. Appropriate criteria for selection of materials would
ensure that they correspond with the planned curriculum and pedagogic objec-
tives of the polytechnics. Selection would be monitored by the TEDC in
consultation with polytechnic staff. Necessary adaptations of materials
available abroad. Appropriate criteria for selection of materials would
ensure that they correspond with the planned curriculum and pedagogic objec-
tives of the polytechnics. Selection would be monitored by the TEDC in
consultation with polytechnic staff. Necessary adaptations of materials
procured, including translations, would be carried out by the TEDC on a
contract basis. The second phase of development would center on preparation
of new materials, initially workshop manuals, laboratory manuals and other
supporting (loose-leaf) materials (e.g., workshop modules, laboratory exercises),
and eventually textbooks. The TEDC would play an active role in defining the
purpose and design of particular materials but would contract authors to write
them; author teams would include engineers (from industry, ITB and elsewhere),
industrial workers, polytechnic staff and specialists (publishers, editors,
teachers) in design, development and use of instructional materials. Technical
assistance would be provided under the project for local specialists to
assist with materials development. Polytechnic staff would assist in testing
and revising new and the adapted materials.
3.18      Outputs.  The first polytechnic students would graduate in June
1985. Beginning in 1986, total planned output of about 1,330 graduates per
year (470 each in civil and mechanical engineering and 390 in electrical
engineering) would be achieved. In view of the general shortage of engi-
neering technicians, polytechnic graduates should find employment within a
reasonable amount of time after graduation (paras. 2.29-2.30).
3.19      Evaluation and Planning.  A planning and performance monitoring
system would be built into the project's technician training component. The
monitoring system would be set up with assistance from the technical advisors
and would be implemented jointly by the polytechnics and the TEDC. The
polytechnics would be responsible for record keeping on enrollments, dropouts,
repeaters, employment performance of graduates, and results of training
programs and staff development. Polytechnic staff would analyze these data
for their respective institutions. The research and evaluation section in
the TEDC would be responsible for coordinating analysis of this information
on a cumulative basis and for initiating and analyzing graduate tracer
studies to determine the relevance of polytechnic training, success in
placing graduates in industry and graduate performance on the job. The TEDC
would recommend changes in polytechnic programs and procedures needed to
improve effectiveness, and these would be implemented with the approval of
the UMDP.
3.20      In addition, a review of the polytechnics would be conducted
during 1984 by a team consisting of representatives from the Consortium of
Technology, BP3K and with professional engineers who would be potential field



- 32 -
supervisors of polytechnic graduates. The focus of this review would be
wider than that of the monitoring process: it would determine how far the
technician training component is achieving its objectives under the project
and identify its strengths and weaknesses. The results of the review would
serve as a basis for strengthening diploma level training and for possible
second phase Bank Group assistance. The project would provide technical
assistance to assist with the review. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that it would conduct a review of the project technician
training component and submit it to the Association by December 31, 1984.
3.21      The UMDP, charged with overall implementation of the project,
would further supervise implementation of two studies designed to improve
the information system for planning and management for higher education
(paras. 2.09-2.10). The first of these studies would seek to establish a
systematic base for middle and higher level manpower analysis. It would be
carried out by staff of the Manpower Planning Office of the Department
of Manpower and would complement ongoing investigation assisted by the ILO.
(The ILO would assist with developing terms of reference for the manpower
study.) The second would involve a series of substudies on issues in higher
education (i.e. financing, structure, determinants of student flows and use
of facilities and staff) to be carried out under contract by university
personnel. The project would include the financing of expert services in
support of these two studies. -
Accountancy Training (Proposed Outlay, US$5.2 Million, excluding contingen-
cies).
3.22      Objectives and Scope.  This component is designed to upgrade the
accountancy training both in universities and the Ministry of Finance. The
quality of such training is presently inadequate (paras. 2.32-2.35) and
hinders the modernization of accounting practices at all levels, both in the
government and the private sector. This component of the project would
help to alleviate the present constraints to effective accountancy training
that can be attributed to limited trained faculty and lack of appropriate
teaching materials and facilities at both secondary and tertiary level
institutions. This would be achieved by establishing three accountancy
development centers (Centers) within university faculties of economics and a
fourth at the Ministry of Finance accountancy training school, STAN.
These Centers would:
(a)  provide training to upgrade accountancy instructors and practicing
accountants;
(b) develop improved courses and teaching materials relevant to
Indonesia's public and private sector accounting and auditing
needs; and
(c) carry out practice-oriented research projects to improve Indonesia's
accounting methods.



- 33
3.23      The project would finance:
(a) the rental of facilities for use by the university Centers,
the conversion of existing facilities at STAN, and furniture for
these facilities;
(b) instructional materials and equipment;
(c) program development for the Centers (training programs,
research contracts and evaluation); and
(d) related technical assistance.
3.24      Organization and Management.  The organization of each Center is shown
in Chart 3.2. The staff of each Center would consist of a director, an asso-
ciate director, two program officers, six instructors (full-time equivalent) and
support staff. The proposed schedule for appointment of ADC staff is as follows:
(a) directors, January 1979;
(b) associate directors, February 1979; and
(c) program officers and instructors, April-December 1979.
Management staff would be selected from senior university and STAN accountancy
teaching staff, while instructional staff would be recruited from full- or
part-time university and STAN instructors and from qualified graduate students.
The director of each university Center would be administratively responsible
to the dean of economics; the director of the STAN Center would be responsible
to the head of STAN. For purposes of program development and implementation
of the accountancy component, directors would report to a project management
authority in the DGHE. Each Center would develop and monitor its own training
programs and materials development and research projects. Overall coordination
would be provided by an executive committee made up of the directors of each
Center, one of whom would be its chairman.

3.25      Locations.  The university Centers would be located at the universi-
ties of Indonesia (Jakarta), Gadjah Mada (Yogyakarta) and North Sumatera (Medan).
These institutions are among the few that have established accountancy
programs and staff capable of providing the required professional leadership
and expertise. The Center at STAN is included because of the Ministry of
Finance's important role in public accounting and auditing.
3.26      Enrollments.  The potential participants and planned training at
the university Centers and the STAN Center are given in Tables 3.6 and 3.7
respectively. By 1981, the university Centers would each provide upgrading
annually for about 480 teaching staff of university departments of accounting,
practicing accountants and bookkeeping teachers; the STAN Center would
upgrade annually about 800 Ministry of Finance accountants and budget
officials. In addition, some 2,500 accountancy instructors and practitioners
would attend workshop, lecture and seminar series given by the four Centers.

3.27      Staff Development.  The project provides for 72 man-months (see
Table 3.7) of short-term (approximately 3 months) overseas fellowships for
Center instructors to develop courses and materials urgently needed to upgrade
accountancy training. Short-term fellowship training would be carried out
during 1978/79, but study leave related to development of the most vital
course materials would be given priority to enable the Centers to incorporate
these materials into their programs as soon as possible. Four PhD and eight
MS level fellowships would be provided to the Centers' staff between 1979 and
1982. Research grants would be awarded to four professors of accountancy to
(a) improve their qualifications as teachers and researchers, and (b) undertake
research projects that support the Centers' development efforts. The executive
committee would be responsible for selecting candidates for fellowships and
awarding research grants. In addition, each Center would be assisted over a
two-year period by a team of two experts. Since existing teaching staff at
the universities and STAN would be jointly appointed to the Centers, recruit-
ment of additional professional staff would not be required. The Centers
would require a small number of secretarial and other support staff.

3.28      Training Programs.  Training programs would attempt to improve the
qualifications of accountancy teachers and practicing accountants at all
levels. At the university Centers, courses for university and academy instruc-
tors and practicing accountants would initially focus on accounting and
management information systems, data processing, operational auditing, and
management and national income accounting. Training for bookkeeping teachers
would begin with elementary accounting and upgrading in basic bookkeeping
methods. STAN's training programs would emphasize management auditing and
accounting, financial accounting, government and budget accounting, data
processing and information systems, and national accounting. Teaching
materials to be developed for these courses could subsequently be used by
participants in their own institutions. The project would provide financing
for the training programs, including the cost of transportation and subsistence
for participants.
3.29      Materials Development and Research Projects.  The executive committee
would be responsible for planning, selecting and coordinating teaching materials
development and research projects. Teaching materials development would include
translating or writing eight standard textbooks, writing 10 Indonesian case
studies and developing course materials (outlines, study notes, problems and
visual aids) for 15 accountancy subjects (9 for university/academy instruction,
3 for upgrading practicing accountants, and 3 for bookkeeping instruction).
The executive committee would also be responsible for selecting qualified
authors/translators and research personnel. Four research projects would be
implemented under the project. These projects would be practice-oriented
with a potential for a short-run impact on accounting practices; they should
be within the competence of available staff and be completed, on average,
within two years. Possible topics would include: uniform bookkeeping systems
for small businesses, uniform accounting systems for plantations, and Indonesian
standards of auditing and financial reporting. The project would include
financing for materials development and research contracts. During nego-
tiations the Government agreed to submit annually for Association comment and
thereafter implement a schedule for training, materials development and
research programs at the four accountancy development centers.
3.30      Evaluation and Planning.  A planning and performance monitoring
system similar to that for the polytechnics would be established under the
accountancy training component. Each accountancy development center would be
responsible for supplying data on annual training programs, numbers of parti-
cipants, materials development and research projects to the project management
authority in the DGHE. A system for obtaining feedback on the relevance of
training and materials provided would also be established; data would be
analyzed by the centers' directors and relevant DGHE project staff so that
recommended improvements for training programs could be effected.
3.31      In addition, relevant staff within the UMDP would oversee imple-
mentation of three planning studies designed to formulate recommendations for
the future development of accountancy training as well as business management
education and improved government accounting and auditing procedures (paras.
2.36-2.38). The first study would focus on accountancy manpower requirements
by level and type of training and would be carried out under the auspices of
the Consortium for Economic Sciences. The business management study, also to



- 38 -
conducted under the Consortium for Economic Sciences, would attempt to define
the type of training required in the field of business management. The third
study, to be carried out by the Ministry of Finance, would be undertaken for
the purpose of developing an improved government accounting and auditing
system and training inputs required to implement it throughout the Government
and public enterprise system. Financing of specialist services would be
included under the project to support these studies. During negotiations, the
Government submitted to the Association for its review terms of reference
for the above studies as well as for the two studies to be included under the
polytechnic component (para. 3.21).
Planning and Management Support (Proposed Outlay, US$15.6 Million, Excluding
Contingencies)
3.32      Objectives and Scope.  The project would provide technical assis-
tance and professional services to support implementation of the project
and to assist the Government in strengthening planning and management in
the education sector, in particular in the higher technical education
subsector. The first objective would be achieved through a combination of
fellowship training and specialist services and the second would be attained
through provision of specialist and professional services as summarized below:

The qualifications and experience of the major consultants financed under
the project and the terms and conditions of their employment would be
satisfactory to the Association. Expatriate specialists would be phased out
during the last years of the project as local staff assume the relevant
responsibilities. During negotiations the Association and the Government
agreed on procedures and criteria for awarding fellowships.

3.33      TEDC and Polytechnics.  Initially a team of specialists financed
under a cooperative agreement with a private Swiss agency (Swiss Contact)
advised on administrative requirements, curriculum outlines and preparation of
master equipment lists and bidding documents for the polytechnics. More
extensive technical assistance, comprising a team leader plus six specialists
in various fields, would assist the TEDC under the proposed project for a
period of five years. In addition, 17 specialists would be assigned for a
period up to three years each to assist the six polytechnics./l The team
leader and six TEDC advisors would begin arriving in July 1979.  The other
experts would be scheduled to arrive in accordance with individual polytechnic
scheduling needs. The specialists would assist in the development of the
polytechnic programs through job analyses and the preparation of learning
objectives, curriculum details, detailed equipment lists, teaching materials
(including laboratory/workshop manuals) and monitoring procedures. They
would also assist in devising and executing training programs for polytechnic
staff and in the training of TEDC (counterpart) staff. An additional 30
man-years of local specialist services would be included to support polytechnic
materials development. Bursaries for about 3,500 prospective polytechnic
staff and students (at US$200 equivalent per year each) would also be
financed under the technical assistance component.
3.34      Accountancy Development Centers.  Eight expatriate specialists
would be assigned in teams of two to assist each accountancy development
center in developing and providing training courses, teaching materials and
a monitoring scheme for a period of two years beginning in January 1980; these
experts would have CPA, PhD in accountancy specializations or equivalent
qualifications. In addition, the experts assigned to the STAN Center should
have a strong background in public management and auditing.
3.35      Planning and Programming  Expatriate services (13.5 man-years)
would be provided to assist with the second and third level manpower study
(3 man-years), the business administration study (0.5 man-years) and the study
on government accounting and auditing procedures (10 man-years). A total of
45 man-years of local experts would assist with educational planning study
(20 man-years), the accountancy manpower study (10 man-years), the business
administration study (5 man-years), and the government accounting and auditing
study (10 man-years).
3.36      Another 25 man-years of expatriate services and 170 man-years
of local services would be included mainly to provide assistance with procure-
ment and implementation under this and ongoing education projects and
preparation of completion reports and future education projects. Included
is one man-year of local specialist services to enable the Government to
carry out its review of the polytechnic component under this project. In
addition, this component includes financing (US$1.4 million equivalent) for
professional services required to prepare future projects.
/1 The specialists would include experts in: technical teacher training;
curriculum, materials and methods; mechanical prime movers; electrical
generation and power distribution; workshop technology and production;
construction; building service; electrical plant installation and manage-
ment; mechanical plant installation and maintenance; construction organi-
zation and management; and factory organization and management.

A summary of the project cost by types of expenditure is given in Table 4.2.
4.02      Base cost estimates refer to December 1978 prices, including a 10%
cost increase adjustment for 1979. Construction costs were estimated on the
basis of functional and economical accommodation schedules, preliminary sketch
plans and recent bidding experience. Site development costs were estimated at
/1  The project was appraised and negotiated before the November 15, 1978,
devaluation of the rupiah from Rp 415 to Rp 625 to the US dollar.  The
figures contained in this report are based on the exchange rate prevailing
at negotiations (US$1 = Rp 415). A preliminary assessment of the impact
of the devaluation on the local costs of the project (including contin-
gencies) indicate that they would rise when expressed in rupiah terms
from Rp 23 billion to Rp 31 billion, and fall in dollar terms from
$55 million to $50 million. The foreign exchange component would remain
unchanged in dollar terms, at $49 million. On this basis the proposed
credit would cover 52% of the total cost of the project.

15-35% of construction costs (depending on availability of services, acces-
sibility of sites and landfill requirement); professional services at 8% of
the cost of civil works (construction and site development). Regional cost
adjustments were applied to the cost of civil works. Furniture and equipment
estimates were based on preliminary lists which are considered reasonable.
The technical assistance program was costed as follows: US$12,000/man-year
for fellowships for overseas training, US$80,000 to $90,000/ man-year for
expatriate specialist services; and Rp 2.5 million/man-year for local spe-
cialists. Incremental operating costs were calculated for the period 1979-84.
They include costs attributable to the project for development of the TEDC and
the ADCs; in-service training for (polytechnic) staff; materials development,
production and distribution; and program evaluation. They further include net
incremental salaries of polytechnic teaching staff (a portion of which repre-
sents a years' preservice training to be undertaken by all such staff). No
disbursements would be made from the Credit against incremental operating
costs.

4.03      Utilization factors for the project polytechnics would average 75%
based on 40 teaching periods per week. Unit building costs would amount to
about US$220/sq m for school buildings, which is in line with building costs
in the region (Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand). The capital cost per
student place at a typical polytechnic would amount to US$7,400, comprising
US$5,000 for civil works, US$300 for furniture and US$2,600 for equipment,
books and materials. The per student cost is roughly equivalent to that for
a similar Malaysian institution (at about US$4,150 in 1973 prices) under
Loan 974-MA of 1974.
4.04      The foreign exchange component of US$49.2 million was estimated as
follows: civil works, 35%; professional services, 20%; furniture, 35%;
equipment, 85%; technical assistance and studies, 90%; and incremental opera-
tion costs, 15%. These percentages were derived by: (a) estimating the costs
of civil works and locally manufactured furniture and equipment attributable
to materials, labor, overhead, taxes and profit; (b) analyzing the c.i.f. cost
of imported furniture and equipment, inland transportation and insurance, and
the delivery and installation of furniture and equipment; and (c) estimating
the costs of expatriate and local expert services to be provided.
4.05      The contingency allowance of US$24.0 million includes (a) physical
contingencies estimated at 10%, and (b) price contingencies averaging 20% of
the base cost. Price contingencies were calculated on the basis of the
implementation schedule (Annex 3) and expected annual price increases between
1979 and 1985, as follows:

4.06      Taxes amount to about 8% of the total project cost including
contingencies. Project items imported by the project management authority
would be exempt from customs duties and taxes.
Financing
4.07      The proposed credit of US$49.0 million would finance 100% of the
foreign exchange cost, equivalent to 47% of the total project cost. The
Government would finance the remaining 53%. At full operating capacity,
programs at the project institutions would require recurrent expenditures of
US$5.1 million equivalent (1977 prices) which represents an increase of 1%
over recurrent public education expenditures in 1977.

Implementation
4.08       Management.   The project would be implemented by the Directorate
General for Higher Education in the DEC. A Unit for Management of Diploma
Programs within the Directorate has been established under a decree by the
DGHE and would serve as the project management authority. The Minister of
Education and Culture has appointed a member of the Unit as Project Director
with broad responsibility and authority to implement the project. For purposes
of implementation, a procurement officer and architect and subunits to manage
associated studies and the accounting component of the project would be
attached to this office (Chart 4.1). During the period of project implementa-
tion, directors of the TEDC and the polytechnics would be directly responsible
to the member of the Unit for Management of Diploma Programs who has been
appointed project director.

4.09      Procurement Unit.  Because of past inefficiencies in procurement
for education projects, the Government attaches priority to creating a
permanent corps with expertise in this area. A central advisory procurement
service unit would therefore be established under the project. The unit
would be temporarily attached to the project management authority, and
after a trial period the unit would be given permanent status within the DEC.
This unit would pool expertise in civil works and procurement of equipment and
furniture from various directorates general for execution of the project. The
unit would be provided technical assistance for local training of procurement
officers assigned to ongoing Bank Group-assisted education projects and for
preparing procurement manuals. During negotiations the Government provided
assurances that it would establish by June 30, 1980 a central advisory procure-
ment service unit with staffing arrangements satisfactory to the Association.
4.10      Professional Services.  Professional services required for civil
works and procurement of furniture under the project would be provided by a
consortium of two or three consultant architects firms. Eight local qualified
firms have been short listed; final selection would be made on the basis of
proposals made by these firms. Preparation of site and sketch plans has
been completed for four polytechnics and is to be completed for the remaining
two polytechnics and the TEDC by January 31, 1979. The project also includes
financing (US$1.4 million equivalent) for professional services required to
prepare future education projects (para. 3.36).
4.11      Sites.  Lands for all project polytechnics except that in Bandung have
already been acquired. The site for the Bandung Polytechnic has been identified
and an agreement in principle for its purchase has been reached with its owners
or their representatives. During negotiations the Government indicated that
funds would be released to complete the transaction by December 31, 1978.
4.12      Implementation Schedule.  Civil works would be carried out in three
phases. Project construction would start in December 1979 and be completed
in 1982. Procurement of furniture and equipment would start around 1980 and
be completed in 1982.
4.13      The Government has made substantial progress in an effort to
expedite detailed project preparation. Under the cooperative agreement with
the Swiss Contact Agency, financed by the Swiss Government in the amount of
US$100,000, work has progressed on details of polytechnic curriculum outlines,
master equipment lists, equipment specifications and bidding documents.
Swiss Contact submitted a report in this regard on October 15, 1978. Sites
have been acquired for five polytechnics, and acquisition of the remaining
site is to be completed by December 31, 1978. Architectural sketch and site
plans have been completed for four polytechnics. A decree outlining the
framework of the project organizational structure has been issued and a
project director has been appointed. Based on this organizational framework
the Director General for Higher Education plans to issue in early 1979
separate decrees to establish administrative subunits for accountancy,
procurement, associated studies and civil works; and authorize the organiza-
tional structure of the technician education development center, the four
accountancy development centers and the six polytechnics. During

negotiations the Government and the Association agreed that the schedule to
issue the decrees in January 1979 is appropriate and that key staff to the
project management authority would be appointed as follows:

During negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would
maintain the project management authority, the technician education develop-
ment center, the six polytechnics and the four accountancy development
centers during execution of the project and keep them staffed with qualified
persons. A condition of effectiveness for the credit would be to sign
contracts for professional (architectural) and technical assistance
services required for all polytechnics.
4.14      Procurement.  To the extent practicable civil works and procure-
ment of furniture and equipment including vehicles would be grouped to form
attractive bid packages.  Contracts for civil works above US$500,000 would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines for procurement. In bid evaluation local contractors
would be given a domestic preference of 7.5%./1 Contracts below US$500,000
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
/1 The domestic preference of 7.5% is based on a GNP per capita of US$240
in 1976. Since the project was discussed and appraised with the Government
before June 1978 when new guidelines for eligibility for domestic
preference were issued, Indonesia's eligibility for the preference is
continued in this project.



- 46 -
following procedures acceptable to IDA and subject to an aggregate amount of
US$6.0 million. Prior IDA review would be required with respect to contract
awards for civil works estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or more.
4.15      Equipment, vehicle and furniture packages over US$50,000 equivalent
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accor-
dance with Bank Group guidelines. In bid comparison, local manufacturers would
be allowed a preferential margin of 15% on the c.i.f. cost of equipment or
the customs duty, whichever is lower. Equipment, excluding vehicles, and
furniture that cannot be grouped to form packages of US$50,000 equivalent or
more would be awarded without prior IDA review on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally under procedures satisfactory to IDA, subject to
an aggregate amount of US$3.0 million. Miscellaneous items, in packages each
costing less than US$10,000 equivalent and subject to an aggregate total not
exceeding US$1.5 million equivalent, could be purchased through prudent local
shopping on the basis of at least three price quotations and a maximum of
nine vehicles could be purchased through prudent local shopping on the basis
of a minimum of three price quotations. Instructional materials and books
produced outside Indonesia would be procured through international shopping,
also on the basis of a minimum of three price quotations. Books produced
locally would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally under procedures acceptable to IDA or, where appropriate, from
publishers after negotiations for bulk purchases. During negotiations an
understanding was reached between the Government and the Association that if
existing restrictions on vehicle imports are not waived to allow international
competitive bidding, the vehicles (excepting those needed for the start-up
period) would be financed by the Government. During negotiations the Govern-
ment provided assurances that it would submit to the Association for comment
by December 31, 1980, and thereafter implement, an equipment maintenance and
inventory control system.
Disbursements
4.16      The proposed credit of US$49.0 million equivalent would be disbursed
over a period of six years as shown in Table 4.4.
4.17      Disbursements would be made on the basis of:
(a)  35% of the cost of civil works;
(b)  100% of the cost of professional services;
(c)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported furniture, materials and
equipment, 95% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
furniture, materials and equipment, 65% of the cost of imported
furniture, materials and equipment procured locally and 40% of the
cost of locally procured vehicles; and
(d) 100% of the cost of fellowships and expert services.
To the extent practicable, withdrawal applications would be aggregated in
amounts of US$50,000 or more prior to submission to IDA for reimbursement
out of the proceeds of the proposed credit. It is recommended that the



- 47 -
Association provide retroactive financing for up to US$200,000 of the
technical assistance costs incurred after July 1, 1978 for finalization of
sketch and site plans, master equipment lists, and specifications and
bidding documents. Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30,
1985. During negotiations the Government and the Association agreed on
procedures for an annual audit of project expenditures.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      Higher education in Indonesia is characterized by poor average
quality, a high degree of inefficiency and underfinancing. The training
provided is biased towards the social sciences and degree level programs;
systematic planning for alleviation of technical manpower constraints, in
particular at the diploma level, has not yet been undertaken. The proposed
project would address these weaknesses. It would introduce a new system of
technician training; improve the quality of accountancy training and practice;
and assist the DGHE to systematically expand collection and analysis of data
related to higher education.
5.02      Benefits.  The main benefits expected from the technician training
component would be improved quality and expanded output of engineering techni-
cians. These would be achieved through establishment of an effective system
for managing and developing technician training and through provision of the
six polytechnics. At full operating capacity, annual output from the



- 48 -
polytechnics, at about 1,330 graduates, would constitute a 45% increase over
present levels of output from technician training programs and would meet about
12% of estimated annual requirements for trained technicians between 1986 and
1990 (para. 1.08). Part of the deficit would be met through a combination of
output from existing technician training institutions and in-service programs
and the rest through upgrading of skilled workers through on-the-job experience.
Further expansion of institutions could be undertaken to balance supply and
demand of trained technicians after the polytechnic system introduced through
the project has been fully established. In addition, policies and programs
developed by the Unit for Management of Diploma Programs would have an impact
on the quality and efficiency of other public and private diploma level
training institutions. The accountancy component would assist the Government
to strengthen the quality of accountancy training and practice in the public
and private sectors through development of teaching staff and improved
courses and materials. It would further pave the way for expansion of
accountancy training in accordance with economic requirements. On an annual
basis each of the three university accountancy development centers would
provide upgrading for nearly 500 accountancy instructors and practitioners.
About 800 (nearly 40% of total) Government accountants and budget officers
would receive upgrading at the STAN center each year. Their participation in
courses on modern Government auditing procedures would contribute to improving
Government financial management, planning and decision-making. The associated
studies would assist the Government in rationalizing development of the
higher education subsector and in modernizing its accounting and auditing
system.
5.03      Risks.  Achievement of anticipated benefits would depend largely
on recruitment and training of teaching staff. There is a risk that adequate
numbers of qualified staff could not be readily recruited to run the polytech-
nics on a full-time basis. Recognizing that it would be necessary to recruit
some initially underqualified staff, the project would provide intensive
preservice training and in-service support for polytechnic teachers. To
facilitate implementation of preservice training, bursaries would be used to
permit early recruitment of appropriate numbers of staff. In addition, a
policy to encourage employment of experienced part-time staff would be
pursued. A related concern is that the polytechnics, located within univer-
sities, could be relegated to second class status within the more academic
environment of the university. The structure and organization of the
polytechnics have, however, been designed to allow for semi-independence
from the universities. Further support would be provided by the Unit for
Management of Diploma Programs through its responsibility for setting
standards and procedures for the development of technician training, and by
the TEDC through its responsibility to develop relevant instructional
materials and train polytechnic instructors. More generally, the monitoring
system built into all project components should serve to highlight deviations
from project objectives during initial operations and to provide the basis
for possible corrective action.

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      During negotiations the Government and the Association agreed on:
(a) schedules for staff appointment and training (paras. 3.15 and 4.13);
(b) procedures and criteria for award of fellowships (para. 3.32); (c) a
schedule for establishment of relevant organizational structures (para. 4.13);
and (d) annual audit procedures (para. 4.17).
6.02      During negotiations the Government provided assurances on:
(a) timely establishment of industrial advisory boards for project insti-
tutions (para. 3.07); (b) evaluation of technician training (para. 3.20);
(c) development of training, materials and research programs at accountancy
training centers (para. 3.29); (d) staffing and maintenance of project
organizations (para. 4.13); and (e) a system for maintenance of control of
equipment (para. 4.15).
6.03      A condition of effectiveness of the credit would be to sign contracts
for professional (architectural) services for all polytechnics and technical
assistance for the polytechnic programs (para. 4.13).
6.04      It is recommended that the Association provide retroactive financing
for up to US$200,000 of the technical assistance costs incurred after July 1,
1978 for preparation of project components.
6.05      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$49.0 million equivalent to the Republic
of Indonesia for a term of 50 years, including a 10-year grace period.
