                         Effectiveness deadline is now Dec. 15, 2012.

                         Between January and September 2012, the task team carried out a series of missions to Chad and CAR. The main outcomes of these missions are: (i) the signature of the Financing
                         Agreements for the Chad Project in N’Djamena on April 13, 2012; (ii) the signature of the Financing Agreements for the CAR Project in Washington DC on April 18, 2012; and (iii) the

                         signature of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the governments of Chad and CAR.

                         In spite of positive outcomes mentioned above, on May 22, 2012, the Chad Government officially disclosed the SITCOM transaction (a contract between the public operator and the
                         private company SITCOM, to outsource the management of some segments of the optic backbone to SITCOM) documentation to the Bank. A legal analysis conducted by the

                         transaction adviser (consultant hired by the project) showed that some key features of the SITCOM transaction are contradictory to the essence and design of the CAB project as
                         reflected in the signed FAs and MOU. In essence, the SITCOM transaction would jeopardize the integrity of the CAB concept: a seamless regional network, specifically in terms of
                         elements such as interconnection, security, pricing, and quality of service.

                         Following management recommendations pertaining to the conclusions of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the government of Chad (GoC) and SITCOM TCHAD
                         dated June 22, 2012, the Bank sent a letter to the government of Chad on July 5, 2012 sharing concerns about the incompatibility of the SITCOM transaction with the Project design
                         and the aforementioned Financing Agreements. In the letter, the Bank requested that Chad communicate to the Bank its formal position regarding the MOU not later than July 20,
                         2012.

                         Thereafter, missions to Chad and CAR were carried out during the summer (July 23-29 and July 29-August 9), to follow-up on the letter dated July 5, 2012, and to work with the GoC
                         on the current effectiveness deadline and discuss the SITCOM issue. The task team made it clear that, in order to restore the viability of the Project, the GoC had to formally
                         renounce, withdraw, and/or modify relevant elements of the SITCOM transaction no later than August 29, 2012. The task team also engaged with the CAR government and explore
                         a possible “Plan B? in case the Chad operation fell through.

                         Following Chad’s letter of October 5, 2012 informing the Bank about their intention to cancel the SITCOM deal, and to give its assets and functions to the incumbent operator, the
                         Bank decided to grant an additional extension of the effectiveness date of the CAB1B Financing Agreement for Chad from Oct. 10 until Dec. 15, 2012. This two month period was
                         intended to be used by Chad to unwind the SITCOM deal and to meet the effectiveness conditions.

                         Following CAR’s letter of October an extension of the FA effectiveness deadline was also requested by and granted to CAR until December 15. During the Annual Meetings, the
                         Bank’s senior management conveyed to Chad’s Ministers of Planning and Finance that the Bank expected the FA to become effective by the new deadline.

                         The task team is currently assisting both countries in their efforts to meet this tight deadline. Meanwhile, and in agreement with CAR and AfDB (and following Bank management’s
                         recommendation), the Bank team is discussing options for an alternativeCAB1B project, involving only CAR and proposing a new cable routing through South Sudan and/or DRC.
