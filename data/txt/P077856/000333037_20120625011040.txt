       INDIA — LUCKNOW MUZAFFARPUR NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT
                         (LOAN NO. 4764-IN)

                                     Restructuring Paper


1.     The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has endorsed a request submitted by
the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to re-allocate loan amounts to various
loan categories for India Lucknow Muzaffarpur National Highway Project (Loan No-
4764-IN).

2.     This request was in response to various discussions held with the NHAI during
recent missions.

3.      This will be second restructuring of the project. The project was earlier
restructured in May 2010. The restructuring involved removing the activities covered by
the four poorly performing works contracts (comprising 155 km out of 483 km of roads
originally financed) from the project description and include additional activities which
are; introduction of a new Safer-Greener Highways Pilot (55 Km); strengthening of the
Road Safety Cell (RSC) and; Implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system. The original Project Development Objective “road users to benefit from
an improved journey between Lucknow and Muzaffarpur? was therefore modified to “To
improve the journey on NH-28 between Lucknow and the Uttar Pradesh/Bihar Border,
and to support NHAI in improving safety and sustainability of the project corridor.? The
outcome indicators (travel time and cost savings) were also revised accordingly.

4.      The current status of the project is as follows:
            Key Project Data                             Project Performance
 Loan Amount: US$620 million                   Summary Ratings            Last         Now
 Board Approval: Dec 21, 2004
 Effectiveness Date: Dec 28 , 2005             Development Objective       MS           MS
 Project age: 137 Months                       Implementation Progress     MS           MS
 Project Restructuring Approved: May 4, 2010
 Closing Date: June 30, 2012                   Risk Flags: M&E, Legal Covenant and Social
 Disbursed: US$607.45 million (98%)            Safeguards (for RAP evaluation)

5.       Although there have been delays of about three years civil works, on 8 contracts
are now substantial complete and the project is likely to achieve the current Project
Development Objective. NHAI has also made considerable efforts on safety and
sustainability aspects. The policy framework for undertaking maintenance of the corridor
is in place but since the maintenance contracts are still to be awarded and the construction
of the safer-greener pilot will not be completed before the loan closing, the rating of
achieving current development objective is maintained at “Moderately Satisfactory? by
last mission. The consultant to monitor the indicators at the EOP is in advance stage of
selection.

6.    The preparation of the Safer-Greener pilot is ongoing but since the construction
work would not be completed before the current loan closing date of June 30, 2012 and


                                                3
the amount allocated to this component would be transferred to 8 civil contracts, it is
proposed to withdraw Bank’s support to this component.

7.      The preparation of bidding documents for ERP is ongoing and the Bank is
partially funding this activity under the ongoing Technical Assistance Project. However,
since the allocated amount to ERP under this loan would not be utilized and proposed
reallocation would transfer this amount to civil works category; it is proposed to
withdraw Bank’s support to this component under this loan.

Development Objectives and Progress towards Achievement of PDOs

         Although there have been delays of about three years, but considering the current
overall progress and substantial completion of four-laning of 8 contracts, the project is
very likely to achieve the PDO. NHAI has also made considerable efforts on safety and
sustainability aspects. The policy framework for undertaking maintenance of the corridor
is in place but since the maintenance contracts are still to be awarded and the construction
of the safer-greener pilot will not be completed before the loan closing, the rating of
achieving development objective is maintained at “Moderately Satisfactory?. The
consultant to monitor the indicators at the EOP is in advance stage of selection.
Overall Implementation Status

9.      Civil works on all eight packages are now substantially complete. The
preparation work on the Safer-Greener pilot and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
has also been advanced but since the loan is closing on June 30, 2012, these activities will
not be completed by the loan closing date. The ERP, would be, however, funded under
the ongoing NHAI Technical Assistance Project.

The proposed Restructuring

Reallocation of loan/credit proceed

10.    Due to delays in procurement, funds allocated to safer-greener highway
construction and ERP implementation would not be utilized. The NHAI therefore have
proposed to allocate these funds to civil works category. Following reallocation is
proposed:
            Loan Categories              Current Allocation (US$)   Proposed Allocation (US$)
1. Civil works                                570,000,000.00                587,677,448.19
2a. Consultants’ services                      35,900,000.00                 19,658,248.61
2b. NGO-provided services and training           1,000,000.00                   767,421.07
3. R&R assistance packages                     10,000,000.00                  8,796,882.13
4. Fee                                           3,100,000.00                 3,100,000.00
5. Un-allocated                                           0.00                        0.00
                                              620,000,000.00                620,000,000.00

11.    The intention of GOI for this proposal is to facilitate full utilization of the loan
amount by the current loan closing date of June 30, 2012. The GOI has not sought any
additional loan amount for the above project.

Removal of Safer-Greener Highway Pilot from Project Description
                                               4
12.    The preparation of the pilot (detailed design) is ongoing but since the construction
work would not be completed before the current loan closing and the amount allocated to
this component would be utilized for 8 contracts, it is proposed to withdraw Bank’s
support to this component.

Removal of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) from Project Description

13.     The preparation of bidding documents for ERP is ongoing and the Bank is
partially funding this activity under the ongoing Technical Assistance Project. However,
since the allocated amount to ERP under this loan would not be utilized and proposed
reallocation would transfer this amount to civil works category, it is proposed to
withdraw Bank’s support to this component under this loan.

Rationale

14.     The proposed restructuring, changes and reallocation of loan proceeds, is intended
to fully utilize the loan amount and to do not affect the Project Development Objectives,
which is likely to be achieved.

Recommendation

15.    The task team recommends that the Bank agrees with the proposed restructuring
which is a Level II structuring to be approved by the Country Director..
