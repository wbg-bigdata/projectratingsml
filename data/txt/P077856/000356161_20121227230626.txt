F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is for road users to benefit from an improved journey
between Lucknow and Muzaffarpur.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
To improve the journey on NH-28 between Lucknow and the Uttar Pradesh/Bihar
Border, and to support NHAI in improving safety and sustainability of the project
corridor.

Note: In PAD & Restructuring Paper, absolute target values of PDO indicators didn't
match % reductions envisaged in PAD and appeared to be even more challenging.
Hence, % reduction targets are used for comparison for consistency. For further details,
please see Annex 10 of ICR.

1.    Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal
1.      The National Highway sub-system plays a critical role in India’s transport
networks. This arterial road system represents less than two percent of the total road
length in the country but carries over 40% of the road traffic. In the decade leading up to
the appraisal of the Lucknow-Muzaffarpur National Highway Project (LMNHP), the
national highway sub-sector witnessed some significant changes including increased
outlays. In 1998, Government of India (GoI) launched the National Highways
Development Project (NHDP) – a flagship program to alleviate congestion, slow speeds,
high vehicle operating costs and poor safety, through a combination of higher investment
and better management. NHDP ushered in a variety of new institutional, financing and
contracting practices (for more details, see Annex 12). As of end-2004, under the aegis of
NHDP, more than 3,200 km of National Highways were already upgraded and work was
in progress on upgradation of an additional 3,700 km; nearly 800 km of these roads were
contracted through the BOT approach. 1
2.      The World Bank recognized the strategic significance of NHDP right from its
inception and started supporting it through lending operations prepared and approved in
quick succession, viz., Third National Highway Project (TNHP, USD516 million, June
2000), Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project (GTRIP, USD589 million, June 2001),
and Allahabad Bypass Project (ABP, USD240 million, September 2003). LMNHP, the
fourth operation in this series, was approved in December 2004 with a loan amount of
USD 620 million.
3.      The four Bank-financed projects, with a combined loan amount of nearly USD 2
billion, had similar project development objectives and implementation procedures. The
principal thrust of all the four lending operations was to support upgrading of selected
national highways (covering a combined length of 1,463 km) through the traditional,
BoQ-type contracts. The first three projects – namely, TNHP, GTRIP and ABP – also
included some technical assistance to support capacity building and/or institutional
strengthening elements such as, for example, corridor management, road safety works,
road asset management, Public Private Partnership (PPP), corporate plan and training. 2
4.      Rationale for Bank Involvement: At a macro level, LMNHP was consistent with
the GoI’s major policy goals for the transport sector enunciated in the Tenth Plan (2002-
07), 3 and the then Bank Group’s Country Strategy for India, wherein highway

2
  For example, while TNHP and GTRIP broadly sought to focus on aspects related to road safety and
computerized road information/asset inventory systems, ABP envisaged support to undertaking
independent and periodic surveys of road users and road sector stakeholders to determine the level of their
awareness, involvement and satisfaction with the delivery, management and operation of national highways
by NHAI. GTRIP also included some support for a Public Private Partnership (PPP) concession.
3
  These goals included: (i) meeting the transport demand generated by a higher rate of GDP growth; (ii)
ensuring transport development is balanced, with special attention to remote regions such as the North-


                                                    1
bottlenecks were identified as one of the major constraints to poverty reduction and
private sector-led growth.
1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.      The project development objective was for road users to benefit from an improved
journey between Lucknow and Muzaffarpur (483 km). The performance indicators and
targets to measure the achievement of this development objective by the end of project,
were: 4
•       vehicle travel time along the project road reduced by at least 20 per cent;
•       truck operating costs along the project road reduced by at least 10 per cent;
•       number of fatal road accidents along the project road reduced by 10 per cent; and
•       user satisfaction with national highways in the region improved.
1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification:
6.      First Restructuring: In May 2010, the Board approved the restructuring of the
project to: (i) remove four poorly performing contracts (in the state of Bihar); (ii) address
deterioration of safety in the construction zones; and (iii) overcome shortcomings in the
existing financial accounting and reporting systems. As part of this, the PDO was revised:
“To improve the journey on NH-28 between Lucknow and the Uttar Pradesh (UP)-Bihar
Border, and to support National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in improving
safety and sustainability of the project corridor.?
7.      Changes to Indicators: The three original key indicators and corresponding
targets to measure the PDO – namely, travel time, vehicle operating costs and fatal
accidents - were revised in line with the reduced length of the project corridor. 5 Also, the
scope of one of these indicators (no. 3 – number of fatal accidents along the project road)
was modified to include fatal accidents during construction and operation. The fourth
PDO indicator from the original set – that is, improvement of the user satisfaction with
national highways in the region – was dropped. In addition, the following indicators were
included to measure the intermediate outcomes of the three activities added during
restructuring:


East; (iii) capacity augmentation, quality and productivity improvements through technology upgrading;
and (iv) greater emphasis on safety, energy efficiency, environmental conservation and managing social
impacts.
4
  For various key indicators, the PAD indicated the targets in terms of absolute numbers as well as
percentage reductions vis-à-vis baseline data. These two sets were not matching and the absolute numbers
appeared to be relatively higher and even more challenging. Hence, the ICR team relied on the
“percentage-reduction? targets envisaged in PAD.
5
  Here too, for reductions in travel time, VoCs and accidents, the restructuring paper used the absolute
target numbers from PAD, modified to reflect the removed packages. In order to maintain consistency, the
ICR team relied on the “percentage-reduction? targets. Also, as the length of the third homogenous section
changed on account of limiting the project corridor up to UP/Bihar border and addition of new Gorakhpur
bypass, the baselines and targets were adjusted on a pro-rata basis to make the final achievements
comparable. For the convenience of the ICR reader, all the relevant data is tabulated and placed in Annex
10.


                                                    2
•      Safer-Greener Pilot Highway Pilot: (i) Ex-post stakeholder satisfaction survey
       shows significant increase in satisfaction; and (ii) Fatal accidents reduced on pilot
       corridor;
•      Fiduciary Controls: (i) No overdue actions on audit reports except for policies
       outside NHAI domain; (ii) Accounts error-free; and (iii) Enterprise-wide
       Resource Planning (ERP) operational in NHAI.
•      Strengthen Road Safety Cell to enhance safety of designs, construction practices
       and network operations including empowerment to enforce safety aspects:
       Reduction in fatal accidents on project corridor sites and completed project
       corridor, with no baseline or separate targets.
8.      Second Restructuring: In mid-June 2012, just before the loan closing, the project
was restructured again but with no changes to PDO. The restructuring essentially gave
effect to cancellation of two poorly performing components – Safer-Greener Highway
Pilot and Implementation of a new ERP system – and reallocation of the funds budgeted
for them (USD 20mn) to the Highway Upgrading component.
1.4    Main Beneficiaries
9.      The main beneficiaries of the project are the users of the road corridor from
Lucknow to Muzaffarpur (Lucknow-Uttar Pradesh/Bihar border, as per the revised PDO),
which passes through some of the poorest districts of UP and forms part of the national
trunk road linking the remote, less developed north-eastern states of India. In addition to
providing direct primary benefits of reduced travel times and costs to the corridor users
(of whom about 65 percent are commercial), the investment operation was expected to
have significant secondary effects on poverty alleviation and the socio-economic well-
being of the population in the adjoining rural areas.
1.5    Original Components (as approved)
10.     Highway Upgrading (USD 802.87 million, including contingencies): This
component was aimed at removing the capacity constraints on the NH network by
providing for the upgrading to 4-lane divided carriageway standard of 483 km out of the
total 513 km continuous stretch of NH 28 between Lucknow and Muzaffarpur. The
Lucknow to Muzaffarpur stretch of the EW corridor was envisaged to be divided into five
homogenous sections: (i) Lucknow-Ayodhya (126 km); (ii) Ayodhya-Gorakhpur (117
km); (iii) Gorakhpur-Gopalganj (106 km); (iv) Gopalganj-Muzaffarpur (134 km), and (v)
Gorakhpur Bypass (30 km). For road sections (i) to (iv) inclusive, the project was to
finance:
•      upgrading of the 483 km section of the NH-28 highway to a four lane standard
       and associated environmental management actions procured in twelve packages
       through International Competitive Bidding (Activity cost: USD 709.28 mn);
•      construction supervision by four teams of internationally recruited consultants
       (USD 24.36 mn);
•      delivery of entitlements under a Resettlement Action Plan to project affected
       people; and




                                            3
•          ancillary activities such as afforestation, cement concrete pavements performance
           study and monitoring and evaluation activities as well as road safety and
           HIV/AIDS awareness programs. 6
11.     It was decided that the construction of the Gorakhpur Bypass would be financed
by the NHAI itself, since it was a Greenfield project and was considered to be different
from the remaining four sections in terms of (higher) unit costs, implementation
timeframe and options for financing. However, considering that this Bypass was to form
an integral part of the Lucknow-Muzaffarpur corridor, it was agreed that the preparation
and implementation of environmental and social safeguard management of this link
would be identical to that of the Bank-financed sections.
1.6        Revised Components
12.     The project components were revised twice, in line with the project restructuring
carried out respectively in May 2010 and June 2012.
13.    First Revision: As part of the restructuring approved in May 2010, the loan
closing date was extended by two years, to June 2012, and the scope of project design
was expanded to include three new activities as detailed below:
      i.   Highway Upgrading (USD 785.39mn): Following the removal of all activities that
           were covered under the four poorly performing contracts, the scope of this
           component was reduced by about 32%, that is, the length of the highway to be
           converted to 4-lane dual carriageway standard under the project was reduced from
           the original 483 km to 328 km (from Lucknow up to the UP-Bihar border).
    ii.    The Safer-Greener Highways Pilot (USD 26mn) to retrofit 55 km of the existing
           six-lane Delhi-Panipat section of NH-1, the country’s most heavily trafficked
           highway, with enhanced safety and environmental measures as a pilot for a
           broader program to improve the safety and user friendliness of the NH network.
    iii.   Strengthening the Road Safety Cell (USD 2.75mn) to enhance safety of designs,
           construction practices and network operations including empowerment to enforce
           safety aspects.
    iv.    Implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system (USD
           34mn): This activity was expected to strengthen fiduciary controls through
           enhanced management systems and accounting based on business principles.
14.     Second Revision: In the second restructuring carried out in June 2012, the Safer-
Greener Highways Pilot and the Implementation of a new ERP system were removed as
their procurement itself witnessed significant delays.




6
   The breakup of budgeted costs of various activities: (i) Land Acquisition, R&R implementation,
additional environmental enhancements not related to the road itself and utility relocation (USD 60.03 mn);
(ii) awareness campaigns for road safety and HIV/AIDS (USD 0.50mn); (iii) services to support
improvement to the NHAI management information system including on cement concrete pavements
performance, road users’ satisfaction survey at the end of the project and RAP impact assessment (USD
0.75mn); and (vi) NHAI incremental operating costs (USD 7.95mn) to be financed by NHAI.


                                                    4
1.7    Other significant changes
15.    Some of the other notable changes in the project design in the wake of the May
2010 restructuring are detailed below.
16.      NHAI TA Project: At the behest of GoI, the Bank prepared a separate Technical
Assistance (TA) project with NHAI to support the latter in undertaking various
institutional reforms including addressing critical recommendations of the inter-
ministerial committee report on strengthening NHAI. The USD 45 million TA (loan)
project – covering a wide range of areas including contract management, governance,
safety, design quality, performance monitoring of contractors/concessionaires and
consultants, and new contracting approaches - was approved in November 2010.
17.     Governance and Accountability Action Plan: The restructuring also brought the
project under the purview of the “Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and
Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants, 2006?, and
accordingly, a Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) was prepared in
agreement with NHAI and GoI and included in the project design.
2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
18.     Soundness of the background analysis: The situation analysis conducted at the
time of appraisal rightly highlighted the merit in supporting NHDP as it was a program of
strategic significance from the transport sector perspective and also widely regarded as
one of the foundations for the country’s economic growth. Even during the CAS period at
the completion of the project, NHDP continues to be an important strategic priority for
the government as well as the sector.
19.     The PDO of improvement of civil works (over a 483 km corridor) and the focus
of the chosen indicators on improving road services - through reduction in travel time,
vehicle operating costs and accidents – was broadly in line with the Bank’s previous
engagements in support of NHDP. The corridor itself, being a part of the East-West
Corridor of the NHDP, is an important link for improving connectivity for the lagging
states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and the North-Eastern Region of the country.
20.      A notable shortcoming in the PDO, however, is the lack of attention to any
institutional challenges involved in effective implementation of NHDP. To be fair, the
appraisal team recognized the importance of these challenges but took a view that: (i)
these challenges were being addressed through the ongoing and planned technical
assistance under the three previous Bank-financed projects; and (ii) NHAI is already
managing a large number of technical assistance activities funded by both the Bank and
other multilaterals. The ongoing and planned technical assistance with the Bank’s
assistance, however, was limited to areas such as road information system, corridor
management pilots, corporate plan and human resource management. To that extent, it
was either insufficient or had long gestation period to have direct, meaningful bearing on
NHAI’s abilities to address the most proximate challenges in implementing LMNHP,

                                            5
viz., inadequate field level staffing with little or no empowerment, paucity of resources
and procedures to ensure effective review of designs. 7 As it turned out, even these TA
activities were either dropped or substantially pruned during implementation of the
respective projects.
21.      Assessment of the Project Design: The project design with a single component of
Highway Upgrading appears to be adequate for the given PDO. Within this component,
the project design had drawn upon several lessons from earlier operations especially
w.r.t. procurement, social and environmental aspects, viz., (i) rationalization of contract
package sizes to increase competition and diversify the risk of poor contractor
performance and difficult site conditions in the states of UP and Bihar; (ii) stricter pre-
qualification criteria for contractors, especially for screening Joint Ventures (JVs); (iii)
efforts for early mobilization of supervision consultants; (iv) utilization of Non-
Government Organizations (NGOs) for Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) implementation;
and (v) stronger integration of HIV/AIDS concerns with exclusive budget and timelines.
It also envisaged some support for: (i) cement concrete pavement performance study; (ii)
road safety awareness campaigns; and (iii) studies for user satisfaction and Resettlement
and Rehabilitation (R&R) impact assessment.
22.     The project design sought to follow the BoQ mode through public funding –
which, reportedly, was the preference of NHAI – with no apparent attempt to explore or
analyze alternative contracting approaches. For example, at the time of appraisal, the
then emerging trend of private participation in NHDP was noted but only from the
narrow lens of public-vs.-private financing. Such a view was apparently influenced by the
Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) sector review (2001), which concluded
that the Bank should focus on highways, especially the interstate system, and that while
efforts should be made to encourage private funding, a substantial public funding
program was justified. Yet, the project could have benefited with a better recognition of
the significance of the private participation trend, i.e., its potential for harnessing
investment and operational efficiencies through clubbing of construction and
maintenance responsibilities over a long time period and for mobilization of additional
funds through user charges.
23.     Adequacy of Government Commitment: Both GoI and NHAI exhibited adequate
commitment throughout the preparation stage. Following the Bank guidelines, the
implementing agency had put in place the safeguard management plans with participatory
processes and suggested institutional arrangements at the field and headquarter (HQ)
levels.
24.    Assessment of Risks: The task team identified nine risks to achievement of the
PDO (three risks) and outputs (six risks). Two other important risks – related to
sustainability of project assets through ex-post maintenance and inadequate staffing –
were rated “modest? based on the expectation of actions anticipated from the ongoing


7
  For instance, the ICRs of both GTRIP and TNHP highlighted that (i) the implementation framework did
not give sufficient attention to monitoring the staffing and training needs of NHAI to fulfill its mandate;
and (ii) the two-year timeline in the PAD’s action plan for NHAI’s transformation was unrealistic.


                                                    6
technical assistance activities under the preceding projects. The subsequent developments
during the implementation suggest that: (i) the risks pertaining to tree cutting, utility
shifting, unsatisfactory contractor performance, construction delays, quality problems,
law & order etc. were correctly reflected as “Substantial?; and (ii) the risks related to
engineering designs/estimates and inadequate cooperation from the state governments in
expediting land acquisition were not recognized.
2.2     Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)
25.      The project implementation period could be broadly divided into three phases,
viz. (i) the initial 3-4 year period of substantial delays; (ii) 1-2 year time taken to address
these challenges through restructuring; and (iii) the remaining 2-3 year period wherein
the (reduced) length of project corridor was made operational.
First (problematic) phase
26.    Problems and challenges in project implementation: In the initial 3-4 years of
implementation, several problems and challenges faced by the project – and their
underlying causes – are summarized below:
•       Delay in Procurement of Civil Works: The first round of bids received in
        December 2004 for the 12 civil works contracts turned out to be 45-90% more
        than the original estimates and, hence, NHAI decided to opt for rebidding them.8
        The project lost nearly one year before all the packages were awarded through the
        second round of bidding;
•       Poor Design Surveys and Estimates for all the 12 packages resulted in quantity
        and cost variations. For instance, prior to the second round of bidding, the
        estimates for various packages were revised up to 20% because the original
        estimates were found to have been based on obsolete Schedule(s) of Rates;
•       Prolonged delays in pre-construction activities: Land Acquisition, tree cutting
        and utility relocation continued to be delayed well up to 2009. This, in turn, had a
        cascading effect in terms of delays in handing over the encumbrance-free land to
        the contractors and thus can be termed as one of the principal causes for the
        subsequent time and cost overruns. These activities essentially come under the
        purview of the respective state governments and the delays were mainly
        attributable to the lack of adequate cooperation from the state governments,
        particularly in Uttar Pradesh where the state government’s condition to provide
        additional land for afforestation took considerable time to get resolved;
•       Delays in implementation of civil works and weak contract management by
        NHAI: Poor performance of contractors (particularly in the four contract


8
  The procurement strategy was reportedly modified to enhance competition in the 2nd round of bidding,
through following measures: (i) pre-qualification was replaced with post-qualification; (ii) bids were
invited in 3 separate batches, four at a time; and (iii) qualification criteria were marginally relaxed.



                                                   7
         packages that were eventually removed from the project) and supervision
         consultants, which was caused or accentuated by the weak contract management
         as reflected in delayed and inconsistent decision making and general reluctance
         on the part of NHAI to make use of remedies available under the contracts such as
         management meetings, arbitration and application of liquidated damages. 9 Lack
         of delegation of powers to the field levels resulted in centralized and slow
         decision making in case of variations and time-extensions, resulting in more
         disputes. 10 Another major problem noted was the confusion caused by some of
         the internal orders of NHAI, which were not consistent with the FIDIC-based
         contracts funded by the Bank. These factors together contributed to delays and
         (sometimes prolonged) disputes; and
•        Inadequate staffing of contractors, supervision consultants and NHAI.
27.      Rapid growth of NHDP: During the course of LMNHP preparation and
implementation, the pace and nature of NHAI’s activities witnessed several major
changes. To begin with, the scope of NHDP – for the most part of which, NHAI was
responsible - expanded manifold to cover a total of about 48,000 km of National
Highways through seven phases. Concomitantly, the road length of contracts awarded by
NHAI increased from 342 km in 2003-04, to 1,305 km (2004-05) and 4,740 km (2005-
06). In the subsequent three years leading up to 2008-09, the length of km awarded
progressively dipped to 643 km, but NHAI had to deal with a substantial shift in the
mode of contracting towards PPP. In years 2009-10 and 2010-11, the pace of awards
accelerated again to reach up to 3,000-4,000 km per year. These changes, coupled with
limited or no infusion of additional staff, seem to have extensively impaired NHAI’s
ability to devote requisite level of attention and staff resources for LMNHP.
28.     Mid-Term Review: The Mid-Term Review (MTR) in the first half of the calendar
year 2008, amply highlighted almost all the implementation problems mentioned above,
viz., the delays in pre-construction activities, poor performance of contractors and
inadequate resource mobilization by the contractors and consultants.
29.    QALP Review: In the second half of the calendar year 2008, an independent
Quality of Lending Program Assessment (QALP-1) Review further highlighted the
problems noted in the Mid-Term Review and rated the likelihood of achieving PDOs as
“Moderately Likely?. Some of the other important observations and ratings of the Panel
were:
•        The simple design of the project is also its weakness. Implementation of this
         project as well as achievement of the broader DO of the NHDP depend critically


9
   For instance, NHAI had sought to address the problem of five “non-performing? contracts (packages 5, 9,
10, 11 and 12) through signing Supplementary Agreements that set stiff but achievable monthly targets
over the subsequent four months and stipulated termination as the only remedy for failure to achieve the set
targets in any month. Although all the five contracts failed to achieve the targets in different months, NHAI
terminated only package 9 (in February 2009).
10
   In the last couple of years of the project, an additional layer of Regional Office headed by a CGM was
introduced but without much delegation of financial powers. This increased the level of scrutiny but the
decision-making was still centralized and at the HQ in Delhi.


                                                     8
       on institutional changes in the implementing agency that are beyond the specific
       scope of the components of this project. This was not understood by the Bank in
       design, as it took on trust the relative integrity of the work-processes of NHAI and
       under-estimated the institutional risk (the quality of the design overall is
       considered Moderately Unsatisfactory).
•      Implementation issues could have been managed if NHAI had performed better,
       but NHAI supervision of works and follow-up on problems were deficient;
       engineering staff were too thinly spread over the length of the project road. Given
       the delays in progress at the MTR, it would have been prudent to reassess the
       implementation schedule for the project (the quality of implementation overall is
       considered Moderately Unsatisfactory).
•      The task team addressed all of the implementation issues, although without
       effective timely resolution on the part of counterparts. The task team has
       consistently over-rated the project in the Implementation Status and Results
       Reports (ISRs) while correctly describing the issues in the supporting text.
       Supervision was constrained by the relatively limited leverage provided by a loan
       of a few hundred million dollars under this project in the context of the overall
       financing needs of the transport sector and the national highway network. Within
       these constraints, the Bank team laboured patiently, returning to the same issues
       time after time, and helping NHAI to improve (the quality of Bank supervision
       was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory).
Second (restructuring) phase
30.     First Restructuring: In December 2008, the task team prepared (and agreed with
GoI and NHAI on) an Action Plan to mitigate various risks and weaknesses in the
implementation of LMNHP. However, as there was no improvement in the situation, the
project was eventually restructured but the process took almost two years. A positive
development in the context of restructuring was an agreement between the Bank and
GoI/NHAI to structure a separate TA loan to address some of the institutional challenges
that may fall beyond the time limit of the LMNHP. 11 Following the restructuring in 2010,
the teams could again focus their efforts more squarely on the day-to-day implementation
issues and eventually completed the balance works – ranging from 4% (in package 2) to
49% (in package 5) - in the eight remaining packages within the next two years.
Third (post-restructuring) phase
31.     Increased attention to the issue of Worksite Safety: Yet another positive
development during implementation was the increased attention to safety during
construction, which, in fact, was prompted by the occurrence of a couple of accidents at
worksites in 2008. The project used these ‘adversities’ to create ‘opportunities’ by
moving the project level requirements for mitigation of safety risk higher up on the
agenda of the highway agencies like NHAI. With the Bank’s perseverance, occupational
health and safety (OHS) issues got the much required attention as a sector level issue and

                                              9
several steps/actions were taken through the project to move this agenda forward, viz., (i)
stationing of safety officers at project worksites; (ii) conducting of worksite safety audits
(the Terms of Reference prepared by the Bank for this task is now being used/referred in
other projects); (iii) monthly review, rating and reporting of worksite safety status of each
works contract; (iv) specific attention to OHS issues in the ToRs that NHAI prepared for
PPP projects and; (v) preparation of a manual on worksite safety management for use in
all NHAI projects.
32.     Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) Investigations/Review: In 2009, INT received a
complaint regarding potential failures in construction work undertaken in the project. INT
reviewed procurement, implementation, management and supervision arrangements as
well as inspected companies identified as the poorest performers and conducted forensic
audits on their operations. In the course of its work, INT identified significant evidence of
potential sanctionable practices by certain construction contractors as well as by
supervision consultants.
33.     Quality of construction: The Annual Independent Review (AIR) carried out in
2011 noted numerous instances of poor workmanship, defects and poor design but
observed that the quality of construction was in conformance with the technical
specifications and was generally satisfactory. The Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR) mission just before the closure of the project made similar
observations and the same were mostly corroborated in the interactive sessions with the
stakeholders. 12
2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
34.     M&E Design: The project envisaged to monitor the achievement of PDO through
measuring the benefits to the users of the project corridor in terms of reductions in
vehicle travel time, truck operating costs and number of fatal road accidents and the user
satisfaction in the region, in year 3 (mid-term) and year 5 (end of project). In addition,
impacts of resettlement were envisaged to be determined through a separate assessment
of RAP. The progress on the Highway Upgrading component was also sought to be
measured through:
•       average cost and time overruns (for civil works contracts, throughout the
        implementation period, using the existing Management Information System of
        NHAI);
•       survival rate of afforested trees (in year 5, at the end of project); and
•       ex-post EIRRs (at the end of project).
35.     At the time of restructuring, the scope of the indicators related to fatal accidents
on the project corridor was expanded to include even the construction-related accidents.
Also, the indicator for road user satisfaction (with the NHAI projects in the region) was
dropped on the grounds that its scope goes far beyond the investments supported under

the project. While this may be so, the project should have at least limited the study to
assess the road users’ satisfaction with respect to the project stretches.
36.     In terms of M&E design, prima facie, the aforementioned indicators and measures
appeared to be sufficient given the focus of the PDO/project design on improvement of
the project corridor but deficient to measure the significant secondary effects envisaged
with regard to poverty alleviation and the socio-economic well-being of the population in
the adjoining rural areas. Also, the basis for choosing particular levels of targets is not
clear. In retrospect, the target of 10% reduction in fatal accidents appeared to be
challenging, especially against the backdrop of rapid increase in vehicle population as
well as concentrated development along National Highway network, both of which
considerably enhanced the risk/incidence of accidents. 13 In addition, the indicators were
sought to be monitored only through a survey at the end of the project, with no
intermediate checks that could have triggered necessary course corrections.
37.     M&E Implementation and Utilization: On the NHAI side, the project was
monitored through four Project Implementing Units (PIUs) (each managing about three
contracts) at the field level and two General Managers, respectively responsible for the
states of Bihar and UP. The PIUs, however, were mostly understaffed; either they did not
have sufficient staff allocation or the staff assigned (mostly Project Directors) were
burdened with the additional charge of various other projects.
38.      The Bank, on the other hand, relied on supervision/monitoring procedure of half-
yearly missions and field visits, comprising members from various specializations. These
missions were followed by field and HQ level wrap-up/debriefing meetings with NHAI,
MoRTH and the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), and aide memoires and
management letters. During the more problematic periods – that is, during and post-
restructuring – the task team undertook more frequent/intensive missions and also relied
on Annual Independent Reviews (AIRs). The project was also monitored through regular
reviews by the Sector as well as Country Management, including through ISRs and
tripartite review meetings with the implementing agency & Ministry (of Road Transport
and Highways) and the DEA. In addition, the project received further scrutiny through
the Mid-Term Review (though delayed by one year) and QALP Panel Review.
2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and resolution, as applicable)
2.4.1 Social and Environmental Safeguards
39.     Social Aspects, Land Acquisition (LA) and Resettlement & Rehabilitation (R&R):
Social, displacement and resettlement impacts of the project were high in magnitude as
well as intensity, viz., (i) an acquisition of 442 ha of private land from about 14,976
titleholders and 8,418 non- titleholders; and (ii) 259 religious properties. In terms of ISR
ratings, the journey of R&R implementation in the project was a mixed experience with
frequent changes in the level of compliance, ranging from satisfactory to unsatisfactory


13
   According to the data compiled by MoRTH, during 2007-2010, the number of accidents and fatalities
increased at annual compounded growth rate of 2.6% and 6.1% respectively.


                                                11
and back again to satisfactory. By the project closing date, the land acquisition and
resettlement implementation was fully completed and all affected families received their
compensation and main entitlements, except a few whose cases were in court on
ownership disputes. 14 Periodic reviews and orientation workshops, regular community
consultations, continuous interactions with state officials and confidence building
measures with local leaders and communities, have all gone a long way in turning around
the LA & R&R implementation. The project also made a notable contribution to
HIV/AIDS control, which was detailed under Section 3.5 on Overarching Themes, Other
Outcomes and Impacts. However, the consultants for evaluating the end of project R&R
results were not hired until the closing date. Some of the corridor sections not financed by
the Bank but still under construction will continue to be monitored by the Bank until their
logical completion as per the provisions of Project R&R policy and Project Agreement.
40.      Environmental Management and Safeguards: Environmental compliance in the
initial years of LMNHP remained patchy and varied across the contract packages, despite
the fact that NHAI had some level of awareness, understanding and capacity to deal with
environmental issues from the execution of three previous Bank funded projects. Here
too, as reflected in the ratings, the compliance moved from satisfactory to unsatisfactory
before turning around to satisfactory. 15 Training workshops, regular reviews, interim
missions, consultations with the communities and continuous interactions with state
administration, helped in bringing substantial improvements. In particular, capacity
building efforts covering the staff of contractors, consultants and PIUs, contributed to
creation of a group of 20+ environment professionals who are now well versed and have
practical experience in dealing with environment, health and safety issues during
highway construction; this contribution is particularly significant in light of a severe
deficit of such skills in the market.
41.    Some of the features that contributed to effective management of various
environmental issues are detailed below:
•        Development and implementation of environmental management practices
         through a systematic process for approval, monitoring and documentation –
         demonstrating a good practice not only for the project but for the highway sector
         as a whole;



14
   Finally, land stretches totaling up to 1,800 mts (480 mts on right hand side and 1,320 mts on left hand
side) were taken out from the project scope due to long delays in resolving complex ownership issues.
NHAI proposed to take up these works with its own funds under maintenance contracts. Similarly, about
four religious properties were not able to be relocated due to hard stands taken up by the religious leaders.
15
   The Bank will continue to monitor a few activities that are still ongoing in the project. These include:
clean-up and rehabilitation works in a few small sections/camps; compliance to drainage related issues
(contracts 1 to 3) raised by the Bank’s supervision missions; and completion and rectification of drainage,
slope protection and debris clearance issues in Gorakhpur bypass (not funded by Bank but being monitored
as this is a ‘linked project’). In addition, periodic review will be undertaken for contracts 9 to 12 (not part
of LMNHP any more) in line with Bank policies and project restructuring agreement until the sub-projects
are completed.



                                                     12
•       Proper rehabilitation of all borrow areas, mostly as farmlands and some as ponds
        (for irrigation or fish culture), contributing significantly to the income of the
        concerned households;
•       Proper camp and plant site management, first aid and emergency response
        arrangements, relocation and enhancement of religious properties (259 in number,
        including resolution of issues in sensitive cases), appropriate debris management
        (including its re-use for productive purposes) and worksite clean-up/rehabilitation
        activities (in most sections);
•       Median and avenue plantation mostly completed along with the civil work cycle,
        with an over-all good survival rate;
•       Introduction of an audit system for improving environment compliance and
        worksite safety management (including occupational health and safety aspects)
        which helped in initiating activities to strengthen the said areas at the sectoral
        level;
•       Practices like vermi-composting and management of BOD in the wastewater from
        camps (by using a particular plant species) remain unique in the context of linear
        infrastructure projects in the region.
42.    Some of the other important features of the project with respect to social aspects
and a few suggestions for process improvements pertaining to social and environmental
management are placed in Annex 8.
2.4.2   Fiduciary Compliance
43.     Financial Management: The Financial Management performance of the project
during the initial half of the project duration was sometimes unsatisfactory but improved
in the last two years of the project implementation to close at a moderately satisfactory
rating. The SOE audit reports were generally timely and unqualified. The timeliness of
submission of the Entity Audit Report also improved. The NHAI entity audit report
continued to have Qualified Exceptions throughout the audit period. There were
consistent improvements in the internal audit function with critical action reports being
issued and reviewed by the Internal Audit Committee and thereafter by the Board Level
Audit Committee. Despite the systemic improvements, the Bank noted that there was still
a significant reputational risk given the nature and quality of audit comments (both by the
internal and statutory auditor).
44.      Procurement: Procurement of works, goods and services was carried out in
accordance with Bank guidelines. The bidding/selection process was conducted in a fair
and transparent manner. Procurement arrangements were well defined, contract
packaging was straightforward and no significant problem was encountered during both
the initial and re-bidding rounds of procurement of works. Based on the experience from
this project, the practice of Pre-qualification (PQ) has been made optional for (relatively
less-complex and standard) Road Sector contracts in India.
45.      However, major challenges were faced in selection of consultants and
procurement of IT systems, and during the implementation of civil works (which were
detailed earlier in para 26). Accordingly, the performance of procurement function was
rated satisfactory in the initial stages but downgraded to moderately satisfactory ratings
in the later stages until closing.

                                            13
46.     Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP): NHAI was initially
reluctant to acknowledge the weaknesses related to its governance but subsequently made
efforts to implement GAAP and achieved notable progress in the following areas: (i)
dissemination of pertinent project related information; 16 (ii) enabling of online status of
e-payments to contractors; (iii) facility for the public to post complaints about any aspect
of any road on the NHAI website; (iv) an incentive scheme for whistleblowers; (v)
selection of consultants (CRRI) to carry out third party quality audits; and (vi)
constitution of an independent expert group to look into pending disputes. Some of the
actions envisaged under the GAAP such as ERP system, performance evaluation and
rating system for contractors and corporate governance assessment of NHAI were not
achieved during the project period but are expected to be implemented as part of the
separate TA loan to NHAI.
2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
47.     Civil Works and Operation and Maintenance (O&M): As regards Operation &
Maintenance of the project-financed roads, the ICR mission was informed that NHAI had
already invited bids for 2-year O&M contracts and is planning to subsequently award
them as longer term Operate, Maintain and Toll (OMT) concessions. NHAI is also
working on the completion of the remaining minor works of restructured LMNHP and
that of the contract packages 9 and 10 to agreed standards of environment and social
norms of the Bank.
48.      Institutional Aspects: From the viewpoint of sustaining broader reforms and
institutional capacity, the NHAI TA project put in place in the wake of the first
‘corrective restructuring’ in May 2010 assumes critical importance. The preparation for
this TA rightly recognized that the then poor performance of the four contracts under the
LMNHP is symptomatic of a need for deep enhancement of the institutional capacity and
effectiveness of NHAI, which is also critical for better managing its mandate of national
highway development. Accordingly, the TA was aimed at assisting NHAI in addressing
two key strategic challenges/concerns – (i) ‘Managing the Present’ i.e. its structure,
people, processes, systems which influence inter alia governance, accountability systems;
asset management and safety; and (ii) ‘Preparing for the Future’, i.e., addressing
emerging demands enabling a manifold increase in output, and changing its role from a
builder to an asset manager. The TA thus provides a substantial opportunity for the NHAI
and the Bank to address the institutional strengthening agenda that was un-
attempted/unfinished in the earlier engagements.
3.    Assessment of Outcomes


16
   These included, for example, restructured project paper, quality audit reports and monthly progress
reports on the status of all NHAI projects including LMNHP (with start and completion dates, time
overruns and cumulative physical and financial progress till date), and details of land acquisition (including
total area to be acquired and actual land in possession of NHAI to begin construction in each state).


                                                     14
49.     The original PDO was revised through restructuring approved in May 2010, and
by that time, about 75% of the project amount was already disbursed. Keeping this in
view, first, separate ratings have been assigned to the original and revised
PDOs/Outcomes and then, they were combined to derive the overall weighted-rating of
the outcome (based on the percentage of loan amount disbursed prior to and after revision
of PDO).
3.1   Outcome rating w.r.t. Original PDO, i.e., up to May 2010
(Moderately Unsatisfactory)
50.      Relevance of Objective, Design & Implementation: The PDO of benefiting road
users from an improved journey between Lucknow-Muzaffarpur is broadly in line with
the Bank’s Country Strategy during the appraisal as well as at the closure of the project.
The Bank’s Country Strategy at the time of appraisal highlighted the importance of
engagement in transport in order to not only support India’s growth agenda but also
contribute to the empowerment of the poor and vulnerable groups by helping improving
access to markets, jobs and services 17. In particular, the strategy underscored the need for
providing investment support to the development of critical links of NHDP as well as
extending assistance to further the sector reform agenda. Similarly, the Country Strategy
for 2009-12 – the period during which the project came to close – also envisaged
increasing the level and quality of infrastructure services including National Highways,
as critical for removing structural constraints to growth. 18 In line with these strategies, the
selected 483 km project corridor – an important segment of the East-West Corridor of
NHDP – was and is critical for improving the connectivity and access for some of the
poor districts in the lagging states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and for the North-Eastern
Region of the country.
51.     However, the PDO’s singular focus on civil works also happens to be its
shortcoming. At the time of the project appraisal, effective implementation of NHDP was
the foremost development priority in the sector as well as for the client government.
Managing effective implementation of a large program like NHDP and negotiating a
massive shift towards BOT concessions would have entailed a variety of institutional
challenges, e.g., augmentation of skill sets, improvement/re-orientation of NHAI’s
systems and processes across various functional areas, etc. Yet, none of these challenges
and trends found a place in LMNHP’s PDO or project design, thereby diminishing the
project’s relevance in addressing proximate sector priorities and challenges. In terms of
preparation and implementation, (i) the overall cost overruns were partly attributable to
the poor quality of initial estimates; and (ii) the measures for mitigating the pre-identified
risks related to delays in pre-construction activities turned out to be less than effective.
Considering these as significant limitations, the relevance of objectives, design and
implementation is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

52.    Achievement of PDO and Efficiency: By the time of restructuring, the original
PDO of improvements in Lucknow-Muzaffarpur corridor was not achieved as the work
on none of the 12 contract packages was fully completed (see Table 1 below). For
example, except in case of packages 1, 2, 3 and 6, the progress was below three-fourth of
the original contract price. Although data on the key outcome indicators – namely,
reduction in travel time, costs and fatal accidents – was not available by the time revision
of PDO, the substantial shortfall in progress suggests that the targets for these indicators
might not have been achieved. In addition, the sizeable differences between the
percentage of progress vis-à-vis original contract price and anticipated completion cost,
summarized in Table 1 below, suggest that all the packages were also facing cost
overruns. In view of this, the achievement of PDO as well as efficiency were rated as
moderately unsatisfactory.

53.     Overall Outcome Rating of Original PDO: Considering the moderately
unsatisfactory ratings for the relevance of objectives, design and implementation as well
as the achievement of PDO and efficiency, the overall outcome vis-à-vis original PDOs
was rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
3.2   Outcome rating w.r.t. Revised PDO
(Moderately Satisfactory)
54.     Relevance of Objective, Design & Implementation: At the time of restructuring,
the scope of PDO was revised to reflect the reduction in length of the Project Corridor
(resulting from removal of four poorly performing contracts). To that extent, PDO
continued to focus mainly on civil works with little or no reference to broader sector
development priorities. However, within the legacy constraints of the project, an attempt
was made to expand the scope of the project design to introduce three new activities to
give fillip to critical issues of road safety and enterprise-wide improvement of NHAI’s
systems and processes (through ERP). More importantly, the GoI and the Bank have
agreed to structure a separate TA loan to assist NHAI on several institutional challenges.
Strictly speaking, broader institutional strengthening objectives of the TA loan were not a
part of the revised PDO of LMNHP. Yet, it is important to recognize that the TA loan
was: (i) organically linked and evolved from LMNHP, with clear reference in the
restructuring document; (ii) structured as a separate loan mainly because its
implementation required longer time beyond the revised closing date of LMNHP; and
(iii) approved by the Board soon after the restructuring. Keeping this in view, relevance
of revised objectives, design and implementation is rated as moderately satisfactory.



                                                    16
55.      Achievement of PDO: By the end of the project in June 2012, the revised PDO –
that is, “to improve the journey on NH-28 between Lucknow and the Uttar Pradesh/Bihar
Border and to support NHAI in improving safety and sustainability of the project
corridor? – was achieved or likely to be achieved but with a mixed record on some key
aspects of performance, as detailed below.
56.     On the positive side, the Lucknow-Uttar Pradesh/Bihar border (a total length of
358 km, including the 328 km comprising bank-financed stretches) has been upgraded to
four-lane standard, with an IRI of less than 2.3. Travel time on the project corridor has
reduced by 23% (for cars) and 25% (for trucks) – against an overall target of 20%. The
road assets upgraded in the project corridor are likely to be sustained through requisite
level of O&M, initially through two-year contracts, followed by OMT concessions. The
project also made a notable contribution to moving the critical issues such as HIV/AIDS
and road safety higher up on the NHAI/sector agenda. The compliance with respect to
environmental and social safeguards has improved to “satisfactory? level by the end of
project.
57.      On the other hand, the project’s performance with respect to key outcomes such
as vehicle operating costs and number of fatal and non-fatal accidents has been, prima
facie, unsatisfactory or at least not-uniformly-satisfactory vis-à-vis targets across the
three homogenous sections of the project corridor. For instance, the targets envisaged in
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)/restructuring paper for vehicle operating costs
were achieved in case of cars in only two of the three sections, viz., Lucknow-Ayodhya
and Ayodhya-Gorakhpur. In case of trucks, the targets for these costs were not achieved
in any of the three sections; in fact, the VOC for trucks has increased in Ayodhya-
Gorakhpur section. Interestingly, this result appeared to be inconsistent with the
reduction in travel times, especially for trucks. A closer examination of the available data
suggests that this inconsistency is perhaps attributable to the increase in speed for trucks
from the baseline figures of around 39-42 kmph to end-of-project values of 48-58 kmph.
In addition, in case of Ayodhya-Gorakhpur section, the baseline VOC for trucks at
Rs.10.27 per km, appeared to be rather low in comparison to VOC of more than Rs.13
per km in all the remaining sections. In this section, average speed for trucks increased
from 42 kmph to 58 kmph, which might have contributed to increase VOC. In view of
this, the assessment of the project’s achievement w.r.t. reduction in VOC may merit some
leniency.
58.    In case of fatal and non-fatal accidents, too, the target envisaged was achieved
only in two sections, viz., Lucknow-Ayodhya and Gorakhpur-Bihar border; Here, as
explained in the section on M&E design, the project appears to have had set a rather
challenging target for itself in this case. For instance, during 2007-10, the total number of
accidents and the fatalities over the National Highway network increased at a CAGR of
2.6% and 6.1%, respectively.
 Table 2: Accident Scenario in National Highways in India

59.     On the negative side, near doubling of both the fatal and non-fatal accidents in the
Ayodhya-Gorakhpur section is particularly alarming and deserves further urgent
investigation and remedial measures. Also, none of the three activities included at the
time of restructuring – namely, support to Road Safety Cell, Safer-Greener Highway Pilot
and ERP Implementation – made any notable progress until the closure of the project in
June 2012. The only note of consolation here is that these activities are not fully
abandoned. While NHAI is reportedly pursuing the Safer-Greener Highway Pilot through
its own funds, the Bank will be supporting the Road Safety Cell and Implementation of
ERP through the separate TA loan to NHAI (which is currently under implementation).
60.   In view of the above shortcomings, the achievement of revised PDO was rated as
moderately satisfactory.
61.     Efficiency (Moderately Satisfactory): In all the eight packages, there have been
sizeable time overruns (average time extension of 95%) and cost overruns (on weighted
average basis, 128%, vis-à-vis original contract amounts). 19 Despite this, in the
economic analysis carried out at the end of project, the three homogenous sections (of the
revised, reduced length of the project corridor upgraded through eight contract packages)
yielded EIRRs of 28% (Lucknow-Ayodhya), 29% (Ayodhya-Gorakhpur) and 18%
(Gorakhpur-Bihar Border). The combined EIRR for the project corridor, at 26%, implies
that the project even with the increased costs is economically justifiable (as against a
threshold of 12%). Keeping this in view, the efficiency of achieving the revised PDO
was rated as moderately satisfactory. For further details of the economic analysis, please
see Annex 3.
62.     Overall Outcome Rating of Revised PDO: Considering the moderately
satisfactory ratings for the relevance of objectives, design and implementation,
achievement of PDO and efficiency, the overall outcome vis-à-vis revised PDOs was
rated as moderately satisfactory.
3.3 Weighted Average Rating of the Overall Outcome (Moderately Unsatisfactory)
63.     The rating of outcomes related to the original and revised PDOs were combined
using the “weighting system? recommended in the Bank’s ICRR guidelines, that is, based
on the percentages of loan amounts disbursed prior to and after revision of PDO (see
Table 2 below). The overall outcome was thus rated as moderately unsatisfactory.




19
  The package wise details of time and cost overruns are provided in Annex 11. Here, it is noteworthy that
these cost overruns may or may not be final because there are many outstanding disputes and claims by the
contractors in all the contracts, which on an average work out to about 62% of the undisputed final cost of
contract at closure. The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) team tried to compare this
performance with other comparable projects but could not get any publicly available, reliable data for this
purpose; such paucity of data is also indicative of the broader institutional challenges in the sector.

  3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
  (if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
  (a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
  64.      Capacity building and Mainstreaming Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS
  program into NH agenda: LMNHP is perhaps the first road sector project that
  purposively incorporated a program on prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in the
  project design with an exclusive budget and timelines. The goal was to reduce the risk of
  the spread of HIV/AIDS in the project area through raising awareness among people
  engaged in road construction; communities residing close to the highways; and of people
  using the highways. The HIV/AIDS program was mainstreamed into the NH agenda
  through capacity building and public awareness programs in the project corridor. NGOs
  engaged for this conducted several small and folk media events and also one-to-one and
  group interactions with outreach workers and peer educators. In addition, they displayed
  and disseminated Information, Education and Communication materials and referred
  several cases for: (i) treatment of sexually transmitted infections; (ii) HIV testing; and
  (iii) care & support services for people living with HIV. NHAI’s field units were directly
  involved and made responsible in delivery of these awareness programs.
  65.    In partnership with ADB for capacity building within the NHAI, a cell was
  exclusively created for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. The cell was headed by a
  DGM with the support of subject specialists. It has undertaken a number of awareness
  programs for the staff and for the community and networked with National AIDS Control
  Organization (NACO) in delivering its mandate.
  66.     Although the project was expected to have significant secondary effects on
  poverty alleviation and the socio-economic well-being of the population in the adjoining
  rural areas, the same could not be conclusively ascertained; the M&E framework did not
  include any provisions for measuring such poverty and social impacts.




                                             19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)
67.     Only the restructured project contained some intervention aimed at institutional
strengthening of NHAI, covering areas such as governance (GAAP), information systems
(ERP) and safety aspects. Of these, some notable progress was achieved in selected
elements of GAAP, and a Road Safety Cell was brought under the charge of a senior
NHAI officer. Although the Cell initiated steps like issuing guidelines and carrying out
audits, the momentum tapered down. The consultants and NGOs hired for the HIV/AIDS
activity too have been demobilized after the closure of their respective contracts. Support
to most of this unfinished institutional strengthening agenda is now being provided
through the TA loan.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
68.       No other appreciable unintended outcomes/impacts were noticed.
3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICRR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
69.      Even though this was envisaged only as a core ICRR, the team conducted three
half-day workshop/discussion sessions 20 to get a better understanding of the ground
realities and perceptions among the various stakeholders. In general, the participants in
these sessions were satisfied with the project preparation, implementation and benefits (in
terms of reduced travel time and costs). They also highlighted a variety of concerns
including inadequate treatment of drainage related issues, road safety, damage to the local
roads caused by the trucks of Gorakhpur bypass contractors (hauling heavy construction
materials) and settlement of roads mainly at approaches to bridges. A more detailed
account of these and other issues, along with the list of participants, is placed in Annex 6.
4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
(Rating: Significant)
70.     The principal outcome of the project – that is, improvement of the project corridor
– is likely to be sustained initially through 2-year O&M contracts, for which NHAI has
sufficient funds and has already initiated the process of procurement. Thereafter, too, the
project stretches are likely to be maintained through Operate, Maintain and Toll (OMT)
concessions. The associated outcomes such as improved attention and capabilities to
handle the social and environmental aspects and road safety, however, face the risk of
being dissipated (or not being replicated) especially considering the experience from the
previous three Bank-financed projects. The other institutional strengthening activities
being pursued through a separate TA, which came in the wake of the project
restructuring, are reportedly gaining some traction with NHAI but it is too early to make

an assessment of the progress likely to be achieved on this front. Accordingly, the risk to
development outcome is rated as “Significant?.
5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
5.1     Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Moderately Unsatisfactory)
(performance through lending phase)
71.     During the project preparation, the Bank’s support with respect to the civil works
appears to be reasonable in terms of: (i) including lessons from previous operations; (ii)
giving due attention to social and environmental aspects; and (iii) identification of risks.
The preparation, too, was completed in a relatively short period of about two years.
However, at the strategic level, the project design did not provide any room for
addressing the larger sector development priorities or challenges, thereby diminishing the
project’s strategic relevance and approach. Given the Bank’s mandate of development,
due importance should have been accorded in the preparation stage to finding solutions
and approaches that are sustainable and replicable. This aspect assumes particular
significance considering that (i) LMNHP was the fourth lending operation in support of
NHDP; 21 and (ii) by the time of preparation, the magnitude and challenges involved in
implementation of NHDP would have been more apparent. In view of this, the Bank’s
performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
72.     Review of various project related documents (management letters, aide-memoires,
ISRs, etc.) suggests that the Bank’s supervision teams have been able to identify the
implementation problems early on and candidly highlighted them to the Bank and NHAI
management. Despite the fact that the project design hardly provided any leeway for a
more robust and strategic engagement with NHAI and NHAI itself became increasingly
busy with the rapidly growing NHDP, the supervision teams appear to have tried their
best to: (i) keep the Highway Upgrading component moving, including through
interactions and pursuance with other stakeholders such as state governments and
communities; (ii) make an attempt to bring the institutional agenda to the fore, mainly
through the structuring of a separate TA loan to NHAI; (iii) bring about some notable
improvements in the management of environmental and social aspects, and progressively
turn them around to satisfactory by the EOP; and (iv) take road safety higher up on the
agenda in sector debates. Once the poor performance of contracts became acute in 2008,
the Bank devoted substantially more staff weeks and expenditure to supervision – nearly
two-thirds of the total resources for supervision over a span of eight years were expended
in three years (FY09, FY10 and FY11, see Annex 4). The team also tried a variety of
measures such as Third-party Quality Audit, Annual Independent Reviews, etc.

   A summary of the key ratings of ICRs for the three Bank-financed projects in support of NHDP are
placed in Annex 13, for easy reference.


                                                21
73.     Despite the above efforts, the Bank’s supervision has largely remained ineffective
in getting NHAI to expeditiously resolve critical issues such as poor performance under
four contract packages (prior to restructuring) and lack of progress in the three technical
assistance activities added during the first restructuring. Owing to the delay in
restructuring, a sizeable portion of the Bank loan as well as supervision efforts continued
to be devoted to contracts that were ultimately cancelled and removed from the scope of
the project; an earlier restructuring could have helped better utilization of these resources
for the achievement of revised objectives. In view of this significant shortcoming, the
Bank’s performance during implementation was rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
74.     Considering that the Bank’s performance has been moderately unsatisfactory
during the entry as well as in implementation, the overall performance has been rated as
moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
75.     The government – that is, MoRTH and DEA – have extended reasonable level of
support to the project during both preparation and implementation. Even at the time of
restructuring, the government preferred that the Bank should continue to engage with the
project and supported the new TA aimed at addressing broader institutional challenges of
NHAI. This support at a broader level, however, did not transcend to ensuring effective
cooperation from NHAI in addressing/expediting various operational level issues/actions.
Accordingly, the Government’s performance has been rated as moderately satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
76.    NHAI’s commitment to LMNHP was evidently strongest during the period of
preparation and until the award of civil works contracts. Building upon its previous three
engagements with the Bank, NHAI worked towards higher level of preparedness by
agreeing to early mobilization of NGOs and supervision consultants. In case of
procurement, too, NHAI had made a strong case of rebidding to reject the uniformly high
bids received in the first round and, thereafter, completed the rebidding process within
one year.
77.     In comparison, during implementation, although NHAI undertook and achieved a
few notable actions/improvements with respect to social, environmental and safety issues,
its involvement in management of civil works and institutional strengthening elements
left a lot of scope for improvement. Most of the problems faced in project
implementation can be traced back to a variety of factors under the control of NHAI, viz.,
inadequate staffing at PIUs and road safety cell, delayed decision-making, insufficient
delegation of powers and weak contract management as reflected in the general
reluctance to apply contractual remedies, delayed procurement for various consultancy
services (e.g., road safety, safer-greener highway pilot and ERP). Keeping the above
shortcomings in view, performance of NHAI was rated as moderately unsatisfactory.



                                             22
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
78.    Considering that the moderately satisfactory performance of the Government and
the moderately unsatisfactory rating of the Implementing Agency, the overall Borrower
performance has been rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
6.    Lessons Learned and Suggestions
(both project specific and of wide general application)
79.     Institutional Strengthening agenda should be accorded due attention, especially
in projects aimed at supporting large programs such as NHDP. Projects such as
LMNHP, being part of a larger program like NHDP, provide rare and unique
opportunities to seed and demonstrate project and program level best practices. These can
then be widely replicated across many projects within the national program and also
serve as examples worthy of emulation by the states. Accordingly, the design of such
projects should ideally have a robust and relevant institutional strengthening component.
80.     Task teams should pay particular attention to the performance of large value
contracts. In case such contracts turn problematic and continue to be intractable even
after usual contractual remedies and/or beyond a reasonable timeframe – as happened
with the four packages in LMNHP – the clients may be encouraged to consider the option
of taking out such contracts, if necessary, through restructuring sooner than later.
Significant delays here are likely to result in not only sub-optimal utilization of the loan
amount but also more time spent by the teams and management on the Bank and client
side.
81.    Importance of contract design and contract management: The apparent poor
performance of the contractors (and the consequent time and cost overruns) in LMNHP is
mostly attributable to the contract design and weak contract management. For instance,
the BoQ contracts offered little or no incentives to complete the projects within the
agreed time and cost limits. 22 This was compounded by weak contract management in
terms of: (i) delays in deciding on contractual issues like variations and extensions of
time; and (ii) general reluctance to make use of available remedies such as management
meetings, arbitration and application of liquidated damages.
82.     Proactively engage relevant government departments: Activities such as LA,
R&R and utility shifting, fall outside the purview of the implementing agency for civil
works. The departments/agencies responsible for these activities, burdened with their
routine workload, usually relegate the project related actions to a lower order of priority.
In this regard, the approach followed in LMNHP – that is, engaging NGOs – appears to
be useful as it helped partly alleviate the workload of the state revenue departments in
expediting LA. In addition, it may be worthwhile to explicitly recognize such


22
   Even in these traditional BoQ contracts, one could consider explicitly requiring the contractors to
mobilize their resources and equipment lock-in-step with progress of availability of encumbrance-free land
for construction, thereby avoiding “idling? claims. Similarly, judicial and timely invocation of contractual
remedies such as management meetings and imposition of liquidated damages could go a long way in
checkmating the lackadaisical tendencies on the part of errant contractors.

departments as key implementing partners and enlist their support through a formal
agreement on their respective roles and responsibilities during the project preparation and
implementation.
83.    A few more suggestions with respect to process improvements relating to social
and environmental aspects are placed in Annex 8.


7.   Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
A summary of the NHAI’s ICR is enclosed in Annex 7. The draft ICR was shared with
the Borrower and NHAI. In response, NHAI have suggested couple of amendments in the
report to reflect the current status on certain aspects and the same have been duly
incorporated in the report.

1.0     Economic Analysis at the time of Appraisal/Planning
1.      At the time of planning/appraisal of LMNHP, economic analysis was carried out
for 483 km (out of the total 513 km continuous Lucknow - Muzaffarpur stretch of NH28)
of the proposed project corridor aimed at removing the capacity constraints through
upgrading to 4-lane divided carriageway standard. The overall economic viability of the
project section – based on estimated project costs and the expected reduction in vehicle
operation cost and saving in travel time cost for passengers – was projected at 26% EIRR
and an NPV of USD1,018 million (Rs.45,810 Million; discounted at 12%). See Table
A2.1 below.

2.0     Economic Analysis on Completion of the Project
2.      On completion of LMNHP in June 2012, economic analysis has been carried out
for the 327 km of the project corridor upgraded through the project – from Lucknow to
UP/Bihar border (excluding Gorakhpur bypass) – by dividing it into three homogenous
sections, viz., (i) Lucknow-Ayodhya (130 km); (ii) Ayodhya-Gorakhpur (116 km); and
(iii) Gorakhpur- UP/Bihar border (81.1 km), and using the Highway Development and
Management Model (HDM-4). The details of homogeneous sections of LMNHP Roads
in Uttar Pradesh State and their improvement proposals are presented in Table A2.2.

2.1    Framework of Analysis: The following scenarios are considered for the economic
analysis.

•         “Without up-gradation proposal for road sections? (Base Strategy): In the
          analysis, this is the base strategy against which the new construction/up-gradation
          is compared.
•         “With up-gradation proposal for road sections in Place?: In the analysis, this
          alternative is compared against the base strategy. The ‘with LMNHP road project’
          situation is used to determine the highest levels of benefits.
4.     Approach: The economic evaluation has been carried out within the broad
framework of social cost-benefit analysis assuming the analysis period of 34 years
including the achieved construction period. The economic feasibility of the project has
been sought to be assessed through estimating the economic returns on investment in
terms of reduction in road user costs of motorized traffic (MT) and non-motorized traffic
(NMT) upon the improvement of the existing road, mainly in the following areas:
      − Savings in VOC
      − Journey time of passengers and goods savings
5.      All costs and benefits are valued in monetary terms and expressed in economic
prices to have the analysis on resource-based framework. The analysis is made section-
wise and combined for the full project road and the results are expressed in terms of
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Economic Net Present Value (ENPV).
6.      Construction Program: The analysis period of the project has been taken as 34
years including construction time. The completed construction program for LMNHP road
network is summarized below, in which the actual construction period only considered.

7.     Model for Estimation of Benefits: The following model has been developed to
estimate the aforesaid benefits.
•      Identification of homogeneous sections of LMNHP Project Road Section.
•      Estimation of present traffic volume on the identified completed road
       sections/packages from field surveys
•      Estimation of traffic growth rate – adopted from the ‘initial base analysis of 2003’
•      All the unit values adopted during the ‘initial base analyses’ are maintained. Only
       the selected variables changed during the project implementation like growth rate,
       implementation period, its phasing, project cost etc. are suitably included in the
       model, without changing the analysis base year.
•      Cost distribution during the implementation period is discounted to the base year
       in order to adjust the price escalation.
•      Usual maintenance provisions and costs in ‘with’ and ‘without’ project conditions
       have been considered.
•      The model used for analysis is HDM-4. This model helps to estimate total road
       user costs for LMNHP road project in terms of lower VOC cost, time cost, etc.
•      EIRRs of the sections have been estimated with HDM but the EIRR of the entire
       project has been obtained by taking together all the sections
•      EIRR and NPV estimation is done with the sum of benefits from (i) VOC savings;
       and (ii) Time savings
8.      Altogether, the above model gives ‘Total Project Benefits’ for LMNHP project
road section. The Total Net Benefits are considered against the economic cost of the
project to determine EIRR and ENPV.
9.    Conversion to Economic Prices and Distribution of Cost: The adopted Standard
Conversion factor (SCF) to convert the financial cost of project to economic cost is 0.90.

10.    Components of Cost: The financial costs for completed up-gradation of different
packages of LMNHP have been collected and per km economic cost has been worked out
by applying 0.90 SCF to the financial cost per km and is presented below:

15.     The Residual Value: Considering the remaining life of the construction items the
Residual value (salvage value) has been assessed at the end of the analysis period. For
structures, the life is assumed to be 50 years. Values of the selected construction items
such as LA, structures, sub-base, social displacement cost etc. are included in the
economic analysis as residual values at the end of the analysis periods. These residual
values are considered, as benefits to the project in the analysis. The value has been taken
as 15%, as considered in the initial base analysis.
16.     Volume of Traffic and Growth Rates: The AADT traffic on different road
sections during the period 2002 to 2012 is given below. For analysis, the AADT adopted
during the initial analysis (2002) is adopted. However, based on the AADT arrived from
the post completion surveys (2012), the actual growth rate achieved during the
implementation period (2002-2012) for different vehicle categories is adopted for the
present analysis. Accordingly, the AADT and the periodical growth rates adopted for the
analysis are presented in Tables A2.11 and A2.12.

3.0    Project Benefits

18.    Vehicle Operating Cost Savings: The model comprehensively predicts the
performance and operating costs of motorized vehicles in the selected fleet. Motorized
vehicle performance predictions include speeds (free flow and congested conditions) and
consumption. Predictions for vehicle operating costs include fuel, oil, tire and parts costs,
crew and maintenance labor costs, capital depreciation, borrowing costs, and overhead
costs.
19.     HDM-4 has been used to estimate the Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) for traffic
in each vehicle category on each selected road with and without improvement. The model
estimates VOC in both the with- and without-project situations taking into account the
speed and travel time including surface quality and road congestion. The resulting VOC
values for each road and section can be found in the HDM results.
20.     Travel Time Saving: The model estimates the Value of Travel Time (VOTT) for
passengers and goods in transit in both the with- and without-project scenarios taking into
account speed and travel time including surface quality, road congestion, unit time value
for different vehicle travelers etc.
21.     Accident Cost Savings: There can be some anticipated reduction of accidents due
to improved signing and engineering intervention, the benefits deriving from this
rehabilitation project are deemed to be moderate and consequently the accident-related
benefits have not been discounted in the HDM analysis. As a result the actual economic
return in respect of increased of Road Safety would be expected to be nominally higher
than the rates of return presented in this report.
22.     Economic Viability: The economic internal rate of return is calculated by the
model applying a project discount rate of 12 percent to the annual undiscounted net
differences of the economic elements considered in the analysis. The sum of these
discounted values gives the economic net present value (NPV) of the project which is
generated and presented.
23.     Economic evaluations were carried out for discrete sections of the project road
and for the scenarios described below:



                                                     35
24.    In the analysis, the ‘with project’ improvement alternative is compared with the
base option of ‘without project’ alternative of maintaining the existing road and minimum
maintenance “Do Minimum? i.e.

        1. Base case: Without improvements and with annual “Do Minimum?
           maintenance
        2. Improvement Alternative: With improvement and annual “Routine
           Maintenance? supplemented by a Periodical Maintenance at five-year interval
           and overlay after 20 years.
25.     The results of section wise economic analysis conducted considering modified
cost of project packages and their sensitivity analysis after 15% reduction in benefits are
summarized in the following table. Another sensitivity factor of increased capital cost
during implementation is already covered in the PCR analysis and so not considered.

26.     The EIRRs obtained for road sections of LMNHP are in range of 18.3% - 29.3%,
which are more than the required 12%. Hence, the project is found economically viable
with increased construction cost. These results show some changes with respect to the
earlier study as VOC and travel time cost savings during the analysis period is more after
considering the modified construction cost, construction phase, observed traffic during
the construction period etc. and vice versa.
27.    The sensitivity analysis is conducted after 15% reduction of yearly benefits for
analysis period and EIRR obtained for road stretches are in range of 16.7% to 26.5%,
which are more than the required 12%.
28.      In all sections, the NPV discounted at 12% is positive confirming the economic
justification of the project even though the cost of civil works had increased. The EIRR
for all the above sections is more than 12%. Combined EIRR for the full Lucknow –
Muzaffarpur Section (483 km) during processing stage was 26% and for the reduced
project of 327 km length at the time of restructuring was >12%. In the present economic
analysis at the end of project, the combined EIRR for the restructured project of 327 km
length is 26.2%, which is equal to the EIRR at processing stage. Higher EIRR values in
the first two sections, which are mainly due to marginal increase in project cost coupled
with higher traffic volume with favorable composition and this, resulted in maintaining
the combined EIRR at the same level of values at the end of project.

                                            36
29.     The first reason, which explains the differences in the EIRR, is the considerable
increase in construction costs, ranging from 15.3% (Lucknow – Ayodhya Section) to
43.7% (Gorakhpur – Bihar Border Section). The second reason is that the roads became
operational later than expected at appraisal and as a result, the savings in the revised
economic analysis are based on 2012 traffic volumes while they were based on
2006/2007 traffic volumes in the initial economic analysis. The third reason is that the
roads deteriorated between the time the initial economic analysis was carried out and the
time the works were completed and roads were improved. The fourth reason is the better
traffic growth pattern in the project road sections achieved during the project
implementation period (2003-2012). The fifth reason is the change in traffic composition
during the implementation period, in favor of heavy and commercial vehicles (Table
A2.15). Though the first two reasons together have caused negative impact on net
benefits, the remaining three reasons discussed above together have resulted in higher
savings in VOCs /VOTTs than estimated at appraisal, and resulted in maintaining the
EIRR and ENPV at the end of project. This higher economic feasibility further confirms
that the improvement of the project road (LMNHP) is justified.

4.0        Conclusions

30.      The results discussed above show the robustness of the economic feasibility
indicators under normal and the adverse sensitivity scenarios including when the benefits
are decreased significantly. The EIRR for all the three sections is more than 12%. This
justifies the project investment with more risk absorption capacity. However, this
sensitivity is unlikely to happen (a) as traffic is expected to grow to accompany the
current economic growth, (b) there is little uncertainty on the cost of the works as all the
contracts are completed and (c) VOCs are unlikely to be reduced in view of the past trend
for the price of inputs such as fuel, lubricants, tires, and salaries.
31.     The estimated economic feasibility results are on the conservative side to the
extent that the qualitative project benefits like tourism development, increased road
safety, better highway environment are not considered in this analysis.

                 Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
1.      As part of the ICRR preparation, the team conducted three half-day
workshop/discussion sessions with various stakeholders to obtain an understanding of
their feedback on the project preparation and implementation. These sessions were
organized at Lucknow, Ayodhya/Faizabad and Gorakhpur, respectively, on 7th, 8th and
9th of August 2012. NHAI, in discussions with the Bank team, invited representatives
from the following groups of stakeholders:
•      Concerned Headquarters, regional and field officers of NHAI;
•      Senior officers of the supervision consultant team who worked on the project;
•      Senior officers of the contractors’ team who worked on the project;
•      Truck owners’ associations operating trucks on the corridor;
•      State bus transport organization representatives operating their buses on the
       corridor;
•      Commercial establishments, factories and industries on the corridor;
•      Farmers and agriculture/horticulture players;
•      Educational institutions like schools, colleges and training institutes along the
       corridor;
•      Representatives of towns and villages on the corridor;
•      Forest, land and revenue officials;
•      District administration officials; and
•      Police department.
2.       A Bank team along with respective package NHAI officers, consultant and
contractor representatives numbering 20-40 people, were present at the workshop. The
district collector of Gorakhpur also participated in the workshop. There were active and
interesting discussions and feedback on all aspects of the project right from the design to
construction and on issues like safety, technical, social and environmental safeguards.
3.       Most stakeholders were of the opinion that the four-laning of the NH-28 as part of
the national program of NHDP had benefitted direct and indirect road users in terms of
quicker and more comfortable travel. The general perception was that heavy vehicle
travel time from Lucknow to Gorakhpur has now reduced by about 1.5 hours and there is
less congestion on the road. This, people felt, may marginally increase with the start of
tolling due to waiting times at the toll booths. Access to educational institutions and
hospitals has improved and become faster. Owners of land and property along the road
were also happy because the values of their assets had increased manifold especially for
land near bypasses and new alignments. The overall perception was that the land
acquisition and R&R process was done reasonably well except for a few stray cases of
dissatisfaction. While some sections of the stakeholders felt that the safety situation is
better, many others felt that it had worsened due to increased speeds even in spite of a
divided carriageway.
4.     The discussions during the workshops also focused on: (i) problems faced during
and due to the four-laning of NH-28; and (ii) suggestions for ways to improve the process
of planning and construction of such projects. Some of the important issues, problems


                                            43
and suggestions, which were discussed during the workshops, have been captured in the
paragraphs below.
5.      Due to increased height of embankment and the construction of service roads, the
original drainage pattern had been disrupted causing major problems to the wayside
community. Many of the drains provided were not properly connected to an outfall, or the
inlets to the drains were not located properly to allow surface water to enter the drains.
People pointed out that in many places the brick-lined drains had started to fail creating
blockages and water overflow. There were small pools of water observed by the mission
on the road due to poor surface water draining which could be the cause of skidding and
other accidents and faster road deterioration. It was unfortunate therefore to note that in
spite of the emphasis being laid on water drainage and provisions being made in the
drawings and designs, this had become such a major issue affecting wayside
communities.
6.      Safety issues and problems were also discussed extensively. Problems of trucks
and other vehicles moving in the opposite direction to avoid taking a U-turn at the next
available median-gap were mentioned. Many unauthorized gaps had been made on the
medians by villages and petrol pumps to allow easier access to vehicles to/from the
opposite lanes. Accidents are frequently caused by vehicles entering the main road from
the spur roads at greater speeds. Some drivers felt that this happened because the spur
roads intersected with the main road at a gradient – because the project road has been
raised in many places. To overcome this gradient, the tractors carrying agricultural
produce have to accelerate while entering the main road, thus causing accidents. Also,
traffic signs were reportedly missing on side roads. Deficient road signage at the
beginning, end and other crossings of Gorakhpur bypass came in for a lot of criticism by
the District Collector and the people at Gorakhpur.
7.      People felt that some of the above problems of safety could be addressed by better
design of roads including the spur road intersections as well as proper use of signage.
Using sign posts and signboards made of materials that do not have a high re-sale value
was a suggested solution to them being stolen and sold as scrap. The stakeholders felt that
using brick/concrete pillars with asbestos or high strength plastic might prevent the
signage from being stolen. The other problems of safety have to be addressed by
enforcement of traffic rules, preventing wrong-side driving on highways and
unauthorized cutting of medians. A huge programme of road construction and widening
such as NHDP has to be accompanied by major safety awareness programs for the
wayside communities and vehicle drivers. Accident victims also need to be taken to the
nearest hospital within the first Golden Hour and this can now be done with wider roads
provided the ambulance facilities reach fast. People suggested that an accident recovery
mechanism should be put in place on this highway as in other highways. NHAI officials
assured the public that the O&M contracts have now been finalized and would be
mobilized shortly. These contractors would be providing some of these facilities.
8.     Since the road has now been widened to more than 20 meters and been raised in
most built-up areas, there has been some impact due to severing of communities. The
need to cross the roads is acute for the villagers and many accidents are reported now
because of higher speeds of vehicles and pedestrians crossing the highway. There was a

                                            44
suggestion that the vehicle underpasses could be made a bit wider and higher to allow
safe movement of larger vehicles and pedestrians too. Wherever underpasses are not
provided there could be a provision for a grade-separated pedestrian cross-over. There
was a suggestion to barricade the built-up areas, with openings only at some places for
dedicated pedestrian crossing. The emphasis during the discussions was more on the fact
that the communities could have been better consulted on these aspects also.
9.     Other important issues which featured during the workshop discussion were:
•      There was a clear dissatisfaction over the settlement of road embankment at the
       bridge approaches causing a huge bump and jolt when vehicles travel at high
       speed. 1 This issue was raised by stakeholders in all three workshops and pointed
       out as a potential to cause breakdown of vehicles as well as accidents due to
       sudden braking.
•      Another very important point raised by the public was that the construction traffic
       with heavy axle loads carrying materials damage the city/town/village and rural
       roads causing unnecessary expenditure and difficulties to the local citizens. The
       DC at Gorakhpur cited examples of PMGSY roads and other city roads which
       have got damaged badly due to the trucks of the Gorakhpur bypass contractor.
•      Since the representative of the State Transport Corporation was present at the
       Lucknow meeting, people expressed their views on the inadequacy of bus services
       as well as the fact that many buses do not stop at the bus stands. It seems that the
       bus-drivers and the transport officials are, in some cases, not aware of the new bus
       stops provided by NHAI on the corridor and hence this problem. Providing for
       drinking water and proper seating facility at these bus stops was a common
       demand of the public.
•      The representative of the forest department expressed overall satisfaction over
       how tree-cutting was done and the compensatory plantation was dealt with.
       However, he mentioned that the Forest Department was not consulted about the
       plantation on the medians and was not sure whether soil testing was done before
       finalizing the median plantation. His typical answer to the delays caused to the
       project due to the tree-cutting process was that it cannot be avoided and has to be
       factored into the project timeline by NHAI.
•      There were some complaints about debris not being disposed of properly on some
       stretches of the Gorakhpur bypass.
10.    The Bank team also had discussions exclusively with the contractors, consultants
and NHAI officers. The general feeling was that contractors were weak in planning
resource mobilization and activity scheduling and that they should strengthen their
planning process. The contractors, on the other hand, felt that proper planning was not
possible due to uncertainty in availability of encumbrance-free land. The possibility of a


1
 NHAI have subsequently informed that the bumps at these locations are being repaired by the
Contractor during the defect-liability-period.



                                            45
joint scrutiny by NHAI, SC and Contractor of the work site and then agreeing on a
revised work/mobilizing schedule, if required, was discussed. This would allow the
contractor to mobilize resources accordingly and for NHAI to pay the mobilization
advance accordingly.
11.    NHAI and the contractors felt that there were very frequent changes in the key
personnel of the SC and this resulted in delays and lack of continuity and consistency in
decision-making. Moreover, lack of SC manpower sometimes acts as a constraint for the
contract to accelerate its work program beyond a certain limit. The possibility of more
severe penalty for changing key personnel in the SC contract was discussed. In addition,
a method for the SC to respond to certain changes to the staffing requirement due to
changes in contract schedules should be looked into as part of the SC contracts.
12.     The discussions did bring out the delays in handing over encumbrance-free land
by NHAI and delays in decision making on contractual issues like variations and
extensions of time requests. NHAI responded by mentioning that most of the problems of
handing over of land were pertaining to state governments. As for delays in decision
making on contractual issues there is an urgent need for NHAI to find a solution to fast
track the decision making process – probably by more delegation to field level officers
who are more conversant with the day-to-day issues in the contract.
13.     There was a consensus amongst the contractors, consultants and NHAI that Bank
missions did provide valuable inputs during their visit and helped in escalating certain
field related issues to the headquarters to ensure higher-level attention. The Bank mission
mentioned that issues of delays in contracts etc. could probably be resolved through
better project management by the Contractors, Engineer and NHAI.

      Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1.1 Background
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has been mandated by Ministry of
Road Transport & Highways, Government of India, to undertake the works of four -
laning and strengthening of NH-28 as part of the East West corridor development (from
Porbander to Silcher with total length of 3,640 km) under Phase - II of National
Highways Development Project (NHDP). About 653 km. length of this corridor passes
through the State of Uttar Pradesh, out of this about 627 km. has already been 4 laned. In
balance length, work is in various stages of construction. The section between Lucknow
in Uttar Pradesh and Muzaffarpur in Bihar forms a part of this corridor and passes
through the cities like Barabanki, Ayodhya, Basti, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar and
Gopalganj. The Lucknow - Muzzafarpur National Highway Project (LMNHP), with a
total length of 483 km, has been implemented by NHAI with funding from The World
Bank. The civil works under LMNHP are being implemented through 12 construction
contracts out of this 8 Packages fall in the State of Uttar Pradesh and 4 Packages in the
State of Bihar.
The Lucknow Muzzaffarpur project is to widen the existing 2-lane NH section to a 4-lane
divided carriageway. The improvements mainly comprises of the following –
•      Widening to 4-lane by providing a new parallel 2-lane carriageway with 1.5 m.
       hard shoulder and rehabilitation of existing carriageway.
•      Provision of 5.5/7.0m wide service roads with separators between main
       carriageway and service road for local traffic in built-up areas.
•      Construction of 4-lane bypasses with rigid / flexible pavement
•      Construction of flyovers and vehicular / pedestrian underpasses.
•      Construction of ROB’s at level crossings.
•      Construction of Bridges and culverts.
•      Provision of traffic safety and control measures such as signs and markings,
       signals, delineators, crash barriers etc.
The PCC services under LMNHP commenced in the year 2002 wherein 483 km. of roads
were selected for Techno-Economic feasibility in the year 2002.
The studies were funded by the Bank. Detailed Design and Contract preparation of the
project was carried out from 2002. The project was appraised by the bank in November
2004 with the project cost to the tune of USD 851.24 mn and subsequently approved
loan (IBRD Loan No. 4764 IN ) to the tune of USD 620 mn. Project implementation was
initiate from 2005. After implementation of the LMNHP, WB desires, as part of its
mandatory requirements, to prepare project implementation completion and result report
(ICR), which would state the success and/ or failure of the project implementation as well
as lessons learned and opportunities for applying such lessons in similar projects in
future. One of the components of ICR is Borrower’s Own evaluation of the project. This
is to present borrower’s own assessment of performance of key players, outcomes of the
project, lessons learnt and suggestions for WB and/or for future project of such
magnitude.

1.2 Project Formulation
The intent of having such project like LMNHP took shape from very high growth in
vehicle population along with increase in road network length during 1995 to 2001.
The draft road policy recognized the needs due to rapid growing traffic levels and the
existing inadequate and deteriorating road infrastructure conditions. As a result the NHAI
had sought WB assistance in improving both the capacity and quality of its core State
road network.
To address the Road Development Plan NHAI implemented the R&R policy of World
Bank, which was consistent with WB’s strategy as defined in “India Transport Sector –
Long Term Issues Report (1995)?.
With this background broad focus areas identified to be part of the project were:
1.     Strengthening institutional capacity of NHAI.
2.     Reduction of Periodic Maintenance backlog.
3.     Increasing in maintenance Funds in real terms.
4.     Improving capacity and quality of National Highway network Based on above
       focus areas, mutually NHAI and WB had framed objectives for LMNHP at
       Project Appraisal Stage. Accordingly key performance indicators were also
       finalized as reported in PAD.

1.3 The Project comprises of four components
1.     Corridor improvements
       a.       Upgrading 483 km. of priority National Highways.

•    Funding Agency: The World Bank.
•    Consultants and Contractor: List of Consultants and Contractors is attached as
     Appendix 1.
2. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION

2.1 Component wise details
The objectives and benefits have been substantially achieved through the following six
component of the projects:
Component 1 (a) – Upgrading: Total length of 483 km. of NH has been 4 laned. In all
eight contract packages covered this upgrading length of 483 km, which was supervised
by international consultants. Regular meetings by NHAI & CSC with all concerned
agencies and rating of construction changes during implementation has yielded good
results. Also consultants imparted training to implementing agencies and their staff on
job. The roads are constructed to a high standard and attain travel time reduction and also
achieved good riding quantity which is comparable to standard International Roughness
Index (IRI) of less than 2200-2300 mm / km. Consequently, travel speeds have increased
close to 30 percent. The new 4 lane road is inherently safer than before. Higher speed
may have an effect on accident cause and severity but not due to geometric deficiency.

                                              49
Surveys of road users and stakeholders, especially those located adjacent to the new
roads, have revealed only satisfaction of the obvious advantages that the improved roads
have provided in terms of riding comfort, speed and aesthetics. Clearly the commercial,
Social and environmental benefits are significant and reflect GOI’s development goals.
Although the design of the project road was carried out earlier by the PCC M/s. CES,
M/s. ICT etc. The PCC services primary included; development financial management
system, contract document preparation, procurement issues, and construction monitoring,
training quality assurance appraisal, design changes and contract management advice to
the project director and Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Three international
consultants were employed to supervise the upgrading works for eight highways contract
packages namely M/s. LASA, M/s. RI – CEG (JV) & M/s. PFC-FPI – FTE (JV).
Component 2 – Land Acquisition and Resettlement and Rehabilitation: In
association with Component 2 Land Acquisition and R&R was carried out successfully
and in line with the WB’s safeguard policies. Implementation of the R&R was carried out
under separate Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) for each of the Phase. The NHAI as part
of its institutional arrangements established the CRRO, which was responsible for
implementing the RAPs with the assistance of NGOs; procured specifically for the
purpose. The Project-Affected-Person and families (PAPs) were for the most part
satisfied with the RAP implementation and associated compensation and training
provided. During the RAP process a grievance redressal committee was established to
hear and adjudicate grievances. The land acquisition process took a time, longer than
expected, but was completely successful. However in few locations the engineering
design had to be adjusted due to problems in acquisition. NHAI made extraordinary
efforts and applied new methods like direct purchase through negotiation to speed up
land acquisition. However due to non-commensurate actions of revenue department and a
few other departments of GOUP related to utility shifting that there were delays in
handling over land to commence the civil works in certain sections of the project roads.
Component 3 – Road Safety Engineering: Improvement of 34 accident prone spots
have lowered the accident rate by 22% as far as fatal accidents are concerned & the
accident rate for non-fatal accidents has reduced by 50%. The NHAI also had taken up
projects on developing model safe roads under this component.
Impact of Institutional Development on Social and Environmental Management
•      Continued existing of the Environmental cell through the project period.
•      Formation of the Environmental and Social management Cell in the PIU.
•      Enhanced capacity of NHAI Engineers on environmental management through
       training
•      Building the awareness of road contractors in environmental management,
       particularly through the workshop.
•      Reduced dust pollution due to improved road surface conditions.
•      Survival of trees planted under the compensatory Tree Plantation programme.

2.2 Delay and other concurrent problems faced
2.2.1 Reason for Delays
Even though the project could be successfully completed, it was delayed for about three
years. The main reason for the delays were:
1.        Time required for land acquisition was not adequately considered with respect to
          award of the civil works.
2.        There was delay in handling over encumbrance free land for unhindered progress
          of work. The fast track arrangement for land take over did not work as fast as
          anticipated due to department delay (Revenue). Moreover the social impact of LA
          was more than 10 times that of any other projects of this nature in India due to
          density of population and ribbon-type development along the road and R&R was
          intense even in rural areas.
3.        LA plans did not account for road levels and utility relocation
4.        Some delay has occurred due to presence of numerous underground services in
          the urban areas which were not identified at the project preparation stage. This
          was compounded by lack of cooperation by services owners and local residents.
5.        Higher number of disputes on contractual issues and delays in decision making
          has also resulted in delay.
6.        Unprecedented rains in 2008.
7.        Complaints of local public on dumping of debris in to their properties by the
          contractors during construction and lack of proper access to the residence where
          cutting and filling was involved.

2.2.2     Problems faced
     i.   Continuous rainy seasons:
          (a) Short working period due to prolonged monsoon season.
          (b) Shortage of construction materials during rainy season and
          (c) Closing of water courses at exit point of CDs cross drainages by local land owners.
  ii.     The High intensity of traffic during construction was a hurdle in overall progress
          of the work, especially for the sections where traffic was heavy and/ or
          urban/town sections.
 iii.     Contractor’s susceptibility to compromise on quality of work.
 iv.      Lack of accountability and ownership sense from CSC.
  v.      Contractor’s failure to mobilize required resources as per work programme.
 vi.      In town areas, problems were encountered due to presence of unknown
          underground utilities. Identification and relocation of unknown undersigned
          utilities during the construction have been one of the problems.
vii.      Problem in construction did arise because of lack of effective inter departmental
          coordination, such as Revenue, forest and other agencies.
viii.     Heavy vehicular traffic on urban and rural link of the corridors.
 ix.      Unauthorized closing to exit points of CDs by the adjacent land owners.
  x.      Tendency of contractors to resort to Arbitration on minor issues.
 xi.      Steep rise in prices of bitumen and steel during project implementation period had
          upset the contractor’s financial planning.

                                                 51
2.3 Economic Re-valuation upon completion
There are considerable adverse changes in the inputs considered for ICR stage re-
evaluation analysis, particularly in increased cost, and increased implementation period.
Overcoming all these negative parameters, return on investment was found to be
increased for most of the road sections due to the increased traffic level; i.e. actual traffic
level were much higher than the traffic forecasted at appraisal stage. The details of
Completed Costs for LMNHP Packages as Appendix 2.
3.      ASSESSMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT
3.1     By Borrower (NHAI)
   i.   Being the first project of its kind and unique socio-economic environment of
        NHAI provides internal rating to the project as satisfactory. This statement gets
        support of user satisfaction surveys, economic re-evaluation after implementation
        completion and enhanced skills-capabilities of NHAI staff along with contractors.
  ii.   The NHAI officers were actively involved in the corridor readiness activities,
        local liaison, monitoring of the works, environmental/social issues and gained
        indirect experience of the duties of the Engineer and contract administration under
        FIDIC conditions. This will be of great utility for other projects of such
        magnitude.
 iii.   The evaluation and pre-qualification and award of contracts were prompt.
 iv.    During project execution the NHAI Offices were actively involved, especially in
        implementation of Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and RAP.
  v.    Overall contribution from CRRO had been excellent. Implantation of RAP,
        regular site visits, interactions with contractors and consultants, imparting training
        to their staff on job as well as in taking contractual actions against contractors
        have greatly helped in successful implementation of EMP and ESMP.
 vi.    The NHAI also resorted to direct purchase of land in few odd cases from the
        PAP/families through negotiation involving active participation of land-owners
        groups. This was in compliance of R&R policy compliance with OD 3.40 of the
        World Bank. This process is faster than the LA Act for NH 1997 and there are no
        further liabilities on the part of the Government or PAPs.
vii.    A tree planting strategy was worked out and trees were planted on all project
        roads.
viii.   Auditors are normally not aware of FIDIC contract conditions, roles and
        responsibilities etc. and are increasing work load for department by raising
        number of not required quarries.
 ix.    The Banks support missions were of a generally high standard and beneficial to
        the project. The Bank’s rigorous mission, touching the minute details had helped
        in successful completion of civil works, financial monitoring, quality control,
        implementation of EMP and R&R, though it sometimes felt tedious to the
        implementing agency. The comments and suggestions in Aide Memoire had
        helped in solving the problems with other line departments of GOUP.
  x.    A frequent staff changes amongst the consultants and Revenue department and
        NGOs was an issue, which constantly arose during the project duration.
        Replacements of consultants were not found of same caliber of the original staff
        and on many occasion it has been observed that the personnel employed by the
                                              52
          consultant are always project specific and not belonging to the regular
          establishment of the consultant. Such project specific personnel lacks elegance
          towards work, therefore the quality of work suffers.
 xi.      Though the Environmental Guidelines and R & R framework prepared by PCC
          has received open appreciation from Bank and other government agencies but the
          contractors have a tendency to attach less importance on implementing the EMP
          and ESMP in the true spirit.
xii.      Many audit observations were raised by comptroller & Auditor General’s office.
          Many of the observations were raised as the audit staffs were not used to audit
          such works under FIDIC condition. However these were later on dropped by the
          Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), except for a few cases.
xiii.     In all, the project has been completed and received good appreciation from all
          spheres. The able assistance from WB, contribution from consultants and
          contractors made it possible to provide quality infrastructure. The targeted
          benefits to the community are getting realized and will continue to accrue in years
          to come.
xiv.      This project has set number of standards on various aspects; to be particular about
          reducing claims and disputes though many cases were referred. The facts and
          figures in respect of claiming are:
                                                      DRB   Arbitration   Court of Law
        Total number of Cases Referred                 28                      1
        Number of cases in Favor of NHAI                4                     nil
        Number of cases in Favor of Contractor         20                     nil
        Number of cases in progress                     4       24            nil

 xv.      Though the NHAI had limited previous experience in handling disputes, such
          good experience and exposure have made department more confident to take on
          with similar projects in near future.

4.        LESSONS LEARNED AND SUGGESTIONS
4.1       Lessons Learned
   i.     Avoid major delays between Project Preparation and Implementation: Due
          to this there could be major variation at the implementation of a Resettlement
          Action Plan (RAP), and quantities, mainly in earth work.
  ii.     Involvement of NGOs and sociologists at field is a prerequisite for bridging the
          gap between the PAPs and the project and in effective management of R&R and
          other social issues.
 iii.     Requirement of adequate diversion width and temporary acquisition:
          Temporary land acquisition for traffic diversions where insufficient space exists
          within the ROW was one of the major problems.
 iv.      The contract provided for performance BG to be valid until a date 28 days from
          the dated of issue of Taking Over Certificate. This should be normally valid 28
          days beyond the completion date of Defect Liability period.
  v.      Environmental management to be part of project acquisition: Environment
          Management is an aspect of the contract which is very difficult to control with
                                                 53
         widespread abuses by the contractor, ruled simply by cost versus profit. The
         majority of bidders will not make sufficient allowance in their price and do their
         best to avoid or minimize their expenditure on EMP compliance after contract
         award.
  vi.    Need for Safety Audits: Safety audits were felt inadequate at the completion
         stage.
  vii.   Define substantial completion of the project: The basic requirements to satisfy
         substantial completion are not clearly defined in the documents.
 viii.   Actual deployment of Contractor’s Key Staff: Contractor’s key personnel
         named in the schedule or approved replacement candidates are sometimes not
         available at works site during normal working hours. Sometimes contractor’s
         foreman or junior technical personnel manage the day to day construction
         activities at site. This has adverse impact on the quality of work.
  ix.    Define Role of Project Consultants appropriately: Neither in contract for civil
         works nor in construction supervision contracts the role and mandate of Project
         Coordinating Consultant has been clearly defined.
   x.    CSC time lines beyond project completion: Normally reference for arbitration
         is made after completion of work and by that time the CSC has already
         demobilized his establishment from project office, therefore the entire onus of
         defending the matter before the arbitrator lies on the Employer. Though such
         decision was taken independently by the CSC without making any reference to
         the Employer, but still the Employer who is ignorant about the matter is required
         to defined the same before the arbitrator. Absence of a contract specialist in the
         Team of CSC resulted in increase of disputes.
  xi.    The contract provided for performance BG to be valid until a date 28 days from
         the dated of issue of Taking Over Certificate. This should be normally valid 28
         days beyond the completion date of Defect Liability period.
 xii.    General
         •       Upfront training of the engineers and contractors were useful in ensuring
                 EMP compliance.
         •       Difficulties in administering EMP measures with the contractor through
                 the provisions in the FIDIC contracts.
         •       Importance of careful drainage planning as improper drainage leads to the
                 destruction of the road surface.
         •       Difficulties in obtaining leveled land for establishing campsites.


4.2 Suggestions

From the lesson learned and experience from the project some of the suggestions brought
out into the notice are given below.
4.2.1 Suggestions for Improving Project Preparation:
      i. Time gap between the completion of project preparation and commencement
          of implementation preferably should not be more than 6 to 9 months.



                                             54
      ii.    Effective and vigorous Public Consultation should be conducted on proposals
             regarding realignment, and bypass to incorporate their views and local
             requirements.
      iii.   Proposal for shifting of utilities coming in the right of way should be made
             based on proper surveys and consultations with the concerned departments
             and be made part of contract.
      iv.    The work of land acquisition and shifting of utilities should be well planned
             and coordinated. All pre-construction activities should be completed before
             award of work.
             • Land plans to include requirement of land for utility relocation.
             • Loss of access to properties adjacent to the road should also be considered
                  during impact assessment.
       v.    Temporary land acquisition for traffic diversion should be identified as far as
             possible and resolve at the design stage in such cases where insufficient space
             exists within the ROW.
      vi.    Sites for Disposal of waste/ surplus material satisfying environmental criteria
             should be identified and indicated at the DPR stage to allow proper pricing by
             the bidders and the contractor to locate proper sites during execution of work
             disposal.
     vii.    It is proposed to ensure that BoQ items are put into the bidding documents
             that properly reflect the value of the EMP compliance.
    viii.     Avoid frequent transfer.

  Design and DPR Stage
   i.   Whilst international standards were extensively used, it is ultimately preferable
        that wherever available Indian standards and codes of practices are given priority
        particularly as they continue to improve and reflect the actualities of local
        conditions.
  ii.   In the absence of legal axle weight enforcement enhance factor of safety for,
        stronger pavement in design will be required for corridors carrying high or even
        moderate volumes of industrial traffic.
iii.    Where traffic diversions are required, the practicability of constructing diversions
        should be determined at the design stage & not during construction.
 iv.    Introduction of formal safety audits at the design stage is commensurate with
        international practice for subsequent projects.
  v.    While preparing longitudinal profile plan adequate care should be taken to avoid
        environmental impacts due to cutting and filling.
 vi.    Joint verification with revenue personnel prior to finalization of LA Plans.
vii.    Marking of the RoW.

  4.2.2 Suggestions for Improving the Bidding and Contract Document:
  4.2.2.1 Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
   i.     A Condition may be incorporated in prequalification document and ITB stating
          that the unofficial sub-contracting of work either in part or whole is prohibited.
          Further a condition to this effect should also be included in COPA or GCC
          whereby if during execution, it is discovered that a contractor had indulged in
          practice of unofficial sub-contracting, he would be summarily disqualified for
          future tendering in the WB financed projects.
  ii.     Joint Venture partners, who abscond from their responsibilities should be subject
          to punitive action. A condition in ITB and COPA should be incorporated stating
          that the JV partners would be considered as one entity and would respond to the
          need of the contract as and when required. Responsibilities of JV partners should
          be clearly defined.
iii.      About checking and verification of Financial Statements of Joint Ventures, the
          contractual powers should be given to Employer to perform this task, when even
          contract is in force; the details like existence of JV, its Financial Statements and
          JV as one entity’s projects related documents.
 iv.      The format of Bank Guarantee should be in accordance to RBI Directives.
  v.      It is suggested that submission of a bid modification through separate letter be
          strictly prohibited.
 vi.      A specific time limit for clarification process should be incorporated in the ITB
          within which if a bidder fails to provide the required information, his bid should
          be considered non responsive.
vii.      Position of Planning Engineer and Chief Quality Surveyor should be included in
          the list of Contactor’s key personnel. All key personnel should be employee of the
          main contractor.
  4.2.2.2 Conditions of Contract
    i.    The basic requirements of satisfying substantial completion should be defined in
          the documents.
   ii.    The Power of attorney clause should be deleted from the GCC.

 International Competitive Bidding
 iii.   Under FIDIC conditions of contract and COPA, time limit is not prescribed for
        rectification of defects noted or identified during defect liability period.
        According to the Clause 49.4 in case of default at the part of the contractor in
        carrying out such instructions within a reasonable time the employer will rectify
        the defect at the risk and cost of contractor. The reasonable time is very vague
        term. Because of this deficiency in contract conditions, the contactors often avoid
        timely rectification of defects causing inconvenience to the public. To avert such
        situation it is suggested to include the following provisions in COPA. Every time
        notice of defect is given, the contractor shall correct the notified defect within the
        length of time specified by the Engineer’s notice.
 iv.    A definite time limit should be prescribed from the date of serving of notice to
        adjudicate the disputed matter to DRB / Adjudicator by any party to the actual
        date of making reference for adjudication.

4.2.3 Suggestions for Improving Supervision Consultant’s Service
  i.   The make-up of staff with strong international experience and local staff should
       be more balanced if international consultants are to be employed otherwise the
       benefit of employing an international consultant is diminished.
 ii.   Replacement staff must be equal in caliber to the outgoing incumbent and in place
       in a timely fashion. Such replaced person should be inducted only after approval
       by the client. The remuneration should be reduced to 90 percent for such
       replacement each time.
iii.   Procedure for monitoring the performance of CSC should be evolved and
       incorporate in the TOR of CSC.
iv.    It is suggested that consultant’s personnel posted on site supervision works should
       belong to the regular establishment of the consulting firm.
 v.    The entire onus of defending the matter before the arbitrator lies on the Employer.
       It is suggested that the CSC should be made responsible to provide his input until
       the arbitration process is over. A condition to this effect should be included in the
       terms reference of CSC services. The contract empowers CSC to take decision in
       respect of many aspects of exclusions without employer’s concurrence. If any
       dispute arises, act of such decision taken by engineer, onus of defending such
       disputes should entirely be on the CSC. If any extra payment results from
       disputes, CSC should be made to pay the same in such cases.
vi.    Accountability and liabilities of CSC and PCC have not been clearly laid out in
       the TOR of services. The TOR should include this aspects also.

4.2.4   Suggestions for Borrower’s Effectiveness
 i.     Government Auditors are not exposed with FIDIC contract conditions, before
        start of the project implementation; training shall be imparted to group of
        Auditors.

                   COMMENT OF BORROWER
       ON IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT

The draft ICR was shared with the Borrower and NHAI. In response, NHAI have
suggested couple of amendments in the report to reflect the current status on the
following aspects:
1) Page no. 47 item no. 9: The bumps at the location of structures with approaches slab
   is being repaired by Contractor regularly during DLP.
2) Page no. 55 item no. 3.1 xiv: The no. of cases in favour of NHAI is Four (4). The no.
   of cases in favour of contractor are twenty (20).

The above amendments have been duly incorporated in the report.

Annex 8. Other Aspects & Suggestions w.r.t. Social & Environmental Management
1.     Additional salient features of the LMNHP project with respect to social aspects
are:
•      Incorporation of the lessons learnt from previous projects: Based on the
       experience of TNHP and GTRIP, this project had improved R&R provisions to
       address complex land ownership issues which included assistance at the
       replacement value for land losers with unclear titles, like people residing in the
       “abadi? lands, people allotted with land under different government schemes, etc.
       Similarly, informal share croppers were identified and provisions for their
       rehabilitation were made beforehand. Several capacity building workshops were
       conducted by the World Bank team before and during the project period both for
       the PIU staff, project NGOs and involved Revenue and Forest officials.
•      Building community confidence through successful relocation of religious
       properties and other common properties: About 253 religious properties
       consisting of temples and mosques and other reverential structures – including a
       large Ashram (a religious institution) - were successfully relocated. These
       measures have facilitated winning the community trust and helped in
       implementation of the land acquisition and R&R program.
•      Skill upgrading and income generation schemes were conducted for about 2,700
       unemployed youth through training programs imparting skills including for
       repairing agricultural equipment, tractors and two-wheelers.
•      Involvement of NGOs in land acquisition in addition to R&R: To overcome the
       issues of (a) inadequate capacity with Revenue Department to carry out the survey
       work for LA; and (b) ‘land ownership’ issues due to continuous fragmentation of
       land holdings, NHAI has taken the onus of tasks such as ownership identification
       and structure valuation, etc, through engaging NGOs to support the Revenue
       Department. NHAI appointed four NGOs for the entire project period. This
       helped in advancing the identification of the actual owners on the ground and in
       establishing a data base that was subsequently passed on to State Land
       Acquisition Officers for their use in legalizing the actual owners. This also helped
       in minimizing the disputes among the family members and facilitated
       understanding of their due share in the compensation and assistance amounts. The
       compensation by the competent authority and the assistance by the project
       authority were distributed in the village itself by the NGO team through a
       doorstep disbursement campaign in a transparent manner. PIUs with the
       assistance of the NGOs ensured that all PAPs received their due/entitled
       compensation with convenience and with updated information.
•      Effective awareness programme and R&R public consultations: Complete
       disclosure of project information and R&R policy was made within the first five
       months of the project. PAPs were better informed regarding their losses.
       Establishment of public contact during the preparation stage through consultations
       helped the project in gaining acceptability. In a rural context, women’s
       participation in large meetings remains a challenge. This was addressed through
       ensuring the deployment of female staff in NGOs, who, in turn, contacted women
       through home visits and encourage them to participate in the meetings.
                                           60
2.     Some of the suggestions for improving the processes pertaining to social and
environmental aspects are as follows:
•     During the DPR stage, prepare LA plans based on actual staking out of Right of
      Way/Corridor of Impact on site rather than by superimposing the alignment map
      on the revenue map; also, update revenue maps.
•     Improve quality control of LA plans and RAP baseline through audit of, say, 15 to
      20% of LAPs and RAPs, and ensure that the consultant’s plans are accurate and
      implementable; for this, NHAI may have to develop in-house capabilities by
      bringing in Revenue Department officers.
•     For land owners with unclear titles, develop guidelines for establishing title for
      those with valid claims and assess typology of land ownership pattern and make
      provisions accordingly in entitlement framework;
•     At least Section 3 (D) notification should be issued by the time of issuing the
      tender;
•     Prior to award of civil contracts, acquire 100% land in first milestone; 75% in
      second and 50% in third milestone stretch;
•     Public Consultations: Extensive and continuous public consultations both during
      DPR preparation and project execution stages are needed to address critical issues
      affecting/involving communities, e.g. road safety, bypasses, grade separation,
      service roads, religious structures, etc. There is a need to involve the state
      administration more proactively in providing feedback to the design for
      minimizing issues/grievances during project execution.
•     Design and execution of drainage works require more attention, respectively
      through proper quality checks (a) at the DPR stage with particular attention to
      proper provisions for outfalls and connectivity; and (b) during the implementation
      and before issuing the “substantial completion? certificate. This is critical to avert
      serious deficiencies such as, for example, improper inlet arrangement, lack of
      provision of proper covers, protruding hooks and improper access to properties
      and thereby minimize many unwarranted environmental, health and safety
      impacts.
•     Attention to EHS issues and compliance could be enhanced by making the
      approval of the Environment and Safety Officer (ESO) of the Supervision
      Consultant a pre-requisite for the processing of the RFI and invoice.
•     There is a need to review the contracting arrangements/mechanisms to execute
      environmental protection and mitigation works. The main civil works contractor
      lacks interest in executing small works such as construction of noise barriers,
      washing platforms and enhancement of community properties causing delays and
      quality issues (as works are not supervised properly).
•     Large projects like LMNHP that take several years for preparation and execution
      are not able to respond quickly to changing conditions on the ground such as
      increased traffic levels, changing land-use, urban sprawl and development of large
      institutional areas along the highway. In such a scenario, the safety requirements
      change and mechanisms have to be found (both within and outside the project
      purview) to respond to these changing circumstances.

      Annex 12. Salient Features of the National Highway Development Project
1.       National Highways Development Project (NHDP) was aimed at alleviating a
variety of problems plaguing the country’s arterial road network of National Highways,
viz., under investment, neglect of maintenance, congestion, slow speeds, high vehicle
operating costs and poor safety. NHDP sought to address these problems through a
combination of higher investment and better management and ushered in a variety of new
institutional, financing and contracting practices, as detailed below.

2.     To begin with, it was conceived as a programmatic approach. The first two phases
of NHDP were aimed at strengthening and widening nearly one-fifth of the National
Highway network to a four-lane standard. These phases are also commonly known as
Golden Quadrilateral (GQ, 5,846 km, connecting the four major cities of Chennai, Delhi,
Kolkata and Mumbai) and North-South and East-West Corridors (NS-EW, 7,300 km,
connecting Srinagar to Kanyakumari and Silchar to Porbandar).

3.     Second, the responsibility for implementation was given to the National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI), an autonomous statutory organization operating
under the aegis of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH).

4.     Third, the program was designed to be financed mainly through payments from
road users in the form of indirect (cess on motor fuels) and direct (tolls) charges. Further,
revenue flows from the indirect user charges were secured through a ring-fenced, non-
lapsable Central Road Fund.

5.       Lastly, in addition to the traditional Bill-of-Quantity (BoQ) contracts for highway
upgrading works (followed up with separate annual contracts for maintenance), NHDP
started trying Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) concessions. Under these concessions,
private sector operators selected through a competitive process were engaged to not only
construct but also operate and maintain the roads for a longer period and allowed to
recover their costs through: (i) tolls from road users and viability gap support (where
necessary and determined through bidding); or (ii) availability based payments
(annuities) from the government. Such an arrangement had the potential to better
incentivize the private partners to take a life-cycle perspective on costs and thereby
optimize investment and operating efficiencies during the entire period of the concession.
It also explicitly recognized and (contractually) committed resources for the maintenance,
which used to be often neglected in the earlier regime of annual funding allocations and
contracts.
