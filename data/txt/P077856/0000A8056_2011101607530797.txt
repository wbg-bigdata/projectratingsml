                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There has been significant progress on works component of the project as well as a steady progress on most of the actions agreed during the last mission, which has turned around
                         overall project implementation situation to a satisfactory level. However, there are three key areas of concerns - (i) the need to expedite the proposed implementation of the
                         Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System; (ii) Continued lack of staffing at the Road Safety Cell (RSC) of NHAI and; (iii )need to expedite the procurement of DPR consultants for
                         Safer-Greener-Highway Pilot.
