        Honorable Minister,

                                   Sierra Leone: Multi Donor Trust Fund for
                Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (Grant Number TF056653)
                                      Amendment to the Letter Agreement

                 We refer to the Letter Agreement (“Agreement?) dated July 21, 2006, as amended, between
        the Republic of Sierra Leone (“Recipient?) and the International Development Association (“World
        Bank?), acting as administrator of grant funds (“Grant?) provided from time to time by various
        donors (“Donors?) for the above mentioned Multi Donor Trust Fund (“MDTF?) established for the
        co-financing of the Sierra Leone Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (“Project?). We
        also refer to the Senior Deputy Financial Secretary’s letter of June 29, 2011, requesting a reallocation
        of the Grant proceeds.

               We are pleased to inform you that the trust fund account has earned investment incomes
        and that we concur with the reallocation request. Consequently, we propose to amend the
        Agreement as follows:

        1.      Annex I of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and is replaced with the new Annex I
                attached to this amendment.

        2.      The table in paragraph 4.2 of Annex II to the Letter Agreement is deleted in its entirety to be
                replaced with the following:
