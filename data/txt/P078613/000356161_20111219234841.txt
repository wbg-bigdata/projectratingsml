1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       After independence in 1961, Sierra Leone socio-political context has been shaped by an
increasing reliance on patronage and state violence as the main strategy to maintain and exercise
political power. This strategy reached its peak under the regime of Siaka Stevens. Under his rule,
elected local councils were abolished in 1972 and governmental power was centralized in the
hands of the elites in Freetown. Under the auspices of patrimonial politics, corruption became
rampant; politicians’ general lack of accountability contributed to a rapid decline in the economic
performance and the subsequent collapse of public services from 1970s to 1980s (Kpundeh 1995;
Reno 1995). This magnified popular discontent, marginalizing wide sector of the population and
eventually bringing the country into a decade-long civil war in which an estimated 70,000 people
died, thousands were maimed, and half of the population was displaced.

2.       By the end of the civil war in 2002, Sierra Leone had many pressing needs for recovery
and reconstructions. The war prompted an exodus of professionals and businessmen, doubled
Freetown’s population, wrecked most of the infrastructure, business and much of the housing
stock, and caused a cumulative decline of 48% in GDP per capita. What little infrastructure
existed collapsed during the war, and the country ranked at the bottom of the UN Human
Development Index. The combined pressures to mitigate the root causes of the conflict and
deliver rapid “peace dividend? through the country implied that state capacity would have to be
built in parallel at the central and local level, or even prioritized at the latter. Consequently, an
agenda for decentralization reforms – originally launched in 1996 – was reactivated and featured
prominently in the Framework for Peace, Recovery and Development in 2002 and set the stage
for the policy dialogue between the GoSL and the development community.

3.       In the view of both GoSL and Development Partners, decentralization was then seen as
contributing significantly to defusing societal tensions and the alienation of the rural population,
while at the same time restoring public service provision and steadily expanding it. Accordingly,
the revival of sub-national - democratically elected - political institutions (after 32 years of
centralized rule) was identified by the SLPP-led government as the primary strategy to build
popular legitimacy, sustain political stability, and reverse the massive urban/central bias which
characterized Sierra Leonean postcolonial politics and led the country into war. This strategy was
also combined with a sustained attempt to re-legitimize the institutions of the Paramount Chiefs,
the ‘traditional’ authorities whose popularity and legitimacy had been greatly weakened during
the period of the civil war. (Srivastava and Larizza 2011; Hanlon 2004).

4.       The process of decentralization formally began in 2004, with the passage of the primary
legislation, the 2004 Local Government Act. (LGA). The LGA established 19 Councils (13 rural
and 6 urban), reshaped the administrative, functional and fiscal inter-governmental relationships
between the central government and the sub-national authorities and identified a four year period
of transition (to end in 2008) during which governmental functions would be devolved in phases
(specified in the Statutory Instrument attendant to the LGA). After that initial phase, the
devolution process was to be completed, including thorough revisions to the legal, institutional,
and administrative structures and systems in place2.

 A more in-depth description of the legal framework established through the 2004 LGA in terms of
political, fiscal and administrative decentralization can be found in Glynn, Larizza and Vinuela (2011a).



                                                    15
5.       The government also recognized the importance of effective public financial management
(PFM) systems to ensure efficient and effective use of scarce public resources. As substantial
resource transfers to local governments were planned under the new decentralized system, the
establishment of a legal and regulatory framework, robust systems for decentralized budget,
execution, accounting and the availability of adequate human resources capacity were urgently
needed. The immediate challenge was therefore to design and implement a decentralization
program to translate what was a national strategic priority into the reality of a development
project.

6.      Consistent with the World Bank Transitional Support Strategy (2002-2004) for Sierra
Leone, the Bank’s Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP) was designed and
approved in 2004 as a major instrument to support the landmark institutional reform envisaged in
the LGA, focusing on decentralization, PFM, and capacity building for local governments.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The original PDO of the (IRCBP) is to support the post-conflict Government of Sierra
Leone (GoSL) to establish a functioning local government system and improve inclusiveness,
transparency, and accountability of public resource management at all levels of government.3
The original PDO indicators of the IDA Grant were the following4:

          At least 19 elected local councils are able to make development plans that respond to
           local priorities through a participatory process.

          At least 19 elected local councils are able to make budget consistent with Section 67 of
           Local Government Act 2004.

          Number of elected local councils which were able to meet the transparency and the
           financial management accountability requirement as per Local Government Act 2004
           (Section 107, 81, 105).

          At least 14 out of 19 elected local councils are able to complete the projects submitted in
           previous year's work plan.

          At least 14 out of 19 elected councils are able to deliver all services devolved to them at
           the levels of the year before devolution.

          At least 14 out of 19 elected LCs receive a tied grant for each devolved service, at least
           that amount necessary to continue the operation and maintenance of that service at the
           standard prior to devolution.

          At least 90% of donor funding is captured in the fiscal reports using government budget
           classifications by program and object of expenditures.

3
  This PDO is slightly different from the project objective in the Development Grant Agreement, which
states that the objective of the project is to assist the Recipient to establish a functioning local government
system and improve inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability of overall public financial management
at all levels of government. The re-wording from “public resource management? to “public financial
management? was done merely to specify more clearly the more intent of the PDO.
4
    These indicators were later revised when the MDTF was restructured in 2010.


                                                     16
       At least 90% of Vote Controllers, within 10 days after end of month, submits to the FS
        actual revenue and expenditure for the preceding month and estimated revenue and
        expenditure for the month.

       At least 90% of reporting entities have unqualified audit reports by the Auditor General.

       In-year reports are published regularly for tracking poverty expenditure by function.

       Public Procurement Law enacted, embracing the principle of transparency, accountability
        & efficiency.

       At least 90% of the funds provided for procurement is effectively utilized.

1.2 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

7.       The PDO was not revised. However, the following PDO indicators were refined at the
time of the restructuring in 2008 to make them more precise so as to facilitate monitoring, and to
comply with the GoSL’s legal framework. These changes did not constitute any change in the
original project scope:

    a) “14 of the 19 elected local councils are able to deliver all services devolved to them at
       the levels of the year before devolution? was modified as: “14 out of the 19 elected
       councils are able to maintain the coverage and quality of five key devolved services –
       primary education, primary health, agriculture extension, water and sanitation, and
       maintenance of feeder roads – at the levels of the year before devolution.?

    b) “95% of Vote Controllers submit regular in-year and annual budget execution reports to
       MoF and the relevant minister on time? was modified to read: “95% of Vote Controllers,
       within 10 days after end of month, submit to the Financial Secretary and the relevant
       minister actual revenue and expenditure for the preceding month and estimated revenue
       and expenditure for the month?. This was more precise and reflected the requirement of
       the new Government Budget and Accountability Act (2005) which was passed after the
       project approval in 2004.

8.      When the IDA Grant closed in March 2009, activities under the original Component 1
(Decentralization and Capacity Building) and Component 4 (Project Coordination) continued to
be implemented until June 30, 2011 with MDTF funding. In view of what had already been
accomplished at the time of IDA Grant closure and to reflect new priorities of the GoSL and
Development Partners (DPs) going forward, a new Results Framework (RF) was formalized in
December 2010 through the MDTF restructuring that scaled-up the project. The original PDO
indicator on the “Number of elected local councils that meet the transparency and the financial
management accountability requirement as per Local Government Act 2004 (Section 107, 81,
105)? was re-casted to “All 19 elected local councils continue to meet the transparency and the
financial management accountability requirement as per Local Government Act 2004 (Section
107, 81, 105)?. Secondly, three new PDO indicators were introduced:

    a) “ Number of Local Councils meeting all minimum conditions on CLoGPAS?;




                                               17
      b)    “Number of Local Councils meeting the threshold for the performance measures bonus
           (or Performance Incentive Grants) of CLoGPAS?; and

      c) “Percent of general population seeing improvements in health and education services?.

9.      Finally, a revised set of intermediate indicators was formulated in order to more
effectively monitor the expected outcomes of the additional activities required to advance
decentralization that were not included in the original project design addressing legal, policy,
chiefdom governance, outreach and training capacity issues.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     Given the nature of the project which focused on developing institutions and systems in
the government (both at national and sub-national level), the PAD does not specifically identify
the primary target group. However, the PDO and the key performance indicators indicate the
target beneficiaries broadly included all 19 elected local councils, the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Local Government and Community Development (MoLGCD) 5 , other ministries,
departments, agencies (MDAs) benefiting from the financial management reforms including
procurement reforms and ultimately the local communities whose living conditions are expected
to improve as result of the restored local state structure e.g bridges and better provision of and
access to basic public services such as health, education, etc. .

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

11.        At the time of approval in 2004, the project components were as follows:

12.      Component 1 - Decentralization and Capacity Building (US$14.3m) was designed to
finance the design and implementation of the government Decentralization Program. Specific
activities were: (i) establishing and strengthening the policy advisory and strategic management
role of the Decentralization Secretariat (DecSec), MoLGCD and the Local Government Finance
Department (LGFD), MoF, so to equip them to lead the implementation of the Decentralization
Program; (ii) providing some modest start-up investment in office infrastructure, communications
equipment, and vehicles to local councils; (iii) supporting the DecSec to manage an ambitious
capacity building program to support decentralization; (iv) financing the Local Government
Development Grant (LGDG) system with the objective of helping local councils quickly establish
credibility and capacity in development planning and execution; and (v) financing a range of
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities, including monitoring for due diligence purpose,
monitoring and evaluating for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of capacity building,
monitoring and evaluation for the purpose of ensuring the sustainability of the fiscal
decentralization strategy, evaluation of the impact of fiscal decentralization on infrastructure
development and service delivery, and evaluation of the social impact of decentralization.

13.      Component 2 - Public Financial Management (PFM) Reform (US$6.2m) was
designed to support the implementation of a PFM reform program. This would be achieved by: (i)
establishing the core policy advisory and implementation capacity for the PFM reform program;
(ii) designing and deploying a new Integrated Financial Management Information System

5
 The Ministry of Local Government was reorganized and renamed the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Local
Government and Rural Development in September 2007. In December 2010, another reshuffle in the
Cabinet split the Internal Affairs function and reorganized and renamed the Ministry of Local Government
and Rural Development (MoLGRD).


                                                  18
(IFMIS) to meet the control and information requirements of the decentralized system of financial
management; (iii) financing the development and implementation of an interim local government
financial management system and intensive training for local government financial management
staff; (iv) strengthening the MTEF process through technical assistance on how to improve the
Cabinet policy process, strengthen the linkages between policy objectives and budget proposals,
and use the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process as a key driver to motivate
vote controllers towards efficiency in management, and to reward budget entities for
performance; (v) financing the implementation of a new legislative and regulatory framework for
procurement; and (vi) carrying out re-assessment of the standard PFM indicators annually so as to
evaluate the impact of the PFM reform initiatives.

14.      Component 3 - Development Learning Center (DLC) (US$2.9m) aimed at
establishing an excellent information, communications, and training center to meet the demand
for capacity building which cannot be satisfied through traditional means and existing
institutions. The key support activities included: (i) establishing the DLC as an independent legal
entity; (ii) constructing the DLC facility, installing the required equipment, and recruiting staff, so
as to make the DLC operational; (iii) assisting the DLC become financially viable in three years;
and (iv) carrying out monitoring and evaluation to provide for consistent tracking of DLC
activities, drawing lessons, and improving on DLC operations.

15.      Component 4 - IRCBP Coordination (US$1.lm) was designed to ensure effective
coordination of the other components and strict compliance with the World Bank Financial
Management Guidelines and the Procurement Guidelines. Specifically, this component financed:
(i) an IRCBP Coordinator responsible for the overall coordination of the project; (ii) a Chartered
Accountant as the Principal Finance Officer; (iii) a Procurement Specialist; (iv) a M & E
Specialist responsible for setting up and maintaining an M&E system for the IRCBP; and (v)
technical assistance, training, and operational expenditures to strengthen the coordination and
monitoring function of the unit.

1.6 Revised Components

16.      One of the revisions undertaken in the project was the cancellation of the DLC
component during the 2008 project restructuring. The cancellation was carried out because of the
inability of the government to formalize an enabling legislation (a condition of the IDA Grant)
within 12 months of Grant effectiveness date, for the establishment of the DLC as a financially
autonomous entity with appropriate physical facilities and key staff and resources. The
cancellation was deemed justified based on Global Development Learning Network (GDLN)
experience in Africa at that time that raised questions of financial sustainability. The cancellation
was also based on the findings of the performance examination commissioned by AFTKIL that
indicated that “only one of the eight centers – the Senegal facility – appeared to have been able to
generate enough revenue through user fees to cover its annual operating costs?. The original
GDLN center business model as described in World Bank project documents that assumed that
each new GDLN entity would be autonomous or semi-autonomous and would achieve financial
self-sustainability in about four years was considered no longer valid in light of the cross-national
experience. Furthermore, without super-savvy business managers who can match capacity
development demand of the public and private sectors with global supply, the DLC could
possibly become a white elephant project that could drain GoSL budget.

17.      Since the DLC component was seen as a means to an end and not an end in itself in the
PDO, the cancellation had no direct effect in the achievement of the PDO for as long as other
alternatives were explored to build up domestic training capacity and learning network. One of


                                                  19
the alternatives identified was the Institute of Public Administration and Management at the
University of Sierra Leone which had been transformed under new leadership into an efficient,
high quality professional training organization. The other alternative was more intensive
development and implementation of relevant training courses from local providers. The latter
was already being supported by the MDTF.

18.      The other revisions pertain to the addition of the following sub-components to
Component 1: (a) Gender; (b) Information Management Support to the MoLGRD; (c) Chiefdom
Governance; (d) Training Service Providers; and (e) Mainstreaming. These changes also did not
affect the achievement of the PDO or the outcome targets.

19.     The savings from the DLC component were reallocated to the other project components.
The reallocation allowed the IRCBP to: (i) increase capacity building and training activities for
decentralization; (ii) extend activities under the PFM component to enable a smoother transition
to the new PFM project planned at the time6, including roll out of the IFMIS beyond the MoFED
and the Police Department to other MDAs; and (iv) support consultation, information, education
and communication activities which were judged important to support dialogue among key
stakeholders and community participation in the decentralization process. (See Table 1).

1.7 Other significant changes

20.    In 2006 additional funding for Components 1 and 4 was provided by United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DFID) (₤7,950,000) and the European Commission
(EC) (€9,100,000), through a GoSL-executed and Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund
(MDTF). At the time the total value of the commitments from DFID and EC was estimated at
US$25 million7. Although it was classified as a “co-financing MDTF?, it was designed to be
implemented beyond the implementation period of the IDA grant which closed on March 31,
2009 and for the MDTF resources to be available until January 31, 2011, original closing date of


6
 The Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMRP) was approved by the Board on
June 4, 2009.

7
 A Bank-executed component provides implementation support to the Bank including a senior public
sector specialist position at the Freetown Office who oversees the implementation on a daily base.

the MDTF agreement that was later extended to June 30, 2011. The additional financing to
support this scaling up of the IRCBP Project was provided by an MDTF Grant with an estimated
value of $27.2 million. The MDTF Agreement was also restructured December 2010 for the
following reasons:

       the amendment of the IRCBP Grant Agreement to include selected performance
        indicators to be used for project implementation;

       the extension of the closing date of the MDTF from January 31, 2011 to June 30, 2011, to
        carry out complementary activities under the Decentralization and Capacity Building
        Component and Project Coordination Component in order to deepen, reinforce and
        consolidate the gains to date,

       the amendment of the MDTF Program’s result framework to identify support for
        additional activities required to advance decentralization that were not included in the
        original project design addressing legal, policy, chiefdom governance, outreach and
        training capacity issues; and,

       the amendment of the DFID and EC Administrative Agreements to extend closing and
        disbursement dates and to reflect the additional resources to be administrated by the
        Bank.

21.      The extra funding resulted in increased resources for existing activities as well as the
provision of funds for additional activities (scaling up) that would promote further achievement
of the PDO. Furthermore, the establishment of the MDTF enhanced donor coordination among
development partners and made the implementation arrangement with the GoSL more effective.
Finally, the additional funding allowed to increase the project’s team by hiring a senior Public
Sector Specialist, based in Freetown up until October 2010. This adviser enhanced the quality of
support and supervision provided to the three implementing agencies and strengthened the quality
of coordination between development partners. Table 2 below indicates availability of resources
under the IDA grant and the MDTF for various components.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.     The post-conflict context had an important influence on the preparation and design of the
project. In view of the severe capacity constraints in the country, the task team faced the well
known trade-off between the objective of quickly delivering tangible results and longer term
objective of building sustainable institutional capacity. In view of the political nature of
decentralization, there was increased pressure to get the systems up and running as quickly as
possible.

23.      In order to support the establishment of sustainable local government systems the project
used an institutional approach at the national level which was a unique approach to addressing the
severe capacity shortage in government. Specifically, in addition to the IRCBP PCU (which was
                                                                                       8
a standard PCU/PMU), the project helped to establish three ‘implementing agencies’ financed
entirely by the project and staffed by competitively recruited local technical assistants (LTAs)
who received salaries significantly higher than the equivalent civil servants. Although the long-
term sustainability of this approach remains an issue of concern (more on this below), available
evidence suggests that the presence of competitively-recruited contract staff acted as a solid
catalyst of the reform process and accounts for the positive results achieved by the Local
Councils over time (Glynn, Larizza and Vinuela 2011). That is a huge upside. However, while
both LGFD and PFMRU were physically and functionally integrated within the MoFED, the Dec-
Sec was only formally included in the MoLGRD, remaining de-facto largely autonomous and
independent from it. Partially as a consequence of the continuous tensions between both
personnel and mandates of the two institutions, the working relationship between Dec-Sec
contract staff and permanent civil servants in the MLGRD remained poor. Finally, the issue of
what would happen at the end of the project was not addressed until rather late in the game with
the result that some of the Dec-Sec functions had not yet been mainstreamed in government at the
time that the project (MDTF) closed in June 2011.

24.     Another important contextual factor is the timing of the first country-wide local council
elections. In order to ensure support to the newly elected local councils (LCs), the project was
scheduled to be delivered before the local council elections scheduled on May 22, 2004. This
meant that there were less than nine months from the project concept review meeting in August
2003 to the board delivery in May 11, 2004 to prepare a technically complicated and politically
sensitive project. This may have restricted the Bank’s ability to conduct a more comprehensive
analysis of several complex issues surrounding decentralization in Sierra Leone, including (i) the
chiefdom reform policy and; (ii) the timing for the devolution of human resources.

25.     Micro-level factors also played an important role in shaping the preparation process and
design such as rivalry and bureaucratic competition between the MoF and the MoLGCD,
prompting the Bank to attempt to mitigate the risk that interagency politics interrupts the project
implementation. Recognizing the leadership role of both the MoF and the MoLGCD in the
national decentralization program, the Bank brokered a power-sharing deal between the two
ministries, under which the MoLGCD formally housed the Decentralization Secretariat that
provided overall coordination of the decentralization policy, legal, and regulatory matters and
capacity building activity while the MoF took over the three units, including the LGFD that
manages all the fiscal decentralization issues, the PFMRU responsible for the PFMR component,

8
 These were the Decentralization Secretariat (Dec SEC) of the MoLGRD and the Local Government
Finance Department (LGFD) and Public Financial Management Reform Unit (PFMRU) of the MoFED.


                                                22
and the PCU. It was also agreed that the directors of the DecSec, the LGFD, and the PFMRU
report to respective parent ministries and directors do not have a hierarchical relation with the
Project Coordinator who reports to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) consisting of the
Financial Secretary (Chair), Establishment Secretary, Permanent Secretary of the MoLGCD, and
other stakeholders. While this could mitigate the potential negative impact of interagency politics
and rivalry, it somehow made the task of overall project coordination and management more
challenging.

26.      Finally, and most importantly, the Decentralization program was at the top of GoSL’s
reform agenda, being perceived as a good opportunity to meet popular expectations, enhance
legitimacy of the post-conflict government, and strengthen the political support for the ruling
party. Largely driven by these political and economic interests, the commitment of the national
government was strong, with pressing demands for support to the internationally community. As
a leading member of the international Consultative Group, the Bank was expected to lead these
efforts to assist the GoSL in developing the national decentralization program. As a result, the
IRCBP was seen as one of the high priority projects in the Bank’s country portfolio and this
status certainly helped the Task Team mobilize necessary resources and support from Bank senior
management during preparation and supervision. For example, at the decision meeting in January
2004, the project funding was increased from US$20 million to US$25 million and a commitment
was made to increase the supervision budget.

2.2 Implementation

27.     Implementation progress has varied significantly across the components and
subcomponents. While the 2006 QSA review noted that overall project performance was good
during the early stages of implementation, the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007
and the subsequent change of the ruling party had the adverse effect of slowing down
implementation dramatically from early 2007 until late 2007. Because of that, the IRCBP was
unable to take prompt action on the series of recommendations identified in the 2006 Mid-Term
Review (MTR).

28.     Despite the carefully designed implementation arrangement, interagency politics and
competition were problematic as highlighted by the DLC component. Originally, the DLC
component was to be managed by the Establishment Secretary’s Office and later established as an
independent legal entity. After project launch it became clear that the Ministry of Education was
in strong disagreement with the Bank and the MoF took over the overall direction of the DLC
component and insisted that it should have supervisory responsibility over this component.
Despite high level discussion at Cabinet, with the President chairing, no compromise was found.

29.      In time, tensions developed between the IRCBP contract staff and regular civil servants.
This may have been due to the variation in salary scale between IRCBP contract staff (qualified
professionals) and the civil servants. In the MoF, this appeared to be somewhat mitigated by the
fact that senior staff - Financial Secretary, Budget Director, Director of EPRU, Accountant-
General – were themselves LTAs financed from donor resources. However, in the MoLGCD, the
relationship between the top civil servants and the DecSec were strained and the DecSec was
isolated from the ministry, undermining the project’s original intention to enhance policy and
implementation capacity within the MoLGCD through the training and integration of DecSec
contract staff designated to be change agents. The difficult relationship hampered the efficacy of
the DecSec.




                                                23
30.     The coordination challenges associated with the hybrid project management and
implementation arrangements which included the PCU, the three project financed government
departments, two key ministries (MoF and MoLCD) and other MDAs, increased. An area of
concern raised by IRCBP contract staff was lack of clarity on human resource management –
recruitment, selection, motivation, discipline, and termination of employment. Furthermore,
complicated implementation arrangements with parent ministries, poor internal communication,
and interpersonal disputes frustrated and demoralized a number of IRCBP staff. The government
addressed these concerns with the introduction of the pay policy reform. The government also
conducted on June 14, 2011 a consultative meeting chaired by the Director General of HRMO for
senior staff of MLGRD, HRMO, Ministries of Education, Health, Marine & Fisheries, Lands,
Labor, Information & Communications, Agriculture and Works. The objectives of the meeting
were to: (i) highlight challenges and bottlenecks in the process of devolution of staff; and, (ii)
agree on the action points on alignment with the decentralization. The meeting reached agreement
on the transitional arrangements under the National Decentralization Policy whereby all locally
operating staff will be employed directly by Local Councils by 2016. The following actions were
also taken by government: (a) Joint validation by HRMO and MLGRD of names of sectoral
Ministry staff posted to local council areas; (b) Preparation of model “letters of deployment? and
selection scheme; (c) Convening of a meeting to agree on models; and (d) Engagement of MDAs
on any perceived problems relating to parent legislation (e.g Education Act).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.      To track progress towards the PDO and intermediate results as well as enhance learning
from the project implementation, a detailed results framework was developed and three streams
of M&E activities were envisaged, including: (1) monitoring for due diligence purpose; (2)
monitoring and evaluating whether the development objectives are being achieved through
various surveys; and (3) evaluating whether the policy and implementation framework developed
under the project will be sustainable. An M&E plan was designed by each component and various
M&E activities, including data collection and analysis, were spread across the components and all
the four implementation agencies. The PCU was responsible for implementing an overall M&E
plan for the entire project. The results framework in the PAD lists a total of 9 PDO indicators and
16 intermediate results indicators (see Table 3 in Annex 2). The monitoring responsibility for
management of the M&E framework is embedded within Sub-component 1.5 (Monitoring and
Evaluation) under Component 1 (Decentralization and Capacity Building). In 2008, two outcome
indicators were refined to facilitate monitoring, and to comply with the GoSL's legal framework
(see Section 1.2). The refinement was not intended to scale down the indicators and it did not
constitute any change in the original Project scope. It was understood by all concerned that the
framework in the appraisal document provided a useful listing of project elements and the results
that were expected to be achieved. During the 2010 restructuring of the MDTF agreement, an
amendment of the M&E framework was undertaken to identify the support for additional
activities that were required to advance decentralization that were not included in the original
project design that addressed legal, policy, chiefdom governance, outreach and training capacity
issues.

32.     The Bank and the implementation agencies monitored the indicators with regularity. The
start was delayed due to delays in recruiting project monitoring officer. After the initial delay,
project monitoring appeared to have functioned relatively well as indicated by the ISRs. In
particular, as part of the effort to monitor and build capacity at local councils the Comprehensive
Local Government Performance Assessment Systems (CLoGPAS) was designed and
implemented in 2006 to serve as a sustainable local council management accountability
mechanism, covering both compliance accountability and performance accountability. After


                                                24
2006, two additional rounds were undertaken by the Decentralization Secretariat’s M&E unit in
2008 and 2011, respectively. Moreover, the results of the CloGPAS were also used to implement
a Performance Incentive Grant System, managed by the Local government Finance Department
(LGFD). The IRCBP’s evaluation unit also launched a series of evaluation studies and country-
representative national surveys to systematically document and tracks the impact of the project
activities and, more broadly, the quality of local governance and decentralized service delivery in
Sierra Leone such as National Public Services (NPS) surveys in 2006, 2007 an 20089. Designed
and carried out in partnership with the Abdul Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), the NPS
covers more than 6000 households nation-wide. (See Annex 5 for summary of key findings from
CloGPASS and NPS surveys).

33.      The evidence is mixed in terms of whether M&E activities effectively informed the
IRCBP operation or findings from M&E were used to improve the project performance. On the
one hand, one of the project’s M&E tools (the CloGPAS exercise) has been institutionalized as
one of the core benchmarking mechanism to establish allocation of resources to LCs under the
Local Government Development Grant (LGDG), aiming to support LCs’ development projects
On the other hand, although M&E was designed to be a key part of the IRCBP implementation,
capacity building and learning, the use of the project M&E framework did not fully move beyond
its traditional position as a compliance tool. In the last two years of project implementation,
however, the task team pursued more strongly in advising and assisting the government to more
effectively using the M&E framework as a management tool in assessing performance and taking
corrective actions that may be needed to achieve results according to agreed plans.

34.      The rich source of administrative/survey data and reports generated by the IRCBP
evaluation unit have also had mixed impact. On the one hand, the reports have been shared with
government departments, local councils, donors, and some civil society groups. A good
relationship was developed with the Ministry of Health with joint surveys developed which fed
back into the workings of the ministry and the World Bank health project. Some donors have
used data from the household NPS survey to design new projects and inform sectoral
interventions. One the other hand, however, the data have been underused compared to their
potential. The lack of the advanced technical skills required to analyze micro survey data –
within the ICRBP team as well across government’s agencies - might have been a factor limiting
the integration of data and reports into the broader policy decision-making process of the
government.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.      Financial Management. The project’s financial management risk was rated substantial
at appraisal. Performance of financial management was rated less than satisfactory on numerous
occasions during implementation primarily because of the operational bottleneck of the GoSL’s
insufficient counterpart funding and persistent delays in processing the withdrawal applications
by the MoF. Initially, it was estimated that the GoSL would contribute $3.07 million for local
expenditure and taxes. Yet, due to national budget constraints, only $736, 972 was deposited to
the project account. The insufficient counterpart funding became a source of delays in activities
related to local council infrastructure. In view of this constraint, the Bank restructured the
project in January 2008 by amending the financing percentage of the IDA grant to 100% for all


9
  The fourth round of the survey was expected to be completed by project closure (30 June 2011), but due
to delays in the data collection process is now expected to be completed by spring 2012.



                                                   25
expenditure categories. It should be noted, however, that local counterpart financing issue was an
issue that affected not only IRCBP but the entire portfolio of the Bank in Sierra Leone.

36.      Procurement. Given the high procurement risk environment in the country, the Bank
team closely monitored project procurement activities and every supervision mission carried out a
procurement post review. The performance of procurement within the PCU remained satisfactory
without facing any major issue for the entire period of project implementation. While the MTR
in December 2006 noted administration of procurement at LC level as moderately satisfactory,
this was mostly attributed to the inability of LCs to follow all the procedures due to weak
capacity. This issue was addressed by the project through more intensive supervision and post
review. It should be noted, however, that overall procurement management across local councils
significantly improved in the last three years (2008-2010) especially since the establishment of
the National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA). The NPPA’s key roles are the following: (a)
regulate and harmonize public procurement processes in the public service; (b) decentralize
public procurement to procurement entities; and (c) promote economic development, including
capacity building in the field of public procurement by ensuring value for money in public
expenditures and the participation of qualified providers across the country.10

37.     Disbursement. The amount approved under the IDA Grant was SDR16.8 million (see
Annex 1) of which almost the entire amount was disbursed. SDR 21,959.86 (approximately US$
35,000.28) was cancelled due to the cancellation of some parts of the local government grants
caused by inadequate attention and oversight by the PCU. The total amount provided by DFID
and EU was US$27.8 million of which about US$ 26.1 (94%) was disbursed.

38.     Environmental Assessment. The environment category of the project at appraisal was B
because the project’s local grants were designed to finance infrastructure development activities
which may have some environmental aspects. The environment safeguard compliance had been
rated satisfactory until a review study in July 2008 that showed that the Bank approved
environmental and social management framework were not being used and no environmental
monitoring were conducted at the local level. Among the actions taken to address this issue was
the recruitment of local and international consultant who developed the ESMF manual. In
addition, relevant personnel of the Local Councils and relevant service providers were trained on
the procedures described in the manual. It should be noted that the rating given prior to
December 2008 ISR of “satisfactory? was based on the assumption of no safeguards issues. This
rating was downgraded to “Moderately Satisfactory? until the time of the MDTF closure in June
2011 after the introduction of the ESMF manual.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     The main challenge of the post-completion operation is how to build on the achievements
of the IRCBP to expand the scope of decentralization and public financial management reforms
and scale up interventions for institutional development and capacity building in alliance with the
GoSL’s broad development objectives and priorities.



10
   This is based on the findings of the Technical and Procurement Audit Reports (2009 and 2010) as well as the PEFA
2010 report.




                                                       26
40.       The following streams of interventions continued:

      a) The Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) to channel contributions from DFID and the EC in
         2006 to expand the scope and finance additional activities and to continue to operate the
         Decentralization and Capacity Building component of the IRCBP from the end of the
         IDA funding in March 2009 until June 2011. The key focus of the support was to address
         some key issues going forward, including integration of the DecSec into the MoLGRD,
         capacity development within the MoLGRD, devolution of human resource management
         to local councils, and strategic communications and outreach to the public.

      b) The IPFMRP project (US$20.9 million) to continue to support GoSL in sustainably
         improving the credibility, control and transparency of fiscal and budget management.
         The ongoing IPFMRP is jointly financed by IDA, DFID, and the EC with support from
         the African Development Bank and GoSL counterpart funds. The IPFMRP was approved
         by the Board on June 4, 2009 and become effective on December 15, 2009.

      c) The Decentralized Service Delivery Program (DSDP) for US$20.0 million to improve the
         quality and access to decentralized service delivery of social services in health, education,
         water, and solid waste. The DSDP was designed to strengthen institutional and
         organizational capacity at the central and local levels to enable local councils to carry out
         their core devolved mandates and functions, and enhance the quality and impact of the
         performance on actual service outcomes.

41.    Last but not least, a pre-identification of a Public Sector Pay and Performance Project is
underway. The project is envisioned to assist the government in implementing the Pay and
Performance Reform/Improvement program laid out in the government’s Pay Reform Strategy of
2011-15.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.      The determination of the project’s objectives and its design were firmly rooted in the
situational context of Sierra Leone in the aftermath of a decade of severe civil strife, community
dislocation and physical devastation. Even prior to the official conclusion of the war in early
2002, the Government’s draft Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (Sept.2001) had
identified decentralization as a priority in governance to secure the peace and to rekindle
development across the national territory, while economic recovery was inter alia to be
underpinned by greatly strengthened public financial management. These priorities were
reflected in the Bank’s Transitional Support Strategy (March 2002) in which the preparation of
the IRCBP was linked. The project, therefore, had high relevance since its inception. This
relevance has remained undiminished during implementation as the change in political
administration left unaltered the commitment to the decentralization by devolution reform and the
deepening of the process is highlighted both in PRSP 2005-2007 (as a “key strategy? under Pillar
1) and PRSP 2008-2012 with an emphasis on effective service delivery for sustainable human
development.

43.     The challenges associated with the condition related to the passing of the legislation for
the establishment of the DLC was probably not fully appreciated at the design stage. As
explained earlier and in retrospect, the eventual cancellation of the DLC component was assessed
as having no impact on the achievement of the PDO.


                                                  27
44.     The trade-offs associated with the chosen implementation arrangements are discussed in
section 2.1 and lessons are drawn in section 6.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

45.      The PDO was to support the post-conflict Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) to
establish a functioning local government system and improve inclusiveness, transparency and
accountability of public resource management at all levels of government. In terms of the PDO
indicators, almost all the targets were achieved (see Annex 2). In 2010, additional funds were
received from the MDTF to scale up the activities under Component 1. Therefore, three new
PDO indicators were introduced to monitor and measure achievements of the scaled up activities
that were not included in the original project design with respect to legal policy, chiefdom
governance, outreach and training capacity issues. Empirical evidence collected through (i)
Aides memoire, (ii) the ESW “Decentralization, Democracy, and Development? undertaken
under the project, (iii) a growing body of analytical work carried out by the Bank and
independent researchers using the rich set of data generated by the projects and, ultimately, (iv)
perceptions of various stakeholders interviewed for the ICR consistently and strongly attests to
the positive impacts of the project activities and the overall success of decentralization reform in
Sierra Leone.

46.      While ambitious in its expectations, the IRCBP project had no guaranteed prospects of
success. On the one hand, several governmental agencies resisted the decentralization process
and tried to delay the devolution of functions to LCs. On the other hand, the fragility of post-
conflict institutional architecture created additional challenges: first, as indicated above, in 2004
the presence of the state outside Freetown peninsula simply collapsed and had to be rebuilt from
scratch. Second, human capital both at national and local level was a massive impediment for any
large-scale interventions aiming to restore local governance. Third, the institutional and
collective memory of the Local government system in the country was buried under more than 30
years of hyper-centralized rule.

47.      Despite these countervailing forces, however, the new disposition for local government
has taken on a momentum and maturity cementing its institutional presence in the architecture of
the state. The process of decentralization has become institutionally embedded, as reflected in the
two rounds of democratic local elections and the growing legitimacy in the eyes of the population
of the elected structures and avenues for the expression of development priorities. This success is
also reflected in the reduction of bureaucratic inefficiencies achieved through a fully functioning
intergovernmental fiscal transfer system established on an equitable and transparent basis which
is universally accepted. Para 48 and 49 below provide summary evidence of PDO achievement.
[Annex 2 contains a detailed assessment of the project’s achievements by component and
outcome indicators, and provides additional evidence to support and justify the project rating].

48.     Established functioning Local Government System. Institutional and organizational
structures of sub-national government have been fully reestablished in the country. Local
councils are fully staffed with core skills in the areas of development planning, internal audit,
monitoring and evaluation and procurement. According to the CLoGPAS assessment, the
number of LCs that met (or partially met) the ‘minimum conditions’ in critical functional areas
has significantly improved between 2006 and 2011. [See Figure 5.1 in Annex 5]. Local Councils


                                                 28
hold regular meetings and produce minutes, participatory development planning has taken root,
accounts are completed on time, and regularly audited and financial information is disclosed. The
latest PEFA report provides additional evidence consistent with these trends, showing that in
2010 local councils received the highest scores on key dimensions of budget execution and
accounting practices scoring higher on these dimensions than the national government (Srivastava
and Larizza 2011). The re-establishment of the functioning systems also brought about notable
improvements in service delivery particularly in the health and education sector. Among other
things, surveys conducted for the period covering 2005 to 2008 showed that: (a) public
satisfaction with health services improved from 81.0% to 90.6%; (b) more rural citizens were
within reach of a primary school than they were in 2005; and (c) the percentage of households
with access to school within 30 minutes’ walking distance increased from 68.3% to 74.3%.

49.     Improved Inclusiveness, Transparency and Accountability of Public Resources. The
Local Government Development Grant (LGDG) funded the development budget of all local
councils. Budgets were released with minimum conditions in terms of implementing the plans
according to agreed standards on transparency and accountability. LCs implemented capacity
building activities for local staff in the areas of participatory planning, budgeting, financial
management, and project management. This helped ensure that local governments were staffed
with skilled individuals who are able to manage resources in accordance with new regulations.
Significant advance were made in laying sound foundations of PFM. All 19 local councils use
simplified (PETRA) system that interfaces with central government chart of accounts managed
through IFMIS. Other notable actions on transparency have been implemented such as the
posting on notice boards at LC offices relevant financial information on a monthly basis. Another
is the establishment of the National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA) (National Public
Procurement Act of 2004) in charge of the regulation and harmonization of public procurement
processes in the public service. One of its key functions is to monitor compliance with
accountability provisions of the new procurement law that requires tenders and contract awards to
be published on notice boards in conspicuous places at the Council Offices and various wards in
the localities. The new law also promotes the use of radio stations to air notices of tenders and
contract awards. These practices have been successfully implemented across the country. Last
but not least, procurement complaints mechanism had been put in place through the Independent
Review Panel (IPRP).

50.    By the aforementioned outcomes, the PDO has been substantially achieved. There is a
good pattern of successful achievement across the broad operational span of the objective.

51.      Achievement of the targets was facilitated by the PCU who were staffed with highly
skilled LTCs. As already discussed, this was a unique approach which had helped facilitate
implementation of project activities. This action was taken to address the severe capacity (and
motivation) shortage in government. Most likely, decentralization would not have taken off and
got established if this approach was not taken. On the downside: (i) there were tensions between
these agencies and "real" government counterparts; (ii) the issue of what would happen at the end
of the project was not addressed until rather late in the game with the result that some of the
functions (mainly those of the DecSec) are not yet mainstreamed in government. The issue with
integration of DecSec, however, is actively being addressed by GoSL within the framework of the
new pay reform strategy.

3.3 Efficiency

52.      At appraisal, a cost-benefit and financial analysis was not carried out because of
difficulties in identifying and quantifying the direct and indirect financial, economic, and social


                                                29
benefits, and attributing specific outcomes to interventions. The signed amount for the IDA
Grant in July 2004 was SDR 16,800,000 which was equivalent to roughly US$26.8 was relatively
efficiently utilized until closure of the IDA Grant in March 2009. With respect to the MDTF
Grant of US$25.3 million, approximately 94% was also effectively disbursed. At all times during
project implementation, funds were used with the view to ensuring cost efficiency and best value
for money. This was evidenced by the fact that all financial transactions were fully verified
before disbursements were made for the acquisition of goods, implementation of local civil
works. Selections of consultants were carried out competitively and in accordance with agreed
procedures (World Bank guidelines and Procurement Law of GoSL) that also promoted
intensively the principles of best value for money. The introduction of the local automated
financial systems linked to IFMIS and adoption of competitive procurement procedures became
important key tools for helping the LCs to adopt the least cost approach in the administration of
their budget.

53.     At project end, an amount equivalent to about US $35,000 was cancelled. The
dovetailing of MDTF funds with those of IDA also resulted in increased absorption rates (LGDG,
Council infrastructure provision) across project activities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

54.      Several senior administrators interviewed for the ICR stated the success of the IRCBP in
providing financial/technical resources and strong implementation intent behind the government
decision to pursue a policy of decentralization and improving PFM as core responses to the
country’s strategic priorities in the post-conflict environment. In the process of actualizing this
intent, the project has generated credence for the original policy initiative as well as helped to
confer legitimacy for the newly established structure of sub-national government through the
increasingly visible and effective operations of the Councils and improvements in PFM.

55.     Within this context of progress in the governance domain, the identified individual
shortcomings and under achievements in specific aspects of the project’s results do not justify a
corrective counterbalance to the satisfactory rating. In fact – again reflecting interviewee
commentary – much of the project’s success can be seen to have been at least partially pre-
ordained by the careful and participatory approach at the design stage and the valuing of the
IRCBP as a key facilitating intervention in the nation’s general developmental effort. The spin-
off of the project therefore has been noted as establishing approaches that will have lasting
importance including in center/local fiscal relations, capacity building modalities and inter
Ministry coordination.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

56.     As noted in Section 3.1 above, the project in its inception was responsive to the
Government’s strategic approach to poverty reduction. Although the original PDO did not focus
on social development, the additional PDOs added in 2008 put an explicit emphasis on improved
service delivery, with special focus on the health and education sector. In this regard, evidence
from the NPS surveys suggests that access to and quality of health services has improved
dramatically since 2005. Clinic infrastructures, availability of drugs and numbers of staff have all
improved with the result that public satisfaction with health service improved from 81.0% to


                                                30
90.6%. With regard to the education sector, more rural citizens were within reach of a primary
school than they were in 2005. The percentage of households with access to a school within 30
minutes walking distance increased from 68.3% in 2005 to 75.3% in 2008. This is recognized by
the IRCBP Evaluation Unit’s consolidated analysis from primary health care studies (2005, 2006,
and 2008) and the National Public Services surveys (2005, 2007). However, it is also observed
“that at the very least decentralization has been compatible with consistent improvements in
                          11
public service delivery.? Moreover, communities far from Freetown but close to a district
capital saw the biggest improvements in services, even holding constant the remoteness of these
communities. A reduction in “distance from power? – a direct byproduct of decentralization –
thus appeared to have had a positive impact on service delivery. These improvements are
remarkable if one considers the short time since the launch of decentralization and the fact that
local government performance continues to be constrained by several factors, including the
incomplete devolution of functions and line staff, the relatively small size and tied nature of the
transfers, and the unresolved tensions between local councils and the traditional authorities.

57.      Concerning the gender dimension, DecSec gave expression to a declared focus on this by
establishing a specialist post (staffed in acting capacity as of the time of this ICR) with a mandate
to devise a policy and strategy. Progress was slow but cooperation with other relevant agencies
was good. In general, the ESW publication identified gender and generational gaps in civic
participation. Encouragingly though, female councilor numbers rose from 12.7% to 18.9%
between the last two elections (in 2004 and 2008).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.       As discussed above, the effective integration of the DecSec into the MoLGRD remained
a work in progress. The plan for integration called for six steps starting with the review and
approval of Ministry functions going forward and included a skills audit, recruitment and
identification of capacity building needs. None of the substantive actions included in the plan had
been achieved yet but the following key actions were taken by government recently: (a) drafting
of the HR policy document for local staff (submitted after national validation session, now
awaiting cabinet approval); (b) convening of an interactive forum with HRMO; and (c)
facilitation of recruitment of 4 additional ‘core’ staff – Economist, Valuator, Gender Officer and
IEC Officer - for LGAs (selection made, recruitment not yet completed due to recurrent financing
discussions with MoFED).

59.     The Ministry presented an organizational chart which essentially divides the existing
Directorate of Local Government into two: a Directorate for Local Government and Directorate
for Decentralization. Just prior to the closing of the MDTF Grant, the Bank strongly
communicated the official approval for the proposed structure and the need for action to
adequately implement the mainstreaming with the view to filling of the established posts within
the Ministry in line with the competencies identified.

60.     The integration of the DecSec into the MLGRD is the more difficult for two reasons: (i)
the vision of the MLGRD continues to be of a DecSec financed by donors; and (ii) there are
reduced resources providing financial support for the transition. In view of the central role of the
DecSec in spearheading the decentralization agenda, this poses the biggest threat to sustainability.

61.      On the other hand, at the local level, the very establishment of functioning LCs where
none existed for three decades represents an institutional milestone. Interviewees who had served
in former appointed ‘committees of management’ typified the change to LCs as entities as a
switch to “legitimacy? (for councilors and managers) in the communities’ eyes. As previously
observed, however, important questions of HRM and accountability through the structures for
service delivery remain to be addressed satisfactorily. Notably, issues of personnel devolution
are yet to be properly streamlined. These include, re-defining the framework for the assignment
of devolved staff to LCs which should include the preparation of letters of deployment and
clarifying issues of accountability and reporting.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

62.     The reallocation of funds to PFM purposes following the restructuring allowed
additionally production of training/coaching efforts, technological support to systems and buy in
of the PFM system.

63.     The vibrancy and volatility in local politics engendered by decentralization measures
might not have been fully foreseen. Since 2004 a new generation of leaders has emerged in the
country whose interests are naturally aligned with the survival of decentralization. The two
rounds of sub national elections—held in 2004 and 2008, respectively—reported an increasing
level of competitiveness and managed to create a new class of local politicians. In addition, the
‘schooling’ of potential leaders through local structures appeared to have resulted into a positive
by-product.

64.       The process of decentralization has also promoted greater participation among all
citizens, including women (as captured by NPS – Annex 5), and increased power sharing across
ethnic groups. Indeed, traditionally marginalized groups such as women and ethnic minorities
have been the largest beneficiaries of the new space for political participation. While in 2004
women occupied 12.7 percent of council seats in council elections, in 2008 this increased to 18
percent, a higher rate of representation relative to the 12 percent share of women’s seats in the
national parliament. Finally, decentralization has also allowed greater participation and power
sharing among representatives from minority groups and smaller ethnic groups. In so doing,
more groups have a stake in the system, promoting prospects of political stability. This is a
remarkable achievement for a country that has emerged from a decade-long civil war.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

65.     As noted in section 2.3 above, the IRCBP evaluation unit has undertaken several rounds
of surveys to monitor the impact of the project activities on a wide range of beneficiaries. More
precisely, the 2006, 2008 and 2011 CloGPAS have captured the performance of Local Councils,
the ‘2008 Decentralization Stakeholder Survey’ captured the perceptions of Local Councilors,
and the NPSs captured the improvement in service delivery as perceived by the Local
Communities. Annex 5 summarizes the key findings from each of these surveys.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

66.      Six years after the decentralization initiative was launched, it has arguably taken firm
root, leading several observers to suggest that it would be very hard to reverse the process and re-
concentrate power at the center. Recent developments, however, suggest that pressures might be



                                                32
building to weaken decentralization, casting some doubt on the central government’s intentions to
unequivocally move the agenda forward. The recent reintroduction of the district officers in 2010
and the downgrading of the political status of the local councils provide some evidence of a new
‘containment’ strategy designed to protect the interests of the national elites and undermine the
emerging political power at the sub national level (Srivastava and Larizza 2011).

67.      The local councils remain highly dependent on grants from the national government.
Although the volume of these grants has increased over time and a larger proportion of budgeted
amounts are now being transferred, the lack of financial autonomy leaves the local councils
vulnerable to the whims of the national government. Moreover, the lack of control over frontline
staff weakens the ability of the local councils to influence the quality of services. Both of these
risks are exacerbated by the ongoing tensions between the Local councils and the chieftaincy
arising from a lack of clarity about their respective domains. All together, these risks represent a
significant threat to the prospects for sustaining and further strengthening decentralization
reforms in Sierra Leone.

68.     Finally, it is still not clear how the functions of the DecSec will be integrated into the
MoLGRD. Without the mainstreaming of these functions, there is a significant risk that skilled
contract staff will not be attracted and retained in the civil service weakening institutional
capacity and undermining sustainability of the decentralization reforms. A similar risk exists at
local level where the local councils had difficulty in recruiting/retaining capable staff for key
positions.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

69.     The Bank performed well under extremely tight schedule and strong pressure to meet
project objectives. The entire preparation until appraisal was done with full involvement and
participation of government officials. The design was consistent with the recommendations of
Quality Enhancement Review team for the project and the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS)
focused on institutional reform and capacity building at both national and local levels. The task
team was composed of individuals with the right skill mix during preparation. The preparation
was well coordinated with other development partners namely DfID, the EC, and UNDP. Even
though the task team identified weak implementation capacity, more effort should have been
taken to address the government’s core capacity to manage the M&E framework.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

70.     Based on the recommendation of the Quality of Enhancement Review team, supervision
was frequent (every four months) during the first 18 months of the project, allowing the task team
to provide on-site support to the project team. The task team provided prompt and relevant
responses to requests from the IRCBP team. The average period of response to requests for no-
objections and review of terms of references was five working days. High quality mission reports



                                                33
were prepared at the end of each mission. A comprehensive Mid-Term review was conducted
during which implementation issues highlighted and remedial actions were agreed upon.

71.       The Bank effectively and successfully partnered with the donors for getting behind a
critical reform agenda with the best possible instrument of coordination with the establishment of
a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) under the management of the Bank. The funds under the
MDTF extended and deepened project activities in decentralization.

72.      After the establishment of the MDTF, the TTL was heavily lobbied by the EU and DFID
to improve both the quality of dialogue between the Bank and its contributing partners, as well as
the day to day strategic guidance and advice to the program. The EU and DFID were concerned
that they were not receiving sufficient information and in-situ dialogue on the way in which the
IRCBP was progressing, nor did they have an immediately available contact point for the Bank
in-country to engage with on technical issues and considerations. Both the EU and DFID were
frustrated that it appeared that the only contact and serious engagement that they could have with
the Bank (and the GoSL implementing agencies) was when the Implementation Support Missions
(ISM’s) took place. To address Donor’s concerns, discussions between the Bank and the donors
began in December 2008 and agreement was reached that EU and DFID would earmark funds for
the recruitment of an ETC based in the WB Freetown office who would be answerable to the TTL
but would also work and discuss IRCBP technical issues with partners and GoSL counterparts.

73.     The ETC was formally appointed in September 2008 after initiating a rapid process of
recruitment that was recognized by the contributing partners as an extremely successful exercise.
For the EU and DFID in particular, the immediate availability and easy access to the ETC
provided significant re-assurance on the way in which their contributions were being utilized,
allowing for increased technical engagement on the program and a greater degree of
understanding of the decentralization processes and the impact that it would have on their
respective country assistance programs. The ETC also provided excellent support to the Dec –
Sec and Ministry activities and very quickly became a valued and embedded member of the team.

74.     Donor co-ordination, as a result of the recruitment of the ETC, has, therefore, helped
further improve the effectiveness of the implementation of the program that lead to positive
achievement of targeted results and outcomes of IRCBP. Both contributing partners were able to
retain an element of continuity in their understanding of their support to the program (despite
their own staff turnovers) as a result of the strong coordination efforts and the full time presence
of the ETC. The ETC also played an integral role by giving inputs on the scope of activities and
program for the successor intervention – Decentralized Service Delivery program (DSDP I and
2).

75.      Internal Bank handovers between TTL's and other Bank newcomers to the IRCBP were
also quickly and comprehensively facilitated by the ETC. The transition process was well
managed with adequate involvement of the subsequent TTLs in the MTR of the project and
timely preparation of detailed hand over notes. There was continuity in the Bank’s team and its
approach was pro-active, demonstrating flexibility in addressing issues. The task team’s focus of
realizing the developmental impact of the project ensured that project implementation was geared
towards the appropriate activities, that the objectives of the project were met and also ensured that
disbursements of project funds never lagged. The task team was forthright in proposing the
cancellation of the DLC component during the MTR. The fiduciary team provided the appropriate
support to the task team. A Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) conducted by QAG in
September 2006 rated the quality of supervision as highly satisfactory.



                                                 34
76.     The Bank, however, could have done better in addressing issues related to environment
safeguards, and anticipated better the challenges associated with the integration of the IRCBP
contract staff into parent ministries, and the workings and management of the IRCBP team. The
Bank also faced challenges in mobilizing the release of donor funds for decentralization in a
timely manner during the latter part of the project due to changeover of the EU TTL.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

77.      Given the satisfactory rating for quality at entry and the satisfactory rating for
supervision, ICR guidance requires overall Bank performance to conform with the outcome
rating, which is satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     Government's commitment was mixed. Even though Government was committed to
decentralization and the devolution of power which was evidenced through various Cabinet
documents and pronouncements of government officials, certain sector ministries (e.g.
Education,) initially opposed the devolution of their functions and it took a lot of effort (on the
part of DecSec and MLGRD) to get this resolved The initial project preparation was spearheaded
by the Governance Reform Secretariat (GRS) as the overarching agency of governance reform in
the country. GRS was able to rally various officials to participate in meetings to get the project
prepared. Subsequently, various stakeholders at national and district levels were consulted during
the preparation of the project. The then Minister of Finance and the Financial Secretary also
demonstrated commitment to PFM reforms.

79.     As agreed in the project documents, the Government constituted the TSC to provide
guidance to the project management team. Initially, the TSC did not function as expected.
However, there has been marked improvement in the functioning of the TSC. This was
evidenced by: (a) the expansion of the TSC to incorporate critical players in the decentralization
process such the Local Council Association, the HRMO, PSRU, and Civil Society; and (b) the
TSC met frequently and provided the required oversight and technical support to the project
implementation units. The Government was unable to provide all the counterpart funds
negotiated and agreed upon with the Bank especially before the project was restructured. The
long delays in the approval of withdrawal applications at MoFED at times posed significant
challenges with regards to cash liquidity at the project level. Some project activities had to be put
on hold until the withdrawal applications were approved and the project accounts replenished. As
noted earlier, however, the issue of counterpart funds was fully resolved when the IDA Grant
financing percentage was increased to 100% during the IDA restructuring in 2008.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

80.     Project management under PCU was mostly satisfactory throughout the implementation
period. Work plans were prepared annually as a guide in the implementation of the project.
Periodic procurement plans were also prepared and revised quarterly to reflect changes in the
work plans. As agreed upon in the Development Grant Agreement, project management reports


                                                 35
were prepared annually and quarterly that indicated progress and outstanding issues.
Procurement management was good as all the procurements that were undertaken followed the
procurement procedures outlined in the project documents. With regards to FM, adequate
financial records were maintained and annual external audits were commissioned on time and the
reports delivered to the Bank within the stipulated six months after the preceding financial year.

81.    LGFD, DecSec and PFMRU provided the appropriate capacity building, coaching and
mentoring to the LCs to understand their new roles and responsibilities in a decentralized
environment. PFMRU also worked with the relevant officials at MoFED, Accountant General’s
Department and other sector ministries to implement the reforms related to public financial
management.

82.      Both PFMRU and LGFD had good working relationships with MoFED and are regarded
as integral units/departments of the ministry. However, the working relationship between DecSec
and MLGRD was not consistent. DecSec initially started working well with MLGRD but later
this relationship deteriorated due to interpersonal differences, salary variations and (until 2010)
physical location of DecSec outside the Ministry.

83.     The Local Councils were rated satisfactory based on their ability to provide the plan and
execute local projects in a timely manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

84.      Given the moderately satisfactory rating for the Government's performance and the
satisfactory rating for the performance of the implementing agencies, ICR guidance requires
overall Borrower performance to conform with the outcome rating, which was moderately
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

85.      The GoSL and DP’s choice to define the ‘road map’ of decentralization by rapidly
enacting critical legislation– before the formulation of a National Decentralization Policy -
proved to be a successful strategy. The rapid enactment of legislation regulating the functions and
mandates of LCs prevented delays at the implementation stage by (i) de-facto blocking
interference by resistance groups in the critical start-up period and (ii) minimizing the space for
conflicting interpretations (such as the issue of the relationship between LCs and Chiefdoms) that
could stagnate the process. Once the 2004 LGA was in place, local elections took place, staff
were appointed to the LCs, grants started to flow and, in short, the show was on the road and on
an, arguably, irreversible, path. In turn, the late elaboration of the NDP (approved by Cabinet in
December 2010) made it possible to benefit from the experience of the early period and quickly
identify specific requirements for additional legislative harmonization and change

86.       The choice to establish an explicit deadline (2008) for the devolution process was also
critical to support the reform agenda. In the view of the legislative framework, the devolution of
functions did not need to await the development of adequate capacity within the institution of LC.
Accordingly, managerial staffing at the new local Councils was pragmatically organized by the
assignment of central civil servants to Chief Administrator (CA), deputy CA and Treasurer posts.
In this regard, the deadline for the function devolution was instrumental in keeping the



                                                36
momentum of the decentralization process and mobilizing demands for sustained capacity-
building efforts at local level.

87.      The sequencing of decentralization reforms - featuring the establishment of
democratically elected authorities first, and subsequently the progressive devolution of fiscal and
administrative functions) was critical to institutional success because the progressive
empowerment of locally elected political leadership – via increased resources and administrative
decision-making power – progressively enhanced accountability relationship with the citizens,
generating demand for services and thereby shaping the incentives for local politicians to deliver
and improve the quality of local services. This in turn enhanced citizens’ perception of LCs as
trustworthy and legitimate authorities.

88.     The design of a relatively simple and transparent intergovernmental fiscal system (first
generation grants) set the stage for predictable and (in general) timely vertical transfers to the
Local Councils. This enabled the effective functioning of LCs and ultimately gave rise to the new
structures and systems for sub-national government evident today with an established level of
governmental subsidiary..

89.      The modality of donor support to decentralization and, in particular, the use of LTA-
funded positions acted as a strong driver of the reform process. As discussed above, the creation
of project financed line agencies was a unique approach within the country environment in which
the project operated. The Dec-Sec was only formally included in the MLGRD, but remained de-
facto largely autonomous and independent from it. Although the long-term sustainability of this
model remains an issue of concern, evidence suggests that the project might not have achieved
the same results in the absence of these agencies. This requires further reflection on the benefits
and potential trade-offs associated with this model, and the extent to which it could be replicated
in other post-conflict and fragile countries undergoing decentralization reforms. The monitoring
of IRCBP activities has benefited from a rich set of survey data collected by the IRCBP
evaluation unit in collaboration with research organizations (J-PAL / IPA) and Statistics Sierra
Leone (SLL). These surveys provided a unique panel data series which had allowed to
systematically track progress of decentralization and impact of IRCBP activities, and had also
been used by Bank staff and researchers to inform new project designs across variety of sectors.
These positive externalities confirm the benefits of building multiple partnerships while also
suggesting the importance of maintaining the surveys going forward, by including them in the
national statistical plan of Statistics Sierra Leone. By doing so, the data and knowledge generated
by the IRCBP are likely to become (better) integrated into the policy decision making process of
government. At the same time, the under-usage of such data during the life of the project
suggests that in the future a stronger emphasis should be made in developing the required
statistical and technical skills across the project’s implementing agencies, to facilitate a more
effective institutional learning within the IRCBP team as well as across government agencies.

90.      Decentralization is one of the most contested and politically difficult reforms to
implement in any national policy. The experience of IRCBP suggests that the trajectory of reform
process is heavily influenced by the degree to which the often-conflicting incentives of different
actors play out. It also suggests that the outcomes of reforms can substantially alter the political
equilibrium in the country, re-shaping political economy dynamics and re-defining the position of
political and economic actors vis-à-vis the reform process. As indicated above, the risk of a
‘containment’ strategy put in place by the central government might well be a by-product of the
successful re-establishment of sub-national government. In light of this, the critical lesson for the
Bank and the donor community refers to the urgent need of continuing the support and
engagement with LCs, after the project closes. Such support is crucial to the mitigate the risks for


                                                 37
long-term sustainability of IRCBP achievements and help local authorities in their ongoing efforts
to meet citizens’ demands and perform their devolved functions,

91.     Trend towards the bi-lateralization of multilateral aid calls for rethinking and adjustment
of the Bank role. Financial support to decentralization from EU and DfID came on stream in
2006 and continued for components 1 and 4 of the IRCBP until June 2011. Thus strict co-
financing in actuality was confined to the mid years of operation although the active involvement
of partners predates this. The relationship between the Bank, donors and the GoSL has been
handled adroitly in these circumstances. In particular, a strong focus on a shared project
perspective and coordination was required when IDA funds were terminating, as the development
partners considered the non-continuation to be an unsatisfactory state of affairs and tended to
become more proprietorial about their own funding inputs as a result. There are important
lessons for future co-financing arrangements. In particular, the Bank administered MDTF project
without IDA funding changed the dynamics among development partners in terms of the
development partners perception that the Bank was the sole TTL. The general view, however,
was that the Bank was an agent and the development partners are the patrons which is not
consistent with the nature of the collaboration that the Bank and donors are equal partners. As
such, the role of the Bank on multilateral aid calls for rethinking and adjustment.

                                Annex 2 - Outputs by Component

1.      As indicated in section 3.2, an examination of the achievement of project results
(intermediate outcome indicators) provides enhanced explanatory value in support of the project
rating.

Component 1: Decentralization and Capacity Building

2.      The initial number of sub-components under Component 1 was increased from 5 to 10
with additional funds and later reduced to 5 towards project end.

Rating: Satisfactory

1.1 Strengthen policy and implementation capacity for decentralization.

3.       The operative legislation – the 2004 LGA and the accompanying Statutory Instrument
detailing the devolution timetable – were in place when project implementation began. This
provided immediate momentum for the reform agenda in moving to establish the machinery for
local government following the Council elections in mid-2004. The intention was to
subsequently reformulate the policy foundation for decentralization in the light of the early
administrative experience and, additionally, to carry out a process of harmonization of existing
laws with the LGA. The National Decentralization Policy has been developed, approved by
Cabinet and launched by the President; drafting instructions for the revision of LGA-04 has been
developed and submitted to the Minister, MLGRD, and a draft Chiefdom Governance Policy
prepared. The devolution timetable still applies and is pursued with individual MDAs despite
some deadline slippage. As earlier noted, the Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer System has been
established on firm and uncontested principles of operation.

1.2 Start-up investment in local government administrative infrastructure is effective and
    timely

4.       Each LC has been empowered to employ eight, non-sectoral, ‘core staff’ competitively
selected under the auspices of the Local Government Services Commission, with procedures of
the Guidelines for Human Resource Management (HRM) applying to their employment. All
devolved staff operating at LCs, however, remains attached to their respective MDAs as deployed
civil servants. The employment and accountability relationship between the Councils and these
staff is consequently not established on any legal basis. Despite much discussion around this
issue, no clear declaration has been made by Government on a definitive HRM regime to be
applied across staff categories.

1.3 Capacity for management and implementation of decentralized governance is
    incrementally strengthened.

5.       All LCs possess own-generated development plans on the basis of which annual budgets
are produced within a MTEF. Financial management and procurement capacity has been
progressively upgraded although qualifications on audit are still registered in a majority of cases.
Devolution of specific service delivery functions continues although with some particular delays
or blockages notably with the roads and water sectors. The generation of own source revenues
remains stunted, a situation that is not helped by the continuing lack of certainty as to the relative
distribution of revenue powers with the Chiefdoms. Budget Oversight Committees exist under



                                                 40
law and LC budgets and the results of public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) are popularized.
The accountability nexus is still seen as lacking, however, as with citizen engagement generally.

1.4 Build Local Councils capacity to design and implement infrastructure development
    projects satisfactorily.

6.       The early introduction of the Rapid Results Approach across Councils and the
introduction of related ‘quick wins’ promoted the legitimacy of the newly elected LCs in the eyes
of their communities. In this regard, an LGDG was designed both as a financing mechanism and
as an incentive mechanism to encourage local councils to adopt practices of transparency and
accountability and to acquire skills of participatory planning, budgeting, financial management,
and project management. The LGDG provided the incentive by stipulating the minimum
conditions for local councils to access the LGDG. The minimum conditions have been derived
from the Local Government Act 2004 and the the LC’s capacity to meet these conditions has been
assessed by the IRCBP Evaluation Unit through the CloGPASS exercise. The introduction of the
LGDG facility, its implementation manual and the annual assessment of eligibility provided the
opportunity for visible projects and disciplined allocations (a total of 240 projects totaling over 20
billion Leones). The degree to which there is full and active community participation in the
prioritization of projects remains a question however, reflecting a general picture of still limited
inclusion of the populace in LC affairs. The constraints faced at the LC level on civil works were
addressed with the recruitment of engineers for all 19 LCs.

1.5 Capacity to carry out effective M&E of the decentralization activities supported by the
    IRCBP and those of the broader GoSL decentralization programme strengthened.

7.       Decentralization dialogue forums were held on two occasions and evaluation survey
results have been widely disseminated including within the ESW publication “Decentralization,
Democracy and Development?. Three rounds of the CLoGPAS (2006, 2008 and 2011) exercise
were completed and results analysed with regard to capacity building requirements. However,
successive project aide memoires singled out project monitoring as a still underdeveloped aspect
of IRCBP activity and, further, questioned the sustainability of the Evaluation Unit’s work and
the mainstreaming of M&E combined into the Ministry for Local Government and official
national structures generally. In terms of regular Audit meanwhile, a backlog for LC accounts
continues though a concerted effort is to be made to clear this.

Component 2: Public Financial Management Reform

Rating: Satisfactory

2.1 Improved legislative and regulatory framework for PFM

8.       The Government Budgeting and Accountability Act was enacted in 2005 and the
Financial Management Regulations – covering also LCs – were gazetted in 2008. Regulations
specifically for the local government level have been in draft form for some time. This was due
to the fact the Regulations for Local Councils was put on hold because of the impending revisions
to the Local Government Act 2004. It was deemed (at the time) that it was not necessary to
finalize the draft Regulations when the principal law (LGA 2004) was under consideration for
review. Thus, the development of the Regulations in the IPFMRP was included and this will be
formalized in 2012. After this, the FM manuals will be finalized for the LCs which alongside
with the Regulations.

2.2 Implement a new IFMIS in MoF and one line Ministry

9.       Roll out of the system to ten Ministries had been accomplished. All of the financial
specialists interviewed for the ICR spoke of the significant benefits arising from the wide
installation of the system and spoke of it as the hallmark feature of the reform.

2.3 Implement interim local government financial management system

10.     All LCs are now using a simplified (Petra) FM system which interfaces readily with the
central government chart of accounts. Extensive FM training and coaching was conducted
throughout the project life both for accounts and non-accounts executive staff in an effective and
exemplary collaboration between PFMRU and LGFD. Monthly financial accounts are now
routinely produced by LCs.

2.4 MTEF process strengthened

11.     This did occur but specialist interviewees have suggested that it might have been done
with more rigors to embed the framework more securely as a planning and monitoring tool. In
particular feedback from ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) to the Accountant
General’s Department remains weak and implementation of the tracking of poverty reduction
expenditure is not as thorough as initially designed.

2.5 Procurement Reform

12.      The legislation and regulations are in place and the National Public Procurement
Authority convened the first National Forum in 2008. Procurement audits have yet to be
regularized. In their absence, adherence of MDA to procurement plans can be fully verified.
There is a generally expressed view by specialists that the LC Procurement Officers hired as ‘core
staff’ and specifically trained, exhibit higher expertise than their MDA counterparts.

2.6 Monitoring and Evaluation

13.     PFM Standard Assessment Indicators were updated on an annual basis as planned. The
PFM Oversight Committee meetings were convened regularly. The final PEFA report was
accepted by GoSL at the end of 2007 and the analysis contained in the report were used in the
design of the IPFMRP.

Component 3: Development Learning Centre

Rating: Cancelled

14.      The end-2006 MTR provides the full summary analysis underlying the recommendation
that the Component be cancelled and funds reallocated to further support PFM. The cancellation
was carried out because of the inability of the government to formalize an enabling legislation (a
condition of the IDA Grant) within 12 months of Grant effectiveness date, for the establishment
of the DLC as a financially autonomous entity with appropriate physical facilities and key staff
and resources. The cancellation was deemed justified based on Global Development Learning
Network (GDLN) experience in Africa at that time that raised questions of financial
sustainability. The cancellation was also based on the findings of the performance examination
commissioned by AFTKIL that indicated that “only one of the eight centers – the Senegal facility
– appeared to have been able to generate enough revenue through user fees to cover its annual


                                               42
operating costs?. The original GDLN center business model as described in World Bank project
documents that assumed that each new GDLN entity would be autonomous or semi-autonomous
and would achieve financial self-sustainability in about four years was considered no longer valid
in light of the experience. Furthermore, without super-savvy business managers who can match
capacity development demand of the public and private sectors with global supply, the DLC
could possibly become a white elephant project that could drain GoSL budget.

15.      Since the DLC component was seen as a means to an end and not an end in itself in the
PDO, the cancellation had no direct effect in the achievement of the PDO for as long as other
alternatives were explored to build up domestic training capacity and learning network. One of
the alternatives identified was the Institute of Public Administration and Management at the
University of Sierra Leone which had been transformed under new leadership into an efficient,
high quality professional training organization. The other alternative was more intensive
development and implementation of relevant training courses from local providers. The latter
was already being supported by the MDTF.

Component 4: Project Coordination

Rating: Satisfactory

4.1 Effective coordination of the 3 components of the IRCBP has been incrementally
    established and IRCBP implementation complies with the World Bank Financial
    Management and procurement guidelines.

16.     At all stages of project review and supervision FM and procurement arrangements were
adjudged adequate (with the exception of continuing delays in the processing of withdrawal
applications). The same was generally the case with project management. As it was conceived
and designed, the PCU Coordinator had no supervisory role over the Directors (other than with
regard to grant administration) for elements of the project. This was also reflected in the fact of
salary parity. As it was, the gelling of personalities allowed this arrangement to work but some
members of the PCU felt a more defined managerial chain of command would have further
benefitted project execution.

17.      Achievement of the targets was facilitated by the PCU who were staffed with highly
skilled LTAs. As already discussed, this was a unique approach which had helped facilitate
implementation of project activities. This action was taken to address the severe capacity (and
motivation) shortage in government. Most likely, decentralization would not have taken off and
got established if this approach was not taken. However, there were some concerns raised by the
PCU that the Technical Steering Committee did not assume its full directional and advisory role
for the project. It was also observed that there was increased distancing of project functions from
Ministry of Local Government regular activity (which was not the case with the MoF). Senior
Ministry personnel characterized their position as being marginalized and put in a back seat with
internal capacity building needs being ignored. Others consider that the Ministry never
sufficiently engaged with the project (perhaps being overwhelmed by its challenges) and ignored
the longer term sustainability issues despite frequent entreaties. The problem with integration of
DecSec, however, is being addressed and actions are being taken by GoSL to resolve these issues
in accordance with the new pay reform strategy.

18.     The final results and outcomes of the project are summarized in the Table 2.1. It should
be noted that the intermediate indicators used for Component 1 (Decentralization and Capacity
Building) were made more comprehensive to more effectively monitor implementation progress

                             Annex 5 - Beneficiary Survey Results14


This annex summarizes some of the key finding from IRCBP’s survey instruments designed to
systematically track and monitor the progress of decentralization reforms and the impact of the
activities supported by the project at the district and household level since 2004. In particular, the
note summarizes the progress of capacity-building efforts at LCs level and the extent to which LC
perform their ‘core’ mandated functions (section 5.1). It then reviews the progress made to date in
the delivery of basic services, with a special focus on the education and health sector (section
5.2).

5.1 Capacity-building at Local Councils: key findings from the CloGPASS reports

The Comprehensive Local Government Performance Assessment System (CLoGPAS) was
designed in June 2006 to serve as a sustainable local council management accountability
(compliance accountability and performance accountability) mechanism for the Local Councils,
devolving MDAs, Civil Society, the development partners, and other key stakeholders in the on-
going decentralization process of Sierra Leone. The framework has two dimensions: the
minimum conditions (MCs) and performance measures (PMs).

The MCs which deals with both aspects of local council management accountability, examine
functional capacities of the Local Councils in terms of their preparedness to take over devolved
functions and deliver services at the acceptable standards and assess/review the compliance of
Local Councils with existing laws and regulations that guide the decentralization process. The
MCs have seven (7) thematic areas1 with sub-indicators that define a specific thematic area. The
thematic areas of the MCs are as follows: (1) Financial Management (2) Functional Capacity in
Development Planning (3) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (4) Functional
Capacity in Budgeting and Accounting (5) Functional Capacity in Procurement (6) Transparency
and Accountability and (7) Functional Capacity of the Local Council.

The PMs which are more concerned about performance accountability assess Councils
operational proficiency in terms of effectively using existing and established
structures/institutions to improve decentralized service delivery, support good governance,
transparency, accountability and inclusiveness. Like the MCs, the PMs have seven broad thematic
areas: (1) Management, Organization and Institutional Structures ,(2) Transparency, Openness,
Participation & Accountability , (3) Planning System & Project Implementation Including M&E
,(4) Human Resource Management (5) Financial Management, Budgeting and Auditing , (6)
Fiscal Capacity and Local Revenue Generation , and (7) Procurement and Contract Management.
Figure2: Monitoring progress in Capacity-Building at the level of Local councils, 2006-2011

There have been three rounds of CLoGPAS in 2006, 2008 and 2011, respectively. Results have
been used to implement a Performance Incentive Grant System by the Local Government Finance
Department, as well as to identify capacity gaps in local councils and, more generally, to inform
and guide the decision-making process for key stakeholders in the Decentralization Program.
Figure 5.1 below shows the number of councils that met (or partially met) each of the seven
minimum conditions captured by the CloGPASS. As indicated, there have been significant

improvements in all ‘core’ functions of LCs, with remarkable achievements in areas such as
‘budget and accounting’ and ‘functional capacity’, where all 19 LCs fully met the minimum
conditions. Since 2008, a slight deterioration has been recorded for project implementation and
development planning. This is consistent with the ISR findings.

5.2 Access to and Quality of Basic Services at the local level

There have been three rounds of the National Public Services (NPS) survey in 2005, 2007 and
2008, respectively. Quality of services at health clinics has been also surveyed three times in
2005, 2006 and 2008. In 2005, a baseline report on the Quality of Primary Education was also
carried out.

Overall, the most important single finding is that the availability of basic services improved
dramatically between 2005 and 2008. As indicated by table 5.1 below, however, the improvement
is not, however, consistent or across the board, with some sectors making more progress than
others. More precisely, availability of services improved sharply with more schools and more
clinics since 2005. The number of rural households within 30 minutes of a primary school rose
from 68 to 74%. An even larger improvement was seen in the number of rural households within
1 hour of a clinic which rose from 48 to 61%. The single largest improvement was households
with access to water up from 61 to about 81 percent (an increase of about 30%. The one area
where there has been a sharp decline in services is agricultural extension where the percentage of
households who have spoken to an agricultural extension worker in the last year has declined
consistently and dramatically (from 23 to 9 percent).

In the education sector, fees remain a major barrier to use, effectively limiting availability.

55% in 2007. Of those not sending all their children to school, fees are one of the main barriers
according to households.

In the health sector a similar situation exists. Fees are charged for vaccines for children and for
medical care to under 5 years, despite the fact that both are meant to be free. Indeed there is no
difference in fees paid by the under fives and over fives. The trend is negative, 65% of
households who had a child vaccinated reported having to pay (includes charges for vaccination
card), which is up from 46% in 2007. Only 40% of households in 2007 said “someone without
money? could get free care.

Moving to the quality of health care provision, survey data suggest that there has been a sharp
improvement in health quality since 2005, with some slight deterioration and erosion of progress
made from 2006 to 2008 (Table 5.2).

 June 30, 2008 Targets for
 PDO Indicators                     Findings
 1. 19 elected local councils       Satisfactory. All 19 local councils have three-year rolling
 which are able to make             development plans. Councils have established ward
 development plans that respond     committees, technical planning committees (TPCs), and
 to local priorities through a      have annual work plans. The development plans were also
 participatory process and make     linked to the national PSRP and the MDG goals. All 19 LCs
 budgets consistent with Section    prepared the FY07 budgets that comply with the content
 67 of Local Government Act         requirements of Section 67. The only deviation has been
 2004.                              that the budgets were not completed 3 months in advance of
                                    the budget year as required, though they were all prepared
                                    by end December 2006. This is largely due to the local
                                    council budget circular not being issued by MoF until
                                    August; the Budget Bureau intends to bring forward the
                                    release for 2008 budget.
 2. 14 out of 19 local councils are Satisfactory.
 able to meet the transparency and S. 107: 14 out of 19 Local councils are displaying monthly
 the financial management           financial accounts, and 15 are displaying development plans
 accountability requirement as per on the LC and ward notice boards.
 Local Government Act 2004          S. 81: Financial statements have been prepared for 2005 but
 (Section 107, 81, 105).            none have as yet been audited. 2004 accounts for all LCs
                                    have been audited but in no cases was the management
                                    letter received submitted to the council.
                                    S. 105: All 19 councils have prepared asset inventories. 15
                                    have submitted them to the MLGCD, and 18 have updated
                                    them in 2006.
 3. 14 out of 19 elected councils Satisfactory
 are able to deliver all services Household data collected in 2005 and 2007 allows us to
 devolved to them at the levels of calculate indicators of Local Council performance in health
 the year before devolution.        and agriculture functions that devolved during that period:
                                    access to primary health care, satisfaction with primary
                                    health care, registration of births, registration of deaths and
                                    contact with agricultural extension agents. For each of the
                                    indicators, at least 14 councils were able to maintain or
                                    improve the level of services. Many councils had mixed
                                    results, however, with services declining in one area while
                                    remaining constant or increasing in others. As a result, only
                                    seven Local Councils were able to maintain or improve the
                                    services on all of the five indicators used.

4. 90% donor funding is captured   Moderately satisfactory. All programmatic assistance is
in the fiscal reports using        integrated into the IFMIS and fiscal reports. However the
government                budget   MoF has only partial information on donor funding
classifications by program and     received by GoSL and does not know the total. In addition,
object of expenditures.            while a significant number of projects are captured in the
                                   development budget, only IRCBP is currently recorded in
                                   IFMIS and included in financial reports.
5.    95% of Vote Controllers Unsatisfactory. There is no evidence that the Vote
submit regular in-year and annual Controllers are submitting budget execution reports to
budget execution reports to MoF either MoF or their ministers.
and the relevant minister on time. The intention of monitoring this indicator was to encourage
                                   accountability of vote controllers towards their ministers
                                   and MoF. This will be particularly important after they gain
                                   substantial budget autonomy under the ongoing PFM
                                   reform. The new Government Budget and Accountability
                                   Act (2005) also specifically requires the Vote Controllers to

                                   requirement is intended to help MoF to manage cash flow.

                                    This indicator was modified as recommended by the MTR
                                    to "95% of Vote Controllers, within 10 days after end of

                                    Government Budget and Accountability Act (2005). The
                                    councils have not adopted this practice.

                                    gazetted on December 21, 2006. Comparison with budget is
                                    provided against economic classification. Functional

                                    budget.
7. Public Procurement Law           Achieved. The Public Procurement Law was passed in

                                       the FY06 budget preparation. The procurement audit that
                                       should have been undertaken by NPPS with support from
                                       the IRCBP did not take place, making it impossible to
                                       determine performance of this indicator.

3.0       CHALLENGES AND OUTSTANDING ISSUES

         Unpredictable and inadequate resource transfers from the central government.
         Very low local revenue mobilization effort
         Resistance of some MDAs to decentralization
         Communication gaps between MLGCD & DecSec
         Difficulty to manage the IMC
         Lack of management culture for sustainability of infrastructure provided for LCs
         Lack of support to WDCs apart from training
         Poor Donor Coordination on Decentralization

4.0       SUSTAINABILITY

The sustainability of IRCBP successes involves a few dimensions:

         The sustainability of the local government management systems and basic capacity to
          mobilize local resources and manage local infrastructure and service delivery.
         The sustainability of the inter-government transfer system.
         The sustainability of the management capacity to continue the decentralization process
          and the PFM reform process.

As both the new inter-governmental relations and the local government management systems
have been emerging, they require constant monitoring, evaluating, and fine tuning to become
sustainable.

The IRCBP implementation arrangement was been designed under the principle that if new
structures are created to lead the reforms, they are created not as parallel structures of government
but rather as part of the government structures. Therefore, the integration of the project funded
units into the respective ministries must be given immediate attention.

There is a risk that the contract staff hired under the project will not be retained once project
funding ends. Given that the government staff is poorly motivated and with inadequate
qualifications, the current trend of adequately trained national staff leaving the public service to
join international NGOs and donor funded programs/projects will continue. The focus on the
transfer of skills by contract staff working in the decentralization secretariat to permanent
ministry staff was given more attention towards the end of the IDA funding. Government should
follow up on this to retain the gains made so far. A gradual reduction in the reliance on contract
staff during the next phase of the IRCBP (with parallel funding of the Decentralization and
Project Coordination components of the through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, which allows for
activities to continue until the beginning of 2011); and in the proposed public financial
management reforms should be encouraged, while increasing the capacity of permanent staff.

5.0     BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1     Bank

5.1.1   Lending:

The Bank's performance at lending is satisfactory, given that the GOSL participated fully in the
preparation of the project and the Bank fully honored its obligation at lending.

5.1.2   Supervision:

The Bank's performance was satisfactory. The Bank provided adequate implementation support
through missions to the country. Initially this was done every quarter of the year. After a year, the
implementation support missions (ISMs) were reduced to once every six months. All aides
memoires related to the ISMs were prepared on time and cleared by borrower before they were
officially issued. The task team leader that started the project stayed for three years. This was
good because it provided the project with consistency in management from the Bank end. The
mid-term midterm review of the project was conducted on time; and in a participatory manner,
involving the borrower. A formal report on the review was prepared and discussed with the
borrower.

5.1.3   Overall Bank performance:

The overall Bank performance is satisfactory

5.2     Borrower

5.2.1   Preparation:

The performance of the Government of Sierra Leone is rated satisfactory as it participated
actively and effectively in the preparation of the Project from 2003 till its appraisal in 2004.
During the period of preparation, Government officials showed their commitment to the project
by cooperating with Bank officials involved in the design of the project.

5.2.2   Government implementation performance:

Government performance is rated unsatisfactory, due to untimely and non-release of counterpart
funds; delays in the processing of withdrawal applications, the inactivity of the TSC; and the poor
oversight of the IMC.

The entire project period was characterized by persistent failure to release counterpart funds. In
instances where the counterpart funds were released, payments were delayed, and only a fraction
of what is requested in provided. For the 2004-2008 period, US$3,070,000 was allocated to the
project by GoSL. As at June 2007 before the Grant Amendment that led to the cancellation of
Government Counterpart funding, Le981,909,500 (equivalent to US$350,574) had been disbursed
to the project.

5.2.3   Implementing Agency:




                                               63
The implementing agency (PCU) is rated satisfactory. This is based on project management
expertise. Work plans were prepared on an annual basis to guide the implementation of the
project and these were submitted to the Task Team Leader after approval by the Project Steering
Committee. Project management reporting was well executed even though annual reports were
not prepared on time. Quarterly reports were prepared on time; and these indicated progress made
against planned objectives and issues planned for the next reporting period. In the area of project
financial management, the PCU kept good financial records and commissioned annual audit
reports within the specified period. The procurement process was well managed, as goods and
services were procured based on procurement procedures outlined in the project covenants.

5.2.4   Overall Borrower performance:

The overall performance of GoSL on the project is rated unsatisfactory due to the inability to
provide counterpart funding, the infrequency of the TSC and IMC meetings.

Lessons Learned

Lessons to be learnt from this project are:

    1. The project management design should be simple. There was a lot of difficulty with the
       reporting requirements, as each unit initially thought it could leave the Project
       Coordination Unit out in its reporting arrangement, dealing directly with only the
       supervisory ministry;
    2. The cost table developed at appraisal grossly underestimated the operational costs of
       project implementation; and for goods and services;
    3. The need for a review and revision of project design midstream to take into consideration
       external circumstances and more so if the country circumstances have changed;
    4. The importance of the supervisory role of the ministries should be emphasized in the
       project design, with an attendant funding provided in the cost table.

                             Annex 8 - Comments of Co-financiers

A. EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EU)

A.1 Background

1.       The EU has for long supported the Government of Sierra Leone in its decentralization
efforts. Under the 9th EDF Country Strategy Paper (CSP - 2003-2007), the overall objective of
focal sector 2 was to contribute to restore civil authority throughout the country and to establish a
participatory, transparent and accountable system of governance. To this end, support to the
decentralization policy was identified as one of the main intervention requirements to achieve
these objectives. Also the 10th EDF CSP (joint EU-DFID), in line with the PRSPII, foresees
continued support to decentralization efforts as a key intervention under the focal sector of
governance and institutional support.

2.       With the signature of Financing Agreement (FED/2004/017-038) in November 2005, the
EU contributed a total of EUR 10 Million to the decentralization capacity building program (9
ACP SL 018), via a World Bank managed trust fund for the Institutional Reform Capacity
Building Project (IRCBP). In November 2010, the EU agreed to a non-cost extension of the
project, extending the final project date to 30 June 2011.

A.2 Project Deliverables

3.      In this Financing Agreement, the EU and the Government of Sierra Leone jointly agreed
on the following objectives, purposes and envisaged results:

4.      The overall objective of this EU support was to provide efficient, transparent and
accountable delivery of services to the poor through the establishment of local governance.
The project purpose was to facilitate the devolution of functions and enable the local councils to
carry out their mandate in accordance with the Local Government Act (LGA - 2004) and other
applicable regulatory frameworks.

5.      The following results were foreseen:

        a) Major inconsistencies between existing laws and the LGA are resolved including
           clarification of roles and responsibilities between local councils and chiefdom
           authorities. The principle of decentralized governance is entrenched in the
           Constitution.

        b) Policy-making and implementation, monitoring capacity, information management
           and communication is strengthened for Decentralization

        c) Local Councils (LC) are provided with the adequate infrastructure and equipment
           means to carry out their mandate

        d) Councilors and LC professional staff have acquired the competencies for the LC to
           assume the delivery of core local responsibilities.

        e) National and Regional Training Service Providers progressively able to formulate
           and implement training to LC



                                               65
        f) LC have at their disposal discretionary development transfers enabling them to
           acquire and "practice by doing" their planning, budgeting, and management skills

        g) Progress and impact of the decentralization process are monitored and evaluated.

        h) The trust fund is managed in accordance with applicable procedures and guidelines.

A.3 Preliminary Comments

6.      Given these envisaged results and the project outcome reported in Table 2 of this ICR
(ICR00001045), the overall project performance can be described as satisfactory or partially
achieved. Please note that at this stage, the EU has not launched an independent evaluation or
audit and comments and observations are therefore to be seen as preliminary.

7.        The re-establishment of local councils including a finance system for local government is
in itself a major achievement in a country that -for decades- has seen deterioration in local service
delivery and massive decline of state presence and legitimacy in the regions. With this increase of
power and authority outside Freetown, the overall political landscape has changed.

8.       There are also indications that the public increasingly recognizes the role of local
councils in service delivery and is experiencing improvements in such, although comprehensive
data is not readily available (i.e. INPS survey expected at end of 2011, IPA survey not usable).

9.      Questions remain over the central government's commitment to decentralization as
concerns were frequently raised over the lack of support and leadership from the responsible
central line Ministry (Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development – MLGRD) in
supporting the institutional framework of local government. A recent example of this is the case
of the mainstreaming of the decentralization secretariat into the MLGRD, which has not taken
place.

10.      While considerable progress was made on tackling some of the inconsistencies in the
legal and institutional framework (e.g. decentralization policy adopted, procurement
act/regulations adopted), there remain gaps and inconsistencies among LGA, decentralization
policy and other acts/regulations. The project shows shortcomings in delivering such amendments
(e.g. Education Act, Hospitals Board Act, Local Tax Act) at project closure. Furthermore, the
relationship between local councils, Chiefs and newly re-introduced District Officers remains
contentious and unclear and government has made no concerted effort to resolve this.

11.      In terms of budget planning, execution and reporting, drafting of inclusive development
plans and delivery of the devolved services, progress made is significant, particularly against the
fact that LC were non-existent at project start. However, it is a major shortcoming that so far only
46 out of 82 functions were successfully devolved. Moreover, not all LC meet the transparency
and financial management accountability requirements and the EU reserves some doubt as to the
proper and sound financial execution of some of the local development projects.

12.      Infrastructure work for LC remains an area of concern. Worryingly, only 9 out of the 19
targeted LC were handed over fit-for-purpose constructed/renovated office buildings. The
unresolved issue of the completed, but unoccupied city council building in Bo further contributes
to the concerns over LC buildings.




                                              66
13.     Regarding the overall implementation and project management, the EU would like to
underline that –while the IRCBP delivery units have delivered much over the entire project span-
the levels of effectiveness and efficiency as well as overall quality, accuracy and readiness of
work and information have deteriorated noticeably in the final year of operation. Furthermore, the
EU's visibility vis-à-vis beneficiaries, stakeholders and partners and its day-to-day involvement
have not been on a satisfactory level.

A.4 Recommendations

14.     It is noteworthy that -building on the work already done under the IRCBP-, the EU has
also entered into a Financing Agreement with the Government of Sierra Leone committing a
further EUR 5 Mio into the Decentralized Service Delivery Project (FED/2010/022-211). Funds
will again be mobilized through a World Bank managed trust fund.

15.     Against the above-mentioned preliminary observations, the EU would like to make the
following recommendations for its future involvement in World Bank managed decentralization
projects.

        EU to maintain closer involvement in project management and in implementation support
         missions
        Ensure extensive EU visibility, in accordance with the partners' contractual obligations
        Follow more closely and proactively manage political debate around decentralization

16.      It is further recommended that – based on the detrimental effects of the pullout of the
external Senior Public Sector Consultant –full-time Freetown-based project management support
is recruited by the World Bank.


B. DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFID)

1.      The Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Program (IRCBP) has been a
longstanding project in Sierra Leone beginning with World Bank funding in 2004, and later being
joined by the EU and DFID. The overall aim of the project was to re-establish local government
across the country to improve both basic services delivery, and to help rebalance the political
economy of the post-war state.

2.       According to DFID’s evaluation of IRCBP, the following impacts are most noticeable:

         a) The re-establishment of local councils and a new local government finance system in
            a post-conflict and fragile state is a major achievement.
         b) There remain gaps and inconsistencies in the overall local governance framework.
            The relationship between local councils, Chiefs and newly re-introduced District
            Officers remains contentious and unclear and government has made no concerted
            effort to resolve this.
         c) Councils are associated with, and are likely to be partly responsible for,
            improvements in service delivery.
         d) Local government has changed the political landscape at a local level, increasing the
            power and authority of governing institutions outside Freetown and potentially
            changing voting behavior at a local level.




                                             67
        e) A large question mark remains over the government’s commitment to
           decentralization and their desire to see local councils grow and flourish, with
           corresponding lack of support and leadership from the Ministry of Local Government
           and Rural Development in supporting and developing the institutional framework of
           local government.
        f) It is likely that in the near future councils will experience two countervailing forces
           regarding their importance at a local level – they are likely to have their power and
           resources challenged relative to other local governing actors that are more closely
           under the control of central government; but will also receive significant new funds
           through DSDP that might go some way to bolstering their profile at a local level.
        g) IRCBP delivery structures have delivered much, but the effectiveness and efficiency
           of World Bank implementation units deteriorated in the final year of operation.

3.      According to the PCR scoring template, comparing logframe indicators to actual
achievement this project is rated as a ‘3’, meaning that its objectives have been partially achieved.
However, this may understate the significant impact this project has had on the country. As
noted, functioning local government has been re-established in Sierra Leone after a 30 year
absence and while there have been – and will remain – uncertainties over the future of local
government the scale of project’s achievement should be properly recognized.

4.      DFID agreed a no-cost extension to the project in November 2010, in return for particular
action on three DFID priorities coming out of the 2010 Annual Review. A summary of these
actions suggest that little progress has not been made against two of the three, although this is
largely due to inaction by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development.

5.      This report makes some recommendations for DFID’s involvement in future World Bank
decentralization-related projects, for example the Decentralized Service Delivery Program
(DSDP) Phase II, which is currently being discussed:

    a) Maintain a closer watch on the political commitment to the decentralization agenda, and
       ‘which way the wind is blowing’ in policy debates.
    b) Be more aware of the ‘day-to-day’ management activity of projects being done by the
       World Bank and/or their delivery units. Where performance is beginning to slip, it could
       take an earlier and more proactive role in raising this issue with World Bank managers.
    c) More actively manage the logframe associated with the project to ensure that it remains
       valid and current to the priorities of the program.
