EGYPT
TALKHA II UREA MANUFACTURING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt has requested IDA
financing for a large nitrogen fertilizer plant with a capacity of 570,000
metric tons per year (TPY) urea (262,000 TPY of nitrogen). The facilities
will be owned by the El Nasr Company for Fertilizers and Chemicals (El Nasr),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Government-owned General Organization for
Chemical Industries (GOCI). Total financing required for the project is
estimated at US$132 million with a foreign exchange component of US$93 mil-
lion. Foreign exchange costs are to be covered by the proposed IDA Credit
of US$20 million and other debt financing of US$69 million from the Abu
Dhabi Fund, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (Arab Fund),
the Kuwait Fund, the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank and the State of Qatar. The
IDA funds would be on-lent to the Company for fifteen years including five
years grace and at an effective annual interest rate of 8.5% to El Nasr wihich
would carry the foreign exchange risk during the period of the loan. The
average Arab co-lender terms, both to the Government and the Company are for
19 years including five years grace and 5.2% annual interest. The residual
financing of US$43 million equivalent including all local currency expendi-
tures, working capital, and US$4 million in foreign exchange expenditures
(for a portion of interest during construction) will be provided by the
Government as equity.
ii.       The new plant will be located at Talkha in the Nile Delta some
135 km north of Cairo and be implemented by El Nasr under the supervision of
the General Organization for Industrialization, the authority responsible
for the development of the industrial sector in Egypt. The project will
utilize efficient modern technology and will use natural gas feedstock from
the nearby Abu Mahdi gas field. It will be one of the largest fertilizer
projects financed to date by the Bank Group. El Nasr has since 1947 been
operating a calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant in Suez
which stopped operating in 1969 following the military action in the area.
The Company is currently erecting on the same site at Talkha a calcium-
ammonium-nitrate (CAN) unit (Talkha I)} dismantled from Suez where it was
partially erected in 1967/68. This unit will also run on Abu Mahdi gas and
is expected to start producing by the end of 1974. Although the Company has
not operated since 1969, its financial positioln has remained sound because
of adequate Government subsidies. Once Talkha I begins commercial operation,
the Company is expected to be able to support itself and repay all its out-
standing debt before the project (Talkha II) will be completed.
iii.      El Nasr has capable management; during project implementation and
plant start-up, it will be supported under a Technical Advisor, Cremer and
Warner (UK) whose initial work is being financed by the IDA Engineering Credit
of US$400,000 approved by the Executive Directors in November 1973. Additional



- ii -
major responsibilities for project execution will rest with a General Contractor.
The IDA Credit would cover the foreign exchange expenditures of the General
Contractor and the Technical Advisor as well as a portion of equipment and
materials, all procured under Bank/IDA guidelines.
iv.       Nitrogen (N) fertilizer consumption in Egypt grew 7% per year in
the 1950's and early 1960's but slowed to 3.5% during 1965-1972 to reach about
320,000 tons of N in 1972. Dboaestic production was only 100,000 tons of N in
1972 and Egypt has therefore become a major importer of nitrogen fertilizers
to the extent of about 220,000 tons of N in 1972 with a current value of
between US$50-60 million. Urea, introduced into Egypt in the early 1960s,
is well suited to Egyptian agrLculture and its use has increased rapidly,
accounting for about 60% of toc:al N imports in 1972.
v.        Consumption of N has been adversely affected by low domestic pro-
duction and limited availability of foreign exchange and, more recently, tight
international supplies at high prices. Future consumption is conservativiely
estimated to grow at about 4% per year and reach some 500,000 tons of N in
1980. Combined with production from capacity now in existence or under con-
struction, the project will, uLder such growth assumptions, help make Egypt
self-sufficient in nitrogen fertilizer production by 1980. However, the
potential demand for nitrogen and other fertilizer grades is considerably
higher since for an intensive zmd virtually fully irrigated agriculture as
that of Egypt, fertilizer application will still be low particularly if Egypt
moves towards more high-yielding crop varieties and the promotion of high-value,
non-traditional exports to head off a potential food crisis and help overcome
its strained balance of payment: situation.  Since, in addition, Egypt has a
comparative advantage in producing its own nitrogen fertilizer, the project
has a high priority in being mc'ved forward quickly.
vi.       The project is well located as it is close to its raw material
source (natural gas) and marketing area and the site is already developed
with largely existing infrastructure and utility supplies.  The project's
estimated production costs and assumed urea sales price ex-plant of US$95
per ton bagged are internationally competitive and compare favorably with
import prices, which on the short-term are in excess of US$200 per ton CIF
and about US$120-140 per ton CIF in longer term projections. The project
will be soundly financed with an initial debt/equity ratio of 67/33 upon
completion and 39/61 when consolidated within El Nasr's overall financial
structure; furthermore, it is forecast to cover debt service more than three
times and have a satisfactory liquidity. The project's (incremental) financial
rate of return would be 19% before taxes.
vii.      The economic rate of return of the project is calculated also at 19%
based on the expected long-term price of US$120 CIF Egypt, and an assumed
natural gas price of US$1.40/thousand cubic feet. It would remain satisfactory,
at about 10%, under the most adverse foreseeable assumptions regarding urea
and natural gas prices. Substantial unmeasurable benefits not accounted for



- iii -
in the calculation of the economic return (such as training of labor, removal
of fertilizer procurement constraints and additional agricultural production
and exports) could also be attributed to the project. The project shows a
net annual foreign exchange savings of about US$41 million.
viii.     The project faces only moderate technical, managerial and commercial
risks and based on agreements reached as summarized in Chapter VIII, is suit-
able for an IDA credit of US$20 million equivalent.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Egypt has requested IDA assistance to help
finance a portion of the foreign exchange costs of a new urea fertilizer
plant at Talkha (Map IBRD-10724) with a capacity of 570,000 tons per year
(TPY) of urea (262,000 TPY in terms of nitrogen nutrient). Total financing
required would be about US$132 million, to be covered respectively by sources
from Arab countries (52%); the Egyptian Government (33%); and IDA (15%).
Work on the project would start in September 1974, and the plant is expected
to be commissioned in December 1977. Annex 1-1 includes a glossary of tech-
nical terms.
1.02      Agriculture as well as fertilizer application and production are
major factors in the Egyptian economy. Nitrogen fertilizer use is well estab-
lished but domestic production is substantially less than consumption and no
high-analysis fertilizer such as urea is now being produced. There are
several existing fertilizer plants in Egypt, but this project would be the
first in the country to use modern, large-scale technology and is aimed at
replacing substantial current imports. The existing Egyptian fertilizer
industry, including its products and raw materials, is described in Annex
1-2.
1.03      Due to limitations on foreign exchange, hostilities, and priority
given to defense, the fertilizer industry and fertilizer consumption have
virtually stagnated over the past few years, significantly slowing down the
growth in agricultural output. The project, commonly described as Talkha II,
will make a major contribution towards rationalization of the Egyptian ferti-
lizer industry although other problems will still need to be overcome: (1)
low use and production of phosphate and mixed fertilizers; and (2) inefficient
operation in other existing production units.
1.04      The proposed credit would be the second industrial lending opera-
tion by IDA in Egypt, the first being Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project
(Report No. 151a-UAR, June 28, 1973). Each of these two credits was preceded
by an Engineering Credit to prepare the projects concerned and determine their
feasibility. In the agricultural sector, IDA has financed two projects, (i)
Nile Delta Drainage Project (No. PA-12a, October 14, 1969), and (ii) Upper
Egypt Drainage Project (No. 80a-UAR, May 23, 1973) which were designed to
improve drainage and agricultural productivity in the selected areas.
1.05      The Talkha II Project was identified by Bank missions in late 1972
and April 1973 1/ and appraised by Messrs. D. E. Brown (Chief), A. K. Basak,
N. Petry, and B. Shen of the Industrial Projects Department following missions
to Egypt in December 1973 and February 1974. The Arab Fund participated in
the two appraisal missions.

II. PROJECT SPONSORS
A.  Organizational Framework
2.01      The project is to be carried out and operated by the El Nasr Company
for Fertilizers and Chemicals (El Nasr) 1/ under the supervision of the General
Organization for Industrialization (GOFI) and the Egyptian General Organization
for Chemical Industries (GOCI). GOFI, attached to the Ministry of Indus;ry,
is responsible for fostering and coordinating industrial expansion in Egypt.
GOCI, one of the 20 such Government-owned organizations covering virtually
every segment of the Egyptian economy, is a holding company for the 29 largest
Government-owned companies in the chemical sector, including El Nasr.  The
GOCI subsidiaries manufacture a wide range of products and are financially
autonomous units, each with its own board of directors. The board chairmen of
GOCI's seven largest firms, together with three university professors and GOCI's
Cnairman (Mr. Marei Ahmed Marei) and General Manager (Dr. Ahmed Shukri Salem)
make up GOCI's Board of Directors.
2.02      GOCI implements Goverament policy in the chemical sector, and works
jointly with GOFI and the compaaies' managements in preparing and implementing
projects. GOCI receives annual budgetary allocations to meet its own operat-
ing costs. It was made a legal holding company in 1971, although it does not
yet consolidate the financial statements of its subsidiaries (Annex 2-1).
GOCI allocates investment funds among its subsidiaries, but its role therein
is limited since all major inveStment decisions are made at the ministerial
level. Once approved, the funds allocated to a given project are usually
channeled through GOFI and disbursed under its supervision, although respon-
sibility for actual project execution is effectively delegated to the ultimate
operating company, i.e., El Nasr in the case of this project. GOCI's sub-
sidiaries are, therefore, primarily responsible for operations and have only
a limited role in policy and investment decisions. A description of GOFI's
and GOCI's functions is contained in Annex 2-1.
B.   El Nasr Comnany for Fertil-zers and Chemicals
2.03      El Nasr is one of the largest of GOCI's subsidiaries.  It owns two
nitrogen fertilizer plants: (1"l a calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate plant
at Suez with a combined capacity of 60,009 TPY of N; and (2) a calcium ammonium
nitrate (CAN) plant now under construction at Talkha (Talkha I) in the Nile
Delta, about 135 km north of Cairo, with an annual capacity of 98,000 tons of
N. The Company has produced no fertilizer since 1969, when the Suez plant was
closed due to lack of feedstock from the adjacent refinery which ceased pro-
duction as a result of the Fgyptian-Israeli hostilities. Construction of the
1/   The appraisal report uses the above English name for the Company.  The
Company's legal name is Societe El Nasr d'Engrais et d'Industries Chimiques.
Its common name in Egypt iE SEMADCO (its cable address). The latter two
names are used in the President's Report, Development Credit Agreement and
the Project Agreement.

Talkha I plant (partially erected at Suez when the decision was taken in 1970
to move it to Talkha) is expected to be completed in late 1974. Since 1969,
the Company has kept all of its staff of 4,250 employed in maintaining the
Suez operations; moving and re-erecting the CAN plant at Talkha; and in
providing engineering and general contracting services in Egypt and abroad.
Of the remaining plants at Suez, El Nasr intends ultimately to recommission
the calcium nitrate plant (capacity: 40,000 TPY of N) and move portions of
the ammonium sulfate plant to Talkha to increase Talkha I capacity by 20,000
TPY of N.
2.04      The Company is organized along functional lines, with a manager
each responsible for commerce, finance, administration, civil works, proj-
ect planning, research, engineering and production (Annex 2-2). The five
senior members of the Board of Directors have been with the Company since
1947-50, and the Chairman and Managing Director, Mr. Ibrahim El Dessouki,
is on the Board of GOCI. The Company's management appears capable, although
it will need some assistance to help it with its large expansion program.
C.   Financial Analysis of El Nasr Company
1.   Past
2.05       The Company's recent income statements, balance sheets and sources
and application of funds, are shown in Annex 2-3 and summarized on the follow-
ing page.
2.06       The Company was established in 1947 with an initial paid-in capital
of BE 4.0 million. Loans from the US Exim Bank financed the calcium nitrate
and ammonium sulphate plant at Suez. Until the 1967 hostilities, the Company's
financial structure was sound, the debt/equity ratio being only 29/71 in 1967.
The Exim Bank loans were repaid on schedule, and paid-in capital increased to
1E 8.5 million by 1967, largely through retained earnings.
2.07      The 1967 war, however, limited the fertilizer production because
of reduced refinery gas supply to the El Nasr plant. Operations continued
at a lower level until 1969 when further military action put the refinery out
of commission and stopped El Nasr's production completely. Pre-tax profit
before 1967 had stood steadily at around 25% of sales revenue and, in 1967
reached 29% of sales or 16% of capital employed.
2.08       Profits as well as cash have been decreasing since 1967 and after
the enforced stoppage in 1969 turned into losses, which were aggravated owing
to the social objective of retaining all workers in the Company's employment.
As compensation, the Government has been granting the Company since 1970 an
annual subsidy to meet most non-capital expenditures excluding depreciation.
These subsidies constitute revenue receipts, and are not repayable to the
Government. In addition, between 1967 and 1972, the Government contributed
EE 10 million to the Company for meeting capital expenditures on Talkha I and
plans to make available another BE 12.7 million through 1974. The total con-
tribution of BE 22.7 million will be credited to paid-in capital, and will not
be refundable.

2.09      By the end of 1972, the Company's total long-term debt outstanding
was LE 3.6 million, including -BE 2.9 million in foreign debt due to German
Federal Republic creditors, plus two previous years' overdue payments on
local debt (included under current liabilities as short-term loans) of
BE 2.3 million.  However, the existing loans are all expected to be repaid
by 1977 in accordance with the terms, and the Government has agreed that
sufficient funds will be provided, as necessary, to the Company for this
purpose.
2.10      El Nasr's latest available audited balance sheet as of December 31,
1972 shows that although the Company has no operating revenues, its financial
structure is still sound, primarily on account of the Government's cash
support. Equity and reserves stood at over LE 25 million, mostly represented
by assets at Talkha. Of the total net fixed assets, only about BE 3 million
or 11% are still in Suez. The financial statements of El Nasr are audited by
the Central Agency for Auditing, a government agency. This arrangement is
acceptable to the Association.
;.   Future - Without the Project
2.11      The Company's projected income statements, balance sheets and sources
and application of funds with Talkha I, but without Talkha II, are shown in
Annex 2-4 and summarized on the previous page. Costs have been escalated
through 1978 (when Talkha II will come on stream) and kept constant thereafter,
except for salaries and wages which have been escalated at 3% annually through-
out the forecast period (1975-1983), to reflect rising real wages. The ex-
factory selling price of its fertilizer (CAN) has been assumed to be constant
at the present level of BE 37.3 per ton (US$95/ton).
2.12      Talkha I is forecast to start operating by January 1975, but having
been dismantled from Suez and re-erected at Talkha and using old, inefficient
(particularly ammonia) technology, is expected to be able to produce at only
80% of capacity. Once Talkha II begins operations in 1978, it will supply
ammonia to Talkha I, allowing 95% capacity utilization. The Suez plant is
assumed to remain closed even though the Company may at some later date restart
operations in part of the plant (para. 2.03); its overhead, therefore, will
continue. Given the cost of natural gas (LE 8.75/ton or US$22.5/ton) and
selling prices of CAN (LE 37.3/ton or US$95/ton), Talkha I operations are
expected to be profitable with a low cash breakeven level of 55% of capacity.
Profit before tax would rise from 8% of sales in 1976 to about 21% in 1980
and beyond.
2.13      The operations of Talkha I are forecast to lead to an acceptable
rate of cash accumulation already during execution of the project. However,
if plant commissioning is delayed or operations fail to reach the level anti-
cipated, then additional funds may still be needed. To avoid Talkha I opera-
tions from interfering with the implementation of the project and to ensure
that the urgently-needed fertilizers will be produced by Talkha I, the Govern-
ment has agreed that it will provide funds as necessary and arrange for any
technical assistance that may be needed to bring output to a satisfactory
level quickly.

III. FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING 1/
A.   Agriculture in Egypt
3.01      Agriculture accounts for about 30% of Egypt's gross domestic
product (GDP) and about half of total employment and it generates more than
half of foreign exchange earnings from commodity exports (Annex 3-1). The
growth rate in real terms in agriculture averaged about 3.5% annually over the
past 15 years (1957-1972) but only 2% or less during the last five years (1967-
1972). Shortage of foreign exchange and priority given to defense, especially
since the 1967 war, have played a major part in limiting agricultural growth.
Agriculture is concentrated in a narrow strip of land along the Nile between
Aswan and Cairo and the Nile Delta.
3.02      The major recent development is the building of the Aswan Dam,
which has permitted a shift to perennial irrigation and a continuing expan-
sion of land reclamation. Egypt has about 2.7 million ha (6.5 million fed-
dans) of agricultural land. However, its almost total irrigation permits a
much larger cropped area - about 4.4 million ha (10.5 million feddans) -
or about 1.6 crops per year per ha. The area cropped has risen by about
210,000 ha (500,000 feddans) since 1960, with most of this increase resulting
since 1966-67, when the Aswan Dam made year-round water supplies available.
Nevertheless, water availability has limited rice production; and shortages
of fertilizer and high-yielding seed varieties, as well as inadequate exten-
sion services and farm managemeat practices in general have limited growth
in yields and production of most food crops.
3.03      Major crops are cotton, rice, maize, wheat, clover and fruit and
vegetables with rice and cotton accounting for about 40% of the cultivated
area, or 25% of the cropped area. Although cotton is a major earner of
foreign exchange, this is achieved at the expense of food crops. Egypt has
increased wheat imports from hE 58 million in 1960 to over hE200 million in
1973. Because of the growing wlheat imports and rising prices, present indica-
tions are that Egypt may grow more wheat, and less cotton, in the next few
years to augment local food production.
3.04      The Government controls the agricultural sector through various
measures such as allocation of fertilizer and other inputs, designation of
cotton acreage and purchase of the entire cotton crop and portions of other
crops. These controls closely regulate the supply of basic food items for
domestic consumption, and all agricultural exports. Prices received by
farmers are usually well below export prices and are kept more or less con-
stant. Agricultural production, therefore, is controlled by varying the
supply and cost of farm inputs rather than by adjusting product prices.
1/   This Chapter is based largely on fertilizer studies prepared by the
Institute of National Planning (INP), Cairo, in October 1973 and
January 1974.

The table indicates that Egypt is a relatively efficient producer of cotton,
rice and sugarcane, though less so of wheat and corn. However, the com-
parison is not entirely meaningful due to total irrigation, multiple cropping
in Egyptian agriculture, and the relatively small land area. When these
factors are considered, Egypt's yields, particularly of corn, wheat and fruits
and vegetables, are relatively low. Limited land availability and a rela-
tively high population (and growth rate) place a heavy burden on the sector
to remain efficient. These data indicate that significant growth in the agri-
cultural sector, including higher levels of fertilizer use is, therefore,
feasible (para. 3.13).
3.06      Some major conclusions of the latest Bank report 1/ on Egyptian agri-
culture are: (i) yield-improving technologies in the principal crops must be
developed urgently to head off a potential domestic food crisis and/or drastic
decline in foreign exchange earnings; (ii) Egypt will have to promote high-
value, non-traditional agricultural exports more intensively; and (iii) in-
creased allocation of resources, including foreign exchange, to supply more
fertilizer, insecticides, livestock feed and machinery are needed without
which the agricultural growth targets cannot be achieved, particularly not
without more fertilizer.
B. Hlistorical Supply and Consumption of Fertilizer
1.   Supply
3.07      Local production of nitrogen fertilizer, which began in 1951, in-
cludes calcium nitrate (16% N) and ammonium sulphate (21% N) at Suez; calcium

December 30, 1972, EMA-56A.



ammonium nitrate (31% N) at Kima (Aswan) and ammonium nitrate (34% N) at
Helwan. Recent production and imports of nitrogen fertilizer are shown in
Annexes 1-2 and 3-2 and are suimmarized below:
Nitrogen Fertilizer Supply in Egypt
(in 1,000 tons of N)
Year               1962    1965    1968    1970    1971    1972    1973
Production        107     159      140     119      109     103      51
Imports            56     116      147     203      174     285     n.a.
Total Supply        163     275      287     322      283     388     n.a.
Production decreased after 1968 for the reasons discussed in para. 2.07, and
since then has remained at over 100,000 tons per year of N through 1972, but
dropped sharply in 1973 on acccount of low production at Kima due to major
maintenance work.  Imports have risen rapidly, even though limited by avail-
ability of foreign exchange anel, more recently, by sharp price increases
combined with some supply constraints, to give an average annual supply in-
crease of 9% during 1962-1972.
3.08      Phosphate fertilizer production and use are small compared to
nitrogen fertilizers. Production is mainly low-grade single super phosphate
(SSP), containing 15% P205 and made from domestic phosphate rock and imported
sulphur. Local production began in 1950 and total installed capacity is now
about 80,000 TPY of P205. Egypt does not import any phosphatic fertilizers.
2.   Consumption
3.09      Egypt's fertilizer consumption since 1950 is shown in Annex 3-3
and summarized below:

Egypt's consumption of fertilizer nutrients rose from 113,000 tons in 1950
to nearly 400,000 tons in 1972, with growth rates of about 7% annually up to
1965 and 4% thereafter. The ratio of nitrogen (N) to phosphate (P205) con-
sumption has remained at about 5 to 1 over the past two decades, which in-
dicates a rather low phosphate application; and potash (K20) use continues
to be very low. As mentioned earlier, the rate of increase in fertilizer
consumption since the mid-1960's has been limited primarily by supply short-
ages but there have been other constraints such as government control on crop
prices (fertilizer prices are also controlled) restricting profitability from
fertilizer use and the strict allocation of fertilizers, favoring selected
crops. Therefore, the past consumption does not reflect the country's actual
needs. A continuation of the 7% annual growth rate in N and P205 consumption
of the 50's and early 60's - surely a feasible target - would have brought
about a nutrient consumption in 1972 of about 480,000 tons or some 22% above
the consumption actually achieved in that year.
3.10      Egypt consumes only straight, rather than mixed or complex nitrogen
and phosphate fertilizers: nitrogen as CAN (45% of consumption), urea (45%),
and ammonium sulphate (10%); and phosphate mainly as single superphosphate.
The use of urea (all from imports) has been increasing rapidly and reached
about 160,000 tons of N in 1972, i.e., equal to about 61% of the proposed
Talkhia IT production at full capacitv. Urea is agronomically well suited
for Egyptian agriculture and its use compared to other nitrogen fertilizers
should continue to increase.
C.   Projected Consumption of Fertilizers
1.   Fertilizer Application Rates
3.11      Future consumption of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers through
1982 are based on typical application rates worked out by the Cairo Institute
of National Planning and the Ministry of Agriculture as shown in the follow-
ing table:
Fertilizer Application Rates in Egypt
(Nutrient kg/ha cropped)
1966               1973              1982
N       P205       N       P205      N        P205
Wheat            87          0     114          0    143          0
Corn             87         0      138          0    191          0

Clover            0         36       0         36      0         52



- 10 -
The above data, based on prescribed application rates, show only a modest
increase in nitrogen use per hectare of cropped area during 1973-1982. As
for phosphate, its application rate would continue to be low, thus consti-
tuting a constraint for increased agricultural yields, particularly of
wheat and corn on which no phosphate use is contemplated even in the future.
3.12      Egyptian officials generally feel that fertilizer application rates
in the country are high. This is true when compared to the application rates
in countries with extensive agricultural land such as Canada, Australia and
India. However, the Egyptian rates are lower than the ones in countries
with limited agricultural land but intensive farming, i.e. factors which also
apply to Egypt, as shown in the following table:
Comparison of Fertilizer Application Rates (1970)

2.   Consumption Forecasts by Nutrients
3.13      The Government projections for different nutrients (through 1982
based on the above application rates) shown in Annex 3-3 are given below:
Projected Fertilizer Consumption by Nutrients
('1'000 TPY)

P205                   66.0      211.0      211.0        12.1             _

The above Government projectiorLs for nitrogen appear conservative and for the
other two nutrients reflect the objective of bringing the N-P-K ratios into
better relationship to each other. They also appear to be influenced by ex-
pected fertilizer availability and the attempt to cover minimum needs rather
than by unrestrained demand and indicate that in the early 1980's, nutrient
consumption would already level off. Total consumption of nutrients is fore-
cast to double approximately between 1972 and 1985. The forecast reflects a
rise in the per ha consumption from 94 Kg to 157 Kg, and assumes that cropped



- 11 -
area would expand from the present 4.2 million ha (10.5 million feddans) to
5.1 million ha (12.6 million feddans). But, as pointed out previously, the
projected per ha nutrient consumption is low for an intensive agriculture
such as that of Egypt. The projections also assume that Egypt will not yet
have moved strongly along the recommendations spelled out in para. 3.06, i.e.
promotion of yield-improving technologies and of non-traditional exports,
which all require substantially increased fertilizer application. One might
also expect that the high prices of foodgrains are likely to accelerate the
trend in Egypt towards the production of more high-yielding varieties of
wheat, maize and rice.

for nitrogen, the nutrient the project will produce, together with the

3.15      The forecast assumes that all nitrogen fertilizer capacity will be
operated at high rates from 1980 onward (i.e., Talkha II at 95% and the rest
of the industry at 100%), so that, from the supply side also, the above projec-
tions are conservative with the result that the expected balance between domestic
production and consumption to be reached by 1978 is more likely to remain as a
supply shortage. The above official forecasts also show a relatively constant
consumption of nitrogen fertilizer up to about 1976, which indicates that they
take account of the limited availability of domestic production and imports
until then. Nonetheless, imports are expected to range from 157,000-272,000
tons of N per year until Talkha II will be operating commercially in 1978,
equivalent to some US$45-80 million per year at present world market prices.



- 12 -
3.16      The Ministry of Agriculture's projections of phosphate and potash
fertilizer consumption show P205 use increasing from 65,000 tons in 1972 to
211,000 tons by 1982 (about 12.5% increase per year), and K20 use rising from
2,000 tons in 1972 to 74,000 tons in 1982 (para. 3.13). In view of Egypt's
severe foreign exchange constraints, and particularlv as long as the present
high cost of imports persists, these increases may be optimistic, unless Egypt
were to expand its own phosphate fertilizer production capacity for which
some tentative plans now exist. If all nitrogen and phosphate consumption
were to rise as forecast, then the 5 to 1 ratio of N to P205 in 1972 would
inprove to 2.4 to 1 by 1982.
3.17      Egypt currently uses negligible amounts (and has no firm plans of
using increased quantities) of compound or complex fertilizers. However,
since both N and P205 nutrients are needed, and needed in an optimal ratio,
to maximize crop yields, further P205 use should be evaluated including its
use in mixed fertilizers. Furt'hermore, as already mentioned, the above fore-
cast of nitrogen fertilizer consumption does not take into account any appre-
ciable expansion of reclaimed land, new seed varieties, etc., which could
require major increases beyond the forecast level. It was, therefore, recom-
mended that Egypt undertake a comprehensive fertilizer sector study to
determine the growth potential and the program necessary to achieve such
growth. The study should include consideration of the next fertilizer
project which is likely to be ant N/P205 fertilizer expansion at Talkha within
the next few years. The Governnent has agreed to commence such a study by
not later than June 30, 1975 and consult with IDA on the preparation of the
studv and the implementation of the resulting program.
D.   Marketing and Pricing System
3.18      The Government closelv controls supply and consumption of fertilizer.
The Ministry of Agriculture sets the application rates and determines the
quotas of fertilizer made available to each farmer according to his area,
location and the crop rotation which he will follow in cultivating his land.
Since the farmer cannot buy less than the norms prescribed, a lower limit on
national fertilizer consumption is established by these quotas.
3.19      The General Organization for Agricultural and Cooperative Credit
(GOACC), a public sector organization, procures and distributes all locally
produced and imported fertilizers in accordance with the Agricultural
Ministry's quotas (Annex 3-4). GOACC operates about 400 fertilizer warehouses
throughout the country with a total storage capacity of about 400,000 tons.
Some 4,000 small cooperative stores handle retail sales and distribution to
the farmer. This distribution system has been working satisfactorily.
3.20      Another Government agency that plays a major role in the marketing
and pricing of fertilizers is the General Organization for Agricultural Prices
Equalization (GOAPE); it determines prices and the amounts, types and sources
of fertilizer to be purchased (including imports) and monitors distribution



- 13 -
through the GOACC, to which it pays about 6% of the value of fertilizer to
finance storage and distribution costs. GOAPE functions as a clearing agency,
balancing high prices for some farm inputs (e.g., urea), against subsidies on
others (e.g., pesticides).
3.21      At the farm level, all (except one) nitrogen fertilizers are sold at
uniform prices on a nutrient basis throughout the country but net plant prices
are set differently to reflect actual production costs of individual fertilizer
manufacturers. Present 1974 net plant prices and farm level prices are shown
below:
Fertilizer Prices in Egypt
Net Plant Price L/. (bagged)       Farm Level Price L2 (bagged)
Material         Nutrient           Matertal         Nutrient

/5   AS (Ammonium Sulfate), CN (Calcium Nitrate) from closed Suez plant.
The assumed net plant price for urea, US$218/nutrient ton, is substantially
below the comparable price for CAN, US$316/nutrient ton; which reflects the
efficient large-scale technology to be incorporated into the project's urea
production. The large difference between the net plant price and farmer price
for urea is an effective tax that accrues to GOAPE and would be used to offset
losses on other commodities that are sold at subsidized prices. The cost
structure of other nitrogen producers is not completely known but generally
is higher than in Talkha's CAN plant. Since GOACC and GOAPE pool all supplies,
the Talkha II urea project, whose output during 1979-80 will account for about
half of domestic production in those years, would potentially allow a reduction
of fertilizer prices to farmers to levels more in line with long-range inter-
national prices. However, the short-term world prices are high (para. 7.01)
and no retail fertilizer price reductions in Egypt are likely in the near future.



- 14 -
3.22      El Nasr will distribute most of Talkha's production in the Delta
within a distance of about 150 km. El Nasr or GOACC will be responsible for
delivery of fertilizer to the regional warehouses of GOACC. All material
will be shipped in polyethylene bags and an estimated 80% will be delivered
by road and the balance by rail. River transport is not contemplated. Since
most of the project's production will displace current imports through
Alexandria, no major distributicon difficulty is contemplated. However,
transportation is generally a problem in Egypt and without proper planning,
bottlenecks in daily distribution may arise. A detailed analysis of distri-
bution requirements for Talkha will be included in the recommended fertilizer
sector study (para 3.17).
3.23      Fertilizer is sold on credit through the GOACC and the village
cooperatives. Terms have been subsidized (about 4% annual interest) and
over 90% of the fertilizer was distributed on credit in the late 1960's.
Credit for fertilizer has leveled at around B6E 33 million for several years,
implying a limitation on credit. Although GOACC indicates that credit
facilities will be expanded as needed to meet fertilizer requirements, they
were unable to forecast credit needs and this subject will be included in the
sector study (para 3.17).
3.24      The cooperative system is relatively well developed for the distri-
bution of specific inputs and collection of crops, with each village orga-
nized into cooperatives but extension services, such as for increased use of
high-yielding seed varieties and higher crop productivity, and farm management
practices need much improvement. The cooperative structure is essential
since land tenure is characterized by many small holdings as a result of land
reform legislation in 1952 and 1961. About 95% of farmers hold 57% of agri-
cultural land in farms of less than 2 ha (5 feddans) in size.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
4.01      The project will be located at Talkha adjacent to the CAN plant now
under erection (para. 2.03) and consists of a single-stream 396,000 tons per year
(TPY) ammonia plant; two identical urea plants with a combined capacity of
570,000 TPY; a plant for the manufacture of 4,000 polyethylene bags per hour;
and all necessary ancillary facilities. The ammonia plant includes 66,000 TPY
canacity that would be utilized for increasing the capacity and production of
Talkha I. All plants will employ modern, commercially proven technology to
ensure efficient operation (Annexes 4-1 and 4-2). The present site area is
about 60 ha, of which 40 ha are occupied by the CAN plant, leaving 20 ha for
the project, which is adequate. The site is on the banks of the Nile and has
good rail and road connections. The towns of Talkha and Mansoura, a power
station, and a factory housing colony are also nearby.



- 15
B.   Raw Materials and IJtilities
4.02      The principal raw material will be natural gas supplied from the
newly developed Abu Mahdi field, some 40 km from Talkha, and the project's
requirements at full production are estimated at 1.2 million cubic meters/day
(M3/D).  The gas composition is suitable for ammonia production.  The gas
company, owned by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and ENI
of Italy, has determined that reserves are adequate to supply Talkha I and II
as well as the Talkha power station for at least 30 years at their combined
consumDtion of 2.6 million M3/D. An independent consultant (Cremer and
Warner, U.K.) has confirmed the gas reserves and the adequacy for the project
of the pipeline system that is to connect the gasfield with Talkha. The
Government has also given its assurance that the pipeline system will be
implemented in time for Talkha requirements. This system (not part of the
project) with a capacity of 3.3 million M3/D is under construction and is
expected to be completed during 1974, to start serving Talkha I. El Nasr has
negotiated a satisfactory 20-year gas-supply contract with the gas company   3
at a price of bE S.75 per ton (US$22.3/ton) which is equivalent to US$0.018/M
or US$0.51/1,000 cubic feet and is based on the prevailing fuel oil price in
Egypt; the contract contains escalation provisions which links the gas price
to the price of fuel oil in Egypt.
4.03      Power is to be supplied from the adjacent power station on a pre-
ferential basis at US$0.015/Kwh. The power station has adequate capacity to
supply the needs of the project and the Government has agreed that the addi-
tional transmission and transformer facilities will be provided by the power
company when required by the project. Talkha will generate its own steam
and water for industrial and drinking purposes will be obtained from the Nile.
The supply of all utilities is thus satisfactorily ensured.
C.   Employment and Training
4.04      The project will provide employment for about 1,350 persons,  nri-
marily as skilled personnel for management, operations and maintenance, with
many to be recruited from El Nasr's existing staff (4,250) that still includes
surplus manpower from the Suez plants. Although somewhat high, the proposed
manning level is acceptable. Existing personnel and facilities of El Nasr
plus the General Contractor and Technical Advisor will be utilized in training,
and arrangements will be made for some specialized training outside Egypt.
The project execution plan (paras. 4.06-4.08) defines the training program
in more detail as part of the responsibility of the project's General Con-
tractor (yet to be selected).
D.   Ecology
4.05      The plant will be designed to meet standards established by the
Egyptian Ministry of Public Health. These standards are specific and rather
strict for liquids to safeguard against any potential pollution of the Nile.
Non-gaseous effluents from the project are small and will be treated in the



- 16 -
wastewater treatment unit now uider construction at Talkha I at little extra
cost. Egyptian regulations for gaseous effluents are not well defined, but
there are no problems associatecl with gaseous effluents from todays efficiently
designed ammonia-urea plants, particularly not with the Abu Mahdi natural gas
which is virtually sulphur free. Pollution control facilities, forming about
2% of project costs, are therefore satisfactory.
E.   Project Execution
-4.06     The entities responsible for project execution will be (a) El Nasr,
under the general supervision of GOFI and GOCI; (b) technical Advisor; and
(c) General Contractor. Cremer and Warner (UK) have been selected as the
Technical Advisor following Bank guidelines and their initial work is being
financed by an IDA Engineering Credit 1/ which was approved by the Executive
Directors on November 13, 1973 (para. 1.04). The detailed project execution
plan has been prepared by El Nasr and Cremer and Warner and the broad outline
is given below.
4.07      Procedures for selecting the General Contractor are completed and
the Contractor is expected to be selected by September 1974. Bids will be
sought on a fixed price basis for all engineering work and project management
including procurement services for all major process units and other facilities,
and on a cost-plus-fee basis for the Contractor's erection and site supervision
services. The General rontractor directly, or through his subcontractors, will
bear the single responsibility for the execution of the project through com-
missioning with full guarantees for the project's capacity, efficiency, mecha-
nical warranties and completion time. Equipment procurement will be conducted
from the General Contractor's office by El Nasr's project team including the
General Contractor and the Techn:Lcal Advisor. Final approval and placing of
equipment orders will be done by El Nasr (paras. 5.07 and 5.08). The Govern-
ment has agreed that it and its relevant agencies will issue all import
licenses and give other approvals promptly in accordance with a critical path
schedule to be prepared by El Nasr and agreed to by the El Nasr Company, the
Government, the General Contractor and IDA, within three months of the selec-
tion of the General Contractor. The project completion date, which is defined
as successful demonstration of all guarantees, and completion of 90 days
operation at 80% capacity utilization or above, is estimated as April 1, 1978.
4.08      Detailed civil engineering will be carried out by El Nasr or another
Egyptian firm; civil construction by local contractors; and plant erection
by El Nasr, or another local contractor all supervised by the General Con-
tractor. El Nasr has formed a project team headed by Mr. Helmy Attia, the
present General Manager of Finance, and other engineering staff from its
project engineering group to work with the Contractor and coordinate the
project with other operations at Talkha. The Company staff is limited in
size and will be supplemented by the Technical Advisor as needed to implement
the project.

- 17 -
4.09       IDA has reached tentative agreement with the Arab co-lenders 1/
regarding procedures to be followed during project execution and supervision,
covering such matters as procurement procedures, allocation of goods and
services to IDA and Arab co-lender financing, provision for later shifting of
goods and services as needed to disburse fully each source of financing (paras..
5.07 and 5.08). These procedures have been confirmed by El Nasr and similar
procedures are expected to be arranged between the Arab co-lenders and El Nasr.
V. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
5.01       Total financing required for the project is estimated at BE 51.9
million (US$132.4 million) including EE 36.6 million (US$93.4 million) foreign
exchange cost (Annex 5-1):
1/   The Arab co-lenders funds are expected to be administered, during project
execution, by the Arab Fund and the Kuwait Fund. Procedures regarding
supervision, exchange of information, and reporting requirements will be
completed once this committee is formed.

These estimates were prepared by El Nasr and Cremer and Warner, based on
January 1974 prices and thus take account of equipment price increases in
major supplying countries due to the recent petroleum price hikes. Physical
contingencies provided are 7% and 10% of local and foreign erected plant
costs, respectively. Price escalations assume 20% annual increase in 1974 and
12% in 1975, for the foreign costs, and 8% annual increase in 1974 and 1975
for local costs (based on Egyptian conditions). Virtually all supplies are
expected to be ordered by the end of 1975. Foreign price escalation was
determined in consultation with several engineering companies. No import



- 19 -
duties are allowed for and the Company has applied to the Government for
exemption from such duties. The estimates assume a project implementation
period of 39 months, beginning in September 1974, and including six months
for start-up and commissioning.
5.02      Projections of price escalation are very difficult under current
conditions, even more so for equipment for the fertilizer and related indus-
tries which are expanding rapidly throughout the world. Inability to obtain
materials in time, longer delivery periods or even lack of an adequate response
to requests for bids could all lead to higher foreign exchange costs than esti-
mated. However, this possibility is considered reasonably small -- though it
cannot be discounted entirely -- because of the provision of high contingency
reserves. The above project costs estimates, therefore, are considered real-
istic.
5.03      Initial working capital is estimated at BE 1.0 million (US$2.6 mil-
lion) which will be provided (Annex 5-2) by the Government as part of its
equity contribution (as shown in the financing plan), by short term loans or
by El Nasr's own resources.
B.   Financing Plan
5.04      The financing plan for the project will be as follows:

Equity financing of the project would be only 33% of the total cost, with
debt financing accounting for 67% which is somewhat higher than would normally
be desirable. However, this capitalization is acceptable in view of the fact
that (1) there will be no outstanding debt on Talkha I once Talkha II starts
operations; (2) debt service coverage afforded by Talkha II itself is expected
to be satisfactory (more than three times): and (3) the debt service of El Nasr's
consolidated operations would be covered more than four times.
5.05      The IDA Credit to the Government will be on-lent to El Nasr at
8.5% effective annual interest, repayable over 15 years including 5 years
grace and with the Company bearing the exchange risk during this period.  Details
of the Arab co-lenders financing are shown in Annex 5-2 and average 5.2%o interest
and 19 years maturity including 5 years grace, with the terms to the Government
and the Company being the same in most cases. Confirmation of the terms and con-
ditions of the Arab financing, including who bears the exchange risk will be a
condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit.
5.06      The equity financing 1/ of bE 16.9 million (US$43 million) will be
provided by the Government, drawing on El Nasr's own resources to the extent
available.  However, the Government's obligation to provide the equity finan-
cing to the project will be independent of El Nasr's ability to generate
internal funds from Talkha I during the execution of the project. The Gov-
ernment will also provide all additional funds (foreign and local) that may
be required to cover any cost overrun in the project, on terms satisfactory
to IDA, including any additional funds for the pipeline system, in the un-
likely event that these would be needed (para. 4.02).
C.   Procurement and Allocation of IDA Credit
5.07      IDA and Arab co-lenders foreign exchange financing will be on a
parallel basis, with separate, specific lists of goods and services. The
list allocated to IDA financing will consist of: (i) engineering and manage-
ment costs essentially for the services of the General Contractor and the
Technical Advisor; (ii) major equipment such as compressors, reactors and

(iii) materials such as structural steel, reinforcing steel, and instruments.
The allocation of the IDA credit and Arab co-lender funds is shown below:

Engineering Credit (para . 4.06), and erection costs shown in the table
in para. 5.01.
The Arab co-lenders' funds will be disbursed against the balance of the project's
foreign cost and, any IDA-allocated items were they to exceed the amount of the
proposed credit, would be transferred to the Arab co-lenders list of goods and
services.
5.08      There will be pre-qualification for all suppliers of equipment
and materials (i.e. independent of the sources of finance) and their tech-
nical evaluation will be done by the General Contractor (paras. 4.06 - 4.09).
IDA-financed items will be procured in accordance with the Bank Group's
procurement guidelines and although none of the IDA goods is expected to be
procured in Egypt, pre-qualified local suppliers would receive, for purposes
of bid evaluation, a preference of 15% or the amount of customs duty, which-
ever is lower. Equipment and materials will be purchased, at cost, in accord-
ance with the Bank Group's or the Arab co-lenders procurement guidelines. For
IDA funds, international competitive bidding will be used with the exception
of about US$3 million of proprietary items or items with limited availability
that will be procured by "international shopping." The Arab co-lenders procure-
ment procedures are expected to be similar to those of the Bank with the excep-
tion that the regulations of the Arab League must be followed and all countries,
including Eastern bloc countries (but excluding Israel), are permitted to bid
and there is no preference for local or Arab States suppliers.

basis and uses estimated 1978 prices. The project's revenues and operating
costs (including the assumptions on which they are based) are given in

/1   Ammonia which is not used, for production of urea is transferred to
Talkha I at Talkha I production costs.
6.02      The urea price has not yet been determined by the Government, except
the principle that it should reflect costs plus a reasonable profit. The
financial projections are based on an assumed ex-factory selling price of
urea of BE 37.3 per ton (US$95) which has been kept constant throughout the
forecast period. The above price has been determined so as to achieve a fin-
ancial rate of return before taxes of about 20%. In comparison, the assumed
urea price represents only two-thirds of the present ex-factory price of CAN
on a per ton nitrogen basis (para. 3.21).



- 23 -
6.03      It is projected that Talkha II will produce about 62,700 tons per
year of ammonia in addition to ammonia requirements for urea, which will be
transferred to Talkha I for further processing into CAN. In the project
analysis it is assumed that the transfer price will be US$110 per ton ammonia
which equals the Talkha I production costs for ammonia.
6.04      The principal raw material, representing about 41% of total operating
costs, is natural gas which has been assumed to be available at US$0.51 per
MCF (equivalent to EE 8.75 or US$22.3 per ton); this price is sufficient to
cover costs (including reasonable profits) for collection, purification and
delivery of the gas to the Talkha plant. Although the gas price is fixed
under a 20-year supply contract, it may be subject to change in step with
the Government's policy on the price of fuel oil. Should this happen, the
selling price of urea would correspondingly have to be adjusted and appropriate
assurance has been obtained from the Government. Since the proposed ex-factory
price, BE 37.3/ton, is well below the farm level price of about LE 62/ton and
actual distribution costs account for only about BE 6/ton, the ex-plant price
could be increased substantially before affecting the price of urea at the
farm. Polyethylene bags, another important input, will be produced from
imported polyethylene as part of the project and will also cover the bagging
requirements of Talkha I. Operating costs have been escalated to arrive at
1978 prices, the first year of Talkha II production, and kept constant there-
after except for salaries and wages which were increased at 3% annually through-
out the project life to reflect a rising trend in real wages. On these bases,
the estimated operating costs are adequate. They are low in comparison to
most other fertilizer projects the Bank Group has financed as the project
benefits from a good location relative to the major sources of materials and
utilities, low cost of feedstock, inclusion of bag making and some sharing of
overhead expenses with the Talkha I operations.
6.05      Detailed financial projections for the project (incremental income
statements, funds flow and balance sheets) together with the major assumptions
are contained in Annex 6-2 and summarized on the following page:

/1   Includes a small amount cf income from other sources.
/2   Net income before interest and depreciation but after tax.
6.06      Revenue forecasts are based on a build-up of Production from 71%
of capacity in 1978, the first year of commercial operation, to 95% of
capacity in 1980 and thereafter. The construction period, expected to end
in December 1977, includes six months commissioning and although the plant
may then already produce fertilizer, no revenues have been assumed. With
standard-sized and commercially-proven plant units, the performance guarantees
from the General Contractor and assured supplies of natural gas and power
from nearby sources, the assumed capacity utilization is reasonable.
6.07      The project is expected to earn a profit before tax from the first
year of operations, reaching a level of 33% of net sales by 1980. The profit
break-even point is 64% capacity utilization in 1978 and 52% in 1983, while
the profit break-even sales price declines from LE 30.9 (US$78.8) per ton
of urea in 1978 to BE 20.6 (US$52.6) in 1983.  Debt service coverage is



- 25 -
expected to exceed 3-times throughout the project life and cash build-up to
be significant as reflected by the increase of the current ratio from 7.4 in
1978 to 11.4 in 1983. The project's debt/equity ratio would be 63/37 in 1978
which will, because of the high earnings, improve quickly to 55/45 by 1982.
B.   Financial Rate of Return
6.08      The financial rate of return before and after income taxes is 19%
and 18% respectively, based on the assumed urea price of US$95 per ton ex-
plant (Annex 6-3). The difference is small because El Nasr pays taxes only
on retained profits (15% of before tax profits). However, as mentioned in
para. 3.21, the urea price has not yet been determined by the Government,
except the principle that it should reflect costs plus a reasonable profit.
Also the urea price on which the financial projections are based is - in terms
of nutrient - only about two-thirds of the price of other nitrogen fertilizers
currently produced in Egypt. A sales price difference of +25% changes the
financial return (before tax) to 25% and 12% respectively. A one year delay
in project completion decreases the return to 16% and a 10% cost overrun to
18%. Should Talkha II run only at 80% of capacity throughout its life instead
of the 95% as projected, the return drops to 16%. Finally the return will
decline to 15% if the gas price were to double to US$1.00 per MCF or conversely
with such higher gas price the urea price would have to be increased by 22%,
i.e., to about US$116 per ton, to maintain a financial return of about 20%.

6.10      While by the end of construction of Talkha II (December 1977), the
project by itself is expected to have a long-term debt/equity ratio of 67/33
it would be 39/61 if consolidated with Talkha I and the Company's consolidated
debt service coverage would exceed 4.0 times from 1978 onwards. A rapid cash
build-up is anticipated after 1978 because of substantial depreciation provisions
and the assumption that there would be no new capital investment in the future
except for normal renewals and replacements. Assuming furthermore (as is
done in these projections) that there would be no cash distribution beyond the
85% of net income normally paid out to the Government and the Company's



- 27 -
employees, the current ratio would remain above 8:1 throughout. While in
practice it is more likely that the Company will be expanded further and/or
that it will have to transfer additional funds to the Treasury, it is evident
that El Nasr's financial position can be kept on a sound basis throughout the
life of the project.
6.11      Nevertheless, to safeguard the Company's financial strength, the
following assurances were obtained: (i) during project implementation (Talkha
II) the Government will continue, as necessary, to provide funds to help El
Nasr repay its existing debt in accordance with its terms by not later than
December 31, 1977 and keep its working capital adequate so as not to interfere
with the maximum possible production of fertilizer from Talkha I; (ii) there-
after the Government will not withdraw funds from the Company if, as the result,.
the current ratio would fall below 1.5:1 or, should that become necessary,
provide funds to El Nasr to maintain the current ratio at least at that level;
(iii) without prior consultation with the Association, El Nasr will not, during
construction of the project, undertake any further capital investments (other
than Talkha I and II and any replacement and modernization of existing facili-
ties) exceeding BE 2 million in any one year and after project completion if,
as the result of such investments, the Company's debt/equity ratio would
exceed 50/50; (iv) in setting the ex-factory urea price the Government will
allow El Nasr reasonable profits at efficient production levels and to cover
its long-term debt service at least 1.5 times, within the framework of the
Company's efficient operations; and (v) without limitations of the provisions
of (iv), the retail price of urea at the farm level should be comparable to
other nitrogenous fertilizer, on a nutrient basis.
D.   Major Risks
6.12      The project faces only moderate technical, managerial and commercial
risks. The potential for substantial delays and major cost overruns during
project implementation, unless caused by a general overbooking in the fertilizer
equipment supply industry, is rather low because of (i) El Nasr's experience
in managing, constructing, and operating other fertilizer projects; (ii)
guarantees to be provided by engineering contractors for timely completion;
and (iii) participation in project implementation by the Technical Advisor and
General Contractor. The Commercial risks of the project are acceptable since
Egypt has been importing urea since the mid-1960's (the project output would
largely replace imports) and urea use is thus well established.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Raw Material and Fertilizer Prices
7.01     IW'orld urea prices in recent years have fluctuated sharply with supply/
demand imbalances, new technology, petroleum prices and currency revaluations.
A typical ammonia/urea plant capacity in 1974 is 5-10 times larger than in
the early 1960s. This increase in size, parallel with improvements in techno-
logy, reduced production costs substantially and a large increase in supply in



- 28 -
the late 1960s caused urea prices to drop sharply. In 1970, urea prices were
about US$50-60/ton. During 1970-1973, the increase in demand was not matched
with increased supply and at present there is a significant shortage of urea
and other fertilizer material throughout the world. These shortages along with
recent price increase of petroleum, the principal nitrogen fertilizer raw mat-
erial, plus changes in currency values have pushed up urea prices substantially.
Current CIF urea prices are US$200-300/ton. With expanding capacity, the
shortage should be alleviated, at least in part by 1977-78, when urea prices
are expected to level off at tlhen current prices of about US$120-140/ton FOB
bagged Persian Gulf port, varying thereafter with petroleum prices and in-
flation to reflect further changes in cost of production. The above FOB
Persian Gulf prices assume surplus gas at US$0.50/MCF, Talkha II construction
costs, a return on capital of 20%, and US$10/ton transport and handling costs
from factory to Persian Gulf port. It is an economic price and does not take
into consideration commercial factors such as higher assigned gas prices,
supply and demand distortions, and further rising transport costs, which could
have a major affect on future fertilizer prices.
7.02      The economic evaluat:Lon of Talkha II is based on a CIF delivered
Egyptian port price for bagged urea of US$120/ton and a natural gas price of
US$0.50/M  (US$1.40/MCF) which is equivalent in heating value to heavy fuel
oil at US$54/ton. This latter assumption is somewhat arbitrary, but since it
is based on the substitution of fuel oil for the gas used by Talkha, it reflects
a conservative price under Egyptian conditions.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
7.03      The economic rate of return is 19% based on the expected long-term
price for imported bagged urea of US$120 per ton CIF Egyptian port, with the
same price being assumed ex-factory at Talkha and a delivered gas price of
US$1.40/MCF (para. 7.04). Assuming Egypt's opportunity cost of capital in
the industrial sector is 12%, this is an attractive rate of return (Annex 7-1).
The relatively high return reflects the several advantages of the project:
(i) import substitution; (ii) optimum and economic use of the indigenous raw
material, natural gas; (iii) economies of scale in production facilities;
and (iv) optimum use of the existing facilities at Talkha. In addition, there
are substantial unmeasurable benefits not included in the calculation of the
economic return, such as training of labor, removal of fertilizer supply con-
straints and additional agricultural production and exports, that are also
attributable to the project.
7.04      The economic return is sensitive to changes in the price of urea,
and varies from 23% to 10% respectively with a +25% change in the urea
sales price. The return is also sensitive to project delays and cost over-
runs - a one-year delay decreases the return to 16% and a 10% cost overrun
lowers it to 17% - and to the gas price as discussed below.
7.05      The opportunity cost of natural gas and its effect on the economic
return of the project presents a special case in view of rapidly changing
petroleum (including natural gaLs) supply conditions and prices.  The price of
natural gas, delivered and suitable for fertilizer feedstock, can range from



- 29 -
about US$0.30-0.50/MCF (US$10-17/ton fuel oil) for surplus gas currently being
flared (as in the Persian Gulf); to about US$0.50-1.00/MCF (US$17-35/ton
fuel oil) as feed to an export LNG or urea plant; to US$1.40-2.00/MCF (USS54-
70/ton fuel oil) as a substitute for domestically consumed petroleum for fuel
purposes. 1/ The above range of gas prices compares to US$0.50/MCF used in the
financial return (para. 6.02). The opportunity cost of natural gas varies
considerably more than that of liquid petroleum since the conversion cost
of gas to other useful products (such as LNG or urea) and its transportation
costs (by pipeline or as LNG) vary over a much wider range than that of oil.
As a result, the opportunity cost of gas (or gas products) for export is
usually much lower than for domestic consumption. Therefore, for this project,
since urea is for domestic use and the natural gas, at least in part, displaces
domestic liquid fuel consumption, an equivalent heating value of fuel oil and
gas has been used in determining the opportunity cost of gas. The economic
return of 19% noted in para. 7.03 is based on a gas price of US$1.40/MCF
(equivalent to US$54/ton heavy fuel oil or about US$7-8 per barrel. The return
decreases to 14% if the gas price increases to US$2.00/MCF (equivalent to
US$70 per ton of heavy fuel oil or US$10/barrel) but increases to 24% if the
gas price falls to US$1.00/MCF.
7.06      If petroleum prices in world trade continue at a relatively high
level of US$6-12/barrel (US$42-84/ton), equivalent to a natural gas price of
about US$1-2/MCF, then the economic price of urea must increase also. At the
higher price levels for gas, alternative fuels such as coal and lignite on a
world-wide basis, are likely to become economic feedstocks for nitrogen
fertilizers.
C.   Foreign Exchange Savings
7.07      The project requires an estimated foreign exchange expenditure
of US$93 million. In return, the project will enable the country to avoid
importing fertilizer whose gross annual CIF bagged value (at US$120/ton of
urea) would amount to about US$65 million at 95% capacity utilization. The
net foreign exchange savings are estimated at about US$41 million/year.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACIED

ANNA 1-1
EGYPT: TALKHA II FERTILIZER PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TER4S
1.        Following is a description of the technical terms used in this
report:
2.        Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 16 elements,
6 in large and the remainder in small or micro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six, and others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc,
iron, aluminium, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen are readily available from the atmosphere and water. Nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium -- three main nutrients -- and the other elements
are drawn from the soil. Unless supplemented by regular additions of materials
containing the three main nutrients, soil is soon depleted of fertility by
cropping. Use of organic materials such as animal and vegetable wastes can
be utilized but the scale and intensity of modern agriculture have far exceeded
the availability of natural "fertilizers."  Consequently, the majority of the
world's primary plant nutrient needs are now supplied in the form of manu-
factured or "chemical" fertilizers. To an increasing degree, secondary
nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and micro nutrients such as
boron, zinc, copper and manganese are also added to soils along with the
primary nutrients in ratios prescribed by agronomists according to specific
crop and soil needs.
3.        Chemical Fertilizers:  Chenical compounds suitable as fertilizers
should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards and hand-
ling problems; and readily water soluble and available to plant root systems.
Commercially available materials meeting these requirements to a large
degree are:
Primary Fertilizer Materials
% of N                % of P205                    % of K20
Nutrient                Nutrient                    Nutrient
Urea               46%      Triple Super-          Potassium Chloride   61%
Ammonium Nitrate   3h%        phosphate    46%    Potassium Sulfate    5h%
Amonium Sulfate    21%      Single Super-
Diammonium                    phosphate    18%
Phosphate        18%    D3.P
Because of the high nutrient content of urea, diammonium phosphate and
potassium chloride (KCL), they are some of the most popular fertilizer
materials in the world today.  It is the common practice to report the
nutrient content of materials in terns of percentages of N and P205
(phosphorus pentoxide) and potassium K20 (potassium oxide).



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
4.        Complex or NPK Fertilizers:  All three primary nutrients (N,
P205, K20) are frequently a;pplied to the soil at the same time in ratios
varying with the nutrient requirements of different crops. To facilitate
handling, the several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uni-
form granules for distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as
a ratio to describe the NPK product. Thus 15-l5-15 complex fertilizer
contains 15% each of N, P2015, and K20; and 12-24-12 complex fertilizer
contains 12% N, 24% P205 an;1 12% K20.
5.          Phosphate Water Solubilitv:  The agronomic availability (or
efficiency) of phosphate materials vary substantially. A common practice is
to use water solubility as a criterion although in acidic soils it is a less
significant factor. Higher P205 water solubility permits the fertilizer to
be absorbed more rapidly. The minimum recommended in most cases is about
60% solubility but in some cases up to8J-85% solubility is preferred.
6.          Anmonium Nitrate (AN) is produced by reacting ammonia with nitric
acid. Nitric acid (HNO3), in turn, is made from ammonia (NH3). AN contains
34).5/Z iiirogen, half in the ammonium form and half in the nitrate form, and
is very hydroscopic. It also is a commercial explosive. In many countries, a
diluent -- e.g. limestone -- is added to lower the analysis and negate the
explosive properties as welL as to minimize the hydroscopic properties.
7.        Electrolysis is the process of separating water into hydrogen and
oxygen, by passing direct current through a weak caustic potash solution.
The hydrogen is subsequently converted into ammonia (NH3) as in the Aswan
(Kima) fertilizer plant.
8.        Partial Oxidation is a method of producing hydrogen from hydro-
carbon fuels of almost any type by a non-catalytic reaction with oxygen
followed by removal of the by-product, carbon monoxide. (It is used in
the Talkha I plant.)
9.        Feedstocks are the hydrocarbons used to produce hydrogen for the
ammonia synthesis; in the proposed Talkha II plant, the feedstock would be
natural gas which is usuaIllr the most economical choice when available.
Other potential feedstocks are naphtha, fuel oil, crude oil, coal or lignite.
10.       Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH2CONH2 - the normal
amide of carbonic acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in the
ammonium form. It is consicLerably less hydroscopic than ammonium nitrate
and it is the most widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
11         Urea Sythesis:  Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon
dioxide. Since both of the materials are produced during the ammonia
synthesis, urea production is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant.
Unfortunately, the corresponding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does
not form stable anmonium salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 3
Therefore, simple neutralization as used in making ammonium nitrate and
sulfate fertilizers is not possible.  Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide
are combined under heat and pressure to make armonium carbomate which,
although unstable, can be dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable
compound. Again,.unfortunately, the overall reaction is completely reversible
and even at 300 atmospheres pressure and 2000C, the conversion to urea in a
single pass through the reactor is under 70%. This introduces several
complications: high pressure must be used to maximize conversion; unconverted
reactants must be separated and recycled; increased corrosion under the high
temperatures and pressures used must be overcone, and urea decomposition into
undesirable products must be minimized. In recent years, several engineering
and producing companies have developed ways of surmounting these problems,
and large plants capable of producing a thousand tons per day, or more, of
urea to rigid chemical and physical specifications are now operating success-
fully for long periods throughout the world.
Petroleum Units and Measures
12.       The petroleum industry historically has used units of measure
based on the English measuring system. Conversion rates for some units
are given below:  I
1 barrel        = 42 US gallons;
1 US gallon     = 0.95 liters = 0.00095 M3;
1 ton crude oil = 7.0 barrels (approximately, based on the crude
oil specific gravity); and
1 ton oil       = 1.25 M3 of natural gas (approximately, based
on oil and gas compositions)
The conversion rates between volumetric units, such as gallons, and weights
are approximate since the specific gravity of the oil varies slightly with
its composition.
13.       Materials that exist in the form of gases, such as methane
(natural gas), are measured in volumetric units. Since gases are compressible,
standard conditions of temperature and pressure (0° C and 1.0 atmosphere )
are used to define the quantity (in volume) of gas, and designated as
"normal cubic meters" or "normal cubic feet."

EGYPT: TALKA II FERTILIZER PROJECT
FERTILIZER INDUSTRY IN EGYPT
A. Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry
1.        The industry is wholly State-owned through the General Organization
for Chemical Industries (GOCI) and existing companies are: (i) El Nasr
Comary for Fertilizers and Chemicals with plants at Suez and Talkha;
(ii) El Nasr Company for Coke at Helwan; and (iii) Egyptian Chemical Industries
(Kima) at Aswan. El Nasr is planning to set up a 570,000-TPY urea plant at
Talkha (adjacent to the existing Talkha I plant), the subject of this report.
The existing and planned nitrogen fertilizer capacity and production are shown
in T-bles 1 and 2.  Fertilizer distribution, marketing and procurement are
undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture in conjunction with the Fertilizer
Prices Stabilization Office, which also controls fertilizer imports  and the
General Organization for Agricultural and Cooperative Credit (GOACCO.
2.        Nitrogen fertilizers in Egypt are made from a variety of feedstocks:
oil refinery gas at Suez; coke-oven gas at Helwan; and hydrogen (from
electrolysis of water) at Aswan. Recently discovered natural gas will be
used for CAN and urea production at Talkha. Production of ammonia and urea
from natural gas is ideal, because the by-product carbon dioxide from the
ammonia plant can be combined with ammonia to make urea. Brief details of
the gas supply for the Talkha plants are given in Section C of this Annex.
3.        Different production costs for ammonia (and corresponding costs
of nitrogen in fertilizers) will prevail at Talkha in the two adjacent units
(producing CAN and urea respectively). The ammonia plant supplying the CAN
unit, although never operated, was designed and purchased some 10 years ago
before the development of modern, high efficiency plants using steam-turbine
driven centrifugal compressors. Moreover, the plant uses relatively costly
partial oxidation technology instead of reforming of natural gas with steam
and air, and is a double-train unit of 360 tons per day. The proposed Talkha
II ammonia-urea plant would contain a single-train, centrifugal compressor-
driven ammonia unit of 1,200 TPD capacity, and utilities integrated with the
urea unit. Ammonia produced at Helwan in relatively small units by partial
oxidation of coke-oven gas will involve high cost. At Kima (Aswan), although
the price of power used to produce electrolytic hydrogen!/ is about $0.002
per KWh, ammonia production costs should be comparable to those at Helwan
and Talkha I. The closed plants at Suez are also small inefficient units
based on partial oxidation of refinery gas, and involving high production
costs. Expansion at Kima was envisaged some time ago, but the Government
had some reluctance to allocate additional power to Kima for increased
nitrogen (or phosphate) fertilizer production, as the opportunity cost of
power seems likely to increase in the near future given alternative uses.
1/  The Nangal Project in India, 46-IN, January 2, 1973, describes in detail
the economics of producing nitrogen fertilizer by electrolysis.



ANNEX 1-2
Page 2
The possibility of using heavy fuel oil to expand nitrogen capacity at Kima
has been discussed in Egypt;, but it is doubtful that this proposal will be
an economic alternative for Egypt.
1.         The Government has under consideration another large ammonia/urea
plant, to be located near Alexandria, that would be export-oriented. The
plans for this project are in a very preliminary stage and it would be
implemented well after the start of the Talkha II project.
5.        Further expansion and/or diversification is possible at Talkha.
A portion of the existing ammonia plant could be converted inexpensively
to methanol/formaldehyde production to supply the industrial needs of these
chemicals in Egypt. Also, nitrophosphate production, based on the already
existing nitric acid/ammonium nitrate plant could prove to be economically
attractive.
B.  Phosphate Fertilizer Indsty
6.        The phosphate fertilizer industry is also owned by the Government.
The El Nasr Phosphate Company operates three plants which are all designed
to produce single superphosphate (SSP), a low-grade granulated material
containing about 15% P205, in the following quantities   (see also Tables 1
and 2):

7.        The Abu Zabal plant is undergoing major maintenance work and its
output may increase in the near future to about 40,000 TPY P20c.  In addi-
tion, some 56,000 tons of blast-furnace slag containing 10 to 12% P205 are
produced at the Helwan steel plant and sold locally as fertilizer.  The
slag production is expected to nearly double during 1974 when a second
blast furnace will be in full operation. Total P205 fertilizer capacity
will then be:

TOTAL                                         92,000
8.        Single superphosphate is produced in the form of granules from
domestic phosphate rock and sulfuric acid produced from imported sulfur
and pyrites, and is shipped in plastic-lined jute sacks.
9.        Considerable reserves of phosphate rock exist in Egypt (see
Map, IBRD-10047).       However, phosphate rock production is small and
Egypt is not significant in the world trade in phosphate rock. In the
eastern desert lie several medium-grade (approximately 30% P205) deposits
of commercial significance. Those near the Safaga port have been mined for
many years, especially for exports, and are substantially depleted. Further
south are the Qusayr deposits, which have also been mined for many years.
South of Safaga, at Hamrawein, is another extensive deposit which will soon
supply domestic and some export needs. Mining and beneficiation equipment
are being installed which, by the end of 197h, should produce annually 0.6
million tons of 32-34% P205 grade, 1.2 million tons of 23% P205 grade and
0.3 million tons of 28-30% P205 grade. Reserves are estimated to be suffi-
cient for 15 years' production. In the Nile Valley, other commercially-
sizeable reserves exist: (a) near Sebeija, south of Luxor, where over 100
million tons of 21% P205 grade rock are known and under exploitation; and
(b) at Abu Shigela (over 11 million tons of proven reserves); (c) and at
Hagaria, west of Naga Hamadi (at least 14 million tons of proven reserves).
The biggest known deposit is at Abu Tatura in the Kharga region of the
Western Desert, where 600 million tons of 28% P205 grade phosphate rock have
been identified. However, these reserves lie under 30 meters of overburden
and are in a remote area. The following table suwmaarizes annual phosphate
rock production and consumption:

Proposed Production Of Phosphorus in Egt
10.        During the last few years, detailed discussions have been held
with the USSR, the US and the Federal Republic of Germany about installing
a large elemental phosphorus complex at Aswan or further dain the Nile at
SebeJ a near suitable phosphate rock deposits. Metallurgical coke, made
from imported coal, is proposed to be barged from the Helwan unit. The
USSR has proposed a project based on using Aswan hydropower that would
include four 72-megawatt furnaces to manufacture about 105,000 TPY of
phosphorus (262,500 TPY of P205) of which 40,000 TPY would be shipped to
the USSR and 65,000 TfY would be converted in Egypt to phosphoric acid. In
turn, this acid would be used to produce for domestic use and exports about
250,000 TPY of diammonium phosphate for agricultural and animal-feed purposes,
plus 30,000 TfY of sodium tripoly-phosphates for detergents. An earlier
proposal to make triple superphosplhate from furnace acid has been dropped.
The total project cost is estimated at about US$300 million (including costs
of development of a new mine, ore beneficiation facilities, feed preparation
furnaces, downstream chemical plants, and power and other infrastructure
facilities). The high project cost, uncertainties in the export markets
and prices, and increased needs for alternative uses of power are major out-
standing issues. The total power production of the new Aswan High Dam should
be 2,100 MW from 12 turbines!/ when the lake is filled. The proposed phos-
phorus complex would consume about 320 MW or 15% of the total. A large
aluminum smelter and other electro-thermal plants (ferro-silicon) are also
under consideration, and competition for power use, including for the purpose
of rural electrification,is increasiing.  As a result, it is doubtful that a
phosphorus project will be implemented in the near future.
C. Natural Gas and Petroleum Production in Egypt
11.        Abu Madi Gasfield (Table 3):In conjunction with DNI of Italy,the Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC:) has developed a new natural gasfield at
Abu Madi, about 40 km north of Talk ha. The joint venture company has drilled
7 wells of which 5 have proved procluctive. Identified recoverable reserves
are estimated between 30 billion and 40 billion cubic meters.2/ A pipeline
with a capacity of 3.3 million cubic meters/day to Talkha and a field
gathering and gas treating plant are under construction and are scheduled for
completion by the end of 1974. Field pressure is sufficiently high so that
compression will not be necessary for the first several years of pipeline
operation. Anticipated daily consumption in cubic meters/day is 26 million
1/ Present output is about 1,200 1W. The old Aswan Dam downstream has a
200 MW capacity. At full operation, the Kima CAN plant uses about 300 MW.
2/ A report by ENI should be completed by March 1974 which should indicate
reserves more precisely. In addition, El Nasr has been asked to utilize
a gas consultant to prepare a report that would assist IDA in completing
its appraisal of this project.



ANNEX 1_ 2
Page 5
cubic meters/day of which 8 million would be for the Talkha I CAN4 plant,
13 million for the Talkha II urea plant, and 5 million for a local
power station and township. The above level of total consumption should
give the reserves identified to-date a life of at least 30 years and
additional reserves could be proven as drilling continues. The gas is
priced to the Talkha plants at LE 8.75 per metric ton for a period of 20
years. The pricing basis used is the equivalent heating value of fuel oil
in the country, which is priced at LE 7 per ton (US$17.8/ton). This price
has been constant for a number of years and does not reflect the recent
changes in the world petroleum situation regarding both supply and prices.
The contract between the Government of Egypt and ENI provides for adjustment
in fuel oil prices but the Government has the option of setting domestic
prices and it is expected that the Govennment gas price to El Nasr will be
maintained at the agreed level for the foreseeable future. However, El Nasr
has been asked to interpret through a gas consultant the various contracts
more precisely.
12.       Other Gasfields:  Two additional major gas discoveries have been
made in the Delta area:  the one at Abu Kir is    comparable in size to the
Abu Madi gasfield; and the other at Abu Gharahib has known recoverable
reserves of about 40 billion cubic meters. By 1975/76, the gas from the
latter will be piped to Helwan and Cairo at tt rate of h million cubic meters
per day. Bids on this line are now being received.
13.       Other Hydrocarbons:  Total annual refinery capacity in Egypt is
about 8 million tons per year from two plants in Alexandria(of 1.5 million
TPY and 3.0 million TPY capacity respectively) and one in Cairo (of 3.5
million TPY capacity). In 1972 and 1973, local oil production was about
8.5 million tons of crude. Recent drilling has indicated additional oil
and gasfields in the Western Desert, but exploration costs are yet unknown
with a ratio of producing to dry holes being about 1:14. An increase in
local gas production and use will release more crude and refinery products
for export, thus giving gas a relatively high opportunity cost. Condensible
hydrocarbons to be exploited from the Abu Gharahib and Abu Madi natural
gasfields are expected to total 250,000 TPY and 70,000 TPY respectively.
Details of Egyptian crude petroleum and refinery products are given in
Table 4. Egypt has recently approved construction oe a maior oil pipeline
of 80-120 million TPY capacity to be installed between Suez and Cairo. This
line will primarily serve as an alternative transport for the Suez Canal and
should not affect the economics of oil production in Egypt nor have any
effect on the economic cost of producing urea from natural gas at Talkha.

ANNEX 2-2
EGYPT: TALKA II FERTILIZER PROJECT
EL NASR COMPANY DESCRIPTION ANJ ORGANIZATION CHARiT
1.        The El Nasr Company for Fertilizers and Chemical Industries (El
Nasr) is one of the largest companies in the chemical sector under the
General Organization for Chemical Industries (GOCI) and one of three com-
panies in Egypt engaged in the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilizers.
Its principal assets consist of a calcium nitrate plant and an ammonium
sulfate plant at Suez and a calcium-ammonium nitrate plant at Talkha, 135
kilometers north of Cairo. Like most industrial companies in Egypt, it is
entirely owned by the Government, having been nationalized in 1961.
2.        The Company has been in existence since 19h7, when it was founded
under private Egyptian ownership with the name Societe Egyptienne d'Engrais
et d'Industries Chimiques Suez. The Company had an initial paid-in share
capital of LE 4 million. In 1948, the Company received a loan of US$7.25
million from the US Eximbank for the construction of the Suez plant with a
capacity of 40,000 tons per year nitrogen as calcium nitrate product, and
began commercial operations in 1951. In 1960 the ammonium sulfate plant
(20,000 TPY N) was constructed alongside the calcium nitrate plant, financed
in part by an Eximbank       loan        of US$5 million.
3.        In July 1961 the Government decreed that all major industrial
companies were subject to nationalizatio; with individual shareholdings in
any given firm to be limited to a market value of LE 10,000, and assets
above that limit passing   into State ownership.  The owners were paid for
their first LE 1,000 of assessed equity in cash, for the next BE 14,000 in
short-term Government bonds, and for the balance in long-term Government bonds.
The Government acquiredl1O% of El Nasr, and in 1962 it was renamed Societe El
Nasr d'Engrais et d'Industries Chimiques, Suez (the legal name of the Company)
and placed under the supervision of the GOCI. In 1963-64 the Company secured
a loan (DM17.88 million) from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) and
suppliers' credits from Koppers (DM3.83   million) and BASF (DM63.75 million)
for the construction of the CAN plant (250,000 TPY , 31% N) at Suez (now the
Talkha I plant).
4.        In 1967 a kraft paper mill at Suez with paid-in equity of BE 1.5
million was merged with the Company. The paper mill produced 18,000 TFY of
kraft paper, and approximately 20% of its output was fertilizer bags. In
1972 the kraft paper facility was re-sited in Alexandria, split apart from
El Nasr Company and merged with the National Kraft Paper Company, another
enterprise under the GOCI's supervision.
5.        With the start of hostilities in 1967, El Nasr Company's plants
were forced to operate at reduced levels. Until 1967, the Company operated



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
at close to 100% of capacity and generated average profits before taxes of
25% on paid-in equity. The financial year 1966-67 was a record year for
sales and profit. In 1969 a direct hit on the adjacent refinery which had
supplied the basic feedstock (refinery gas) for the fertilizer plants forced
their complete shut-down, and since July 1969, the Company has produced no
fertilizer, and has run at a loss.
6.        In the interim since 1969 and until its plants can begin operating
again, the Company has been dependent on State subsidies. Management and
labor have demonstrated flexidbility and esprit de corps in keeping the enter-
prise operating primawily as a service organization, lending its engineers
and technicians to other companies within Egypt, and selling services to
other Arab countries. The Company had gained experience by erecting and
starting up its ammonium sulfate unit in 1961. This experience had proven
valuable in 1966 when the pri-j contractor for the CAN plant (Chemico)
ceased work in a dispute over project delays and cost overruns and the Com-
pany was forced to take over the contracting and supervision of construction
and start-up. The Company itself had successfully contracted for and erected
the partial oxidation (Koppers) unit and the nitric acid (BASF/Uhde) plant
and had partially completed the erection of the ammonia plant when the deci-
sion was taken in 1971 to move the entire CAN plant to Talkha, located in
the Delta 250 kilometers by rail northwest of Suez. The Company carried out
the job of disassembling and moving the plant and is responsible for erection
at Talkha, including over-all supervision, design engineering, general and
detailed civil engineering, supervision of civil works execution (by local
sub-contractors), and mechanical construction and erection. The CAN plant
is due to begin commercial operation in early 1975.
7.        In addition to its own plants, the Company's engineers, technicians,
and skilled laborers have carried out the following jobs:
a. Conducted the start-up of the H  plant at the Suez
Petroleum Refinery Company (1966);
b. Erected and started-up two sulfur mills for the Kafr
El Zayat Insecticide Company complete with all
electrical and instrument connection (1970);
c. Assisted in the erection and start-up of the El Nasr
Company for Coke's AN plant at Helwan (1970-73);
d. Erected the Misr Chemical Company's sodium carbonate
plant in Alexandlria (1970-73);
e. Assisted in the construction and erection of the
superphosphate plants at Asyut and Abu Zaabal;



ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
f. Assisted in the construction, erection, and start-up of
a large urea plant in Kuwait; and
g.  Conducted start-up and continue  to supervise operation
of the ammonium nitrate plant at Hems, Syria.
As many as 650 engineers, chemists, fitters, masons, welders, equipment
operators, riggers and laborers were employed in each of the above assign-
ments for six months to four years.
8.        As a result of this extensive experience the Company maintains its
labor force intact while developing a skilled group of engineering, construc-
tion and maintenance personnel. This experience should serve to minimize
the costs of the proposed Talkha ammonia/urea plant and to help keep down-
time to a minimum once the plant goes into commercial operation.
9.        The Company's organization chart is shown on page 5 of this Annex.
The Board of Directors includes the Managing Director, his four senior
officers, and four representatives of labor. The five senior management
members of the Board are appointed by the President of the Republic. They
have all been with the Company since 1947-50 and have             spent half
their careers with the Company under private enterprise operation.
10.       Labor relations are said to be good, and the four labor representa-
tives on the Board reportedly share management's over-all perspective. The
Company is over-staffed by private enterprise standards, having a total of
4,250 people on the payroll (including a contingent of unknown size left over
from the kraft paper mill which no longer belongs to the El Nasr Company).
11.       The work force is divided among Suez, Talkha, Cairo and other com-
panies' sites (although at present the Suez site is abandoned). Approximately
2,500 persons are engaged in the erection of the CAN plant at Talkha. The
remaining 1,750 are divided between those engaged in administrative functions
in Cairo and those on loan to other companies for work in on-going construc-
tion projects. When the CAN plant at Talkha reaches full capacity in 1975,
it will employ 2,000 with 600 utilized in production, 900 in engineering,
maintenance and utilities.and 500 in administrative duties. It is expected
that the proposed ammonia urea project will employ another 1,350.
12.       The Company management controls day-to-day operation of the enter-
prise, within the constraints defined by the nationalization laws of 1961 and
subsequent legislation. As a profit center the Company is expected to survive
on its own financially, but it has little or no direct control over the unit
costs or sources of its inputs. Selling prices are determined on a cost-plus
basis and are mutually agreed upon by the Company, the GOCI and the Ministry
of Industry, usually at a margin of 20 - 25% over costs. The Company has
only one customer, the General Organization for Agricultural and Cooperative

Pags' 4i  ~
Credit (GOACC) of the Ministry of Agriculture which is the agency responsible
for procurement and distribution of fertilizer.
13.       Investment decisions and the flow of funds of the company are
defined by law and illustrate the degree to which the Government participates
directly in the major decisions. The company submits its budget forecasts
and year-end accounts to the GOCI for supervision and auditing. The company
can utilize its depreciation reserves and 10% of its net income at the dis-
cretion of the company's Board of Directors, but any proposal for expansion
must be cleared by the GOCI zand the General Organization for Industry (GCFI)
and ultimately by the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Industry.
The normal sequence is for the company to draft a proposal which includes
a budget by year and a sources and uses of funds statement.  A formal feasi-
bility study is then prepared by the GOFI in consultation with the Company
and the GOCI and cleared through the Ministry of Industry to the Ministry
of Planning which compiles the proposals into the national plan for submis-
sion to the Central Planning Committee, a cabinet branch, which after con-
sideration,in turn, submits the national plan for approval by the Parliament.
(The Talkha ammonia/urea project has been through this approval process
already and has gone to tender, but the Government has been unable to find
financing for it.)
14.       Once approval for a project is obtained, generally the GOFI is
charged with execution of the project, and the assets are transferred to the
ampany as they are purchased.                     The project is subdivided
by years and each year's budgeted capital expenditure must be approved by the
company, the GOCI and the GOFI.
15.       The distribution of excess funds generated by the company's opera-
tions is similarly governed by law.  The  ompany can retain only 10% of net
income for its discretionary use with an additional 5% being earmarked for
investment in Government bonds. The remaining 85% of net income is distributed
through GOCI to the Treasury, the GOCI (as a management fee) and the Company's
employees. The financial year ends December 31, and the books must be closed
by March for certification by Government auditors by the end of April. A
General Assembly meeting of thte GOCI, equivalent to a shareholders' meeting
and presided over by the Ministry of Industry, meets in May to review the
prior year's operations, clear' the audited financial statments and approve
the proposed distribution of net income. The actual payout of cash then
takes place in May.
/.rofit distribution
16.       The'laws are somewhat flexible; for example, the company is allowed
(with the consent of the Ministry of Industry) to make provisions out of net
income for reserves for expected future costs before any distribution takes
place.

Definition of Ratios
Operating Ratio Before Depreciation (OP RATIO BEF DEP) = Cost of Goods
Sold/Total Sales.
Operating Ratio After Depreciation (OP RATIO AFT DEP) = (Cost of goods
Sold + Depreciation)/Total Sales.
Debt Service Coverage (DEBT SERVICE COV,) = (Income before interest
but after taxes + depreciation)/(interest payments + loan repayments).
Current Ratio (CURRENT RATIO) = Current Assets/Current Liabilities.
Debt/Equity Ratio (DEBT/EQUITY RATIO) = Total Longterm Debt/(Total
Equity + Total Longterm Debt). The figure shown, if multiplied by
100%, thus gives the percentage of debt with respect to total
financing.

EGYPT: TALKHA II FERTILIZaR PROJECT
AGRICULTURE IN 3GYPT
A.   Past Growth
1.        Agriculture is Egypt's most important economic sector in terms
of contribution to GDP (about 30%), employment (about half), and foreign
exchange earnings (about 55% of total commodity exports in unprocessed
form, with processed agricultural goods accounting for an additional 30%).
The growth rate of value added (in real terms) in agriculture has averaged
about 3.54 annually over the past 15 years, but slowed to 2% or less annually
in the period 1967-1971. This decrease reflected declines in the growth rates
of both crop yields and labor productivity. The shortage of foreign exchange,
low investment in agriculture and fertilizer, and the priority given to
defense and other sectors, especially since the 1967 war, have been significant
influences limiting agricultural growth. Cotton as a foreign exchange earner
and bilaterial trade ties have been important influences on agricultural
production and trade. The major development of the last decade was the
completion of the Aswan High Dam, which permitted a shift from basin to
perennial irrigation and the expansion of the agricultural area through
reclamation.
B.   Cultivated Land
2.        The land area under cultivation in Egypt is between 6.5 million
and 7 million feddans. However, almost total irrigation and long-growing
season permit a much larger cropped area -- about 10.5 million feddans -- which
means that about 1.6 crops per year per unit of arable land are obtained on
average. The area cropped has increased about 500,000 feddans since 1960,
with most of this increase resulting since 1966/67, when water from the Aswan
High Dam made year-round water supplies available. Rice and cotton currently
account for about two-fifths of the arable land, and a quarter of the cropped
area. The cotton area remained at about 1.6 million feddans over most of the
past decade, but the rice area increased by more than 500,000 feddans, reaching
1.1 million feddans by the late 1960's.  The cotton area is allocated by the
Government. Rice has become an increasingly popular summer crop because its
price has generally been favorable and it is not affected by high water tables.
However, because of its high water demand, the area cultivated in any district
is limited by the capacity of the canal system to deliver irrigation water.
3.        The regulation of cotton and rice areas has effectively controlled
the summer cropping pattern, and the constraints imposed by the rotation system
have effectively restricted growth of the major food and feed crops: wheat,
maize and berseem (clover). These crops currently account for 1.3 million,
1.5 million and 2.7 million feddans, respectively. The only crops other than
rice which have experienced area increases in Ihe past decade are sugarcane,
and fruit and vegetables.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
C.   Government Policy
4.        While agricultural policy in the 1960's was fairly successful  in
terms of export earnings (largely from cotton and rice -- and for cotton
due to favorable world prices rather than an increased volume of exports),
Egypt has had to increase food imports (largely wheat and wheat flour) from
LE 30 million in 1959/60 to over 6E 95 million in 1970/71.
5.        The shortage of foreign exchange has affected agriculture in two
major ways. Pressure is exerted to maintain or increase earnings from
traditional exports and to develop new agricultural exports. At the same
time, agriculture has had to compete with other high-priority sectors for
scarce foreign currency to finance capital and intermediate goods imports.
In Egypt, where land is limited and relatively intensely cropped, increases
in production come primarily from improved yields, which result from the
use of better production methods with larger applications of inputs such as
fertilizers, pesticides, new seeds and farm equipment which usually involve
some foreign exchange component.   But these requirements are not all being
met. For example, shortages of imported fish meal have seriously affected
poultry production, while the rationing of foreign exchange for fertilizer
imports has constrained the growth of fertilizer use in the case of most
crops.
6.        Although more than 90% of Egyptian farmland is in either private
or small-scale cooperative sectors, the Government'. controls are pervasive.
The purchase of the entire cotton crop and portions of other crops (rice,
wheat, sugarcane, onions, etc.) by village cooperatives, at centrally
determined prices, has been the principal method of regulating the supply
of exports and of basic food items for domestic consumption. For export
commodities, prices received by farmers are determined independently, while
for essential domestic commodities there is a complex system of taxes and
subsidies. There is a distinct policy of maintaining farm prices relatively
constant, and of varying the cost of farm inputs rather than adjusting prices
received by farmers, to influence production. Thus, the Government influences
farm income and the production possibilities of farmers.
7.        The Government also has a major impact on the sector's activities
through budget administration. In recent years, a relatively low percentage
of public investment has been allocated to agriculture (15-18% of the total).
The announced target of the Government is an increase of about 40% in
agricultural value added over the next decade. But it is questionable whether
thiF growth can be achieved with allocation to agriculture (including
irrigation) of only some 13% of public investment, as is proposed in 1973-1977
Plan. And, while the Plan itself targets a substantial enlargement of invest-
ment funds as compared with recent years, the continuing high priority given
to defense and to industrial development make the goals for agricultural
investment and output appear overly optimistic.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
D.   Major Problems
8.        The latest Bank economic report on Egypt (December 1972) and
the Bank "Report on Agro-Industries and Rural Development in Egypt"
(March 1973) describe the major issues and problems relating to Egyptian
agriculture. Theeconomic report stresses that greater reliance must be
placed on yield-improving technologies in the main field crops to head-
off a potential domestic food crisis and/or a drastic decline in foreign
exchange earnings (or savings) from these crops. However, this will call
for increased allocations of foreign exchange for import (or investment
in domestic production facilities) of fertilizers, insecticides, livestock
feed and certain farm machinery. Both reports recommend that Egypt pursue
more intensively its efforts to promote high-value non-traditional agric-
ultural ecports, and conclude that the rationing of ertilizers in recent
years has constrained the growth of yields and output. Doubt is expressed
whether Egypt's growth targets for the sector could be achieved with the
relatively small share of resources allocated to agriculture under the
1973-1977 Plan.
9.        There are certain characteristics of the Government administrative
structure in agriculture that limit its ability to face up to many of the
current key issues in agriclitural development planning and programming.
One of these is the fragmentation orf responsibility for sector development
among several ministries, in particular the Ministry of Agriculture and
Agrarian Reform, the Ministry of Irrigation, and Ministry of Land Reclamation,
tlhe Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Foreign Trade,
and the Ministry of P-lanning. Some steps have been taken to coordinate:
land reform and land reclamation under tlae supervision of the Ministry of
Agriculture; Agriculture and Irrigation through a Ministerial Comnittee for
Production; and other activities through a Supreme Council for Agricultural
Development under the Minister of Agriculture. However, there are still
quite distinct lines drawn between the land reform areas (about 1 millicn
feddans), the old land (about 5 million feddans) and the newly-reclaimed
lands (about 712,000 feddans). Likewise, the division of responsibilities
between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Irrigation, together
with the rather different orientation of the two  Ministries -- Agronomy and
Engineering -- presents problems for coordinated planning.  The cotton and
rice indlustry organizations are supervised by the Ministry of Finance,
Econon-,y and Foreign Trade.  The Ministry of Industry *s responsibly for the
fertilizer, textile and food processing industries.  Wlith this division of
responsibility, ani a generally inadequate forward planning system, the
orderly and rapid developmrent of the agricultural sector m.y pirove to be
difficult.

3.        The agricultural national plan for the period 1972-1985 aims at
increasing agricult.ural production by about 50%. This increase in the
value of agricultural production is to be achieved through several ways,
the most important of whiclh is the increase in agricultural productivity
through the use of improved technology. Fertilizer is assumed to play an
important role in the attainment of this projected growth.
4.        The following table shows the projected needs of nitrogenous
fertilizers for various crops:

C.   Fertilizer Application Rates
5.        Tables 4, 5 and 6 give the planned or the recorptended nitrogen
application rates for different crops.  These rates indicate a trend
toward increased rates for the majority of crops. This trend is gradual
for nitrogen fertilizers butl shows a sudden increase for phosphate and
potash fertilizers in 1976 aind 1977 for certain crops. However, no
phosphate is planned for wheat and maize, reflecting the current practice.
6.        Phosphate fertilizers for vegetables are planned to increase
from a rate of 15 kg (of P2(5) per feddan during 1973-1975 to 30 kg in
1976, remaining constant at that level in the near future. The same
trend is forecast for fruits and some oilseeds.
7.        Potash fertilizers are confined to fruits and vegetables.  Their
consumption per feddan is planned to remain constant during 1973-1975 at a
level of 24 kg (of K20), and then increase to 36 kg in 1976. From 1977 on,
their use per feddan will increase to 48 kg for both fruits and vegetables.
8.        Fertilizer experiments are scanty particularly for phosphate and
potash fertilizers and, therefore, their role in total fertilizer applica-
tion can hardly be determined. Furthermore, the fertilizer response of
different crops will depend to a large extent upon the general level of
agricultural technology. In the absence of such a comprehensive analysis,
it is assumed that the planrned rates represent the best available indication
of the extent of the composition of fertilizer use in the coming decade.
Projected requirements were calculated (Tables 4, 5 and 6) accordingly
taking into account the changes in the cropping pattern and new land area
contribution:

D.   Cropping Pattern
9.        The crcpping pattern in Egypt is determined by several factors.
Aside from the two major existing constraints--land and water--the fcllowing
factors are taken into account in determining the cropping pattern in Egypt:
(1   Soil, building crops, e.g., leguminous crops that improve the
soil's productivity due to its nitrogen-fixing character;
(2) Fodder crops to feed farm animals and to cope with livestock
production targets; and
(3) Grains which can be divided into cash crops and subsistence
crops for farm consumption.
10.       It was against these considerations that the triennial (i.e., three-
year) rotation system has emerged throughout most of Egypt. Given the severe
land ancd water constraints, the general cropping pattern in Egypt shows
lirited change over time. The general cropping system can be depicted as
follows:
Table 7
General Cropping Pattern in a Cropping Year
Permanent Crops:            Orchards
Semi-Permanent:              Sugarcane
Whole Year Crops:            Berseem and Cotton
Basic Winter Crops          Basic Summer Crops
Wheat                        Rice
Barley                      Groundnuts
Beans                       Maize
Lentils                     Millet
Perm-Berseem                 Sesame
Onions                       Summer Vegetables
Flax
Winter Vegetables
11.       It follows that the increase in the area of one crop is only
feasible at the expense of other crops.  The ex)ansion in rice area for
imstance can be achieved at the expense of maize or cotton. The rise in
wheat area can be compensated by a decline in either cotton or berseem area,
whereas the expansion of fruits and vegetables (both winter and summer)
affects mainly cotton and possibly other crops.

ANNEX 3-3
Page 13
1L.       The projected cropping pattern, which is presented in the above
tables, shows: (1) The cotton area is kept constant at a level of about
1.6 million feddans. This area will suffice to meet the cotton needs of
local industries and also of exports given the fact that the Plan assumes an
increase in cotton productivity from the level. of 1.C0 tons per feddan in
1972 to 1.20 tons in 1977 with the use of better yielding seed varieties;
(2) For rice, the Plan envisages itz area under the "old" land to remain at
the present level of about 1.0 million feddans and a slight increase in itF
area under the "new" land.  The Plan aims at increasing rice productivity
per feddan from 2.2 tons in 1972 to 2.6 tons in 1977; (3) The projection
entails an increase of about 240,000 feddans in the old land for some basic
food crops such as beans, sugarcane, sesame, lentils, onions, fruits and
vegetables. Such increases, though of smaller magnitude, are planned in
the new land, particularly for fruits; and (4) As a result of increasing
the area under the above-mentioned food crops, and keeping the cotton area
at a relatively high level, there will be a decrease in the areas undler
wheat, maize, barley, and berseem of about 700,000 feddans, as can be seen
frcm the following figures:
Cropwise Distribution of Area
(In 1,OOC Feddans)
Crop                     1972 (Actual)             1977 (Projected)
Wheat                        1,29b                       1,143
Maize                        1,573                       1,360
Barley                         132                         113
Berseem                      1,732                       1,580
15.       Despite a decrease in the area of wheat and maize, the Plan estimates
higher levels of production for the.se two crops. Wheat productivity per
feddan is expected to increase fron 1.3 tons in 197? to about 1.7 tons in
1977 mainly due to the use of better seeds.  Therefore, despite the projected
decrease in total wheat area by some 14%, total wheat production is expected
to increase by about 12%.
16.       Maize yields are projected to increase by about 33% which will
more than compensate for the reduction in area. Several new high-yielding
varieties being introduced are expected to cover all the maize area by 1977.
E.   Development of the New Lands
17.       The above discussed projections for crop pattern have taken into
account two facts;  First, the total agricultural land in Egypt has been
decreasing owing to the expansion of non-agricultural uses of land.  It is
estimated that the annual lsses of cultivated land in the past few years has
amounted to about 60,00o feddans. However, several legislative measures were
adopted recently to curtail further losses and, therefore, the projec-tions were
b..Ased on average annual losses of cultivated land of about 20,000 feddans.
Secondly, the area of the new land that is being put under cultivation is planned
to increase from about 480,oo0 feddans in 1972 to about 668,ooo feddans in 1977,
based on the land. reclamation program. On the whole, the new land cropped area
percentage to total cropped area is projected to increase from 7.1% in 1972 to
10.-0` in 1977.

EGYPT:  TATLEIA II FERTILIZER PROJ3CT
D'SCRIPTION OF FACILITIES
A.   Talkha I (Under Construction)
1         The Talkha I Unit is an ammonium nitrate (AN) facility supplied
from uermany (Faderal Republic) nearly 1C years ago for installation at
Suez and to be based on flare gas from a local refinery.  The project
construction was interrupted by hostilities in 1967, and the entire plant
has been moved to Talkha starting in 1970;  the plant's design capacity
is 318,000 TPY of CAN (31% nitrogen), equivalent to 98,000 TFY N.  A minor
expansion to 117,000 TPY N is proposed, which entails moving additional
facilities from Suez. Ammonia -would be provided from Tplkha II. The
existing ammonia plant at Talkha iF based on partial oxidation of feedstock
and gas purification, followed by reciprocating, electrically-driven
comi:ression and aTrinonia synthesis.  The air separation-oxygen unit was
F,upplied by Linde and the ammonia unit by Thde on BASF design.  AltIough
the equipment is new, this ammonia plant is obsolete by comparison with
thoFe built in the last few years (i.e., based on steam-reformied nWaphtha
or natural gas, plus steam-driven, centrifugal compression).
2.        The nitric acid plant, supplied by Uhde is a standard low-pressure
design based on nine converters, with emphasis on energy saving and maximwu
catalyst recovery.  The ammonium nitrate BASF-Uhde neutralization section is
also standard. The AN concentration and prilling unit was supplied by
Didier and includes a prill tower plus rotary equipment for drying, cooling
and conditioning the prills. Provisior for grinding and adding limestone
are included. Bagged storage for about two weeks production or 10,000 tons
is under construction.
3.        Off-site facilities include steam generation, electrical sub-
stations, water treatment, offices, laboratories, maintenance shops and
garages. The site is level and firm with a total area of about 60 hectares,
of which 20 are taken up by the AN plant, 20 by itE off-sites, leaving
another 20 for the proposed urea project. Estimated employment for Talkah I
is about 800 on production, plus 900 on maintenance and utilities, and 40G
on engineering and administration, or a total of 2,100.
B.   Proposed Talkha II Project
4.        The proposed project comprises a 1 ,200 TPD single-stream amxonia
plant and a 1,725 TPD twin-stream urea plant, corresponding to annual
capacities of 396,000 tons of ammonia and 570,000 tons of urea.  All
necessary off-sites and other facilities would also be included. Material
balances and flow sheet are shown in Annex h-2.
5.        Ammonia plant design would be based on steam-reformed natural gas.
Compression, heat and energy recovery would be based on steam-turbine-driven
centrifugal machines.  Urea unit design would be based on the most economical



ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
process which could be a stripping process embodying centrifugal compression
and maximum thermal recycle and heat recovery. Urea would be produced in
prilled, uncoated form and packed in plastic bags for prompt shipment and use.
C.   Natural Gas  'upply
6.        Natural gas feedstock and fuel for the project would be supplied
from the new Abu Mahdi field! some 40 km away via a 0.3-meter diameter
pipeline at 40 atmospheres pressure. This field has sufficient reserves
to supply both the fertilizer plants and the local power station for at
least 30 years, according tc the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation
(EGPC). Further details of gas resources are given in Annex 1-2.
D.   Ecology, Infrastructure and Utility Systems
7.        Some facilities and off-sites will be shared with the Talkha I
unit with a consequent saving in costs.  However, the ammonia-urea project
wi'l operate independently from the existing production units.
8.        Availability of utilities should not be a problem.  Ample fresh
water is available from the nearby Nile for process, cooling, steam and
other purposes. An adjacent 100 MAT power station, directly linked to the
fertilizer plants (which have a top-consumer priority) should ensure a
reliable and adequate power supply. Liquid plant and sanitary wastes will
be treated before discharge into the Nile, to conform with legal requirements
of' the Ministry of Public Health, in ccnjunction with effluents from the CAN
plant. Air pollution is not anticipated to be a problem. The only raw material
is natural gas which contains less than 10 parts per million sulfur, which will
be removed to avoid contaminating the ammonia plant catalysts. Other gas
streams, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and ammonia are contained within
the process.  The only gaseous effluent is carbon dioxide, virtually all of
which is consumed in producing urea.
?.        Plastic bag manufacture from imported polyethylene is being included
in the project scope with capacity to include all Talkha requirements.
Bagging and shipping facilities (by road and rail) are also included.
1C.       The El Nasr Talkha factory is already linked with good road and rail
systems which are adequate for handling an additional 1,725 TPD of fertilizer.
The lack of availability of adequate road trucks and railroad cars could
present a problem in view of the general shortage of transport facilities
in Egypt. Fowever, since mo t of production will be consumed within a radius
of about 100 km and largely replace imports, little difficulty is anticipated.
An annual plant storage capacity of about 30,000 tons of bulk fertilizer has
been proposed by El Nasr Company as being the minimum size to accommodate
probable fluctuations in transportation and consumption.
E.   Manpower and Training
11.       El Nasr Company's estimated additional manpower needs for the
proposed project are:

800 Maintenance and Technical
130 Sales and Administration

15,30 Total
12.       The General Contractor will be requested to 4nclude provisions
for specialized training. In addition, El Nasr will train staff from
its existing personnel at the existing Talkha facilities. Some (as yet
unspecified) will be recruited from the current surplus staff from the
Suez plants. El Nasr cannot make a definitive statement until a decision,
expected shortly, is made regarding the future of the Suez fertilizer
plant.

19/ 7% of local currency components; 10% of total foreign currency cost of

20/  Price Escalation
A.        The basis proposed for price escalation differentiates inflation
effects on materials and equipment from effects on services.
B. Equipment and Materials
(i) It is assumed that by mid-1975 the perturbed situation prevailing
at Januarz 1974 will have responded to control measures introduced
by major equipment exporting couqAges         and that procurement
of equipment and materials will /be on a fixed price basis. Such
fixed prices will include the vendors' estimates of their cost
inflation during the period of manufacture and delivery. Therefore,
inflation need be provided up to the time of placing of orders and
not beyond.
(ii)  If the gener 1  ontractor's start date is assumed before the end
of September; , would be expected that he would be in a position
to place orders for the long-delivery critical equipment items
by end of June 1975. These items would commit a substantial
proportion of the equipment cost at that time. An escalation
factor can be applied to the whole equipment/materials cost at
that point.
C. Services
(i) These costs relate to the contractor's home office costs for
engineering, procurement, and supervision of construction and
commissioning. These are payroll and overhead costs, and
inflation applies throughout the construction period, according
to the disbursement schedule on these items, assumed as 30%,
40%, and 30% over 3 years 1975, 1976 and 1977.
(ii) License fees are also included in the "services" cost. There is
no way of knowing how licensors coimute their fees. They could be
fixed and treated on the same basis as the equipment, but it would be
more conservative to assume escalation as in C (i) above.
(iii) The Technical Advisor's fees and expenses are also a service but
the ceiling cost is fixed under the consultancy contract and no
provision for further escalation is included.
D. Escalation Rates
(i) Pre-contract period - Capital cost estimates have been prepared
as at January 1974. These costs presume that, if a contract became
effective at that date, for execution over three years 1974, 1975,
and 1976, the cost estimates would hold good. To allow for



Page 4
further escalation betw7 January 1974 and tenders received
by end June - mid-July/  ii i prices open for acceptance for
90 days, a rate of 19$/month is assumed. Over 6 months,
compounded, this gives an increase of 9.34% which has been
rounded up to 10%.
(ii) Equipment and Materials - On the basis of the bulk of the value
being committed by about July 1975, escalation from the start of
the contract to July 1975 has been allowed at 15% once only.
(iii) Services - After the pre-contract period escalation has been
calculated at 10% per annum compound on a disbursement schedule of
30%, 40%, 30% for the years 1975, 1976, and 1977.

EGYPT: TALKHA II FERTILIZER PROJECT
Assumptions used in the Financial Analysis of Talkha II
1. Sales Prices:
The ex-factory selling price of urea has been assumed to be
US$87 (LE 37) per ton, so as to give a 20% financial rate of return
before tax.
The transfer price of ammonia which is produced by Talkha I and
used by Talkha II is projected to be US$110 (LE 43.1) per ton based on
production costs of Talkha I ammonia. Proceeds from the transfer are
treated as a reduction in operating costs.
2.  Operating Costs:
For urea and the incremental ammonia, the fixed costs are as
follows:
i) Labor, tE 1.0 million in 1978 prices, to be inflated as 3%
per annum over the life of the project.
ii) Other expenses, iE 0.3 million at 1978 prices.
The variable operating costs for the yearly production of 542,000 tons
of urea and 62,000 tons of ammonia to be transferred to Talkha I are:
US $ per ton of          tE per ton of
Urea      Ammonia       Urea    Ammonia
Natural Gas                  12.20      21.37         4.78      8.38
Chemicals & Catalysts         1.46       2.64        0.57       1.04
Power                         1.80       0.54         0.71      0.21
Bags (Polyethylene Chips)    5.00           -         1.96         -
Maintenance Materials         5.12       3.07         2.01      1.02
Total                  25"9        27.62       10.03      10.83
Operating costs were escalated by between 3% and 10% from 1974 to 1978
levels and are kept constant thereafter except for labor costs which are
escalated at 3% per year to reflect a real rising trend of wages. All
repairs and maintenance expenditures are written off in the year they
occur. No capital improvements are envisaged during the life of the project.
3. Depreciation
Depreciation is based upon the Standardized Accounting System
in force in Fgypt, which specifies that assets must be depreciated at
the following rates:
Deferred Revenue Charges and Interest during Construction       20%
Cranes and Vehicles                                         12e-20%
Plant and Equipment                                         10 -15%
Buildings, Constructions, Roads and Railways                 2 - 6%

4. Other Income
Other income is interest income resulting from investments into
Government bonds.
5. Income Tax
Income tax is calculated at 39.55% of retained earnings. Taxes
on distributed earnings are not the responsibility of the Company.
6. Retained Earnings
It is assumed that 85% of the profit before taxes is paid out to
the Jovernment and to the Company's employees, of the remainder, 5% is used
for compulsory purchases of Government bonds in the following year and
10% is shown in the cash balance.
7. Effect of Talkha II
To reflect the eff,ect Talkha II will have on the Company, dis-
tribution of profit and tax calculations take into account the financial
position of the Company without the project.  Taxes are not paid and
profits are not distributed before all cumulative losses of Talkha I have
been written off.
8. Debt Calculations
The following assumptions have been made with respect to terms
and conditions of loans which will be made available to El Nasr for financing
of the project.
