INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF IHE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR THE TALKHA II FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of US$20.0
million on standard IDA terms to finance a portion of the foreign exchange
cost of an ammonia/urea fertilizer project at Talkha. The proceeds of the
credit would be onlent to the Societe El Nasr d'Engrais et d'Industries
Chimiques (SEMADCO) 1/ at an effective financing cost of 8.5 percent p.a.,
for 15 years, including five years grace. A group of Arab lenders will pro-
vide about $69 million equivalent to finance most of the remaining foreign
exchange costs of the project. The Government will provide to SEMADCO,
mainly as equity, an estimated LE 16.9 million (approximately $43 million
equivalent), towards the balance of the foreign exchange cost as well as the
local cost of the proposed project.
PART ;t - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
Arab Republic of Egypt" (R73-16) dated December 30, 1972, was distributed to
the Executive Directors on January 23, 1973. An economic mission has just
returned from Egypt, and its preliminary findings are reflected in this re-
port. Country data are provided in Annex I.
Economic Structure and Growth
3.        The period since the Revolution of 1952 involved major changes in
the structure and organization of the economy. On the production side, there
was a marked shift toward industry, supported by government policies which -
especially after the 1956 Suez crisis - emphasized import-substitution and
self-sufficiency. Industry has been growing faster than any other sector
of the economy, and its share of GDP increased from slightly over 10 percent
in 1950 to nearly 30 percent in the last three years. Direct involvement of
the State in industrial organizations and enterprises, became the main feature
of Egypt's industrial policy. At the same time, agriculture has maintained
its pivotal role in the economy, employing half of the labor force and gen-
erating four-fifths of exports, although its relative share in GDP has de-
creased from about 45 percent in 1950 to less than one-third in recent years.
Land reform, irrigation and drainage works and the promotion of cooperative
/    Also referred to in the Appraisal Report as "El Nasr Company for Fer-
tilizers and Chemicals (El Nasr)" or "the Company".



- 2 -
farming has been extensively provided by the Government, in its effort to in-
crease agricultural productivity and to improve income distribution and rural
employment.
4.        Notwithstanding these efforts towards industrialization and rural
development, population pressure continues to be one of the most urgent prob-
lems faced by Egypt. Egypt's population is already one of the most densely
settled in the world and is growing at about 2.5 percent a year. The fast
rate of natural increase is combined with a high rate of internal migration
to urban areas, resulting in growing urban congestion, especially in Cairo.
Recognizing that continued rapid population growth would erode much of the
benefit of its economic and social programs the Government embarked on a na-
tional family planning program in 1965. Results achieved so far are modest
and need to be reinforced.
5.        With the impetus of the First Five-Year Plan (1961-65) Egypt's eco-
nomic growth accelerated in the early 1960's to an average annual rate of about
6 percent -- nearly reaching the plan target of 7 percent and considerably
faster than the pace of growth in the 1950's. However, the increased invest-
ment rate of the early 1960's was accompanied by growing defense expenditure
which led to serious balance of payments pressures by the mid-1960's. In
1966/67, the Government imposed severe import restrictions and deflationary
policies, resulting in negligible growth in that financial year. The war of
June 1967 compounded an already difficult situation, and there was a signif-
icant fall in GDP in 1967/68. In the following years, the economy recovered,
but average growth was reduced to some 4 percent a year.
6.        Defense has taken a progressively greater share of Egypt's resources,
reaching 15-20 percent of GNP in recent years, largely at the expense of invest-
ment expenditure, which has fallen to about 12 percent of GNP. This economic
situation has been aggravated by continuing severe pressure on the balance of
payments. The share of private consumption in GNP has, however, remained
fairly constant, implying a growth rate in per capita private consumption of
about 1.5 percent annually. Employment has grown slowly (by about 2 percent
annually in recent years), resulting in increased unemployment and underem-
ployment.
Recent Developments
7.        The Egyptian economy emerged from the war of October 1973 with rela-
tively little damage. Agricultural production was unaffected and additional
diversion of industrial production towards military needs was probably mar-
ginal. There was a temporary drop in tourism and some dislocation or eco-
nomic activity, mainly due to a slowdown in commercial shipping traffic.
Much of the direct cost of the war was financed by Arab grants, mainly from
Saudi Arabia, Algeria and the Gulf States. In addition, an estimated $400
million was received from Arab sources, as well as the $250 million (iE 110
million) received annually under the Khartoum Agreement to replace Suez Canal
revenues; this inflow of funds permitted Egypt to sustain a somewhat enlarged



-3-
current account deficit in 1973, and to settle various debt arrears existing
up to mid-1973. However, whereas gross reserves exceeded $400 million at the
end of 1973 (about 3 months imports), short-term liabilities were even greater;
therefore, net reserves were still negative to the extent of $430 million.
8.        In 1973 the rising import prices (and particularly higher prices
of foo,l imports) resulted in a sharp increase in the current account deficit.
In 1972, Egypt imported 2.1 million tons of wheat at a cost of about $150
million. In 1973, 2.3 million tons of wheat imports are reported to have
been imported at a cost of about $400 million. Imports of other principal
foodstuffs, edible oils and animal fats increased from about $100 million
in 1972 to $170 million in 1973. Altogether, food imports cost nearly $600
million in 1973 (nearly 40 percent of total commodity imports), an increase
of about $350 million over the 1972 level. A further increase is projected
for 1974. While world prices of cotton, Egypt's principal export earner,
also rose in 1973, most of the gains from this price rise will not be re-
flected until 1974. Overall, the deficit on current account excluding trans-
fers of Arab funds amounted to over $300 million in 1973 and is expected to
be higher in 1974. Foreign exchange shortage continues to limit both the
utilization of productive capacity and the implementation of new development
programs.
Debt Service Burden
9.        During the past year, Egypt relied heavily on short-term credits to
finance its deficit; the total use of these credits (including rollovers)
amounted to nearly $1,100 million in 1973. Egypt's medium and long-term debt
outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1973 stood at about $2 billion, with
the USSR as Egypt's principal creditor, followed in importance by the United
States, Kuwait, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Germany. The debt service ratio
for 1973 was about 25 percent. IBRD debt at end 1973 comprised less than
one percent and IDA debt comprised about 1.5 percent of the total reported
medium and long-term debt (including undisbursed). Of the reported outstand-
ing medium and long-term debt at end 1973, 40 percent was due to be repaid
within two years, 50 percent within three years, and 64 percent within five
years. The debt service ratio is expected to increase to nearly 27% in 1974.
Given this unfavorable debt structure and its burden on Egypt, it is important
that development financing on appropriate terms be made available so that re-
cent reliance on short-term financing can be reversed.
Development Prospects
10.       Egypt has considerable potential for economic development.    Apart
from her favorable geographic location, her proximity to Arab and European
markets and her sizeable domestic market, she has a labor force that is dis-
tinguished for its high level of education, skills and industrial experience
as well as a willingness to offer sacrifices for national goals. In some
sectors such as cotton, textiles, leather, food and some engineering goods,
Egypt competes successfully in international markets. Utilization of known
natural resources, including oil and natural gas, is well underway and will



be intensified by the application of advancec technologies. Tourism holds
great promise, due to a favorable climate and the country's outstanding cul-
tural heritage. Domestic food production can be substantially expanded pro-
vided irrigation and drainage projects are implemented expeditiously, and
crucial inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, better seeds) are supplied
in sufficient quantities.
1*.       The Government is preparing a development plan for 1976-80. Mean-
while it is actively working on a transitional program, which, on the assump-
tion that more peaceful conditions will prevail, would provide the framework
for changing the pattern of the country's resource allocations. The expected
reopening of the Suez Canal in 1975 should improve Egypt's economic prospects
considerably.  The Government believes the economy could be rapidly stimulated
by fuller utilization of existing capacity in the industrial and agricultural
sectors, which is currenttly constrained by severe shortages of forejgn exchange;
this aspect is currently being reviewed by a Bank mission.   The Governzenc is
also taking steps to liberalize the economy, to stimulate foreign investment,
and to encourage private domestic investment. There is also a good chance for
increased financial support from oil-exporting countries, as well as from pri-
vate and official Western sources, on concesslonary terms, which would assist
Egypt considerably in improving its debt profile; to facilitate this support
the Government has recently established an Agency for Arab and International
Economic Cooperation to coordiLtate external capital inflows. All these mea-
sures, form part of the Covermient's effort to improve Egypt's economic and
debt management, in order to gradually restore creditworthiness.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN EGYPT
12.       The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's tenth operation in
Egypt. It would bring Bank and IDA commitments to $207.6 million. The first
operation was a Bank loan for the Suez Canal Expansion Project ($56.5 million)
in 1959. IDA lending began in 1970 with a credit for the Nile Delta Drainage
Project ($26 million). Since then, credits have been made for the following
projects: Railways I ($30 million), Upper Egypt Drainage ($36 million),
Bank of Alexandria ($15 million), Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation ($18.5 mil-
lion including the refinancing of the $175,000 engineering credit for the
cotton ginning project), Population ($5 million), and the engineering of the
proposed Talkha Fertilizer Project ($0.4 million). Annex II contains a sum-
mary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1974, together
with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.   There have been no IFC
lnvestments in Egypt.
13.       The main purpose of the IDA lending program is to assist develop-
ment of key sectors and to alleviate Egypt's severe shortage of foreign ex-
change by financing high-priority projects in agriculture, industry and pop-
ulation, as well as for infrastructure. In view of the overall demands upon
IDA monies, the amount that can be allocated to Egypt remains modest in rela-
tion to that country's size and absorptive capacity. The staff has therefore
been exploring the interest of other donors in the complementary financing of



- 5 -
projects, in order to broaden the impact of limited IDA funds. A pipeline
of projects has been developed in the sectors noted above. A project covering
the second phase of the railway rehabilitation program is being appraised, and
one for the expansion of cement production is scheduled for appraisal around
July/August this year.   Both are likely to be-ready for Board consideration
in the third quarter of FY75. A project to provide certain facilities required
in connection with the r~eopening of the Suez Canal has also been appraised, with
a view to presenting it for Board consideration in the first half of FY75.
Other projects under discussion, which may result in lending operations in
FY75 and FY76, include proposals for telecommunication expansion, textile
rehabilitation, production and export marketing of fruits and vegetables, and
a repeater development finance company project with the Bank of Alexandria.
PART III - AGRICULTURE AN) THE FERTILIZER SUB-SECTOR IN EGYPT
Egyptian Agriculture
14.       Agriculture is concentrated in the Nile Delta and along the Nile
between Aswan and Cairo, and accounts for about 30 percent of Egypt's gross
domestic product (GDP), about half of total employment and over half of the
country's commodity exports. The growth rate in real terms in agriculture
averaged about 3.5% annually over the past 15 years (1957-1972), but only
2 percent or less during the last five years (1967-1972). The construction
of the Aswan Dam permitted a shift to perennial irrigation and continuing
expansion cf land reclamation. Egypt has about 2.7 million hectares of agri-
cultural land. Its extensive irrigation however, permits cropping of about
4.4 million hectares or about 1.6 crops per year per hectare. The area crop-
ped has risen by about 210,000 hectares since 1960, with most of this in-
crease since 1967 when the Aswan Dam made year-round water supplies available.
Nevertheless, shortages of foreign exchange for key inputs, such as fertilizers,
seeds, agricultural equipment and spares, especially since the 1967 war have
limited agricultural growth. Inadequate extension services and farm manage-
ment practices have also limited growth in yields and production of most food
crops.
15.       Major crops are cotton, rice, maize, wheat, clover and fruit and
vegetables with rice and cotton accounting for about 25 percent of the cropped
area. Cotton is a major earner of foreign exchange, but at the expense of
producing food crops. As indicated above, Egypt has sharply increased food
imports (largely wheat, but also including flour, edible oils and animal fats).
While most of the increase has been attributable to rising import prices, the
food gap has also been growing in real terms, partly on account of increased
demand due to rapid population growth, partly on account of the slow growth
of food supplies due to rationing of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, etc., and
failure to take aggressive policy measures to stimulate import-saving agricul-
tural production. Short-term agricultural possibilities are constrained by
limited land, high population density, capital shortages and organizational
and structural impediments, including pricing policies which have depressed



- 6 -
incentives to produce and market wheat and other basic foods. Yields of some
crops such as wheat, maize, vegetables and fruits are low compared with other
countries having a similar climate and irrigation; the high man/land ratio,
irrigation, location and favorable climate indicate that intensive production
methods (i.e. better varieties, larger quantities of fertilizer and other
inputs, more credit) can result in substantial future growth. A large poten-
tial also lies both in import substitution (by expanding domestic production
of wheat and livestock feeds and products), and in export expansion of fresh
and processed fruits and vegetables.
The Fertilizer Subsector
16.       In 1972, fertilizer consumption in Egypt had reached 395,000 tons
of nutrients (figures here and below measure nutrient content with that for
nitrogen nutrient designated as N), of which 83 percent (327,000 tons) was
nitrogen fertilizer with phosphate fertilizer comprising most of the balance.
Fertilizer consumption has increased substantially from 113,000 tons in 1950
with growth rates of about 7 percent per annum from 1950 to 1965 and 4 percent
thereafter. No mixed or complex nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are used
and the ratio of N to phosphate consumption has remained at about 5 to 1 during
the past two decades. This is a relatively low level of phosphate utilization.
The Egyptians intend to increase the use of phosphates parallel with N, but do
not as yet have a detailed plan for increasing phosphate availability. Under
the proposed project, the Government will commence by June 30, 1975, a com-
prehensive fertilizer sub-sector study which will review fertilizer production,
distribution and use, including provision for increasing phosphate availability
and usage (Section 4.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). It has
also agreed to establish a retail price of urea, which, on a nutrient basis,
would he comparable to the retail price of other nitrogen fertilizers in
Egypt (Section 4.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
17.       Of the ammonia fertilizers in use, calcium ammonium nitrate and
urea are by far the most common, with ammonium sulphate making up a relatively
minor portion of the total. These fertilizers are used most extensively for
production of sugar cane, corn, wheat, vegetables and cotton. Since the mid-
1960's, the rate of increase in fertilizer consumption has been constrained
by insufficient supplies and fertilizer has been rationed.
18.       Domestic production of fertilizers began with the completion of a
phosphate plant in 1950. Egypt now has four phosphate facilities with a total
installed capacity of 80,000 tons per year, compared with 1972 consumption of
66,000 tons. No phosphate fertilizers are imported and as indicated above,
further expansion of phosphate production is now needed. Production of N
began in 1952 when a plant at Suez began operations. The country has had
four N plants, including one each at Aswan, Helwan, and Suez, with a fourth
plant, initially constructed at Suez, now being reconstructed (and expected
to be completed in late 1974) on the site of the proposed project at Talkha
(hereafter referred to as Talkha I). Both Suez plants, whi-ch belonged to
SEMADCO, ceased operations in 1969 after the refinery providing the feedstock



- 7 -.
was destroyed by war. SEMADCO decided in 1970 to reconstruct one of these
plants as well as establish additional facilities at Talkha, both in view of
the proximity of this location to the fertilizer market in the Nile Delta and
to the Abu Mahdi natural gasfield, the adequacy of which was confirmed at
the time, and whose gas' could be used as feedstock for fertilizer production.
Portions of the other plant at Suez may be recommissioned and modernized
although it is small and obsolete by present standards. In recent years,
Egypt has thus been forced to rely on production of N at the Aswan and Helwan
plants, which currently (1974 estimates) produce about 109,000 tons a year,
or less than a third of Egypt's consumption of N.
19.       The deficit in production of N has been made up with imports, par-
ticularly of urea, which accounted for about 160,000 of the 285,000 tons of
N imported in 1972. The foreign exchange cost of these imports is about $80
million (measured at a price of about $280 per ton of N). The modest increase
in consumption actually recorded in recent years does not take into account
the likely pent-up demand for fertilizer during the period when rationing
has been necessary. The table below shows the past and projected supply and
consumption of nitrogen fertilizers, assuming a relatively modest 5 percent
per annum future increase in consumption which is significantly less than
optimal from the agricultural point of view. Actual consumption will, in all
probability, increase somewhat more rapidly as a result of the project.

(Surplus)
/1   Actual imports in these years were 203,000 and 285,000 tons of N
respectively with the differences from apparent deficit attributed to
changes in inventory.
Even with the increased utilization of plants at Aswan and Helwan, and the
commissioning of Talkha I in 1975, Egypt would face serious shortages of
N over the next several years without substantial imports. The proposed proj-
ect would provide about 250,000 tons of N annually and would virtually elimi-
nate the necessity for fertilizer imports from 1978 into the early 1980's.



20.       Fertilizer production and distribution in Egypt is managed by public
sector institutions. The General Organization for Industrialization (GOFI),
an autonomous public sector organization attached to the Ministry of Industry,
is responsible for fostering and coordinating inLdustrial expansion in Egypt.
The General Organization for Chemical Industries (GOCI) one of the 20 such
autonomous governmental organizations which cover virtually every segment
of the Egyptian economy, is a holding company for the 29 largest Government-
owned companies in the chemical sub-sector, including SEMADCO -- which wilL
implement the proposed project. GOCI implements Government policy in the
chemical sub-sector, and works jointly with GOFI and the companies' manage-
ments in preparing and implementing projects. COCI receives annual budgetary
allocations to meet its own operating costs. It was made a legal holding com-
pany in 1971, but its role is limited, since all major investment decisions
are made at the ministerial level. Once approved, the funds allocated to a
given project are usually channeled through GOFI and disbursed under its
supervision, although responsibility for actual project execution is effec-
tively delegated to the ultimate operating company. All fertilizers are
distributed through the General Organization for Agricultural and Cooperative
Credit which supplies credit, and other inputs, and purchases most crops at
controlled prices through cooperatives.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
21.       In early 1972, Egypt approached the Association for assistance in
financing a project for the construction of an ammonia urea fertilizer plant.
The economic mission of March/April 1972 also ilentified fertilizer production
as a priority subsector. Missions in late 1972 and April 1973, identified
the proposed project. In view of the substantial foreign exchange financing
that was likely to be required and the project's importance to Egypt, the
Association acceded to the Egyptian request to help prepare the project,
appraise it, finance a portion of the foreign exchange cost and play a cata-
lyctic role in putting a financing package together. The Association there-
after assisted Egypt with project preparation, which was further advanced
through the appointment of a technical advisor. An engineering credit (S-15
UAR) was approved in November 1973 to finance these services (see Annex II).
The technical advisor has assisted with process selection, design criteria
and other preparation work essential to moving forward with the project.
Meanwhile, the Association actively explored the interest of and received en-
couraging responses from, certain donors in participating in the financing.
In August 1973, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development indicated
its interest to Egypt and the Association in providing a part of the requisite
financing and helping to arrange the balance from other Arab sources, if the
Association assisted in completing project preparation, and appraised the
project.



- 9 -
22.       Egypt and the Association agreed to proceed on that basis.    The
proposed project was appraised in December 1973, followed by a post-appraisal
review in early February 1973. The Arab Fund participated in the Association's
appraisal and post-appraisal missions. Thereafter, the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development also indicated its willingness to participate in financ-
ing the appraised project. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in
Washington, D.C. between May 3 and 10, 1973. The Egyptian delegation in-
cluded Mr. Attia, General Manager of SEMADCO, Mr. El-Nahal, Minister (Eco-
nomic) in the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Mansour, Legal
Adviser of GOFI.
The Pr2ject
23.       The proposed (Talkha II) project consists of the design, engineer-
ing and construction of a large nitrogen fertilizer plant with a capacity
of 570,000 metric tons per year (TPY) of area (262,000 TPY of N). It will
be centrally located in the Nile Delta at Talkha, to take advantage of na-
tural gas feedstock available from the Abu Mahdi gas field about 40 km away.
Natural gas would be first converted into ammonia, and then urea. The urea
would be marketed primarily in the Delta within about 150 km. of Talkha as
a substitute for nitrogen fertilizers currently being imported.
24.       Gas reserves are adequate for at least 30 years to supply Talkha I
and II, as well as the Talkha power station. The independent project to
exploit the gas and connect It to SEMADCO's plants at Talkha, is under con-
struction and is expected to be completed by the end of 1974. The gas com-
pany (owned by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and ENI of Italy)
and SEMADCO have contracted for a 20 year gas supply at a price of $22.3/ton,
equivalent to $0.018/M3 or $0.51/100 cu. ft., which is based on the prevail-
ing fuel oil price in Egypt--with a provision for escalation linking the gas
price to the price of fuel oil in that country.
25.       The proposed project includes (a) a 396,000 TPY ammonia plant which
would supply 66,000 TPY of ammonia for use in the existing calcium ammonium
nitrate fertilizer plant (Talkha I) and 330,000 TPY for conversion to urea;
(b) a 570,000 TPY urea plant; (c) facilities for manufacturing 20 million
polyethylene bags per year for the output of Talkha I and Talkha II; (d)
all necessary ancillary and related equipment, and (e) consultancy services
and training and pre-operational expenses. The project would utilize com-
mercially proven modern technology to ensure efficient operation. Adequate
pollution control facilities would be included to deal with effluents. The
main features of the proposed project and credit are summarized in Annex III;
the appraisal report "Appraisal of the Talkha II Fertilizer Project," (No.
456-UAR, dated May 28, 1974), is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors.
Project Cost and Financing Arrangements
26.       The estimated total cost of the project is about $132 million.    The
foreign exchange component, including interest during construction, would be
about $93 million, roughly 70 percent of total cost. The proposed credit



- 10 -
would finance $20 million, or about 21 percent of the foreign exchange cost.
Of this amount, about $12 million will be used to cover the estimated cost
of the services of the General Contractor and Technical Advisor and to refi-
nance the engineering credit in line with the Association's normal procedures;
besides contingencies, the remaining $8 million is allocated for selected
equipment and construction materials. Egypt will onlend the proceeds of the
proposed IDA credit to SEMADCO for 15 years, including 5 years grace, at an
interest of 6 percent plus a supplemental Ministry of Finance charge of 2.5
percent per annum. Thus, the effective cost of proposed credit to SEMADCO
will be 8.5 percent per annum.. :SEMADCO will also bear the foreign exchange
risk on the loan (Section 3e.1 (b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
27.       Approximately $69 naillion equivalent 1/, or 74 percent of the for-
eign exchange cost of the proposed project, will be provided as parallel fi-
nancing, by a group of Arab lenders. The group consists of the Arab Fund,
the Kuwait Fund, the Abu Dhabi Fund, the State of Qatar and the Libyan Arab
Foreign Bank. This is the first titie that Arab financing, which will sub-
stantially exceed the Association's share of the foreign exchange cost, has
been arranged for a Bank Group project in Egypt. The three funds will pro-
vide financing in the fo-rm of loans, while Qatar and the Libyan Foreign Bank
will purchase bonds to be issued by SEMADCO.
28.       The Arab Fund, which is providing KD 6.5 million ($22.0 million),
has already signed loan documents with SEMADCO. Approval of the board of di-
rectors of the Kuwait Fund for its KD 7.0 million ($23.7 million) loan is
anticipated shortly. The boards of the Abu Dhabi Fund and the Libyan Bank
have respectively approved a loan of KD 3.0 million equivalent ($10.1 million)
and a bond purchase of LD 3.0 million ($10.1 million). Qatar has already
confirmed to Egypt its intention to purchase KD 1.0 million equivalent ($3.4
million) of SEMADCO's bonds. It is a condition of effectiveness that Egypt
and/or SEMADCO will have obtained financing amounting to $69 million equiva-
lent towards the foreign exchange cost of the proposed project, on terms
satisfactory to the Association (Section 6.01 (c) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
29.       The Arab Fund loan to SEMADCO is at 6 percent annual interest, with
a 20 years repayment period, inclusive of 5 years grace; this loan is guaran-
teed by Egypt. The Kuwait Fund's loan will be made to the Government of Egypt
at 4 percent annual interest and with repayment and grace periods similar to
the Arab Fund loan; however, its loan is to be onlent to SEMADCO at 6.5 per-
cent annual interest, with repayment over 15 years including 5 years grace.
Similarly, the Abu Dhabi Fund will lend to Egypt at an interest of 6.5 per-
cent per annum and a 19 years repayment period, inclusive of 6 years grace;
the monies will be onlent to SEMADCO on the same terms. SEMADCO's bonds to
be purchased by the Libyan Foreign Bank and Qatar, will carry an interest
rate of 6.5 percent a year and have 16 years repayment period, inclusive of
1/   Kuwait Dinar (KD) and Libyan Dinar (LD) have both been converted at the
current rate, which equals $3.38.



- 11 -
5 years grace. The terms of the Arab financing average about 5.2 percent
inte:est per annum and a repayment period of 19 years, inclusive of 5 years
grace.
30.       About $4 million of the foreign exchange costs (mainly representing
interest during construction on some of the Arab financing) and the entire
local currency cost (about $39 million equivalent) will be made available
to SEMADCO by the Government of Egypt (Section 3.01 (a), (c) and-(d) of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). Most of this will be provided in the
form of equity, as promptly as required to finance the proposed project.
Organization and Execution
31.       The proposed project will be carried out by SEMADCO under the super-
vision of GOFI and GOCI. Established in 1947, SEMADCO is one of the GOCI's
largest subsidiaries and already owns fertilizer plants at Suez and Talkha
(Talkha I). The company is organized functionally and has a capable manage-
ment, but some technical assistance is required to help with its large ex-
pansion program.
32,       SEMADCO has already hired consulting engineers, Cremer and Warner
(UK), to serve as its technical advisors for the project, with the foreign
exchange cost of the first year of these services financed under the said
$400,000 engineering credit. SEMADCO will also employ a General Contractor
to assume overall responsibil:ty for the design, engineering and execution
of the project through commissioning of the project facilities (Section 2.03
of the draft Project Agreement). Selection of a General Contractor is ex-
pected by September 1974. The selected firm will provide full guarantees
for the project's capacity and efficiency, mechanical warranties and for its
completion on schedule.
33.       A joint committee of the Arab and Kuwait Funds is expected to be
established with responsibility for supervising the project and the Arab-
financed procurement, on behalf of all the Arab lenders. This committee
will also coordinate all project supervision matters with the Association.
A tentatiVe understanding exists between both parties on the coordination
and administration of the proposed project, and this will be formalized
by an exchange of letters during the next few weeks.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       IDA and Arab financing will be on a parallel basis, for separate
and specific lists of goods and services, Goods and services to be procured
with the proceeds of the proposed credit consist of: (a) the Technical Ad-
visor's and General Contractor's services and license fees; (b) special and/or
proprietary equipment such as compressors, reactors, pressure vessels, and
proprietary and construction equipment; (c) materials such as structural steel,
reinforcing steel and instruments; (d) refinancing of the said engineering
credit, All other equipment, as well as a portion of the interest during
construction, will be financed from monies provided by the Arab lenders. The
allocation of the proposed credit and Arab financing is shown below:

20.0         69.3
The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the
foreign expenditures of the goods and services financed by the Association.
The Arab lenders will disburse against the balance of the project's foreign
cost and also remaining IDA-allocated items -- should their total foreign
cost exceed the amount of the proposed credit.
35.       There will be pre-qualification for all suppliers of equipment and
materials (i.e. independent of the sources of finance) and their technical
evaluation will be done by the General Contractor and SEMADCO. IDA-financed
items will be procured in accordance with the Bank Group's procurement guide-
lines; if any local suppliers are pre-qualified. They would receive, for
purposes of bid evaluation, a preference of 15 percent or the amount of
customs duty, whichever is lower. International competitive bidding will be
used with the exception of about US$3 million of proprietary items or items
with limited availability that will be procured by "international shopping".
The Arab co-lenders procurement procedures are expected to be similar to those
of the Association with the exception that the regulations of the Arab League
must be followed and all countries, including Eastern Bloc countries (but
excluding Israel), are permitted to bid and there is no preference for local
or Arab States suppliers.
Financial Returns and Covenants
36.       The proposed project has a financial rate of return of 19 percent
based upon conservative assurptions of urea price and operating costs; the
rate of return remains at 16 percent or above, even under adverse sensitivity
analysis assumptions. On the strength of financial projections for the pro-
posed project and similar projections for Talkha I, SEMADCO is forecast to
have a healthy debt service coverage of 4.0 and a current ratio above 8.0
from 1978 onwards. SEMADCO may, however, undertake other projects in the
future which could affect these projections. Egypt and SEMADCO have there-
fore agreed on a number of lending covenants to ensure the financial viabil-
ity of SEMADCO.
37.       The draft Development Credit Agreement includes provisions under
which Egypt would (1) contribute bE 15.9 million to SEMADCO as equity towards
the estimated capital costs of the project (Section 3.01(d)); (ii) provide



- 13 -
any additional foreign or local funds which might be required to complete
both the proposed project and the Talkha I project, and also to ensure ade-
quate liquidity for SEMADCO until the completion of the proposed project
(Sections 3.01(a) and 3.02); (iii) provide BE 1.0 million towards initial
working capital for the project (Section 3.01(c)); (iv) not withdraw funds
from SEMADCO after conmpletion of the project, if such withdrawals prevent
SEMADCO from maintaining a ratio of current assets to current liabilities
of at least 1.5:1 (Section 3.03); (v) provide SEMADCO with funds at project
completicn and, if required thereafter, to maintain a current ratio of 1.5:1
(Section 3.04). Egypt has also undertaken to (i) set the ex-factory price
of fertilizers so as to ensure SEMADCO a reasonable return on its investment
and debt service coverage of at least 1.5:1 (Section 4.03); and (ii) repay
SEMADCO's existing long-term debt before December 31, 1977 (Section 4.02).
38.       The draft Project Agreement also provides that:
(a) prior to the completion date of the proposed project, SEMADCO
will not undertake capital investment (other than the proposed
project, Talkha I and rehabilitation or modernization of exist-
ing facilities) exceeding LE 2.0 million a year, without prior
consultation with the Association (Section 4.03(a));
(b) after that date, it has undertaken not to make any capital
investment which would raise the debt/equity ratio beyond
50:50 (Section 4.03(b)); and
(c) it will take all action within its power to maintain a debt
service coverage of 1,5:1 and a current ratio of at least
1.5:1, after the said completion date (Sections 4,04 and 4.05).
Economic Benefits
39.       The proposed project would make good use of the natural gas reserves
at the Abu Mahdi field, and approximately double Egypt's production of N after
1978. The net foreign exchange savings from the proposed project are esti-
mated at $41 million annually. It would also introduce significant economies
of scale to the industry, and the extra ammonia capacity provided under the
proposed project will also enable SENADCO to increase substantially the operat-
ing efficiency of its Talkha I plant. Taking these factors into account and
assuming a long-term price of $120/ton c.i.f. Egyptian port for imported bagged
urea and a natural gas price of US$1.40/thousand cubic feet, the economic re-
turn would be 19 percent. The return is however sensitive to change in urea
prices, as well as to project delays and cost overruns. A one-year delay in
project implementation decreases the return to 16 percent and a 10 percent
cost overrun lowers the return to 17 percent. A 25 percent increase or decrease
in urea price, correspondingly increases or decreases the economic return to
23 percent or 10 percent. Substantial unmeasurable benefits not accounted for
iin the calculation of the economic return (such as training of labor, removal
of fertilizer procurement constraints and additional agricultural production
ani exports) can also be attributed to the proposed project.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Egypt and the Asso-
ciation, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and SEMADCO, the
recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed development credit, are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately.
41.       Special features of the draft Development Credit and Project Agree-
ments which are referred to in paragraphs 16, 27, 28, 32, 37 and 38 of this
Report. Besides the execution of necessary agreements for financing of about
$69 million equivalent in foreign exchange cost of the project mentioned in
paragraph 27, Section 6.01 of the Development Credit Agreement provides inter
alia that an additional condition of effectiveness is the execution of a
subsidiary loan agreemenxt between the Government and SEMADCO.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. No. 181-UAR     Nile Delta Drainage Project; US$26 million Credit of
April 17, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
In 1973 a revised implementation program was prepared, extending
this project until 1978, and the government agreed to take a number of actions
ricommended by IDA to improve project performance and provide an effective
management. In February 1973, NDDA and the Egyptian General Authority for
Drainage (EGAD) were merged in the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage
Projects (EPADP?) established by Presidential Decree. A new Chairman and Vice
Chairman for the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt Drainage Projects were appointed
and the staff reorganized and strengthened by the appointment of additional
qualified personnel.  A panel of experts was nominated to undertake project
evaluation, and action is being taken to replace the consultants who advise
and assist the Authority on the implenmentation of both the Nile Delta and
Upper Egypt projects. The new Authority is actively working on the arrange-
ments for the maaintenance of equipment and the storage of spare parts and has
drafted the terms and conditions under which project equipment will be trans-
ferred to local contractors for construction of drainage works and for the
manufacture of drainage tiles. Recent supervision missions have expressed
concern that sufficient local currency funds be budgeted to keep project im-
plementation up to the pace agreed in the revised schedule; this matter has
been discussed with the Government and remedial action is being taken.
Cr. No. 284-UAR     Egyptial Railway Project; US$30 million Credit of
February 9, 1972; Closing Date: (i) December 31
1973 for track materials, locomotives and spare
parts; and (ii) September 3C, 1976 for signalling
and telecommunications equipment and installation.
The project has been implemented satisfactorily.   Mc:t ef thei pro-
curement contracts have been awarded, and the credit is almost e"t-irely coak-
mitted. Some complaints have been received about evaluacion procŽedurf-s. It
appears that delays occurred in passing out information to potLPV& a    i'4hiers.
IDA discussed this problem with Egyptian Railways and steps were takti- -
improve procurement procedures and increase the number of staff in th- pro-
curement office.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive DirecZors rrt,ip
the progress of projects in execution, and in particula-r io reporr .ny
problems which are being encountered, and the action be:znA ..ke  to
remedy them.  They should be read in this sense, and wit.. Lcat uzider
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaltu!rjci ot
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. S-13-UAR    Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Engineering Project;
US$175,000 .redit of November 17, 1972; Closing Date:
November 30, 1973.
This Credit was approved on November 7, 1972 and was declared effec-
tive on June 15, 1973. It has been fully disbursed and subsequently refinanced
under Cr 423 below.
Cr. No. 393-UAR     Upper Egypt Drainage Project; US$36 million Credit of
June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Tlis Credit was approved by the Executive Directors on June 7, 1973
and signed on June 8, 1973. It became effective on November 28, 1973. Pro-
gress in implementing the project has been satisfactory. A recent supervi-
sion mission reported insufficient budgeting of local currency funds for the
current fiscal year. The matter has been taken up with the Government, which
promised remedial action to ensure timely project implementation.
Cr. No. 412-UAR     Bank of Alexandria Project; US$15 million Credit of
June 29, 1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
This Credit, approved by the Executive Directors on June 26, 1973,
and signed on June 29, 1973, became effective on November 29, 1973. Since
then, BOA has approved several sub-projects and over $2 million of the credit
has been committed.
Cr. No. 423-UAR     Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project; US$18.5 million
Credit of July 30, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This Credit, approved by the Executive Directors on July 24, 1973,
and signed on July 30, 1973, became effective on February 15, 1974. Meanwhile,
bids for major packages have been invited and a program for retraining of na-
tionalized works, prepared by Egypt for IDA's consideration. Because of
sharply increased equipment prices, an overrun in project cost is anticipated.
Cr. No. 437-UAR     Population Project; US$5.0 million Credit of November 6,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This Credit, approved by the Executive Directors on October 23, 1973,
and signed on Nobember 6, 1973, was declared effective on March 25, 1974. The
architects have been appointed, as also consultants for other studies financed
by the credit.

This Credit, approved by the Executive Directors on November 13, 1973,
and signed on November 20, 1973, was declared effective on April 24, 1974.
Meanwhile, a consulting firm, appointed as the technical advisors, has done
some of the work covered by this credit and has been paid by Egypt. This pay-
ment, about $50,000 to $60,000, will be reimbursed as soon as the expected
documentation is submitted by Egypt.

Project             SEMADCO, under the general supervision of GOFI and GOCI,
Execution:         will be responsible for project execution.   It will be
be assisted by a consulting firm, as its technical advisor.
A General Contractor will also be selected by September
1974, on a fixed-price basis, for obtaining the necessary
license, designing, engineering and exercising supervision
over the construction of the project. The General Con-
tractor will bear the single responsibility for the exec-
ution of the project through commissioning with full gua-
rantees for the project's capacity, efficiency, mechanical
warranties and completion time. Civil engineering con-
struction and plant erection will be carried out by
SEMADCO or other Egyptian firms.
Procurement:        IDA and Arab foreign exchange financing will be on a
parallel basis, with separate, specific lists of goods
and services. The Arab lenders will disburse against
the project's foreign cost for items not covered by IDA
and also any IDA-allocated items should the total foreign
exchange cost of such items exceed the amount of the
proposed credit. There will be prequalification for all
suppliers of equipment and materials (i.e., independent
of the sources of finance) and their technical evaluation
will be done by SEMADCO and the General Contractor. IDA-
financed items will be procured under the normal Bank
Group procurement guidelines through international com-
petitive bidding, except for certain proprietary and
critical items with an estimated value of about $3 million.
Although none of the IDA goods is expected to be procured
in Egypt, pre-qualified local suppliers will receive, for
purposes of bid evaluation, a preference of 15 percent
or the amount of customs duty, whichever is lower.
Procurement of the Arab-financed items will also be sub-
ject to international competitive bidding under the rules
of the Arab lenders concerned and whose procedures are
similar to those of the Bank Group, with the exception
that the regulations of the Arab League must be followed,
and all countries, including Eastern Bloc countries
(but excluding Israel), are permitted to bid and there is
no preference for Arab or local suppliers.
