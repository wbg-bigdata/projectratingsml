PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT: TALKHA II FERTILIZER PROJECT
(Credit 484-UAR)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Project under review consists of an expansion program of the
Talkha Fertilizer Plant, operated by Societe El Nasr d'Engrais et
d'Industries Chimiques (SEMADCO), involving the construction of an ammonia
plant with a capacity of 396,000 tons per year (tpy), a urea plant of about
570,000 tpy and miscellaneous ancillary facilities.
The Talkha II Fertilizer Project was physically completed in
April 1980, about 30 months behind schedule, in part, due to factors beyond
SEMADCO's control. Project management was not very effective. The
engineering firm was also not able to perform in a fully satisfactory
manner. (PCR, paras 3.03-3.09). However, once the Project was physically
completed, it was able to pass the start-up tests and achieve a high level
of production within seven months, without experiencing prolonged serious
commissioning problems. The project cost amounted to US$195 million, 58%
above the appraisal estimate mainly due to the delays in mechanical
completion, the sharp increases in world equipment prices following the
1973/74 oil crisis, and modification of the project scope to improve
project viability and also achieve more operational flexibility.
Production levels have been close to projections from the first
year of operation. The financial performance of SEMADCO has improved since
1980 with the commissioning of Talkha II. The financial and economic rate
of return of the Project are now re-estimated at 13% and 19%,
respectively. The economic rate of return is close to the appraisal
estimate despite the project delays and the higher capital costs, partly
because the real cost of building a plant similar to Talkha II in the world
has increased considerably following the world energy price increases, and
there have been real increases in international fertilizer prices since the
Project was taken up for implementation (PCR, paras 5.03-5.04, 6.01-6.02).
In analyzing the Project experience, the PCR (para 9.02) stresses
the need to: pre-qualify local civil contractors on a sound basis; arrange
for effective construction supervision and coordination; evaluate closely
the experience of the engineering firm's branch office responsible for
design, engineering and implementation; develop an effective procurement
system; and provide for a bonus/penalty clause in the contract with the
engineering firm selected for project design and execution. In summary,
despite project delays and cost increases, the Project is still
economically viable and has introduced modern ammonia/urea technology to
Egypt, and its foreign exchange effect on the country's economy is
significant.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT: TALKHA II FERTILIZER PROJECT
(CREDIT 484-UAR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Societe El Nasr d'Engrais et d'Industries (SEMADCO) was founded
in 1947 to build and operate a calcium nitrate plant (annual capacity:
270,000 product tons or 42,000 tons of nitrogen), and an ammonium sulfate
plant (annual capacity: 85,000 product tons or 18,000 tons of nitrogen) at
Suez. In 1964, the Government decided to expand the facilities at Suez by
establishing a new calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) facility with an annual
capacity of 320,000 product tons or 98,000 tons of nitrogen. In 1970,
while all the Suez fertilizer facilities were still closed due to the
effects of the 1967 Egyptian-Israeli war, the Government decided to
dismantle the partially erected CAN plant and relocate it at Talkha, 350
kilometers from Suez. This plant, now called Talkha I, was commissioned in
1975. At Suez, the calcium nitrate plant was re-started in 1969 while the
sulfuric acid plant was dismantled and sold to another fertilizer plant in
Egypt and the ammonia sulfate plant was closed.
1.02      While Talkha I was at an advanced stage of construction at
Talkha, the Government requested and IDA agreed to finance a 1,200
tons per day (tpd) i.e., 396,000 tons per year (tpy) ammonia plant and a
1,725 tpd (i.e., 569,250 tpy) urea plant at the same location, which is
called the Talkha II Fertilizer Project. In addition to IDA,there were
five other lenders to the Project: the Abu Dhabi Fund, the Arab Fund, the
Kuwaiti Fund, the Libyan Arab Fund and the Government of Qatar.
1.03      Talkha II was jointly appraised by IDA and the co-financiers
during 1973-74. Subsequently, the Project received a US$20 million credit
from IDA and a total of US$69.3 million equivalent in long-term and largely
low interest loans from co-financiers. The contributions from the
co-financiers were subsequently raised to US$97.7 million when the Project
showed cost increases partly due to higher than expected equipment price
increases following the world oil crisis in 1973-74. The total financing
required for the Project was nearly US$210 million, about 58% more than
anticipated at the time of the appraisal. The Project was mechanically
completed in April 1980, about two years behind schedule for reasons
explained in paras 3.06-3.09. Since its commissioning in November 1980,
the Project has attained high capacity utilization in a fairly short
period.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPITON AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Background, Objective and Description
2.01      The Talkha II Project was part of an overall plan of Egypt to
increase the supply of nitrogen fertilizer based on local natural gas and
reduce fertilizer imports. This was achieved by establishing Talkha I and
Talkha II and building an ammonia/urea plant at Abu Quir, comparable in
size to Talkha II. Talkha II was identified by IDA missions in late 1972
and April 1973 and appraised by missions in December 1973 and February 1974
in which IDA and five other lenders participated. The Project included a
1,200 tpd ammonia plant in one single process stream and a 1,725 tpd urea
plant in two streams of equal capacity, along with necesary auxiliary
facilities such as ammonia storage tank, urea storage facility, power
transmission and transformer facilities to draw power from the nearby power
station, a steam generation unit for the urea plant, a bag-making plant as
well as other necessary equipment for construction, material handling,
warehouse and laboratory. The ammonia plant included 200 tpd excess
capacity (over and above the quantity required to produce 1,725 tpd urea)
for facilitating higher capacity utilization in Talkha I. In addition,
housing and training facilities were included under the Project. A
Fertilizer Sector Study was also included to provide a basis for preparing
a plan for the future development of the fertilizer sector in Egypt.
2.02      The Project was originally developed through the use of an
Engineering Credit that financed the preparation of a feasibility report,
and also the services of a technical advisor at the early stages of the
Project up to the selection of the engineering firm for the Project.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Scope
3.01      Following detailed review of the project scope at the design
stage, SEMADCO decided on the advice of the engineering firm to modify the
project scope to achieve more flexibility and further improve project
viability. Subsequently, the following modifications were carried out
during implementation: (i) increase in the ammonia storage capacity from
2,000 tons to 10,000 tons; (ii) increase in the urea storage capacity;
(iii) increase in the capacity of the auxiliary boilers from 150 tons/hr to
280 tons/hr; (iv) an additional crane to increase the lifting capacity from
350 tons to 450 tons; (v) construction of a new Regional Training Center to
serve the needs of not only Talkha II but also other fertilizer plants in
Egypt and other Arab countries; (vi) capacity expansion of the water
treatment plant in line with the revised boiler feedwater and process water



requirements; (vii) addition of an effluent treatment plant to improve the
effluent quality to protect sources of potable water in the area; and
(viii) additional provision for housing. All of these changes were
technically and economically justified and agreed to by IDA. The changes
in the project scope accounted for an increase of about US$23 million in
project cost equivalent to 30% of total cost increase.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.02      Work on Talkha II started in February 1975: the Project was
mechanically completed in April 1980 and commissioned in November 1980.
The production build-up in the Project following commissioning has been
satisfactory. It achieved a capacity utilization of 76% and 68% in the first
year of operation in the ammonia and urea plants, respectively, compared to
the appraisal expectation of 70%. The plants are now operating at about
90% capacity, as assumed in appraisal report. Natural gas for Talkha II is
supplied through a pipeline from the Abu Madhi Gasfield to the site
completed in time for the commissioning of Talkha I. As that pipeline was
designed taking into account the needs of Talkha II as well, only an
additional control station was required at the site to supply gas to Talkha
II. Further, the surplus ammonia capacity (200 tpd) is helping to achieve
higher capacity utilization in Talkha I by meeting part of its ammonia
requirements.
C. Project Management
3.03      SEMADCO acted as Project Manager for the Talkha II Project.
During appraisal, it was agreed that SEMADCO would be assisted by a
technical advisor (TA) firm, since SEMADCO had limited experience in
building large projects and in carrying out procurement under the guidlines
of international organizations. SEMADCO established a project team of
about 20 experienced persons to supervise and coordinate the work of the
engineering firm and the civil work contractors. The TA firm and the
project team worked together satisfactorily through the engineering phase
of the Project. However, when the construction work on the Project
commenced, SEMADCO management decided that they did not need the services
of the TA firm any longer as they felt that their construction experience
(i.e., in Talkha I) was sufficient. Subsequently, when the civil works
were delayed, SEMADCO hired another TA firm, at the suggestion of the Bank,
at the last phase of implementation to support the project team in
supervising construction, erection and commissioning. The progress of the
Project was also adversely affected by changes in the project team--the
Project Manager left in mid-1977 to join another company and the Civil
Works Manager was later replaced when civil works progressed slowly.
3.04      The responsibility for basic and detailed engineering, design,
procurement of equipment, and commissioning rested with an engineering firm
hired by SEMADCO. Even though it is a subsidiary of a well-known
engineering company, the subsidiary's specific experience in detailed
engineering for ammonia/urea complexes was rather limited in 1975 when it



- 4 -
was selected. Talkha II was the first major ammonia/urea plant undertaken
by that subsidiary. As a result, a number of modifications had to be made
in the original design in the course of execution. Further, the SEMADCO
Project team had the prime responsibility for construction supervision and
coordination of the work of the civil contractors and, in practice, for
procurement decisions. The role of the engineering firm was cnly advisory
in the construction phase. In the course of implementation, when it became
apparent that the civil contractors' work was lagging behind schedule, the
main contractor was changed, and incentives were introduced to expedite the
work. Cement shortages also affected civil works. SEMADCO subsequently
obtained clearances from the Government to import 10,000 tons of cement.
To overcome a serious shortage of skilled welders, SEMADCO modified its
contract with the engineering firm and requested them to supply skilled
expatriate welders. Further, SEMADCO, which had assigned a procurement
team to the office of the engineering firm to expedite procurement by
working closely with the engineering firm, withdrew the team before the
procurement was fully completed, assuming that their presence was not
necessary as only 5% of equipment in terms of value remained to be
procured. However, the last 5% procurement included many sophisticated
instrumentation equipment, piping and fittings and other small items whose
prompt procurement and delivery were critital to mechanically complete and
commission the Project. Faced with this problem, SEMADCO had to send its
procurement team back to the office of the engineering firm on short
assignments to expedite procurement of small items some of which had to be
purchased at short notice. SEMADCO also faced another problem regarding
the procurement of small items. According to Egyptian regulations, the
standard terms and conditions of purchase have to be applied for all
procurement under the Project including the procurement of small items.
Subsequently, SEMADCO resolved this problem by having a contract with the
engineering firm to purchase small items on a reimbursible basis.
3.05      Port congestion at Alexandria hindered prompt unloading of
imported equipment and materials. Moreover, slow customs clearance was one
of the problems faced during Project implementation. Some equipment items
were held up for weeks in spite of repeated requests from SEMADCO for their
release. The slow release of imported equipment from customs is a factor
to be reviewed carefully for future projects in Egypt.
D. Implementation Schedule
3.06      At the time of the appraisal, it was envisaged that the
engineering firm would be appointed by September 1974. However, there was
a delay of five months in the selection of the firm. The contract with the
selected engineering firm became effective in February 1975 as against the
original schedule of September 1974. From the contract effectiveness, the
Project was expected to take 36 months for mechanical completion. However,
it took 56 months, 20 months more than expected. Overall, compared to the
appraisal estimate, there was a delay of 25 months up to mechanical



-5-
completion, including the delay in the selection of the engineering firm
(Annex 1). The appraisal estimate, which was based upon a detailed
feasibility study, proved optimistic under Egyptian conditions.
E. Project Start-up and Commissioning
3.07      Problems were encountered in commissioning the ammonia plant
because of repeated failures of the ammonia syngas compressor turbine.
This problem was overcome with the help of the equipment vendor. While
commissioning of the urea plant, problems were encountered in the
absorption section. Further, the biuret content of urea produced initially
was higher than expected. These problems have been resolved subsequently
with the help of the urea process licensor. After overcoming initial
start-up troubles, the Project was commissioned in November 1980.
F. Use and Performance of Engineering Firms and Consultants
3.08      SEMADCO management was not satisfied with the performance of the
engineering firm and the technical advisor. As mentioned, SEMADCO stopped
using the services of the technical advisor (TA) as the former was not
satisfied with TA's expertise in construction supervision. As for the
engineering firm, even though they tried hard, their work was affected
partly by lack of previous experience in carrying out detailed engineering
for large-scale ammonia/urea plants. Their selection was based to a large
extent on the reputation of their parent company, and their price quotation
was substantially lower than that of other competing firms. However, about
18 months after the contract, the firm wanted the contract price to be
increased as it was apparent that the Project would be delayed partly
because of slippage in civil works, and as their costs under the contract
were increasing at a far higher rate than anticipated due to steep
increases in prices the world over following the 1973/74 oil crisis.
Initially, SEMADCO opposed any increase in the contract price and the
relationship between SEMADCO and the engineering firm was strained.
Subsequently, SEMADCO was convinced that there was justification for
increasing the contract price, and agreed to raise the contract by Lira 1
billion (equivalent to US$700,000 at the existing exchange rate in
mid-1977) or 5% of the original contract price.
3.09      As noted, the engineering firm was responsible only for
engineering, design, procurement assistance and commissioning of the
plant. The SEMADCO project team was responsible for procurement and to
supervise and coordinate the construction work with the help of a civil
engineer from the engineering firm. Further, slower than anticipated
release of detailed vendor drawings required for the civil design of
foundation, structures, etc. also affected civil works. The engineering
firm was responsible for expediting the preparation of these drawings by
the vendors. The main local civil works contractor firm selected did not
have experience in building large plants. It was responsible for civil
works and erection for process units, some utilities and offsites. For



other civil works, SEMADCO signed contracts with a few other local
contractors. SEMADCO found the performance of the main civil works
contractor less than satisfactory and the contractor was subsequently
replaced. The progress of erection could have been expidted by appointing
a specialized contracting firm from outside Egypt for the erection of some
of the heavy and difficult to erect equipment. At one stage, SEMADCO
management considered this idea but did not follow it through as they felt
that the cost of such foreign service was too high.
G. Training
3.10      Adequate attention was given to training under the Project.  A
Regional Training Center was established at Talkha as part of the Project
to train operators, shift supervisors, maintenance and instrumentation
technicans required for SEMADCO plants, other chemical plants in Egypt and
also in neighboring Arab countries. The foreign exchange cost of the
Center was financed by the Kuwait Fund through the supplementary loan it
provided for Talkha II in June 1976. The Center is capable of training
about 200 technicians and supervisors per year.
3.11      About 137 selected SEMADCO personnel were sent abroad for
training. Training at the offices of the engineering firm was provided for
eight SEMADCO engineers in basic and detailed engineering and three SEMADCO
staff members in procurement. Furthermore, about 29 persons were trained
at selected fertilizer plants in Kuwait in ammonia and urea plant operation
and maintenance. In addition, 34 ammonia and urea plant supervisors were
sent for training at the fertilizer plants of ICI (UK) and Stamicarbon (the
Netherlands); and 63 trainees were sent abroad for training at equipment
vendors workshops. When SEMADCO faced shortages of specialized welders, it
organized on-site training for welders with the help of the engineering
firm.
H. Procurement
3.12      Procurement of equipment and services financed by IDA was done in
accordance with IDA/Bank Guidelines. Except for items that had been agreed
as critical items, all contracts for equipment (Excluding small items) were
awarded based on the international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.
3.13      SEMADCO faced problems in the procurement of small items for
which the suppliers expect cash payments to avoid the delays in following
disbursement procedures of IDA and the other co-financiers. SEMADCO,
however, did not have any foreign exchange at its disposal which it could
advance for such items. To overcome this problem, SEMADCO got approvaL
from the co-financiers to establish revolving funds to finance some small
items. SEMADCO also ararnged with the engineering firm to purchase some
other small items from its own funds to be reimbursed by SEWMADCO from the
IDA Credit.

3.14      It was also noticed that some of the Egyptian regulations were
not conductive to prompt project execution. For example, any contract
costing LE 1 million and above had to be approved by the Minister of
Finance. The Project Manager had authority to authorize contracts costing
only LE 500,000 or less. Even minor changes in the Letters of Credit had
to be approved by a number of officials of the Company and the Finance
Ministry. The same standard terms and conditions of purchase were to be
used for contracts whether they were large items or small items. In future
Bank projects, the procedure should be simplified. Perhaps the Companies
could be encouraged to get from the Government adequate authority for
taking prompt procurement decisions by obtaining prior approval of the
Finance Ministry for a "Master Project Proposal". Based on this approval,
the Companies could be enabled to open the "Master Letter of Credit"
account in a leading local bank and station their staff in the offices of
the engineering firms to expedite the procurement of equipment. Such a
procedure would help overcome delays faced by companies in seeking approval
for the procurement of each imported item.
3.15      The following table shows the sources of supply of equipment and
services to Talkha II under IDA credit and loans from Arab lenders:

3.16             Italian suppliers were the most successful in winning contracts
for both services and equipment on this project, accounting for about 70%
of disbursements under the IDA Credit (of which nearly 60% was for
engineering services) and 48% of disbursements for the total foreign
loans. The Federal Republic of Germany was the second largest supplier
(accounting for about (15% of total foreign disbursements). This pattern,
i.e., correlation of suppliers from the country of the engineering firn,
follows that of other industrial projects financed by the Bank.
I. Project Capital Cost
3.17             Total financing required for Talkha II was US$209.7 million,
including US$135 million in fdreign exchange. A comparison of the actual
capital costs with the appraisal estimates is summarized below:

3/ Freight was originally considered as local cost as Egyptian ships were to be the carriers. However, subsequiently, SEMADCO
decided to entrust the responsibility for shipping and landing to equipment suppliers to achieve better coordination between
suppliers and carriers.
3.18             The Project experienced a cost increase of 58% in US$ terms
mainly due to : (i) sharp increases in the total cost of civil works and
erection; (ii) changes in project scope; (iii) increases in working capital
requirements due to a sharp rise in operating costs; (iv) higher than



- 9 -
expected increases in equipment prices and currency realignments; (v)
increase in preoperating costs partly because of project delay; (vi)
increase in interest during construction. Such cost increases were common
in projects appraised before the world oil crisis of 1973/74. The
following table shows the changes in cost by different causes:
TALKHA II   COST VARIATION BY CAUSES
US$ million       %
- Increase in Civil Works and Erection Costs                 23.4       30.3
- Changes in Project Scope (incl. additional
equipment, civil works and erection)                    22.8        29.5
- Increase in Working Capital Requirements                   11.1       14.3

- Increase in Interest During Construction                    6.0        7.8
- Change in Cost of Engineering Services and Licenses    (0.7)          (0.9)
- Change in Cost of Freight and Insurance                   (1-8)       (2.3)
Total                                                   77.3       100.0
3.19      The single most important reason for the cost increases was the
steep rise in the cost of civil works and erection mainly because of
project delays. The second most important reason was the change in project
scope (para 3.02) which improved the technical and economic viability of
the Project, and provided additional operational flexibility to Talkha I.
The above two factors accounted for a major part (nearly 60%) of the total
cost increases of the Project.  Since Talkha II was implemented, the
cost of building similar projects has increased significantly in real
terms. As a result, in spite of the cost increases as compared to the
appraisal estimate, the cost of Talkha II is still lower in real terms than
what a similar project would cost to build now.
J. Project Financing
3.20      The additional US$77.3 million required to meet cost increases
was provided by increased equity contributions from the Egyptian Government
and by supplementary loans from the co-financiers.  Even though the
co-financiers had increased their loans from US$69.3 million to US $97.7
million, they disbursed only US$88.6 million. The rest of the amount was
cancelled by the co-financiers who did not approve of extending the Closing
Date for their loans following the boycott of Egypt by Arab countries soon
after its Peace Treaty with Israel in 1978. The following table shows the
actual financing of the Project compared to the original plan:

3.21      The original Closing Date for the IDA Credit was April 1, 1979
but it was extended twice owing to project delays, in response to the
Government requests for extension. As of Septemer 1980, the final Closing
Date for the Credit, almost all the Credit was disbursed, there being only
US$11,984 undisbursed amount which was cancelled. The Credit was used
primarily to finance engineering services and selected critical and
specialized equipment (including compressors, high pressure reactors and
boilers).
3.22      The actual disbursement pattern of the IDA Credit and that
estimated at the time of appraisal are shown in Annex 2. The disbursement
pattern assumed at the time of appraisal proved to be optimistic because of
project delays. According to the appraisal estimate, disbursements were to
start in the third quarter of 1974 and were to be completed by December 31,
1977. Disbursement actually commenced in the beginning of 1975 and
proceeded at a slower rate than that assumed during appraisal as shown
below:

K. Environmental Aspects
3.23      Talkha II was designed with adequate attention to international
standards for gaseous and liquid emissions.  Generally, there is little
pollution from well-designed and well-operated ammonia/urea complexes based
on natural gas. SEMADCO is monitoring the pollutants to minimize their
effects on the environment through checking of efficiency of the scrubbing
system at the top of the urea prilling tower. Atmospheric pollutants are
kept well below the current international standards. Measures are also
taken to reduce pollution by liquid effluents. Toxic emissions from the
cooling towers are either diluted or reduced before discharge. The traces
of ammonia and urea contained in the discharged water are within the
acceptable level.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Build-up of Production
After overcoming the start-up problems (para 3.07), Talkha II was
commissioned in November 1980. It produced 302,200 tons of ammonia and
387,500 tons of urea in 1981, the first calendar year of operation,
reflecting a capacity utlization of 76% and 68% for the ammonia and urea
plants, respectively (Annex 3). These capacity utilization figures are
close to the appraisal estimate of 70% for both ammonia and urea plants in
the first year of operation. Currently, the production level is close to
90% of capacity. Thus, though Talkha II project implementation experienced
delays, it has achieved impressive production built-up after commissioning.
B. Market Development and Performance
4.02      Nitrogenous fertilizer consumption in Egypt has grown more or
less in line with the forecasts at the time of appraisal in 1973 as shown
in the following table:
NITROGEN CONSUMPTION
('000 Nutrient tons)
1974   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981
Appraisal Estimate       381    409    410    438    456    474    492    513
Actual                  358    360    415    428    460    481    500    575



- 12 -
4.03      The forecasts at the time of appraisal had assumed relatively
constant consumption of nitrogen fertilizer up to 1976 due to limited
domestic production and foreign exchange constraints for increased
imports. Since 1976, the N consumption has increased at a faster rate
(close to the rate forecast) with the increase in the availability of
fertilizers, partly through higher imports.
4.04       The Government of Egypt continues to control the supply and
consumption of fertilizers. The Ministry of Agriculture sets the
application rates and determines the quotas of fertilizer made available to
each farmer according to his crop area, land location and the crop rotation
which he follows in cultivating his hand.
4.05       The General Organization for Agricultural and Cooperative Credit
(GOACC), a public sector organization, continues to procure and distribute
all locally produced and imported fertilizers in accordance with the
Ministry of Agriculture quotas. The distribution system is working fairly
well.
4.06      As a part of the Talkha II Project, IDA financed a
Techno-Economic Study of the Fertilizer Sector with special reference to
balanced fertilizer use, more reliable forecasts of fertilizer demand.,
taking into account the scope for reclamation of land and t'he use of
new seed varieties, etc. and programs necessary to achieve higher
fertilizer consumption. The Study was carried out by the Institute of
National Planning (INP), Cairo, on the basis of terms of reference agreed
with IDA. The recommendations of the Study have been followed by the
iMinistry of Agriculture in revising its application rates and in
determining quotas for farmers. The Study was detailed but did not
adequately address all of the issues facing improved fertilizer use and
supply in Egypt. In 1981, the Bank prepared a Fertilizer Sector Report on
Egypt to assist the Government in restructuring and modernizing the sector.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Financial Rate of Return
5.01       The financial rate of return (FRR) for Talkha II is now
calculated at 13% (Annexed 4 and 5) which, though satisfactory, is less
than the appraisal estimate of i8%, mainly because of project delays,
higher investment costs, and low retail fertilizer prices.  The calculation
of the FRR, which is made in real terms at 1980 prices, is based on the
actual investment costs, the actual urea price of 1980-81 with real
increases for outer years in line with the projected real increases -in
world urea prices, and the gas price per 1,000 standard cubic feet of
US$0.25 in 1981, US$0.36 in 1982, US$0.52 in 1983, US$0.76 in 1984 and
US$1.1 in 1985 and remaining at this level for outer years. The gradual
increase in gas price in real terms vetween 1981 and 1985 would raise the



- 13 -
gas price to a level adequate to cover the cost of building the
gas-gathering and distribution system and ensure a reasonable rate of
return to the gas supply company.

5.03     The overall financial position of the Company has improved over
the years. From a loss of LE 8,000 in 1976, the Company's profitability
improved to LE 4.1 million in 1980-81. The profitability of the Company is
still low because of low ex-factory prices for two fertilizers--ammonium
nitrate (AN) and calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)--produced by Talkha I and
Suez plants. The ex-factory prices for those products continue to be less
than their production cost, with the Government making up the losses
through compensation payments. Thus Talkha I is operating on a no-loss,
no-profit basis. As for urea produced in the IDA-financed Talkha II
Project, the ex-factory price fixed by the Government (LE 122.5 per product
ton), though lower than the CIF price by about 27%, is adequate to ensure a
reasonable return on net fixed assets in service of Talkha II at the
current gas price of US$0.25/1,000 standard cubic feet. The gas price is
expected to be increased gradually to US$1.1/1,000 standard cubic feet
during 1981-85. During the same period, the ex-factory prices for urea are
expected to be increased by the Government in line with the projected real
incrases in world fertilizer prices from the current depressed levels due
to temporary over-supply. Further, even though the Government has
increased retail prices over the years, these prices are still low by



- 14 -
international standards. For example, the delivery price of urea is about
§US$128/ton compared to the economic delivered price (based on the current
CIF price) of US$240/ton, reflecting a subsidy of 47%. However, this
"subsidy" appears to be needed considering that crop prices are also
controlled at low prices.
5.04      SEMADCO's financial structure has been satisfactory during
1976-80, with the debt/equity ratio at the level of 40/60 in 1980. The
Company's liquidity position improved during 1976-78, with the current
ratio reaching 1.4:1 in 1978. However, the ratio declined to O07:1 in 1979
before rising to 0,9:1 in 1980. However, the current ratio is estimated to
have improved significantly in 1981 with the commissioning of the
ammonia/urea plant, with SEMADCO getting reasonably high ex-factory pr:ice
for urea.  One of the important financial convenants under the Talkha LI
Project is that SEMADCO will reach a current ratio of 1.5:1 after project
completion. Another important covenant is that the Company shall maintain
a debt service coverage of not less than 1.5 times after the project
completion. The compliance of these covenants will be evaluated when the
audited statements for 1981 are received. Preliminary indications are that
the Company has made significant progress toward meeting these covenants.
5.05      Audited financial statements have not always been sent to the
Bank by SEMADCO within four months of the end of the fiscal year as
agreed. It takes about six months to receive those statements after the
end of the fiscal year, partly due to the manual reporting system.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.01      Price assumption for economic rate of return calculations are
detailed in Annexes 4, 8 and 9, and the calculations have been made at
constant 1980 prices.  Economic prices for urea reflect international
market prices for the 1980s as forecast by the Bank based on expected real
increases in energy prices. They are adjusted for the cost of freight,
insurance and port handling charges to derive the CIF landed price (at
Alexandria Port). The economic price for natural gas is assumed at
US$1.1/1,000 standard cubic feet up to 1985 and US$4.9/1,000 standard cubic
feet for outer years. The lower price for gas during 1980-85 is based on
the assumptoon that the current surplus of gas in Egypt (which is mostly
flared) will continue until 1985 before effective measures are taken to
gather and distribute the gas as a fuel oil substitute in industries,
including power plants. Until this happens, the gas is priced at the level
adequate to cover production costs and ensure a reasonable return on
investment (i.e.,on the gas-gathering and distribution system). After
1985, when the surplus gas would be effectively used, the opportunity cost
of natural gas would be the energy equivalent price for fuel oil. On this
basis, the natural gas price would be US$4.9/1,000 standard cubic feet from
1985 onwards, based on the international price of US$215/ton of fuel cil in
1980 prices.



- 15 -
6.02      The revised economic rate of return for the Talkha II Project is
19.2%, which is close to that estimated at the time of appraisal (19%).
The major reasons for the substantially the same economic rate of return in
spite of project delays and capital cost increases were: (i) the real cost
of building a plant similar to Talkha II in the world has increased
considerably compared to the investment on Talkha II following the world
energy price increases; (ii) there have been real increases in
international fertilizer prices and transportation charges since the
Project was taken up for implementation.
B. Transfer of Technology
6.03      Talkha II was the first large-scale ammonia/urea projet to be
undertaken in Egypt for implementation using modern technology and services
of international consultants, advisors and engineering contractors.
SEMADCO was exposed to modern design and engineering techniques and gained
significant experience in project management.
C. Foreign Exchange Effects
6.04      The foreign exchange savings in 1982 expressed in 1980 dollars is
estimated at US$85 million. The savings are expected to increase to US$120
million per year in 1985 with higher capacity utilization, real price
increases for fertilizers and declining debt service payments. The foreign
exchange cost of US$195 million(at 1981 prices) for Talkha II would be
recovered in about two years of operation of the Project.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
7.01      SEMADCO, Egypt's largest fertilizer company, has shown that it is
capable of operating its plants at Talkha and Suez at high capacity
levels. The Company has good, experienced technical staff. However, the
Company's construction and financial management is comparatively weak.
SEMADCO has gained valuable experience in construction and project
management under Talkha II and this should help the Company in the
implementation of any future projects. The Company's financial management
needs improvement with particular attention to standard costing, capital
budgeting and financial planning and modern management information systems.
VIII. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
8.01      IDA was closely associated with the formulation of the Talkha II
Project from the preliminary identification mission in April 1973 to
project appraisal in February 1974. The Project was approved by the Board



- 16 -
in June 1974, 11 months after the Egyptian Government's formal request.
The Credit processing followed the original timetable fairly closely. In
view of considerably longer processing time for other projects, 11 months
for this Project from the date of request to Board approval shows IDA made
special efforts to respond quickly to the Borrower's needs.
8.02      IDA involvement in the Project helped attract co-financiers wTho
largely relied on IDA in the appraisal process; and IDA helped prepare a
memorandum of understanding wvith other lenders, SEMADCO and the Government
of Egypt as a basis for project financing and execution, including
procurement procedures.  To maximize its impact on the Project, IDA agreed
to finance technical services as well as critical and specialized equipment
needed for efficient plant operations, Even though the techni-cal advisory
and engineering firms were selected in consultation with IDA, 'frictions
arose between SEMADCO and  the firms.  SEMADCO subseauently stopped us:ing
the services of the technical advisory firm in spite of IDA's efforts to
reconcile their differences. Subsequently, after some delay, SEMADCO
appointed another technical advisory firm on the advice of IDA.  This
helped strengthen SEMADCO's capability for project management.  Moreover,
when the working relationship between SEMADCO and the engineering firm was
strained,IDA helped reconcile their differences by intensifying its
supervision efforts. By stopping over in Cairo and the headquaters of the
engineering firm at regular supervision mission as well as duriag other
trips to Europe and countries neighboring Egypt, IDA staff played an
important role in improving the working relationship between SEMADCO and
the engineering firm.  There  could have been additional delays in project
completion if SEMADCO had stopped using the services of the engineering
firm and had gone out to contract another engineering firm.
8.03      IDA's relationship with SEMADCO throughout project preparatiDn
and implementation was satisfactory and, by and large, SEMADCO was
receptive to IDA's recommendations. IDA was also helpful in establishing a
urea-pricing formula that ensured a reasonable return on assets in
service. Moreover, IDA was able to reach an agreement with the Government
for a Fertilizer Sector Study to help the Government in its medium-and
long-term planning for the fertilizer industry and fertilizer distribution
system.  IDA worked closely with. the Government, which made concerted
efforts to provide contributions to complete the Project in the face of
cost increases.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
A.  Overall Assessment
9.01      Talkha II was implemented by an experienced project team with the
help of technical advisory and engineering firms. The SEMADCO team gained
extensive experience in construction, procurement and operations of a
large-scale fertilizer plant.  Civil works and erection experienced



- 17 -
substantial delays partly because the main civil works contractor was not
fully competent to undertake such a large-scale project (though the
contractor had previous experience with small- and medium-scale projects),
and there were shortages of construction materials. When the Project was
completed, the SEMADCO team was able to achieve high capacity utilization
from the very first year of operation.
B. Lessons for the Borrower and the Bank Concerning similar Projects
9.02.     Lessons learned from the Project which are of relevance to
similar projects in other developing countries are described below.
a) The project sponsor should be asked to prequalify local civil
contractors and finanlize the prequalified contractors' list in
consultation with the Bank. Consideration should be given to the use of
foreign firms when local experience is limited. Previous experience in
building large-scale projects within schedule should De given adequate
weight in the selection of civil works contractors as well as engineering
firms.
b) The engineering firm's experience, including careful
assessment of the experience of the actual office of the firm to be used,
should be evaluated more thoroughly in the selection of the engineering
firm.
c) When the project sponsor is not familiar with the IDA/Bank
procurement procedures, the IDA/Bank should help the project sponsor to
establish an effecient procurement system by paying special attention to
this aspect during appraisal and supervision missions. Further, a
procurement team of the project sponsor should be assigned to the head
office of the engineering firm to expedite procurement. The team should
stay there until procurement work is completed, and should have adequate
authority to take prompt decisions on procurement matters.
d) There should be a capable Site Manager responsible for
coordination of all activities, including the work of all sub-contractors
for civil works and erection. This responsibility should be entrusted to
the engineering firm in countries where construction supervision and
coordination capability of local companies for large-scale projects are not
fully developed. In the case of Talkha II, the engineering firm was only
an advisor to the SEMADCO management.
e) In countries where the local capability for civil works and
erection is weak, and where there is shortage of construction materials and
trained craftsmen (e.g., welders), it is advisable to carry out large-scale
projects on a lump-sum contract for engineering as well as construction
with a capable and experienced engineering firm, with only equipment and
spares to be procured under international competitive bidding.



- 18 -
f) Consideration should be given to incorporating a bonus/penalty
clause in the contract with the engineering firm. Such a clause in the
case of Talkha II could have helped reduce project delays.
g) In countries where the Borrower is unable to advance foreign
exchange, agreement should be sought with the Borrower that a Revolving
Fund be established for, say, US$150,000 in the country of the engineering
firm to expedite the procurement of small items (e.g., piping, fitting,
instrumentation equipment). The Bank Group could consider providing for
the Revolving Fund from the loan if the Borrower so desires.
9.02      In summary, though Talkha II experienced project delays and cost
increases because of factors mentioned above, the Project is still
economically viable and has introduced modern ammonia/urea technology to
Egypt, and its foreign exchange saving effect on the country's economy is
significant. Thus, the Project has successfully met its basic objectives.
