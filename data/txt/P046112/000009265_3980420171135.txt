Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators)
The Project development objectives are to: (a) improve the capacity of schools, education communities and the municipality
to provide effectively and in a participatory way their respective education services.(b) contribute to the municipality's goal
of improving student learning, school access and retention rates in the territory of the municipality and; The Project will
achieve the above-mentioned objectives through: (i) a short term strategy supporting and financing Municipal plans to
address Basic Unattended Educational Needs (Necesidades Educativas Basicas Insatisfechas - NEBIs), such as provision
of basic education materials, urgent school infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion of access; (ii) financing a set of
activities aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Municipal Education Secretariat (Secretaria de Educaci6n Municipal -
SEM) to coordinate the execution of the Project and discharge its managerial and advisory role and (iii) a medium/long tenn
strategy supporting and financing the development of Educational Networks (Redes Educativas) and the implementation of
their education improvement plans.
As an important corollary to the achievement of the above development objectives, the project aims also at providing lessons
and valuable experiences, for the design of a national strategy to support municipal and departmental education investment
programs in the framework of education decentralization. The departmental project designed in Antioquia in parallel to this
operation is an integral part of the same learning strategy. All Departments and Municipalities over 100,000 are expected
under the law to assume responsibility for the management of sectoral resources, investment planning and implementation.

pedagogical support material and teaching tool kits), teacher
training on the use of these materials and urgent infrastructure
rehabilitation. Additionally, the component would finance the
expansion of school access through the construction of new
classrooms, the substitution of classrooms in serious state of
disrepair and contracts with nonprofit institutions. The above
financing will be used as an incentive to schools and
communities for the development of the School networks -
Redes. Resources will be targeted to benefit more the schools
and communities most in need.

3. Benefits and target population
The Project is expected to produce social, economic and institutional benefits with regards to:
a) Social Benefits
. Increase access to basic education in the Municipality to compensate for school age population growth
. Increased quality of compulsory Education cycle
. Increased learning and achievement of 5-15 year olds in participating communities
. Greater equality of educational opportunities
.   Increased motivation of teachers, students and parents to integrate school teaching and learning with community
outreach events
• Improved civic attitudes at the community level
b) Institutional Benefits
* Strengthened management of the municipal education sector
.   Increased capacity of the schools to develop and implement education development plans
.   Improved effectiveness of education services delivery at the municipal and school levels by transferring decision
making closer to the end-user clients (parents, principals, teachers and students)
. Increased municipal and community commitment to and ownership of the process to improve the quality of education
provided by the schools
. Reduced budgetary constraints of centrally controlled financial mechanisms for municipal and school level education
services and investments
c) Economic Benefits
* Increase self-financing capacity of education services at the municipal level
. Instead of individual schools offering a complete basic education cycle, it will be provided by each School Network
* Shared infrastructure and resources among the schools belonging to the same School Network
Target Population
In 1997, the Municipality of Pasto will have 95,064 children aged 5-15, in the basic cycle (grades 0-9) who will be the
primary beneficiary of the project. About 40 percent of the population of Pasto live below the poverty line and most of the
poor attend public schools. The project will be targeted to finance the improvement of services provided by the public sector
in 167 schools (51,575 students, 2,730 teachers), which will be organized into 12 school networks (six in rural areas where
currenttly 7,389 students attend 99 dispersed schools), that will count on the active participation of families and local
communities.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements.
Implementation period: Four years (1998-2001)
Executing agencies
A set of Manuals (Operational, Procurement and Financial Management) details the proposed structure and procedures for
project management at both the Municipal and at the Network level and would guide project implementation at every level.
The issuing of these manuals in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition for the effectiveness of the
Loan.
.  The Municipal Education Secretariat (SEM): would be responsible for overall project coordination as well as the
promotion, appraisal, and ex post evaluation of the demand-driven investment subprojects generated by the school
networks. A project manager will coordinate, under the overall direction of the Education Secretary (Project Director),
a small Project Management Unit (PMU) (4/5 staff) which will directly support implementation. This team, part of the
education management division of the SEM, will be responsible mainly for the administrative processes between the
World Bank and the Municipality (e.g., information, reports, disbursement requests, procurement documentation, no-
objections, financial reporting). The PMU will be supported by a four technical teams (Redes, NEBIs, Institutional
Development and Financial Management) of the SEM's planning, education management and administrative divisions.
The staff of these technical teams will provide technical support to the implementation activities towards the schools
and will comprise SEM personnel as well as some (about ten) temporary staff. The project will finance on a declining
basis the additional temporary staff of the Redes and NEBIs teams dedicated to promote and guide the creation of the
school networks during the first phase of project implementation.
Additionally, two advisory commissions (Pedagogy and Admninistration), comprising the heads of various divisions of
the SEM and of other secretariats such as Hacienda (Finance) and Civil Works, will assist the PMU providing guidance
on administrative, financial and pedagogical issues. The involvement of the entire structure of the SEM in Project
implementation is expected to create permanent sector management capacity. The same organizational structure
designed for project implementation will be adapted to progressively assume SEM's new responsibilities deriving from
the decentralization of the sector, particularly with regard to the local management of the fiscal transfers (Si tuado
Fiscal) currently managed by the Department of Narifio.
.  The School Networks (Redes), once created according to agreed procedures described by the Manuals (and summarized
in Annex 2), will, through their executive organ, the Council, be responsible for the implementation of the school
network subprojects under the supervision of the SEM.
.  Existing school, cormmunity and municipal organizations, created under Law 60, will play a key role in the creation of
the Redes and the implementation of the PDRs. These organizations include:
*  La Junta Municipal de Educaci6n (JUME), a Municipal Representative Committee
* El Gobierno Escolar, a school govemrnment (with representation of teachers, parents and the community)
headed by the school principal with legal status to manage school funds (Fondo Docente);
*  El Consejo Academico, a pedagogical school committee with representation of teachers from various
disciplines;
*  La Asociaci6n de Padres de Familia, Parents Association, which can also manage funds for teacher/parent
activities within the schools; and
*  Personeros Estudiantiles, student rights committees and associations which represent the interest of students in
the above mentioned committees.
Project coordination
All project activities at the school/community, Red and municipal levels will be coordinated by the SEM to guarantee
common objectives and clear procedures, incentives and rules according to the Manuals.
The Operational Manual comprises a set of modules detailing procedures, functions and responsibilities for the SEM. the
Networks and the Schools: (i) General Infortnation and Promotion; (ii) Role and responsibility of the SEM for the
implementation of each component, (iii) School Network Creation and Sub-project Presentation and Appraisal (including
the description of technical, social, institutional and financial feasibility criteria for subproject presentation); and (iv)



Pasto Education Project                                                                        Pa e 5
participation of the Schools to the Networks. The Operational Manual will be integrated by the Procurement and
Financial Management manuals.
Project Implementation Cycle
The Project will be implemented through two different, although integrated, strategies. A first strategy, would finance
supply-driven interventions, urgent in nature, directed at alleviating the NEBIs so to promote a minimum standard of
education inputs in the municipal territory and stimulate the development of the School Networks - Redes.
The other strategy aims at the creation of School Networks, with a pilot phase involving five Redes. Following the
evaluation of this experience, a second phase with the remaining seven Networks would commence. Once the governing
organs of the Redes (the Council and the Assembly) are selected and legalized by a decree of SEM, the networks will begin
to receive technical assistance to facilitate the preparation of the triennial Network Development Plans --(Planes de
Desarrollo de Red - PDRs). Each PDR and its annual operative programs, will be financed by Project proceeds according
to the operational manual and to an administrative act (resoluci6n administrativa), issued by the mayor of Pasto, regulating
the formal establishment of each Red and delegating the management of Project funds to finance the PDRs to the manager
of each School Network, the Coordinador de Red.
Project oversight (e.g., policy guidance)
Although the SEM will be responsible for overall project coordination of project implementation, the two advisory
commissions (Pedagogy and Administration) comprising members from SEM units and from other secretariats will provide
policy guidance and help find solutions to possible institutional bottlenecks during implementation.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements
Consolidation of overall project accounting and financial reporting will be done by the SEM. At the Red level, the
respective procedures for project implementation detailed in the Manuals will emphasize appropriate accounting and
auditing procedures. The project will finance the purchase of a financial software to monitor the use of project resources at
the SEM as well at school level. Quarterly administrative audits will provide feedback on imnplementation procedures, the
school networks subprojects and of physical progress (e.g., construction, services provided, goods delivered) for the overall
Project. Community oversight (veedurias) programs will also be implemented. Communities would be informed (e.g.,
through periodic newspapers, bulletins and/or other publications) about the objectives, activities and financial resources
provided by the Project for their schools/communities organized in the Redes. For overall Project implementation, external
financial audit reports (including the auditing of the use of funds at the Network level) prepared by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank, would be submitted annually in accordance to Bank standards. Periodic independent Technical
Audits will certify that the goods procured under the Project are used consistently with overall project objectives and
strategies. Annex 6 details the proposed accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
The school network development and related demand-driven projects require a well functioning monitoring and evaluation
system. A systematic evaluation of the implementation process is key to identifying the strengths and weaknesses of project
design at each phase. Although monitoring and evaluation of the subprojects is the responsibility of each Network, the
SEM will be responsible for the overall monitoring of project processes and impact, and the periodic adjustment of project
design, implementation mechanism and participatory processes at each phase of the implementation cycle and in agreement
with the Bank.
Along with the quarterly financial reports, SEM's Administrative Team would submit to the Bank
consolidated performance indicators at the end of each quarter. The SEM and the Bank would jointly
conduct annual Project reviews and a comprehensive midterm review to be carried out by December 1999
to evaluate implementation progress and to make additional necessary adjustments.
The project will provide resource to develop a monitoring and evaluation system to ensure that the project has achieved its
objectives at the school and school network levels and that education stakeholders have a say in assessing project processes,
strategies and use of resources during the implementation of the project. Annex 9 describes the proposed Monitoring and
Evaluation S stem and relative indicators.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project    CAS Report #P6070-CO 16/12/93-- New CAS to be presented
to the Board in November 1997.
Colombia's Country Appraisal Strategies (CASs) of 1993 and 1997 recognize that the country's still unequally low levels
of educational attainment and coverage, primarily in poor and rural communities, adversely affect development in this
country. The 1997 CAS puts a stronger emphasis on successfully implementing Colombia's decentralization and
community participation policies. In the education sector, the focus is on expanding access and improving quality through
education services provided at the municipal level, and with increased school autonomy and greater community and private
sector participation. By transferring education responsibilities to the departments and municipalities, decisionmaking at the
local level can more accurately reflect the needs of the users, adequately attend to regional diversities, and also increase
accountability. As one of the two pilots testing decentralization strategies at the departmental and municipal levels, the
project provides decentralization design and implementation lessons from the ground up as input for a national
decentralization strengthening strategy. The project fully supports the CAS objectives.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy
National Policies: Local Government and Community Management of the Education System
a) National and local governments emphasize social programs, as reflected in the national development plan (Salto
Social), and the national education plan, (Salto Educativo). The Salto Social's objectives include social development,
the competitiveness of the economy, the environment, and decentralization and institutional strengthening. The Salto
Educativo calls for the transferring of education management responsibilities to departments and municipalities. To
enable regional goverrunents to operate in the new decentralized environment, the national government fully supports
strengthening the capacity of local education agencies as part of its strategy to improve access and quality of education.
By making education management local, the possibilities for resource mobilization, cost sharing, and greater
community and parental involvement are enhanced.
Decentralization Background
b) The decentralization process in Colombia was initiated in 1968 through an effort to deconcentrate the Ministry of
Education (MOE) to local organization, though MOE maintained veto power over them. In 1971, an education tax
allowance (the Situado Fiscal) earmarked national government expenditures and sales taxes for educational purposes.
The Regional Education Funds (Fondos Educativos Regionales, FER) were institutions created as a hybrid system
intended basically to deconcentrate the payroll of national and nationalized teachers, with a highly centralized control of
how the funds could be used. Teacher qualification committees (Juntas de Escalafon Departamental3 followed to
guarantee minimum standards. Since the 1980s, the stated policy objective has been to give local governments the
power to manage their educational systems. Local fiscal autonomy however, was not supported until the late 1980s
when new measures began to increase local revenues (tax and nontax). The law requiring the election of mayors to
increase their accountability to the community facilitated fiscal decentralization. The Constitution of 1991 increased
local responsibility in the delivery of social services and distributed administrative functions at different levels.
Municipal governments have experienced a sharp increase in local revenues -- from 2 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in 1980 to 3.5 percent in 1994.
Original Decentralization Implementation Strategy
c) While important decentralization advances took place, the central government had continued to control partially the
national education investment budget. The cofinancing system remained overly centralized and bureaucratic, citing low
local capacity to justify restraining funds and slowing disbursements. Also, large institutional development investments
provided only centrally delivered training and sporadic technical assistance. Local processes of leadership, autonomy,
participation, and innovation went largely untapped. This incompletely implemented decentralization strategy did not
contribute to improving the quality indicators of the education system: an average Colombian student still takes seven
years to complete the first five years of primary school. While 87 percent of students complete all five grades, 19.5



Pasto Education Project                                                                           Page 7
percent do so only after repeating three or more grades. Only half of those students entering sixth grade reach the
eleventh grade five years later, and most of them are from wealthier families. The results from the first national
assessment of primary education indicates that most third and fifth graders are not achieving at grade-level in reading
comprehension and mathematics.
New Decentralization Implementation Approach
d) Attempting to find new alternatives to successfully achieve the objectives of local government and community
management of the education system, the central govemment initiated a process of transferring fiscal management to
Departments and large municipalities (populations over 100,000). This process is called "certification." In this context,
certified local governments are fully responsible for planning education investments, managing the situado fiscal
(mostly funds for recurrent costs and teacher salaries), identifying additional sources of investment financing, and
implementing and evaluating their own improvement projects.
e) Moreover, to strengthen local management and decisionmaking, the national government is supporting the provision of
multilateral funds directly to local governnents. It is expected this strategy also would improve the efficiency of
investments supported by international development organizations. A municipality and a department were selected to
participate in a pilot program and the World Bank was approached to support this innovation. This pilot operation,
directly designed and implemented by local govermments, would provide lessons to a nationwide system of technical and
management capacity strengthening and decentralized financing of capital investments. The key criteria used for
selection of the participating local governments included: financial indebtedness capacity, regional and socioeconomic
representation, and political commitment. Financial sustainability was weighted heavily, since the central Government
seeks to encourage fiscal discipline at the local government levels. Socioeconomic representation guaranteed equity
considerations. Political will is key to any major sector reform and learning strategy. The Departrnent of Antioquia, in
the central region of Colombia, and the Municipality of Pasto, in the Andean Highlands, were selected.
Main Sector Issues in the Municipality of Pasto
General Situation
Pasto, capital of the department of Narifno, is a municipality in the southwest of the country with about 333,000 inhabitants.
About 89 percent of its population lives in the urban area, and the rest lives in the rural areas. Unemployment of the active
population was 15 percent in June 1996, and of the employed population, 40 percent lived with an income below the
poverty line. The most dynarnic sectors of the local economy, such as border commerce (Ecuador is less than two hours
from Pasto), tourism, and retail banking are gradually employing a larger sector of the urban population, while the
traditional farming activities are on the decline.
Education Statistics
The municipal school system served 80,154 children in 1996 (grades 0-1 1), 64 percent of whom went to public schools.
School exiting exams (ICFES) held in Pasto demonstrate low achievement in comparison with national averages. Children
in only 12 percent of the public schools of Pasto achieve higher than average scores. Schools with double or triple shifts
(moming, aftemoon, and nights) and rural schools present the lowest achievement data. While 82 percent of the students
complete fifth grade, only 60 percent of them reach sixth grade without repeating. In rural areas, 78 percent of the stuidents
complete fifth grade, and 50 percent of them do not repeat any grades. Dropouts and repetitions have a negative impact on
the efficient use of education resources. It requires an average of 6.0 years per student to complete the first 5 grades and 12
years to complete the ninth grade.
Teaching Staff
Almost 75 percent of teachers in Pasto have completed preservice training (teacher preparation at the secondary level
and/or university level). However, there is a deficit of teachers in certain teaching disciplines (mathematics and science in
particular). In-service teacher training has not been done systematically, and its classroom application is negligible. Isolated
training courses and irrelevant topics can still provide teachers with escalaf6n credits (option for higher pay). Most of these
credits are obtained in Pasto through distance education correspondence courses.



Pasto Education Project                                                                            Page 8
Curriculum
ntil 1994, curriculum content was designed and programmed centrally in Bogota, the nation's capital, including the
selection, procurement, and delivery of textbooks and other instructional materials. As a result, the content of what was
taught in the classroom was often irrelevant to the realities and needs of the diverse communities in Colombia. Moreover,
the required tools and materials that support effective teaching in the classroom arrived late or not at all. With the adoption
of Law 115/94, some measures aimed at changing this situation were introduced. The current national and local education
policies aim to provide a margin of choice for curriculum content. The basic curriculum areas is to be maintained and
strengthened. However, local governments have the opportunity to add content areas relevant to their socioeconomic and
cultural backgrounds.
School Infrastructure
School infrastructure is insufficient and deteriorating. Almost 40 percent of the 167 public schools of the public institutions
of Pasto have double or triple shifts (morning, afternoon, and nights). Intense use of double and triple shifts explains
coverage rates higher than the national averages for the primary and lower secondary levels. However, low scores in the
ICFES exit exams can be correlated with students in the afternoon and night shifts. Gross school access rates (both private
and public) of the school age population in Pasto are 35.5 percent for preprimary, 93 percent for primary, and 84.2 percent
for secondary levels, respectively. (The public sector provides coverage to 18 percent, 66 percent, and 49 percent for the
three levels, respectively.) A school facility and inventory preparatory study has determined that at least six schools (two at
the preschool level and three at the primary level) will need to be replaced because of safety reasons. Similarly, a
rehabilitation plan calls for various interventions in 44 urban and 92 rural schools ranging from replacement of the sanitary
services to drainage works.
Management of the Sector
According to the Constitution of 1991 and the Laws 60/93 and 115/94, sector management responsibilities at the national
level, include formulating education policies and providing general financing, technical assistance, and national evaluations.
The Department would plan and cofinance education development objectives, manage nationally provided fiscal resources
(the situadofiscal) for municipalities with low capacity, and assist municipalities in managing their own education services.
Teacher training remains a Departmental level responsibility.
The Municipality of Pasto and its townships seek to successfully implement their respective education management
responsibilities. At the municipal level, educational policies are currently executed and managed, local investments alxi
cofinanced, and schools are supported and monitored. With the certificacion process, which transfers fiscal responsibility
for the education sector to the municipality, the municipality will fully assume the responsibilities described for the
Department. At the local level, schools and their communities are entitled to develop and implement their own development
plans and construct complementary course contents specific to their realities.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices
Sector Issues
A recent study of decentralization in Colombia (Decentralizaci6n de los Servicios de Educaci6n en Colombia. DNP 1997)
assesses the present challenges of a decentralization process that started almost 20 years ago. The key issues are local
government management, school autonomy, and the reform of the current system of allocation of fiscal resources.
At the National Level
The Project of the Municipality of Pasto, as a national pilot to provide lessons for a countrywide decentralization
strengthening strategy, would be instrumental in testing mechanisms to build the capacity of municipalities to manage the
education sector and provide schools with the autonomy and capacity to plan, implement, and evaluate their own education
development efforts. This investment, thus, serves two major purposes: (i) a full-fledged development intervention in Pasto,
a municipality providing crucial investments to address Pasto's needs for good education, access, efficiency, and
organization; and (ii) a pilot operation for Colombia, the country.
At the Municipal Level. The specific sector issues are: (i) institutional strengthening of the management capacity of
municipal level education offices, and strengthening of the SEM in its new role as strategic planner, advisor, and facilitator



Pasto Education Project                                                                            Page 9
with the goal of improving municipal collection and analysis of education statistics, and promoting education reformms and
positive behavioral and attitudinal change through a municipal-wide information, education and communication campaign;
and (ii) increasing coverage (mainly at the preschool and lower-secondary level).
At the School/Network Level: The value added of the Pasto project, in regards to school autonomy, is piloting a school
network strategy that would provide a stronger foundation for school autonomy in urban and rural settings. The specific
sector issues addressed include: (i) increasing community participation in school activities and vice-versa (i.e., schools more
involved in community events); (ii) improving the skills of administrative and teaching staff, and (iii) providing financing
for self-identified improvements in pedagogical innovation, teacher training, school infrastructure, maintenance and
instructional materials.
Strategic Choices
The project design process considered three key strategic choices: (i) national versus local responsibility for project design,
financing and implementation; (ii) centralized (at the municipal level) versus decentralized (schools/communities) decision
making; and (iii) low (information sharing and consultation) versus high (self-management and decision control)
participatory approaches.
National versus Local Projects
Projects to support local govermnents have been implemented in the past by central institutions. However, centralized
channels have proved to be overly bureaucratic and inefficient. Top-down mechanisms from the central government diluted
the expected impact of investments creating a sense of frustration at the Departamental and municipal levels, the ultitnate
beneficiaries. The altemative considered, working directly with approved decentralized local governments to finance and
prepare projects on a pilot basis, was preferred, since this approach provided the opportunity to implement a strategy that
aims at enhancing responsiveness, client orientation, and innovation.
Municipal versus Community decisionMaking and Project Management
The choices for decisionnaking vacillated between: (i) having the SEM autonomously assess sectoral needs and identify the
specific interventions of the Project; and (ii) giving a degree of responsibility to the school and community levels in
managing their own specific project outputs and services and final allocation of resources. In line with the objective of
strengthening the municipal institutions and, at the same time, enhancing conmmunity based management of schools, the
Project opted for the latter alternative.
Low versus High Participatory Approach
Change management experiences within organizations and larger systems have shown that successful reforms are correlated
to high participation of local stakeholders, managers and staff in planning, decisionmaking, implementation, and evaluation
of their own initiatives and activities. Additionally, a successful change management effort must provide the needed
financial resources to promote innovation, team-building, and knowledge building. Promotion and implementation of
changes in management policy and procedures must be accompanied by direct access to resources. Participation has been
key to project preparation. However, there were still choices as to the level of participation expected of schools and
communities for both preparation and for implementation. In deciding whether the emphasis would be put on: (i)
information sharing and consultation (surveys, focus groups, public notices, town meetings, and incorporation of opinions);
or (ii) collaboration and empowerment (self-management, decisionmaking on type of investments, and use of resourccs and
capacity building), the latter choice was selected, for the more long-term results.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
School-Level Educational Inputs
Alternative Rejected:
. All Project activities and interventions identified and managed by the Municipal Education Secretary -- SEM.
This alternative was rejected because it was not congruent with the capacity building objectives of the
municipal educational policies nor of the project.
Alternative Selected:



Pasto Education Project                                                                          Page 10
Creating and capitalizing on a Fund for the Redes, which will finance demand-based subprojects. The demand-
based Fund will provide a flexible mechanism to finance investment needs as they arise during the reform
period. Moreover, commitment and community responsibility will be created by empowering schools and
communities to manage their own resources and implement their own projects. Community-based monitoring
and transparent procedures will minimize risks of misuse of funds and inefficiencies. Only the most urgent
activities that address Basic Unattended Education Needs (NEBIs) will be managed directly by the SEM and
used as incentives for the creation of the School Networks (Redes).
Increasing Student Access:
Alternative Rejected
. Access would be increased solely through construction of two large new school buildings under the initiative
and management of the SEM.
Alternative Selected
. Only one school building, currently in construction, would be financed (retroactively) by the project. The
remaining funds would be channeled to the schools to build additional classrooms in existing buildings using a
strategy already tested. The school community will manage hiring the contractors, while the municipal Civil
Work secretariat will provide technical supervision. SEM will pay the contractors selected by the community.
This strategy has yielded good cost-effective results and promotes school management capacity building.
Additionally, some funds will be used to finance contracts with private not-for-profit schools (which will
provide educational services to expand school access) in order to evaluate the effectiveness of such a strategy in
Pasto.
Private schools as members of the Red/Network:
Alternative rejected:
* Creation of School Networks among public and private schools. The creation of School Networks (Redes)
among public and private schools was rejected, since the Project is targeting the public sector, which serves the
communities most in need, and because of the operational difficulties in implementing PDRs with private
schools.
Alternative selected:
. Private schools will be involved in the various learning and exchange activities organized by the Redes (i.e.,
conferences or seminars), but will not benefit directly from the investmnent funds, which finance the subprojects
part of the PDRs.
Project management and implementation:
Alternative rejected:
. The creation of a Project Implementation Unit to manage the Project was rejected because of Colombia's poor
experience with project implementation units. These units become isolated and overcontrolling, and the project
is hardly incorporated into the day-to-day operations of the executing agencies. Resistance and mistrust are felt
by staff who are not participating in project implementation and, thus, capacity-building in public agencies is
not achieved.
Alternative selected.
* Since project design introduces capacity-building investments not for large management reforms, but for the
specific roles and resources needed in SEM to mange the project, the project preparation team decided to rely
instead on the internal structure of SEM and the Network to self-manage and coordinate the project.
Strengthening the staff and management systems necessary to manage the project is expected to contribute to
overall management efficiency. A small administrative team will specifically support the added administration
needs of managing a World Bank-provided loan (e.g., reporting, accounting, Bank procurement methods). All
other management and technical assistance will be provided by the respective division of SEM and the School
Network

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Based on the Bank's experience in financing social sector projects in Colombia, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC),
and in other regions, critical success factors are:
i) decentralization projects should not provide solely technical assistance to strengthen the legislative and
structural frameworks of education systems;
ii) Decentralization investrnents should systematically address strengthening of (i) the organization and structure
of the education system, (ii) management change and human resources, and (iii) identification and solution of
conflict of interest across levels and key stakeholders;
iii) Centrally prepared and managed decentralization investments (maintaining political and fiscal controls) are not
conducive to flexibility, management capacity building and local decisionmaking;
iv) Strong local participation is critical for all stages of local government and school subprojects (e.g., promotion,
management of resources, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation);



Pasto Education Project                                                                        Page 12
v) Political support and commitment to the goals and the participatory process of the project should be promoted
at all levels of the Government (political leaders, technocrats, and administrators);
vi) Collaboration among public, private and volunteer sectors is critical to ensure complementary objectives
vii) School and community subproject designs should be technically simple and with well-defined appraisal criteria
and transparent allocation of resources;
viii)There should be choice of suppliers for provision of goods, services, and technical assistance (e.g., public
agencies, NGOs, communities, pro bono support, voluntarism); and
ix) Regular and frequent financial and technical audits should complement evaluation of physical progress
(quantity and quality).
The Bank's operations in Colombia in the past reveal:
* Bank-financed education projects in Colombia, albeit emphasizing decentralization and capacity-building of local
governments, have been fully designed and managed in the nation's capital. During project implementation, capacity
building programs, financing mechanisms, and monitoring procedures continued to emphasize central controls.
• Departmental and municipal governments have not been entrusted fully with financial resources and decision making
autonomy. As a result, local govermment capacity remained weak or untapped.
Unshared Vision of the Decentralization Process
* A shared vision (i.e., no agreement on goals, roles, and functions; conflicts and power issues not resolved; and lack of
representation and voice of local stakeholders) of the decentralized system had not been consolidated.
.  At the central level, the MOE investments in technical assistance and training were used without a clear understanding
of the new role, objectives, and services to be provided by the MOE within a decentralized framework. At the regional
level, capacity building interventions were carried out in isolation, with limited resources and power to plan, manage,
and implement educational programs. Traditional training and technical assistance programs provided local government
with fixed packages of services as preconditions and prerequisites for any financial assistance.
Lessons From Unsatisfactory IBRD-Financed Education Projects
* Specifically, the IBRD-financed Secondary Education Project has experienced major implementation problems. The
key implementing agencies have been the MOE and other central institutions such as the Social Investment Funds
(Fondos de Inversi6n Social, FIS). These institutions are distant from local governments but still guaranteed
themselves a major role in the provision of resources, training and technical assistance to the regions. Preparing a
project centrally implied a highly complex administrative system with decision power remaining in the capital. For
instance, the National Cofinancing System, the financial instrument designed to transfer resources from the national
budget to local governments, has been ineffective in allocating and disbursing funds in a timely manner. The amount
and type of financing was controlled centrally by yearly national allocations (usually released very late in the
implementing fiscal year) to each municipality without input from local governments.
Impact of Decentralized Pilots
• Government and Bank agreement to work, on a pilot basis, with completely autonomous local governments was the
outcome of a year-long negotiation propelled by a seemingly frustrating dead end with centrally designed and
implemented projects. Even at the design stage, the decentralized projects are providing lessons for present adjustments,
in design and procedures, of the Bank's ongoing education portfolio. Consequently, the Government and the Bank are
discussing the key elements necessary to restructure the Secondary Education Project. The Government has also
initiated discussions on dismantling the FIS.
. Direct operations and financing of local governments' projects provides an opportunity to assess the benefits of
removing rigid budgetary procedures and central control layers. Concurrently, there have been important changes in the
policy and institutional framework: (i) higher priority by the Government of implementing successfully the
decentralization strategy, even if it implies loss of control and functions at the central level; (ii) emphasizing school
autonomy as crucial to the decentralization strategy, and (ii) reducing budgetary controls of funding to municipalities



Pasto Education Project                                                                        Page 13
and school, including block (as oppose to line item) financing. The Government has continued with its broad-based
participatory process for the development of School Education Projects (Proyectos Educativos Institucionales, PEIs),
to foster autonomy and accountability in their execution. Moreover, school-based planning will be complemented with a
serious effort to transfer funds to schools to implement their plans (a missing element in the past).
Articulated Education Portfolio Strategy
*  Various studies in capacity building at the local level have shown that capacity is best achieved by doing and learning,
and by allowing local stakeholders to identify their own weak areas and strengths and, then, to define the type of
technical support, skill, and knowledge required. Thus, the Government sees the three education operations (the
restructured Secondary Education Project, Antioquia Department Education Project, and Pasto Municipality Education
Project) as an articulated learning strategy to support the decentralized management of education investments and
guarantee the highest impact.
* The restructured Secondary Education Project will provide learning on a nationwide investment programs still
coordinated by the central Ministry of Education in the Capital, but with strengthened mechanisms to provide the
required decisionmaking and controls at the local levels. Antioquia Education Project will provide the same investment
coordination experience but from the Departmental level. Pasto Education Project will be a case study of how
municipalities can plan, manage and implement their own investment operations. A proposed second phase of these
three operations is expected to incorporate the wealth of knowledge to be generated into a more effective and efficient
system of investrnent operations in the social sector, especially those financed with loans from multilateral and
development banks.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
•  Project preparation was led locally with full consideration for quality at entry elements, albeit restricted by limited
funds and first-time experience working with the World Bank.
. The national Government requested Bank support for these operations in various forums including the discussion of the
CAS. It also expedited loan guarantee procedures.
.  Full central commitmnent to and support of the decentralized projects, including the establishment of fully coordinated
technical assistance between central institutions and the municipal government, in such critical areas as process and
impact evaluation and dissemination of lessons learned.
*  Broad participation of stakeholders in project preparation and implementation design.
*  Initial municipal financing of project preparation, in lieu of national or loan advanced funds.
.  Extensive media coverage of project objectives and educational investments.
12. Value added of Bank support:
*  The Bank's new team approach contributed to a cohesive and integrated assistance strategy for Colombia. It has
supported a shared vision of the decentralization process by: (i) participatorily developing the CAS (which provided a
forum where top stakeholders identified as high priority local government and school/community control of education
investments); (ii) conducting Economic Development Institute (EDI) workshops to facilitate the identification of
interinstitutional conflicts risen from decentralization and identification of tools/strategies to resolve them; (ii) inviting
Colombia and regional governments to participate in EDI's decentralization study tour to New Zealand and Australia;
(iii) support of the Human Development Department (HDD) in the preparation of the education technology investments
and collection of international experiences on information, education, and communication campaigns; and (iv) an
committing to the ongoing documentation of project preparation experience at the local levels and of nationwide
education reforms. In addition:
* The Bank assisted the Government of Colombia (GOC) in preparing a study of the status of decentralization
implementation in Colombia (Local Government Capacity Building -- Beyond Technical Assistance), which served as
a critical input for the design of the project;
*  The Bank participation has served as a catalyst in the country to test different strategies to implement successfully
Colombia's decentralization and participation policies;
.  The Bank has accumulated much experience in the recent pass on how to prepare and implement projects with

extensive participation and local decisionmaking;
* The Bank's involvement in the project is expected to provide lessons for other national and international development
agencies; and
.  The decentralized projects would complement the other major activities in the social sector, including the Secondary
Education Project, the Primary Education Project and the Magdalena Medio Project.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 9)
13. Economic Assessment  ]    Cost-Benefit Analysis:            [x]  Cost Effectiveness   [  Other
(see Annex 4)                 NPV=US$    million; ERR=  %            Analysis:               [Specify]
The justification for public investments in education is guided by the following considerations (i) the social rates of return to
education; (ii) the impact on the poor; and (iii) the effectiveness of education inputs on learning outcomes.
Research has consistently found that investments in all levels of education are profitable, and that the rates of return to
society is highest in primary education. Also, studies from international experiences suggest that investment in basic
education (primary and lower secondary) is likely to be more efficient and equitable than investment in higher education.
The overall distribution impact shows that public education expenditures benefit low income households relatively more
than other income groups mainly because of the poor's high participation rates in primary and lower secondary education.
Finally, guided by a wealth of research, the project emphasizes those investments in educational inputs that are known to be
effective in promoting student learning (see Annex 4).
The criteria used to guide the choice between different project designs to achieve the development objectives were based on
least cost analysis in addition to (i) stakeholder consultations and participatory decision-making; (ii) lessons learned from
previous project designs and from a study tour to countries with effective decentralization reforms; and (iii) institutional
capacity.
Two major altematives for which the least cost estimate criterion was a decisive element (for other project design choices
see Block 2, section 8) were: (i) a cost-effectiveness comparison of increasing school access by construction of new
schools, and enlarging existing schools and contracting with non-profit NGOs for the provision of services in urban areas;
and (ii) a cost-saving analysis iustifying the creation of School Networks for the provision of various services (e.g. a
hypothetical case of using the networks to provide computer labs to be shared among a number of schools was contrasted
with the situation of each school developing a lab on their own).
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)        NPVUS$             million; FRR 
Historical and expected trends in Pasto's GNP, education budget, and expenditures have been assessed. These figures have
been compared to expected fiscal needs of project investments and recurrent costs. This analysis showed that project impact
on municipal education budget is manageable. Over the life of the project, real incremental recurrent costs are estimated to
grow from 1996 PS 71 million in the first project year to a total of 1996 PS 4,480 million in the last year. Project recurrent
costs as a percentage of education expenditures would average 2.4% during the life of the project. Recurrent costs plus
counterpart funds would grow from 1996 PS 672 in the first project year to a total of 1996 PS 9,373 in the last year.
These total costs as percent of education expenditure would rise from 2.1% in 1997 to an average of 5.0% in 2001. The
total municipal recurrent costs plus counterpart funds would absorb 2.9% of the aggregate budget increase during the 1997-
2001 period. After project completion, the yearly average incremental recurrent costs at the municipal level generated by the
project would account for about 0.64% of the municipal budget for the education sector.
Also, a full indebtedness study was done prior to project preparation and was up-dated, together with the fiscal impact
analysis, prior to the national Government approval of its guarantee to the loan. Fiscal viability and indebtedness capacity
were two of the conditions to the provision of Govermment's guarantee to this regional operation.



Pasto Education Project                                                                           Page 15
15. Technical Assessment:
The project takes in consideration the context of the current educational system in Colombia and in Pasto and the national
and local governments' sector strategies. The SEM will maintain a qualified technical staff to manage project
implementation as agreed by the Bank. Technical standards were developed to guide the planning and implementation of the
subprojects of the School Networks and are described in the Operational Manual.
16. Institutional Assessment:
The level of existing institutional capacity, as summarized below, is acceptable for project implementation.
However, ample technical assistance and close supervision will be needed to further strengthen the capacity,
especially during the initial phase of implementation.
a) Executing agencies:
The Pasto Education Project differs from other operations traditionally managed by the Bank in Colombia. Its execution
occurs in a decentralized scenario, with a closer proximity between the government level (the Municipality) and the people
who benefit (the schools and communities), who are directly involved in project execution through the School Networks.
In order to have a clear vision of the present institutional arrangements, and to influence a better setting for the execution of
the project, the institutions involved need to be considered, as well as their roles and their feasibility as managers of the
different components of the project.
The Schools. The new Colombian Education Policy (Law 115) confers increased responsibilities to schools. Schools may
design their own technical/pedagogical strategies, undertake the administration and financial management of school
improvement investments (through their own Institutional Education Projects -- PEIs) and establish school accounts
(Fondos Servicio Docentes). However, with some exceptions, few schools/communities in Pasto and in the country have
produced quality PEIs. Lessons learned demonstrate that emphasis should be on strengthening institutional leaders (school
principals, staff and teachers), as well as encouraging the participation of school parents in all aspects of project planning,
and its financial systems, as well as community monitoring and control. Project interventions, particularly with the
development of the School Networks, aim at achieving higher commitment and management participation on the part of
school and community actors.
The Community: Community participation in school activities has increased over the years. Pasto has promoted community
participation through the Municipal Education Plan Humanesimo, Saber y Productividad. During the activity, the
community was made responsible for the execution of many of the school development initiatives that benefited the quality
of education, such as improvements in school infrastructure, school safety and community fund-raising events. Such direct
involvement guarantees greater community ownership of services and greater civilian oversight of education investments.
The Municipal Government: The current administration of Pasto has made it clear that education is one of its top priorities.
The Municipal Development Plan (Todo por Pasto) pledges 25 percent of the investment budget of the municipality to
education. The SEM is in the process of complying with the requirements for assuming complete autonomous responsibility
for the fiscal management of education through the process called "certification" Through this process it assumes fuli
responsibility for: (i) the planning and management of the educational sector; (ii) the organization of educational processes;
(iii) the execution of educational services at the municipal level; and (iv) the evaluation of the educational sector. Thus, it is
putting in place the necessary organizational structure and qualified staff. However, a preliminary analysis carried out
during project preparation indicates that strengthening is needed in the sector's evaluation processes, as well as in
information systems, to allow for a timely and appropriate decisionmaking process. The Project will sponsor a
comprehensive analysis to better rationalize SEM's administrative functions and provide recommendations for
improvements in structure, staffing and procedures. The Project will also provide technical assistance and advice to support
the strengthening of the planning, managing and monitorig capacity of the SEM.

The National Government: The national government, including the Ministries for Planning - Departamento Nacional de
Planeacion (DNP), Finance and Education, provides active support to the two (Pasto and Antioquia) territorial. The
provision of direct multilateral development loans as a tool to promote decentralization is a positive aspect for the execution
of the project. Still, many national policies will affect the life of the project. During project implementation, coordination
efforts will take place between the central government and the Municipality of Pasto to readily adopt/adapt any national
policies affecting the project.
b) Project Management:
The capacity of all executing agencies (see Block 4 -- Institutional and Implementation Arrangements) has been assessed.
Existing staff at the municipal level is qualified. Additional skills and competencies at the municipal and school levels either
would be developed through training or contracted through additional staff or technical assistance.
17. Social Assessment:
Stakeholder Analysis
The identification of key stakeholders, the importance of their stake, and the participation expected from each was
conducted by the project preparation team from the earliest stages of Project preparation. Social actors identified tnrough
this process include all of those who are relevant within the formal educational system and those that are part of the larger
educational community defined by the General Education Law, e.g., students, parents and leaders of community
organizations. A small group within the preparation team was formed to develop a participation plan for preparation and
implementation. However, the entire preparation team formed by staff with significant representation of various units of the
Secretary of Education as well as representatives of the Secretaries of Finance and Planning was itself a good example of
participatory planning. (see block 19 for a description of the Participatory Approach)
Project Social Impact
A very positive social impact is expected as a consequence of Project outputs such as: (i) increased coverage and better
quality of the educational services and (ii) strengthened capacity of parents associations, schools governments, school
boards and local educational authorities to manage the educational services under their responsibility. These will translate
into better understanding of educational processes, greater control over teacher's performance and compliance with
responsibilities, community lobbying for resources with local, regional or national governments to expand the use of J'ondos
Docentes. Finally, a greater involvement of communities and school governments in the management of the educational
system will increase the ability of local communities to demand and provide for good educational services.
18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental         [ ] A    [] B   [X]  C
Category
Under the existing educational investments, no one poses an environmental risk. Additional school places will be prov-ded
mainly by expansion of existing schools (construction or substitution of classrooms) and contracting of some school places
in private, nonprofit schools. Accessing new land and relocation of possible squatters are unlikely. The financing of
investments to improve school sanitation facilities is expected to have a positive impact on the environment.
The Municipality of Pasto does not have a specific indigenous population. The Department, however, does have some
indigenous populations protected by special territorial rights. These populations are outside the jurisdiction of the
municipality of Pasto; and thus will not participate as part of the project. The Bank is presently discussing the possibil ity of
a Rural Education Project (perhaps for FY 99), which may address the needs of indigenous communities.
19. Participatory Approach:
Preparation: The focus of the participation plan for preparation was to obtain the views of people on quality of education
and expectations with respect to the kind of support desired to improve education in their municipalities. The plan required



Pasto Education Project                                                                           Page 17
the continuous involvement of members of the preparation team to assure that the findings of the consultation were taken
into consideration in the design of the project. Information sharing and consultation activities were carried out with
educational communities of the informal networks underway (Annex 2). These participatory activities involved mainly
education cluster directors, school directors, teachers and community leaders. It is of relevance to note, that the development
of the networks building on those that have started informally is itself a significant sign of the way in which the project relies
on and takes into consideration the views and the inputs of relevant stakeholders.
The level of stakeholders' involvement in project preparation was as follows: (i) information sharing, consultation and joint
decision making within the formal sector, (ii) information sharing and consultation with teachers, parents, students and
community leaders as expected beneficiaries.
Implementation: the project makes participation one of its objectives. The education network concept promotes itself a
participatory process in both the formation- and the development of the network. The first phase of network formation
(Annex 2) takes an approach of "animacion y sensibilizaci6n" which is a process that requires increased involvement and
commitment of relevant stakeholder. The network development phase formalizes a structure with ample representation of
key educational actors, namely, teachers, students, parents, municipal authorities and community organizations.
Furthermore, the Project not only proposes to activate the formal mechanisms created by the education law, but it
incorporates specific mechanisms to guarantee a broad base stakeholder involvement, such as the assembly of the network
and the oversight and social control committees (veedurias ciudadanas). The successful creation and performance of these
committees will provide a good example for the rest of the country. The expected participation during implementation
requires joint decisionmaking and self-management of members of the educational community, with specific activities and
instruments for each.

20. Sustainability:
Fiscal Sustainability is discussed in Block 14 and Annex 5.
Sustainability of the School Networks/ Redes is ensured through:
a) High degree of participation in their design;
b) Concept of school network and spontaneous practice of it were developed in Pasto previously to Project
identification;
c) The Redes help building school administrative capacity, in the framework of national politics aimed at transferring
increased financial management power to the schools;
d) The Redes produce benefits (shared knowledge, experience and school infrastructure and a complete basic
education cycle) even with very low investment plans; and
e) Loan proceeds to finance the PDRs are disbursed on a declining basis with the Borrower assuming more
responsibility towards the end of the Project.
Sustainability of the subprojects generated by the Redes is ensured through:
High degree of participation in community project identification, preparation, appraisal, contracting and
a) supervision;
b) Ownership by the beneficiaries, as evidenced by community in-kind counterpart funding;
c) Appraisal criteria which require community support; and
d) Community based evaluation of the results of the subprojects and use of funds.

Sustainability of the overall project is ensured through:
a) High degree of participation of SEM staff in the preparation and implementation of the project;
b) High support of the project by the national and municipal level governments;
c)  High degree of participation of education stakeholders in project identification, preparation, appraisal, contracting
and supervision;
d) Implementation of a informnation, education and communication campaign design to rally support for the project and
its objectives; and
Institutional strengthening interventions that focus both on structural/procedural improvements and in team building and
change management.

communication skills.
Teachers Strike             Moderate    Teacher strikes are common occurrences. The direct involvement of
teachers, parents and communities in school network planning and
investments is expected to dissipate any teacher resistance to the project
and promote greater parental demands agamst interrupted school time.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
* Demand by Other Municipalities and Departments Which Can not be Met Directly by the World Bank: As pilot
operations, the Antioquia Education Project and Pasto Education Project will raise expectations of support by other
municipalities and departments. The direct support by the World Bank in each municipality (about 1060) and-or
departments (32) will not be feasible, given economies of scales and time-resources constraints. Thus, a second phase
from this investment expects to establish a national system to assist other municipalities and departments to prepare
Quality at Entry Project proposals, which could be eligible to access multilateral development loans. The two piloL
operations will provide learning on reducing over-bureaucratization and enhancing efficiency of nationwide systems.
The second phase of the national strategy would develop Colombia's own internal mechanisms for project preparation,
technical assistance and channeling multilateral funds for other local governments.
* Indebtedness Capacity: In line with the promotion of local fiscal discipline, a key criteria included for selection of the
participating decentralized projects was financial indebtedness. However, during the preparation period of projects to be
financed by multilateral Banks, Departments and municipalities may seek other credits and loans in private banks and
financial markets. To reduce risk of a deteriorating financial status, the indebtedness study was updated prior to
national approval for the guarantee of the loan and prior to project appraisal. Additionally, the central government
requested a fiscal management plan to guarantee efficient use of revenues, lower operating costs and/or reduced access
to additional debt.
* Political Influence on School-Community Operations: Under fiscal constraints, politicians may tend to see local
investment subprojects as an alternative tool to please their constituencies. The subproject instruments are established in
a very clear and transparent manner; however, it is also possible that some politicians still attempt to exercise their
influence on investment operations. The multilevel communication and ex post evaluation would provide check points to
assess the adequacy, effectiveness and transparency of investments.

PASTO Education Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Components
Project Component 1 -- Basic Unattended Educational Needs (NEBIs) -- US$6.7 million (total cost)
The objective of the component is to provide to public schools of the basic cycle (grade 0-9) a minimal level of
educational materials (classroom libraries, pedagogical support material, and teaching tool kits), teacher training on
the use of these materials, and urgent infrastructure rehabilitation. The financing of these is to be used as an
incentive to schools and comnmunities for the development of the school networks -- Redes -- and is concentrated in
the first two years of project implementation. Resources will be targeted to benefit relatively more the schools and
communities most in need. The activities financed by the component will not duplicate, but rather will integrate
other efforts made at the national and departmental levels (e.g., PACES project) in the areas mentioned above.
Given the urgent nature of the proposed interventions, the implementation of the component will fall under the
direct responsibility of the Project Management Unit of the SEM. The interventions to be financed by the
component were identified by the SEM through preparatory studies, and they will be discussed with each school
community that benefits in order to increase community ownership. In the case of the five pilot Redes, which will be
created during the first phase of implementation, discussions will take place with the governing organizations of the
Redes (Councils)to finalize the scope and quality of the intervention financed by the components in each Red In the
case of the Networks of the second phase, the financing of the NEBIs in the various schools of the future Redes will
be used as a promotional incentive for the creation of the networks, and as an occasion to commit school
communities to the project.
Strengthening of PEIs (Institutional Education Projects)
The General Law of Education (115/1994) identifies the school as the organizational focus of the education sector
and the PEI as the instrument through which the schools can develop new pedagogical, administrative, and
participatory strategies. However, in the practice, and in particular in rural areas, most schools have not developed
the capacity to prepare the detailed plans such as required by the PEIs, especially regarding the pedagogical and
participatory content. This subcomponent will promote the creation in each public school of Pedagogical Circles
(CPIs -- Circulos Pedag6gicos Institucionales), where teacher working groups will meet periodically to discuss
and develop the pedagogical proposals to be included in the PEI and to follow their implementation. Each CPI will
be comprised of about 20 teachers from the same institution working on a specific area of the PEI. Smaller
institutions will join together within their network to form a CPI. Technical assistance will be provided by
contracted NGOs or university staff who will be assisting the CPIs over the long term, and who will evaluate their
activities based on an organizational chart. The project will also finance the printing and distribution of self-training
modules for strengthening the role of the CPIs as catalysts of community participation to the preparation of the
PEIs. The CPI will cluster at the level of the School Network into Circulos Pedagogicos Institucionales de Red
(CPR).
Educational materials
The subcomponent will finance classroom libraries, teaching tool kits, and pedagogical support materials to be
provided to about 1,080 classrooms of the basic cycle, along with teacher training on the use of the materials and
their maintenance. A preparatory study has demonstrated that more than 60 percent of the public schools of the
basic cycle do not have a minimum level of educational materials and teaching aids. Classroom libraries are
practically nonexistent. Packages of materials for each grade have been identified. Basic materials for the learning
development and group activities will be provided for grades 0-3, while teaching tool-kits to promote investigation
and innovation both in teaching and in learning will be provided for grades 4-9. Small classroom libraries wil'



26
support the teaching efforts in grades 0-1 1. Adequate training on the use and maintenance of the materials will
accompany distribution.
School Rehabilitation
The project will give priority to the financing of a rehabilitation program based on a needs analysis completed by an
architectural firm during project preparation. The program will emphasize student safety and sanitation, and will
focus on rural and marginal urban areas. It is expected that an overall total of 136 schools (44 urban and 92 rural)
will benefit from the program. Many of the smaller interventions (e.g., fencing walls) will be completed by the local
communities with materials and equipment provided by the project. The project would also finance the purchase of
5,000 new student desks. The PDRs prepared by the school networks will integrate this subcomponent by financing
school infrastructure and furniture maintenance programs.
Increased School Access
Additionally, the component would finance the expansion of school access through: (i) the substitution of existing
classrooms in serious state of disrepair, (ii) the construction of new classrooms, and (iii) the signing of contracts
with nonprofit private schools. With coverage rates above national levels (35.5 percent for preprimary, 93 percent
for primary and 84.2 percent for secondary levels), the component's objective puts emphasis on increased access to
basic education in the public sector, particularly in existing bottlenecks (grade 0 and 6) to compensate for school
population growth.
T;he first strategy calls for the substitution of seriously depleted schools that may put student safety at risk. A
preparatory study and inventory of school facilities has determined that five small schools of the outer urban area
(two at the preschool level and three at the primary) need to be replaced for safety reasons.
The second strategy is bascd on the construction of a new preprimary and secondary level complex (accommodating
150 and 800 students, respectively) that will be built as the second phase of a plan to open access to a complete
cycle of basic education in a fast growing marginal urban area. The building will complement the primary level
school recently completed with cofinancing from the national Government, Financimiento para el Sector
Agropecuario (FINDETER). During the appraisal mission, the Bank team reviewed the selection procedures
adopted in the selection of the contractors for the construction and found them satisfactory. It was agreed, therefore,
that the cost of this activity was to be financed retroactively once loan effectiveness was achieved.
Additionally, school access will be expanded to a total of 75 classrooms in preschool and primary level institutions
through a third strategy already proved to be cost-effective in Pasto. In the case of these technically simple
classroom extensions, the municipality transfers the amount of money (under a standard legal agreement) for
materials and construction services to a school account (Fondo de Servicios Docentes). The school community
contracts out the construction services directly. Often it is the same community that completes the work. Technical
analysis and supervision is provided by the Civil Works Secretariat of the municipality. Through this strategy, 85
lower-cycle classrooms were completed at an average cost of US$7,500 per classroom with a capacity of about 30
children in the last three years.
Project Component 2 -- Institutional Strengthening -- US$2.4 million (total cost)
This component would: (i) strengthen the capacity of the SEM to coordinate the project, and at the same time
strengthen both its managerial and its advisory roles in the promotion of the educational network; (ii) promote the
consolidation of an efficient Education Information System as a management tool; and (iii) strengthen the
administrative capacity of the various actors who will comanage the networks (i.e., the principals, teachers,
students and parents of the School Self-Government Associations, the directors of the Nucleos, and the members of
the Councils of the Redes). Specific institutional building interventions include technical assistance, workshops,
studies, and training activities, in addition to office improvements and equipment upgrading.
Possible technical assistance and training directed at the SEM Staff and the comanagers of the networks include:
strategic planning, organizational management, monitoring and evaluation, financial management, school



27
management, appraisal methods (e.g., social, technical, institutional, economic, financial, environmental), conflict
resolution, and community participation. The training for the comanagers will take place parallel to the process of
organizing the Councils of the networks.
As an overall information, education and communication (IEC) strategy, the project will finance promotional
activities, community participation programs, participatory monitoring, and dissemination of project outcomes.
Project Component 3 -- Redes - School Networks -- US$2.9 million (total cost)
The idea of the school networks in Pasto was developed by the SEM on the basis of what a number of schools and
communities had spontaneously begun doing in practice. Faced with institutional and financial weaknesses, some
educational communities of the area had started operating as networks, sharing information, pedagogical
innovations, and the use of physical plants, exchanging teachers, and organizing collective teacher training or
recreational events. On the basis of these positive experiences, along with visits to Ecuador where the concept of
school networks is applied at the national level, the Red became the main method of the SEM to involve the
community in the management of the education sector in Pasto.
The component will finance training, and promotional and institutional development activities aimed at creating 12
School Networks on the territory of the municipality. Additionally, the component will finance the Development
Plans (Planes de Desarrollo de Red - PDRs) prepared by the networks with the participation of teachers, school
governments, students, and parents associations. These subprojects would be demand-driven, with the support of
promotional and technical assistance to help develop institutional capacity as needed. The PDRs are intended to
address objectives related to school improvements, pedagogical innovations, school management, and community
participation.
Each Network (Red Educativa) would be comprised of about 15 public schools across the complete grade cycle (0-
11). The schools of the Networks were identified on the basis of their contiguity and the socioeconomic
homogeneity of their territories. The expected benefits of this strategy include the strengthening of the educational
community within the schools of a network through interaction, self-training, and the exchange of pedagogical
experiences and innovations, as well as increased parent and private sector participation. The availability of a
complete basic education cycle for the students of the networks will also be assured.
Development of the Redes
Three stages of development are envisaged for the formation of the Networks: organization, development, and
maturity (see Table 2 below). The first phase includes all the training, technical assistance, and information
activities of the various actors of the future networks, coordinated by the SEM and representatives of the future
networks. The objective of these activities is to promote the idea of the networks, inform the community of the
implications of the project, and finally, train the delegates from the various associations (i.e., school governments,
parents, students, teachers and principles, and directors of nuicleos). These delegates will make up the Network
Assembly, which will then elect an  I-member Council. The Council will serve as the executive organ in charge of
coordinating the activities of the network. It will elect a chairman, Coordinador de Red, who will serve as the legal
representative of the network. (All the electoral criteria and procedures are detailed in the Operational Manual.) The
Assembly, which is organized into three commissions, will assist the Council. These commissions (Participation,
Education Management, and Pedagogy) reflect the thematic areas of analysis of the PEIs and the PDRs.
The second phase consists of the legalization of the network and its elected officials, the identification of the Leader
School, the preparation of the PDR, and its approval by the SEM. An official act of the SEM will sanction the
formation of each network, after elections of the Council and selection of the Leader School for the network. The
Leader School will provide the site for the Council's meetings. The municipality through the SEM, will open a
special bank account in each Red (Red account) into which it will transfer funds for to operate the network and
finance the PDRs. An administrative act (Resoluci6n Administrativa) of the mayor of Pasto will regulate the
transfer and use of funds of the network and delegate to the chairman of the council the management of these funds.
Under the leadership of the Council, the schools/communities of the network will prepare a PDR according to pre-



28
established guidelines part of the Operational Manuals. A committee of the SEM will evaluate the quality of the
plan and its eligibility in accordance with the guidelines. Technical assistance will be provided by the project in this
phase to assist the networks in the preparation of the PDRs.
Finally, the third phase includes the financing of the annual implementation plans of the PDRs and an evaluation of
the impact on five pilot networks (two urban and three rural) where school networks already spontaneously
operated. The networks will then be expanded to include seven additional Redes.
PDRs
PDRs are triennial development plans prepared and implemented through annual implementation programs by the
Redes. It is expected that during the project's life, the five pilot networks will implement PDRs for a maximum of
four years, while the remaining eight will implement them for a maximum of three years. Each PDR and relative
Annual Implementation Plans (POAs) will be evaluated by a committee of the SEM to assure quality and
conformnity to project objectives and guidelines. A ceiling to the financing for each network is going to be set on the
basis of a formula that weights differently rural and urban areas and the size of the schools of the network.
Networks attending more student and rural areas will receive comparatively more funds per student.
The table below illustrates examples of eligible expenditures and quality criteria for the financing of the
PDRs.

Structure of the Redes
A council will be the executive organ in charge of the Red for three years. The council will lead the process of
preparation of the PDRs, negotiate the financing of the PDR with the SEM, and be responsible for the
implementation of the annual plans and the management of the Red account where the funds of the project will be
transferred. The council is assisted in its functions by three commissions: participation, management, and
pedagogy.

Economic Principles that Guide Project Design
JUSTIFICATION FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT
The justification for public investments is guided by the following considerations (i) the social rates of return to education;
(ii) the impact on the poor; and (iv) the effectiveness of inputs on learning outcomes.
Social Rates of Return to Education
Research has consistently found that investments in all levels of education are profitable, and that the rates of return to
society is highest in primary education. In Colombia, the social rates of return to primary education were about 20%, that
to secondary education, about 11.4%, and that to university education, about 14%. These rates of return are higher than the
cost of capital, thereby making investments in education justifiable on economic grounds. (See Table below on Latin
America for comparison). Therefore, there is strong evidence that this project which supports public investments in basic
education, would yield benefits to Colombian society.

Impact on the Poor
Studies from international experiences suggest that investment in basic education (primary and lower secondary) is
likely to be more efficient and equitable than investment in higher education.' The World Bank Country Study,
Poverty in Colombia (1994) confirmed that in 1992 the poorest 20 % of households received 39 % of total
subsidies, an amount 9 times that received by the richest 20 %. At the secondary level, because the poorest
quintile had low enrollment and resided mostly in rural areas, the second and third quintiles benefited the most.
Nevertheless, the first 3 quintiles benefit more from public spending in secondary education than the last 2
quintiles. The situation was reverse in higher education, because enrollment in higher education was concentrated
in the fourth and the fifth quintiles. (See Table below).

The overall distribution impact shows that public education expenditures benefit low income households relatively more
than other income groups mainly because of the poor's high participation rates in primary and lower secondary education
(See the following Table). In 1992, households in the poorest quintile accounted for 23 % of all subsidies. However,
because the poor tends to have larger families, the distribution of per capita subsidies is neutral. It is also evident that
because enrollment ratios at different levels of education differed by quintile, poor students benefited less at the higher level.

For the above mentioned reasons, the two decentralized projects in Pasto and Antioquia, Colombia, are targeting poorer
populations. Among the poor in Basic Education in the two regions, above 90% of them attend public schools.
Effectiveness of Educational Inputs
Guided by a wealth of research, the project emphasizes those investments in educational inputs that are known to be
effective in promoting student learning. These investments include: (i) provision of instructional materials and facilities; (ii)
increasing the opportunity to learn through increasing instructional time and homework; (iii) provision of teacher training;
(iv) increasing teachers' salaries; (v) and reducing class size. The following graph provides a summary of the percent of
studies showing differential positive effects of investments on learning. The Project focuses particularly on the provision of
instructional materials and facilities (NEBIs) and on increasing teachers' knowledge and sharing of pedagogical experiences
through the CPI of the Redes.

CRITERIA FOR PROJECT DESIGN
Tlhe criteria used to guide the choice between different project designs to achieve the development objectives were based on
least cost analysis in addition to (i) stakeholder consultations and participatory decision-making; (ii) lessons learned from
previous project designs and from a study tour to countries with effective decentralization refonms; and (iii) institutional
capacity.
A~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Colombian firm assisted the Pasto preparation teamn with the economic analysis of alternatives in project design.2
Least-cost analysis forTned the basis for some of the strategic decision described in Block 2, section 8. Here we present a
svnthesis of the major outcomc of the analysis performed in relation to two important areas of project design. The detailed
analysis is available in the Project files,
School Coverage
Six different strategic alternatives were examined: (i) no expansion of the system, (ii) optimization of the use of existing
facilities, (iii) restructuring the existing infrastructure, (iv) expansion of existing schools, (v) contracts with private schools
to provi'de education service, and (vi) construction of new schools. All this alternatives were compared with the national
average cost per student and per classroom for each strategy'. The alternative strategies were then compared to cach other
in order to achieve the objective of the Project in the least costly way. The planned interventions are described in Annex 2.
The analysis provided the justification for eliminating choices i and ii. The first for the higi. social cost that would
produce, and the second as impracticable since most of the school in Pasto already operate on two if not three daily shifts,
and there are very limited possibilities of optimizing the use of both public and private facilities. Although, many school
buildings are dilapidated, option iii proved to be cost effective only when it addressed minor reparation of ordinary
maintenance and/or some specific critical conditions for the welfare of the students, such as the presence of functional
sanitary facilities. In many cases, the cost associated with the restoration of very dilapidated schools did not compare well

3 It was asssumed that each classroom will have a life of 25 years and a capacity of 30 student, more stringent than the planned 38
student per class of the Project. The national figures used for comparison were those calculated by the Mision Social of the
National Planning Department

with the costs of entirely substituting such schools. Finally, the construction of new classrooms with the involvement of the
school community in the selection of the contractor and management of funds proved to be the least costly way of providing
quality school places. Through this strategy, 85 lower-cycle classrooms, with a capacity of about thirty children, were
completed in the last three years at an average cost of US$7,500 per classroom, with a cost per student, 16.7 % lower than
the national average.
The possibility of providing public school places through contracts with private not-for-profit institutions has never been
tested in Pasto. The economic analysis demonstrated how the cost per student of this option in Pasto would be 14%
cheaper than the national average. This strategy has proven to be effective in other regions of Colombia (e.g. Antioquia).
However, given the inexperience of the SEM with this contracts and the lack of clear data on student achievement and
quality of education of these private institutions, it was decided to pilot this strategy (780 contracts over 4 years) to evaluate
its effectiveness in Pasto.
Cost-Saving Analysis Justifying The Creation Of Reeds For The Provision Of Various Services. A key development
objective of the project, proposed and agreed upon by a large representation of education stakeholders in Pasto, is to
"develop a medium/long term strategy supporting and financing the development of Educational Networks (Redes
Educativas) and the implementation of their education improvement plans." Thus the selection of a school network design
was in part supported by a cost saving analysis of provision of educational services by either single schools or through
educational networks.
'he hypothetical case analyzed using the networks to provide computer labs to be shared among a number of adjacent
schools. This option was compared with a) each school with at least a lab and b) only the schools with a student
population that would use at least 50% of the lab capacity with labs.   Construction, usage and maintenance costs and
classroom sub-utilization were compared using as a model an hypothetical Red of four schools with respectively 210, 360,
900 and 1,500 students each. Each computer lab could be used at maximum capacity by 20 classes of 30 students each and
could be build and equipped at a cost of PS (1 996) 47 million. A snap shot of the results is provided below.

The cost-saving analysis supports the idea that there are economies of scale to be exploited with the creation of the school
networks. The planning of shared lab facilities (but the same methodology could be applied to sport facilities, training
events etc.) and the optimal use of them within the Red proved to be the most advantageous strategy in the case study.

Public Expenditure on Education and Fiscal Sustainability
Public Expenditure on Education
After the enactment of Law 60 of 1993, which stipulates for municipalities to assume the responsibilities for social service
delivery and for fiscal transfer to support their new duties, Pasto has been managing its own education expenditure since
1994. Fiscal transfer from the central government come in the forms of (i) Situado Fiscal (mostly to pay for the salaries of
teachers and administrators within the national system); (ii) the ICN (mostly for capital investment in education, but also in
part to pay for salaries of teachers hired at the municipal level, and in part to pay for co-financing projects); (iii) FIS to pay
for counterpart funds for co-financing with the central governiment. In addition, Pasto uses its own revenue to pay for its
own education administration and for some general expenditures.
As can be seen from Table 1, Situado Fiscal accounts for about 90 percent of the totai public expenditures on education in
Pasto, ICN for nearly 7 percent, and FIS for about 2 percent, while expenditures from Pasto's own resource is a mere 0.3
percent. It should be noted that while other sources of funding either declined modestly between 1994 and 1996, ICN
increased from 4.6 to 6.9 percent.
Table 2 which presents public expenditures on education in constant prices, shows that within the two year period, in real
terms, Situado Fiscal grew by 26 percent, ICN by 95 percent, and FIS by 84 percent, while spending on Pasto's own
resources declined by 26 percent. In total, public expenditures on education grew by 30 percent; per student spending rose
by 32 percent.
Table 3 shows the changing composition of total public spending on education between 1994 and 1996. While salaries
increased by 18 percent, direct investment by 51 percent, and co-financing by 180 percent, general operating expenses
(which includes spending on instructional materials, supplies, in-service training, and supervision) declined by 12 percent.
Both the trends of increased central transfer and declining spending on key educational inputs point to the timeliness of the
project to channel resources to educationally effective inputs to expand access and improve quality, as well as to the fiscal
Sustainability of the project because of the injection of funds from the central government.
Fiscal Sustainability
Total project costs are US$12.0 million, including US$4.84 in counterpart funds, to be disbursed over four years.
A Colombian firm was hired to carry out the analysis of the fiscal impact of the Project and the final report with the details
of the calculation and assumption used is available in the project files4. The estimated financial impact of the project was
calculated based on the following general assumptions:
Macro-economic variables: (i) the GNP grows by 4% per annum up to 2001; (ii) Local annual inflation rates of 18,
15,14.50,14,13.5 during the period 1997-0 1; (iii) extemal inflation was considered as an associated cost of the interests
accumulating on the Loan
Loan condition: (i) standard grace period and interest rate calculation for a bank Loan in single currency (US$) with
LIBOR rate (US$7.2 million).

Revenue growth projections: (i) by projecting the growth rate for the traditional source of municipal income (cadastre,
commerce, industry and gasoline taxes - accounting for about 45% of total revenues - and the fiscal transfers from the
national Government - 55% of municipal budget in Pasto in 1996) it was possible to estimate an annual growth of
municipal budget of 3.9%. and (ii) of the education budget of 4% for the period.
Cost Projections: based on the analysis of municipal debt service and sectoral fix costs and investment projections it was
determined that the aggregate of operating and investment costs will grow during the period in question less than the
revenaes at an annual rate of 1.2 % thus producing in 2001 a potential sector budget surplus of about 5%. This
calculation is based on the assumption that the salary cost for teaching staff, currently absorbing about 90% of sectoral
resources, will not grow further. It is expected that the salary incremental cost generated by the construction of new school
places will be absorbed by a rationalization of the use of the teaching staff rather than by hiring new personnel.
Over the life of the project, real incremental recurrent costs are estimated to grow from 1996 PS 71 million in the first
project year (three months), to a total of 1996 PS 4,480 million in the last year. Based on projected education budget
increases of about 4% per year, project recurrent costs as a percentage of education expenditures would average 2.4%
during the life of the project. Recurrent costs plus counterpart funds would grow from 1996 PS 672 in the first project year
to a total of 1996 PS 9,373 in the last year. These total costs as percent of education expenditure would rise from 2.1 % in
1997 to an average of 5.0% in 2001. The total municipal recurrent costs plus counterpart funds would absorb 2.9% ofthe
aggregate budget increase during the 1997-2001 period. After project completion, the yearly average incremental recurrent
costs at the municipal level generated by the project would account for about 0.64% of the municipal budget for the
education sector.

PASTO Education Project
Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management Arrangements
A. Procurement Arrangements
General. Goods and works shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of the "Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and
August 1996 (The Guidelines) and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement.
School Networks (PDRs). Given the small size of contracts and the wide range and timing of individual PDRs, packaging
of works and items into large procurements groups is not feasible. The average cost of each individual network (each
comprised of approximately 15 schools with subprojects for each school) is US$150,000 and will not exceed US$200,000.
Thus, most contracts for minor works and goods would be awarded on the basis of lump sum, fixed price contracts through
quotations obtained from at least three eligible suppliers. Consequently, the value of contracts for such projects will not
taken into account when calculating the aggregate limits mentioned in the following paragraphs. Participating networks will
follow- procurement procedures for small purchases detailed in the Procurement Manual which is satisfactory to the Bank.
The Manual also details the procurement procedures to be followed by participating schools on the basis of established
ceilings and procurement methods and details supervision, reporting and auditing requirements to ensure the intended use of
resources. The Bank will carry out procurement audits once year to assure that procedures are consistent with the Manual.
Civil Works. Works estimated to cost US$1,500,000 or less, but more than US$100,000 equivalent, will be awarded
following National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$2.1 million.
International bidders may not be discriminated and the procedure should be acceptable to the Bank. Smaller works
estimated to cost US$ 100,000 or less, equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$3.0 equivalent
will be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three (3) qualified
contractors according to guidelines detailed in the Procurement Manual.
Goods. Goods estimated to cost over US$250,000 will be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
procedures. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$250,000 but not less than US$50,000 will be procured through
National Competitive Bidding procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$0.9 million equivalent. Goods estimated to cost
US$50,000 or less may be procured on the basis of national shopping procedures up to an aggregate amount of
US$235,000..
Employment of Consultants: Consultant's services shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the bank in January 1997 and the
provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement.
Consultant's Services: Firms, regardless of the contract cost, may be contracted under Quality-and Cost-Based Selection
procedures, except as indicated below. Consultants Services provided by firms for technical assistance, training and other
services of standard or routine nature estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 may be selected based on Least-Cost
Selection procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$1.1 million. The short-list of consultants for these services,
estimated to cost less than $ 100,000 equivalent per contract, may comprise entirely of national consultants Provision of
services by Educational NGOs for special student access programs, up to an aggregate amount of US$350,000 will be
contracted under Fixed Budget procedures. All other consulting services estimated to amount in the aggregate of
US$200,000 will be procured under contracts awarded to individual consultants in accordance with the provisions of
paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 of the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated
January 1997.
Prior Review. Prior Bank review would be required before all bidding procedures for the following procurement actions:
(a) all ICB procurement; (b) the first NCB procurement each year for both civil works and goods; (c) all consultants'
services esimated to cost US$100,000 or more if provided by a firm including those contracted under QCBS irrespective of



38
their value, according to the stipulations of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers, dated January 1997; and all consultants' services estimated to cost US$50,000 or more if provided
by an individual; (d) any amendment of contracts resulting in the increase of the contract value beyond the review linu,s set
in (a) through (c) above; and (e) all Terms of Reference (TORs). Random ex post review of all other contracts will be
carried out by Bank supervision missions.
A Procurement Plan satisfactory to the Bank, including sample Letters of Invitation and TORs for the first year of
implementation, has been elaborated and a project launch workshop to familiarize the implementing unit with procurement,
disbursement, reporting and auditing requirements will be organized at an early stage in project implementation. The
General Publication Notice is planned to be published by January 1997 together with the first invitation to express interest
to consultancy contracts.

amounts will be allocated as per schedule implementation and costs. Procurement may include goods (computer
equipment, didactic materials, supplies, furniture), technical assistance (fellowships, workshops, teachers'
investigations and training), and services (e.g., dissemination campaigns, tranmportation, rental of conferencw.
rooms, meetings) and maximum 20 percent in small infrastructure improvement. Procurement will be carried out
upon identification of needs by each Network, up to an allocated amount per Network assigned by the municipality
on the basis of established ceilings and procurement methods described in the Procurement Manual acceptable to
the Bank, and up to an aggregate total amount of about US$2.7 million.

(a) School Networks (PDRs) funds will be allocated to 12 networks which will consist of approximately 15 to 20 Fixed
Budget eligible schools each. The amounts will be allocated as per schedule implementation and costs in Annex.
Procurement may include supplies (paper, materials), technical assistance (fellowships, workshops, teachers'
investigations and training), and services (e.g., transportation, rental of conference rooms, meetings). Given the nature
of the School Networks (PDRs), procurement of goods, with an aggregate total of about US$2.7 million, would be
done preferably through local shopping. Grant requests and procurement procedures to be agreed upon would be
reviewed by the Network Council.

B. DISBURSEMENTS
Required Documentation. Disbursement against the following expenditures would require the submnission of complete
documentation: (a) all expenditures LIB procurement; (b) the first expenditure requiring NCB procurement each year for
both civil works and goods; (c) all consultants' services contracts valued at US$100,000 or more if performed by a firm,
and at US$50,000 or more-if performed by an individual. Disbursement against expenditures other than those specified in
(a) through (c) in the above, and those against activities not undertaken by contracts will be made on the basis of Statement
of Expenditures (SOE). Documentation would be retained by the Municipalities and SEM and would be made available for
Bank staff review and the auditors. Applicable documentation requirements by contract value are summarized in Tables B I
and 2.

C. FLOW OF FUNDS AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES
A Financial Management, Recording and Auditing Manual (FMM) will describe in detail the flow of funds to finance
project activities, the financial management procedures and the financial auditing requirements.
Financial Reporting. Since all documentation will eventually be sent to the SEM (see below), project financial reporting
and auditing will be carried out at the central level (SEM); The project would be required to prepare financial statements,
which would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to
the Bank for review and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Special Account. In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account (SA) will be established in U.S. dollars in a
commercial bank outside of Colombia with branches in Pasto. This arrangement is currently in place on other Bank projects
in Colombia, in which Special Accounts are held in U.S. branches of Colombian banks. The rationale for this procedure is
that the country's central bank is not equipped to handle a large volume of small transactions and does not offer all required
banking services.
Monitoring of the SA, including the preparation of withdrawal applications for reimbursement from the Loan Account, will
be the responsibility of SEM (Administrative and Financial Unit). However, for internal control purposes and in order to
operate within the existing financial management system, Secretaria de Hacienda (Hacienda), the Finance Secretariat, will
manage the account under terms and conditions-satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank would make an initial deposit of
US$300,000 in the Special Account. Once total withdrawals from the account have reached US$700,000, the authorized
allocation for the Special Account would be increased to US$600,000. SEM will submit replenishment applications for the
Special Account on a monthly basis, or when 25 percent of the authorized allocation has been used, whichever occurs first.
The replenishment applications will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of the Special Account
and a reconciliation bank statement of the Special Account against the Bank's records. Replenishment of the Special
Account would follow Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited in conjunction with the annual audit of the
project (see above).
Procedures described in the FA".M Project Accountant in the Administrative and Financial Unit of the SEM prepares
payment orders and other requests (such as requests for replenishment of the Special Account), which are approved by the
Project manager and transmitted to Hacienda. Preparation of checks, the Bank's withdrawal applications, and so forth
will be done by Hacienda whose officials will be the authorized signatories for these documents.
Municipal Counterpart Funds. A Current Account (CA) in Pesos would be established for counterpart (municipal) funds,
possibly in the same local branch of the commercial bank where the SA will be open. Through these funds the Muni.,ipality
of Pasto will cofinance the various activities of the project according to the disbursemenlt categories described in Table C. It
is expected that a small percentage (2-3 percent) of this financing will be provided directly by in-kind contributions (e.g.,
skilled and unskilled labor for minor civil works) of local communities. As with the SA, the establishment of the CA would
necessitate an initial deposit by the municipality, equivalent to 3-4 months of the government's share of expected project
expenditures. The account would be periodically reimbursed after submission of an application for reimbursement (with
financial reports as agreed to between the SEM and Hacienda) prepared by the PMU/SEM for Hacienda.
This system will provide assurance that counterpart funds will be readily available for project expenditures. In addition,
accounting for expenditures which are financed by both parties (i.e., the Bank and the municipality) will be transparent,
since each account will only be used to pay for that financier's portion of the expenditure.
Procedures described in the FMM: Project Accountant in the Administrative and Financial Unit of the SEM prepares
payment orders and other requests (such as requests for replenishment of the CA)., which are approved by the Project
Manager and transmitted to Hacienda. Preparation of checks and the replenishment of the CA will be done by Hacienda.

Municipal Level Investments (NEBIs and Institutional Strengthening). Payments for investment activities to be financed
under the NEBI's and School Coverage components will be made directly out of the SA and CA according to the agreed
disbursement percentages for each category, as shown in Table C.
Procedures described in the FMM: Project Accountant in the Administrative and Financial Unit of the SEM prepares
payment orders which are approved by the Project Manager and transmitted to Hacienda. Preparation of checks for
payments from the SA and/or CA (or Clearing Account) will be done by Hacienda.
School Network Level Investments (PDRs). A Resolucion Administrativa of the major of Pasto will regulate the transfer
and the use of funds to finance the subprojects. The contract will stipulate that an amount equivalent to three months of
implementation (it is suggested that this be not more than 20 percent of the entire valu. of the contract) will be transferred
to each network as a down-payment once the contract is signed. The transfer of funds will be made to a current account
opened by the municipality in each Red and managed by the Red coordinator, according to the procedures detailed in the
operational manual. This initial grant will be financed by both loan and counterpart funds; the loan portion will be deposited
only after the relative amount of counterpart financing is deposited in the Red account by the municipality.
After the transfer of the down-payment, subsequent transfers of funds to schools and redes will be made only after the SEM
is satisfied as to the use of funds previously transferred to the network. The networks, represented by the Chairmen of the
Council, will have to submit a financial report to the SEM, with all expenditures fully supported by appropriate
documentation. The project will provide each network with a standard, concise chart of accounts, which will represent a
subset of the overall project account structure, and appropriate accounting software. Training on the use of this accounting
system will be provided by the SEM to each of the redes.
Procedures described in the F2W
1) Network Creation and Opening of Bank Account: Once the network is created, it sets up a bank account in
accordance with FMM. This bank account is to be used solely for project-related expenditures;
2) Municipal/Network Financial Management Agreement Signed
A legal agreement Resoluci6n Administrativa will regulate the access to the account and the use of funds;
3) PDR and Plan de Inversiones Approved: The annual Operating Plan and Investment Plans of the Redes are prepared
and approved according to the procedures described in the operational manual and summarized in block 4 of this PAD.
Approval by: Secretaria de Educaci6n Municipal (SEM);
4) Initial Transfer: The project transfers an initial amount equivalent to three months of expected expenditures to the FSD.
Authorized to Request Funds: Coordinator of the Network; Authorized to Approve Transfers: Project manage-, and
designated Hacienda Officials (see "Special Account" and "Counterpart Funds " procedures above);
5) Procurement, Disbursements by the Network: The network carries out procurement in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines, and spends the funds in a way that is consistent with project objectives (i.e., according to the
components/subcomponents of the project). Signatories on FSD accounts: Principal of the Magnet School, Chairman of
the Network Council; Oversight Responsibilities: Network Assembly, Local Community Organizations (Verdurias
Comunitarias), SEM, Contraloria Municipal (internal auditing), external auditors, Bank supervision missions; and
6) Request for additional financing: The project will make new grant transfers to the FSDs on the basis of financial
statement reports prepared by the Network with all expenditures fully supported by appropriate documentation.

PASTO Education Project
Impact and Process Evaluation Design
Description of Evaluation Research
Purpose
To ensure that the project has achieved its objectives at the school and school network levels and that education stakeholders have a
say in assessing project processes, strategies and use of resources during the implementation of the project.
Impact Evaluation Goals
To measure the level of improved student learning at time of graduation, which would have occurred during the implementation of
the Pasto Education Project.
To measure the level of access to schooling and changes in education efficiency (student dropout and repetition), which would have
occurred during the implementation of the project.
To measure the level of improved student attitude and interpersonal skills which would have occurred during the implementation of
the project.
To measure changes (type, time and perceived satisfaction) of relations among municipal officials, principals, teachers, student,
parents and the community.
Process Evaluation Goals
To evaluate the processes of provision of the educational services within a school network as regards to equity, timeliness and
satisfaction.
To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of project implementation procedures and organizational functions, in order to make timely
adjustments.
Evaluation Design
1. The impact evaluation design will focus on three levels of impact: (i) overall student learning, (ii) improved access and education
efficiency, and (iii) behavior and institutional changes at the school network level. The process evaluation will assess the efficiency
and effectiveness of delivery of services from the municipality to the school networks and among schools within a network. The
project interventions will be provided to a total of 12 networks and approximately 60 schools in each network.
The Design

2. No random experimental and control groups were selected. Instead, the evaluation is concerned only in specifying if any
significant changes took place in schools during the implementation of school networks by comparing the status of the three above-
mentioned levels of impact, prior and after project implementation. Pasto's Secretary of Education decided on a black box
evaluation approach (i.e., no attempt will be made to desegregate the impact of the project from other educational interventions).
The evaluation will not assure full direct causality but will assess the overall status prior to implementation and the changes
perceived after project interventions.
3. The process evaluation will assess the efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation procedures and other
organizational and managerial elements of the project. The first evaluation of project processes and procedures will take
place after the initial phase of project implementation, consisting of only 4 networks. After the initial phase and any
adjustments resulting from the first process evaluation results, the project will be expanded to an additional 8 school
networks.
Outcome Measures
4. For each of the evaluation goals, the following objectives and measures are defined:
5. Measure Improve Student Learning. The objectives are to differentiate student learning in four basic curriculum
contents: language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. The learning measures would be the average SABER
scores per school. SABER is a standardized series of tests administered to third and sixth graders, at the end of the school
year.
6. Measure Level of Community Satisfaction with Networked Schools and the level of Community Participation in
the Networks. A community and school survey will try to determine what is the level of satisfaction/attitudes of principals,
teachers and parents towards networking schools, and how satisfaction and attitudes change over time. A second indicator
of community participation in their networks will be the level of community contributions (time, in-kind, financial)
compared between the beginning and the end of the project.
7. Measure the difference in access to education resources between Networked and those Not-Yet-Networked schools
(i.e., schools in first pilot phase and others). The process evaluation indicators will track (i) the procedures used to deliver
education inputs (e.g., civil works, instructional materials, training), (ii) the level of resources channeled to each network
and other schools, and (iii) the respective outputs produced (e.g., access, infrastructure improvements, instructional
materials available, number of staff trained).
Data Collection Procedures
8. Five tools for data collection will be used: (i) existing standardized test scores, SABER; (ii) a school survey designed to
collect demographic information of each school, but also include questions designed to assess attitudes and behaviors at the
school network level; (iii) investment data from Pasto's Education Secretariat; (iv) yearly focus groups with school staff,
students and community representatives to triangulate the result of the surveys; (v) and random school climate observations.
Data Analysis
9. Selection, application and reporting of inferential statistics will be used for analysis of evaluation data. Case studies of
project implementation experiences will analyze further qualitative impact.
