INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)
FOR A NORTHERN REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to YAR in the amount of SDR 12.5 million (US$17.6 million
equivalent) for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance the Northern Regional Agricultural
Development Project. The project would be cofinanced by UNDP for US$3.4
million equivalent. The Government of YAR and the Beneficiaries would
contribute the remaining US$18.4 equivalent of the project cost.
2.       Background.  Since the early seventies, YAR has been transforming
itself from a subsistence economy largely closed to the outside world to a
market economy, propelled by remittances from Yemenis working abroad and
foreign aid. However, these capital inflows have decreased by 451 from their
peak in 1978. Consequently, and because YAR has virtually no exports, the
country's foreign exchange position has come under pressure. YAR is not
self-sufficient in food crops; it imports about 0.5 million tons of foodgrains
annually. The scarcity of foreign exchange has recently severely limited
imports of other agriculture products and inputs. The situation is expected
to improve after the country starts exporting oil in 1988. Agriculture in
YAR, while providing a livelihood to 60S of the domestic labor force,
contributes about 25% to GDP and is, therefore, important to the economy.
Agriculture value added has grown at an annual average rate of 1.5% over the
period 1982-1986 despite three years of severe drought during that period.
There is sufficient land available with good potential for agriculture, but
production is constrained by low rainfall and scarcity of water. Despite this
constraint, agriculture remains the sector with substantial potential for
growth and income generation in the medium to long-term - yields cL -ld
improve considerably, cropping pattern could move towards high value crops and
the irrigation area could expand.
3.       The performance of the agriculture sector has been well below its
potential due to: (a) generally poor agricultural practices; (b) untimely and
limited availability of fertilizer and other inputs; (c) lack of adequate
technical advice and other services to farmers; and (d) lack of adequate
credit. Recognizing these shortcomings, the Governmert started in the late
seventies to provide agricultural services as part of area development
projects in selected areas followed by regional development projects. A total
300SC



-2-
of 12 IDA-assisted projects have resulted in improved extension, availability
of credit in some of the country's often remote areas and establishment of
links between research and extension. The results of improved extension and
technical services are encouraging. However, agricultural credit provided by
the Cooperative and Agriculture Credit Bank (CACB), institutionally supported
by a separate IDA-assisted project since 1982, still reaches only a small part
of the farmer population due to lack of funds and facilities in the field.
4.       Project Objectives:  The proposed project is designed to support the
Government's efforts to provide improved services, technical support and
infrastructural development for the agricultural development of the Northern
Region not yet covered by other area development and regional projects. The
major objectives would be to increase agricultural production, reduce food
imports and increase farmers' income and improve their living standards. The
project would support an ongoing institutional development program aiming at:
(a) efficient use of the country's limited water resources by management of
surface and groundwater and improvement of irrigation in areas with
sustainable water resources; (b) measures to ensure sustainability of the
country's development programs and (c) upgrading the managerial,
administrative and technical skills of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries (MAF).
5.       Project Description:  The proposed project, covering an agricultural
area of about 78,500 ha, would establish infrastructure on the same lines as
has successfully been undertaken with IDA assistance in the Western and
Southern Regions of the country. It would include: (a) strengthening of
agricultural services and facilities comprising (i) a regional extension
service; (ii) support to the national Agricultural Research Authority;
(iii) establishment of self-supporting nurseries; (iv) support for
importation of fertilizers; and (v) support for development of women; (b) the
provision of medium-term agricultural credit for on farm investment;
(c) irrigation development by carrying out site investigations and
construction of ten recharge dams for efficient water resources management;
(d) establishment of regular operation and maintenance (O&M) service for the
project to ensure sustainability, and training of O&M staff for the operation
and maintenance of Mareb Dam; (e) support for establishment of Northern
Regional Development Authority (NORDA) which has already been approved by the
Government as project implementation authority; and (f) support for technical
assistance and training program for MAF agricultural, management and
engineering staff, also including establishment of in-service training
centers. The proposed assistance to the newly established NORDA would
facilitate close monitoring and control of support services. Linking local
research with extension would allow extension staff to better disseminate
advice on improved technology and efficient water management. The project
would be implemented by NORDA and would be carried out over six years. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$39.4 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of tS$22.8 million (58S). A breakdown of the costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursement and the disbursement schedules are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group Operations in YAR are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map (IBRD 19940) of the project area is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6978-YAR dated February 19, 1988 is also attached.

6.       Agreed Actions:  All major issues were di3cussed at appraisal and
agreements and understanding reached. A complete list of issues and actions
which were discussed at negotiations are presented in the Staff Appraisal
Report. The main points are summarized as follows: (a) establishment of a
revolving fund by December 31, 1989 for operation of nurseries and setting the
sale price of plants to recover full productions costs; (b) establishment of a
revolving fund by June 30, 1990 for import of agricultural inputs and granting
of import licenses and provision of foreign exchange by the Government of YAR
for continuous operation of the fund; (c) submission to IDA of terms of
reference for the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system by
October 1, 1988, and the carrying out of a midterm review at the end of 1991;
(d) timely availability of local funds and staff and (e) speedy mobilization
through an existing PPF advance (P-454-YAR) approved by IDA. The conditions
for effectiveness of IDA credit would be: (a) signing of an agreement for a
UNDP Grant of US$3.4 million; (b) apwointment of a Credit Coordinator to
assist CACB and MAF in effectively carrying out credit operations, and
(c) signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between CACB and MAF for onlending
of credit to the farmers.
7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement:  The project forms an integral part of
the Government's and IDA's sector development strategy to ensure timely
availability of essential support services to farmers to help raise
agricultural productivity and efficiently exploit the limited natural
resources. The strategy focusses on the strengthening of extension, research,
credit and provision of essential inputs in expanding agricultural
productivity and output of foodgrain, as well as improving diversification
into fruits and vegetables for import substitution. IDA's involvement in this
process over the last 15 years has been instrumental in modernizing the
agricultural sector. The continuation of this involvement through financial
and technical assistance and through attracting additional cofinancing funds
is important for continued implementation of the strategy.
8.       Benefits:  The project benefits would result from (a) introduction of
improved on-ferm technology (34,400 ha); (b) on-farm investments to improve
efficiency of irrigation water and establishment of fruit orchards (5,000 ha),
and (c) technical assistance and training to help local women in agricultural
and nonagricultural activities. The regional component and accompanying
credit package would have directly quantifiable benefits from the incremental
production of sorghum, wheat, pulses, fruits, vegetables, alfalfa and coffee.
At full development, the project would increase annual grain production by
about 5,000 tons and fruit and vegetable production by about 30,000 tons. The
net farm income is expected to increase by 36% by Year 8 of the project. The
internal economic rate of return (ERR) is 16.5%. Risk analysis shows that ERR
would remain about 12% if costs increase by 13% or benefits decrease by 12%.
Both of these are satisfactory.
9.       Risks:  Possible risks could include (a) delay in the establishment
of NORDA and the speed with which NORDA will be able to mold itself into an
effectively operating institution and (b) the effectiveness of the extension
service in convincing contact farmers to adopt new farming practices. The
Government attaches high priority to the development of the northern region
and has already completed legislative action to establish NORDA. The
300SC



-4-
effectiveness of the extension service will be ensured through extensive
demonstration of the recommended practices on the farmers' fields and
demonstration farma attached to each block center and by facilitating easy
access by the farmers to agricultural credit. Also, under the project,
extension staff from the project area itself will be hired and trained so that
an atmosphere of trust and confidence prevails between the extension service
and the farmers. Another factor which could affect the project is inadequate
budgetary support resulting in delays in construction and staffing schedule.
However, in view of the expected oil revenues by the end of 1988 and the
priority that the Government attaches to the development of the Northern
Region, this risk is minimized.
10.      Recommendations:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
