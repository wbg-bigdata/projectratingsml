THIRD AND FOURTIH DEVELOPMENT rNDW_STRIAL BANK PROJECTS
(Loans 1533-EGT and 1804-EGT)
PREFACE
The project completion report covers Loans 1533-EGT (DIB III) and
1804-EGT (DIB IV). Loan 1533-EGT was approved in ^srch 21, 1978 and closed on
March 15, 1983. The corresponding dates for Loan 1604-EGT were, November 3,
1980 and June 30, 1985.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office following a visit to Egypt in March 1986. It is based _;a the
Staff Appraisal Reports nos. 1809a-EGT dated February 28, 1978 and 2669-EGT
dated February 6, 1980, amd the respective President's Reports nos. P-2241-EGT
dated March 9, 1978 and P-2711-EGT dated February 20, 1980, correspondence
with the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda, supervision and audit reports,
specific information submitted by the Sorrowers for the PCR, and PPAR no. 4531
dated June 7, 1983.
The PCR describes the project objectives and implementation, provides
an analysis of the use of the two Bank Loans, and discusses DIB's
institutional development and its operational and financial performance. It
draws lessons from different aspects of the performance of the two Loans.
DIB cooperated fully in the preparation of the PCR.
The PCR was forwarded to the Borrower and the Government in draft
form for their comments. These comments have been taken into account in
finalizing the report and are reproduced as Annex 11.
The two projects have not been audited by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
THIRD AND FOURTL! DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRIAL BANK PROJECTS
(Loans 1533-EGT and 1804-EGT)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Development Industrial Bank (DIB) commenced operations in
August 1976, when the activities, staff, and portfolio of the Special Services
to Private Industrial Sector Unit of the Bank of Alexandria were transferred
to DIB to form the nucleus of a development bank. DIB has since received five
Bank Loans aggregating US$ 250 million, and the sixth Bank Loan for US$ 170
million is expected to become effective shortly. DIB's paid-in capital of LE
34 million is held entirely by the Government. Its annual budget, salary
structure, financial statements and appropriation of profit are subject to
Ctntral Bank of Egypt's approvaL.
2.       The objectives of the two loans were: (i) to encourage private st=..tor
industrial growth, specially the growth of Small Scale Industries (SSIs);
(ii) to strengthen DIB's management and organization, project appraisal and
supervision procedures, and (iii) to promote with financial and technical
assistance an institute (The Engineering and Industrial Design and Development
Center - EIDDC) whose aim is to raise SSI productivity (para 8).
3.       Since its creation in 1976, there has been steady demand for DIB
financing. Under the two Bank loans under review, DIB financed 265
subprojects (paras. 26-27). For Loan 1533-EGT, the final date for subproject.
submission was extended by six months and the closing date by three months;
for Loan 1804-EGT, the subproject submission date was extended by one year and
closing date by six months (paras 5-6). The Bank has been instrumental in
assisting DIB to introduce well formulated internal policies and procedures,
develop and implement an appropriate management information system, and
improve project appraisal and supervision capacity. In the late seventies,
DIB lost a large number of its professional staff who were attracted by
substantially higher salaries in the Gulf countries and in the newly
established joint venture banks. However, through a continuing, vigorous
process of recruitment and training, supplemented by the use of competent
outside advisors, further supported by the Bank's guidance through supervision
missions and during subproject review, DIM was able to maintain and strengthen
its organization. It possesses today a knowledgeable core staff in its
appraisal and supervision departments. Training has been emphasized over the
years especially with new staff members (para. 15).
4.       Supervision reviews, as well as the financial and economic rates of
return indicate that the subprojects have performed satisfactorily overall.
62,566 j bs have been created under the two Bank loans at an average
investment cost per job of between LE 5,000 and LE 6,000. The subloans have
covered virtually all subsectors of industry, and geographical coverage too
has been wide, altnough the Cairo area, as Egypt's principal industrial
centre, has been the main beneficiary (para 32).



DIB, with the Bank's encouragement, gave priority to SSI financing.
In 1982, SSI lending reached 341 of total approvals, increasing to 421 in
i985. However, DIB was not able tco reach in 198C and 1981 the target of 30S
of term lending approvals set by the Bank under Loan 1804-EGT. In 1986, SSI
approvals declined to 241 as Bank funds were no longer available for riew
approvals for the 12-month period (para 20).
6.       The Engineering and Industrial Design and Development Centre (FTDDC)
provides extension services, engineering consultancy and management courses to
SSIs. With Bank and UNDP technical assistance, this institute today ftuctions
effectively and its input has been found to be highly relevant to SSIs needs
in management, technology and market development (para 31).
7.       Financially, DIB is a sound institution.  Although arrears in its
portfolio have tended to rise, the situation is manageable; DIB has recently
set up a project rehabilitation unit to assist ailing projects to recover
(paras. 35-36).  DIB needs to broaden its resource base; 601 of DIB's
resources come from the Bank .-d, as a sound institution, DIB should begin to
investigate the international financial markets for funds (1rara 24).
8.       DIE has sound management and its organization responds well to its
needs. Its loan appraisal and supervision work has improved substantially
(paras 18-19). DID should be able to remain viable, and to continue to play a
major role in financing private sector industrial projects.
9.       The two Loans have successfully met their objectives.  In hindsight,
the target set for SSI financing has proved to be somewhat too ambitious, but
it did induce DIB to make strong efforts to seek out sound SSI projects for
financing. At the same time, the establishment of EIDDC as a service
institute has produced an important vehicle for SSI assistance. DIB now needs
to broaden its resource base, to more actively promote projects, and to assist
in the development of the Egyptian capital market (para 38).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
THIRD AMM FOURTH DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRIAL BANK PROJECTS
(Loans 1533-EGI and 1804-EGT)
I. Introduction
A. Rae
1.       This completion report covers the implementation and performances of
Loans 1533-EGT (DIB III) and 1804-EGT (DIB IV). It follows the Project
Performance Audit Memorandum dated June 29, 1983 on the two IDA Credits
(412-EG,T and 567-EGT) to the Government of Egypt, onlent to the Bank of
Alexandria (BOA) to support its industrial term financing unit, SSPIS, and its
successor, the Development Industrial Bank (DIB). Loan 1533-EGT for $40
million was approved on March 21, 1978 and Loar. 1804-EGT for $50 million was
approved on March 11, 1980 to meet part of DIB's foreign exchange needs ove-
1978-79 e-id 1980-81 respectively.
2.       In the wake of the announcement of the open door policy in Egypt, in
1975, the World Bank and the Government agreed that for the growth of
production, employment and exports in Egypt, industry had a high priority.
One of the most efficient ways to accelerate industrial development was to
lend financial and technical support to private and in particular to small
scale industry. In the banking system, BOA and later DIB were almost alone in
providing term finance in a meaningful way for the private medium and small
industries and the Bank therefore decided to stuoport them with loans and
technical assistance.
3.       Evaluating the achievements of IDA Credits 412-EGT and 576-EGT,
approved in June 1973 and July 1975 respectively, the Project Performance
Audit Memorandum (PPAM) concluded that DIB had made a considerable
csntribution to the development of the private industrial sector and of the
SSI segment in particular. Although still a young DFC, DIB had evolved into a
vigorous institudion, with arrears within acceptable levels, and with
satisfactory composition and quality of portfolio. IDA had been instrumental
in assisting DIB, as well as its predecessor institution, SSPIS, to introduce
improved internal policies and procedures, strengthen its operational and
financial policy and planning, develop and implement an appropriate management
information system, and improve project appra sal and supervision capacity.
In this process, DIB has been pioneering long-term financing standards in
Egypt. PPAM also pointed out that although DIB had been allowed substantial
independence in its lendiig operations, the legal framework imposed severe
constraints in organizational structure, appointments of senior staff and
board members, and staff remuneration. Further, due to the easy, and on
occasions unsolicited, access to official resources at concessionary terms and
due to the flaws in policy framework and interest rate structure beyond its
discretion, DIB had not broadened its resource mobilization to tap domestic
and private international savings and to achieve a measure of independence.
It had done very little to overcome the regulatory obstacles and to promote
and participate in new industrial ventures or to broaden the ownership of
industrial capital. In spite of great progress in institution building, there
was room for improving DIB organization and staffing and its skills in
appraisal and supervision of projects.



-2-
4.       As we shall describe in this report, since then DIB, with the
prompting and assistance of the Bank, has made great strides in strengthening
its loans procedures, organization and management and, through recruitment and
training, its staff capabilities. Only in areas of project promotion and
resource mobilization, regulatory obstacles have been obdurate and much
remains to be done.
B. Loan Features
5.       Loan No. 1533-EGT, amounting to $40 million was aFproved on March 21,
1978, signed on April 12, 1978 and became effective on Jul:r 18, 1978. The
Loar was granted to DIB at an interest rate of 7.45% and commitment charge of
0.752 and was guaranteed by the Arab Republic of Egypt. The rate of interest
charged to the subborrowers was to be not less than 9.95% (for a discussion of
the foreign exchange risk, see para 21). The free limit was set at $400,000
and the aggregate free limit at $16 million. The final date for project
submission was set at June 30, 1980 originally and had to be extended to
December 31, 1980. The closing date, originally set at December 31, 1982, was
extended to March 15, 1983 when $39.5 million of the Loan was disbursed and
the balance of 0.5 million cancelled.
6.       Loan No. 1804-EGT, amounting to $50 million was approved on
March 11, 1980, signed on May 11, 1980 and bc.came effective on
August 8, 1980. The Loan was granted to DIP with the guarantee of tae Arab
Republic of Egypt, at an interest rate of 8.25% per annum and the usual
commitment fee, to be onlend to sub-borrowers, at a minimum rate of 11X per
annum (for a discussion of the foreign exchange risk, see para 21). The free
limit was set at $650,000 %ithout an aggregate. The final date for projects
submission was set at June 30, 1982 and extended to June 30, 1983 and the
original closing date of December 31, 1984 was extended to June 30, 1985.
$49.6 million of the Loan was disbursed, $.04 million cancelled.
7.       Technical Assistance Components - Loan No. 1533 agreement provided
that DIB could allocate $300,000 out of the proceeds of the Loan for the
financing of the foreign currency cost of goods and services required for the
implementation of a program satisfactory to the Bank for strengthening its
management and operational procedures. These costs were actually provided
throu6n grants from USAID and EEC and therefore this portion of the Loan was
used for DIB normal operations. DIB would also lend $200,000 of the Loan to
the Egyptian Government at 7.451 to cover the foreign exchange cost of a
technical assistance program to EIDOC for SSI.
H. Objectives
8.       The objectives of the two Loans were similar and built on the results
of the first two IDA credits. Accordingly, the loans continued to support the
Government policy of encouraging private sector, especially its smaller
segments. The objective was to increase the contribution to industrial
development, industrial efficiency and employment generation. For this
purpose, the Bank loans were: (i) to provide over 4 years, 1978-1881, part of
DIB's long-term foreign exchange resources for industrial projects in the
private sector and, to a lesser extent, to export oriented projects in the
public sector; (ii) to assist further, with the help of the Bank's project
screening and supervision and outside advisors, the strengthening of the
management and organization, project appraisal and investment supervision
procedures of DIB; (iii) to promote with financial and technical assistance an
appropriate unit within the Government (EIDDC) to raise SSI productivity and
efficiency through provision of managertal and technical assistance, training,
and business information.



9.       Convinced that SSI could increase production and employment faster
than larger firms with the minimum use of resources, the Bank under these
Loans laid emphasis on financial and technical assistance to these
industries. During appraisal of Loan 1533-EGT, the Bank's review confirmed
that SSI were using out-of-date machinery and technology, ieflcient
production, management, product design and had marketing problems. Their
access to institutional finance, raw materials and skills (because of
emigration to other oil producing Arab countries) was severely restricted.
Although the banking sector since 1974 had grown rapidly with a large niumber
of commercial banks, including investment, joint-venture and foreign units,
the banking system was reluctant to grant credit to small enterprises bec&use
of higher costs and risks. It confined itself to financing public sector and
larger private sector projects. SSI was defined under Loan 1533-EGT as
enterprises whose fixed assets (excluding land and building) did not exceed
LE 150,000 (around $215,000); the corresponding limit under Loan 1804-EGT was
LE 200,000 (around $285.000).
10.      The Loan agreements provided for:
(a) Industrial financing through DIB. $39.5 million under
Loan 1533-EGT to meet 602 of total foreign exchange requirements
over 1978 and 1979; antd $50 million under Loan 1804-EGT to meet
57X of DIB needs over 1980 and 1981. DIB was allowed to onlend to
public sector enterprises up to $10 million (25X) of
Loan 1533-EGT, and again $10 million (202), of Loan 1804-EGT
provided that the projects financed were expected, on the basis of
realistic estimates, to export at least 202 of their products for
freely convertible currencies. Thus DIB was gradually weaning the
public sector from access to its finance in favor of the private
sector.
11.      DIB agreed to lend at least $4 million or 10% of Loan 1533-EGT and
$15 million or 30S of Loan 1804-EGT to SSIs. It also agreed under
Loan 1804-EGT that DIB would target 30% of its term lending in 1980 and 1981
to enterprises whose assets (excluding land and bu:tding) did not exceed LE
100,000. Concurrently with Loan 1533-EGT, DIB obtained a loan of $8.75
million frotg Opec Special Fund (OSF) to be onlent at 8% to smaller SSI, half
to borrowers whose assets did not exceed LE 100,000 and half to those with
assets under LE 20,000. It was also estimated that about 10% of the Bank loan
and 20% of combined Bank and OSF loans could qualify for the Bank's Urban
Poverty Program target lending (projects with investment cost per job
generrted not exceeding $3,000 in 1977 prices).
(b)  Technical Assistanco to DIB.  $300,000 ox Loan 1533-EGT was to
finance (in additi.n to $90,000 provided under IDA II Credit) a
management advisor on organization, planning and policy matters
and a technical advisor on project appraisal and supervisiou., and
the foreign exchange costs of training DIB staff abroad. Further,
technical assistance through Bank/IDA supervision and missions to
DIB was expected to continue.
(c) Technical Assistance Prosram for SSI. $20C,000 of Loan 1533-EGT
was onlent to the Government to finance a technical assistance
pilot program. Under this, the Engineering and Industrial Design
and Development Center (EIDDC), a public sector organization in
Cairo, would provide extension services, engineering consultancy
and management courses to SSI, and the Productivity and Vacational
Training Department (PVT) of the Ministry of Industry in Cairo



- 4 -
and Alexandria would provide an accelerated training program for
unskilled and semi-skilled workers in specialized trades.
Although DIB has no direct responsibility for the program, it was
required to follow the progress and help the Bank co closely
monitor the implementation of this program.
Ill Attainment of Objectives
A. Build-up of Institutional CApaeAy
Level of OPerations
12.      DIB term loan approvals over the 1978-1985 period is shown below
(details in Annex 1). In numbers and amounts in constant and nominal prices
it shows noticeable growth.

13.      In general during this period, actual approvals exceeded projections,
but since 1982, actual approvals have at times lagged projections due to
phasing out of public sector projects. The sixth Bank loan approved in 1984
had not yet become effective due to problems related to the foreign exchange
risk. Durx.ng ten years of its existence to 1986, DIB had made 11,708 loans
totalling LE 1,010 million of which LE 454 million or 45% were in foreign
currency. These loans have resulted in LE 2,518 million total investment in
industry, covering virtually all subsectors of industry; the two main
subsectors receiving about a third of DIB loans are textiles and
engineering/metal working (para 32).
Developments in Organization, Management and Staffing
14.      As noted earlier, DIB's institutional building was a prime objective
of the two loans under review since DIB was the only institution able and
willing to develop in Egypt the provisions of development banking.



- 5 -
15.      During the boom years of the late seventies, DIB suffered some heavy
loss of its experienced professional staff due to emigtation and opening up of
large numbers of joint v.nture and investment banks. This worried its
international lenders who observed that the loss of acquired skills was
affecting the quality of its portfolio. As a public sector bank, DIB's
salaries were regulated and could not compete with the private sector. In the
eighties, emigration had more or less ended, growth of the banking sector had
slowed and, in part as a result of the Bank's pressure on the Government, DIB
had been given leeway to increase salaries through. bonuses and fringe
benefits. During this period, DIB also acquired access to extensive technical
assistance through the service of consultants funded by USAID and EEC
(paras 30-31). The technical assistance was supplemented by close supervision
of DIB by the Bank through supervision missions and through subproject
roviews. These institution building efforts have gradually had an impact and
DIB's institutional strength has increased considerably. This enabled DIB in
the early eighties to weather successfully the retirement of its
founder-chairman and senior members of the management team. DIB now has a
staff of 278 professionals, 109 in the branches and 169 in the Head Office.
DIB's Chairman at the time of the implementation of these two loans,
Mr. Abdel Hamid Kabodan, had wide banking experience and led DIB most ably.
He was succeeded in June 1984 by Mr. Mohammed El Sayed El Ghoroury an
expereinced industrialist and former Minister of Industry who proved to be a
dedicated and highly competent Chairman. Senior management was also
strengthened at that time from internal promotions. To date, DIB's management
and staff are of high caliber, well integrated and stable. The only important
concern which could be expressed is about the compulsory retirement age of 60,
which will again prematurely deprive DIB of its Chairman in mid-1987. It is
very important that the Government continues to appoint experienced and
dynamic chairmen to DIB.
16.      As agreed with the Bank and in order to introduce outside guidance to
DIB's Board, an external Advisory Committee to the Board was established in
early 1980, consisting of four members, knowledgeable in finance and
industrial development. While the Committee appeared to function for the
first two years, giving some useful opinions to DIB management, it gradually
petered away. Essentially, the then DIB Chairman failed to see the
Committee's usefulness. Although the Bank found a worthwhile contribution had
been made by the Committee's deliberations on DIB's policies and operations,
as long as the Committee was not an organic part of the organization, DIB's
Chairman did not feel obliged to convene it. The only way to ensure a
systematic review of DIB policies and major operations by the Committee would
be for either the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) or DIB creditors to require
regular meetings and reports on the Committee's deliberations.
17.      Under existing regulations, CBE is authorized to approve DIB's
budget, annual report, orgenization and salary structure. These constraints
adversely effected DIB in that organizational change became difficult to put
through and it steadily lost trained professional staff. The Bank had pointed
out, on a number of occasions, the adverse impact of these restrictions to the
Government. Finally the Government and CBE about three years ago allowed DIB
to increase salaries by raising the annual bonus from two to six months, and
two years ago authorized DIB to introduce changes in its organization as and
when required. As a result, staff loss has been contained and DIB has
implemented the proposals of its management and technical advisors (page 17).
The latest organization structure meets DIB purposes. Annual planning and
budgetting and management information and accounting systems are in place and
statistical, accounting and management information are being computerized.



-6-
18.      New departments for "SSI", for "rehabilitation of defaulting clients"
and for "investment and marketing" are in operation. There is frequent
communication and interchange of ideas between appraisal, follow-up,
engineering and economWcs departments and between them and the branches. All
this has improved the standard of appraisals, follow-up and assistance to
enterprises in difficulty. Training courses are arranged, in house, using
cases from DIB files and, outside, with the help of American University in
Cairo, Bedford University of England and Author D. Little, the consulting
firm. More senior staff are sent for advance training to international
seminars and development banks in other countries.
19.      Procedures.  A pre-screening system has been established to reject
the obviously unviable projects and avoid waste of manpower. In consultation
with advisors, appraisal and supervision guidelines and checklists have been
prepared and are in use. Deadlines for each operation are established to
avoid delays in appraisal and approvals. Costs and time over-runs, are
carefully controlled and all supervision reports are sent to appraisal
departments in order to keep in touch with implementation issues. To control
construction delays, which commonly affect its projects, DIB requires half of
the construction work to be completed before its loan is disbursed. Also,
after a project is approved, every applicant has to deposit, in addition to
the 10% or 20Z security deposit, a large part of the equity (one third of the
cost of the project) with DIB, to be disbursed gradually with the loan as
required.  As soon as the Follow-up Department detects a number of enterprises
in a sector in trouble, it warns the appraisal department and ask the
economics department to prepare a report on that sector. Thus DIB's functions
and structure are efficient and aim at applying satisfactory managerial,
technological, marketing, economic and financial standards.
B. SSI Financing
20.      The percentage of SSI loans in total DIB term loans since 1980 has
been as follows:
1980      1981        1982      1983        1984      1985        1986
32Z       252         34%       302         402       42%         24%
Up to 1985, with the Bank's urging, there had been a gradual increase in SSI
lending, but a drop occurred in 1986 probably due to the temporary pause in
IBRD financing (Para 11). Under Loan 1533-EGT, only $807,457 were disbursed
for 11 loans to the smaller SSIs and only $6,493 for 3 projects with
investment per job of less than $3,000. Of the Bank Loan 1804, just over
$5 million were disbursed for 94 loans to SSI with less than LE 200,000
assets. Obviously DIB found it difficult to extend Bank loans to very small
enterprises. DIB co-operates fully with EIDDC in sending clients with
management and technical problems to EIDDC for assistance and extending loans
to SSIs sent to them by EIDDC. In addition to its three branches, DIB has
also set up a special department for appraisal of loans to SSI.
C. Foreig Exchange Risk and Interest Rates
21.      Under both loans, 1533-EGT and 1804-EGT, the agreements provided that
the subborrowers would assume the foreign exchange risk in US dollars i.e.
they would repay in local currency at the highest official exchange rate
declared by CBE. The Government assumed the risk between the US dollar and



-7-
other currencies.  The highest official rate and the free market rate evol-ed
as follows:
US$ per LE
1978       1979        1980/81    1981/82
Highest official rate    1.43        1.43          1.35        1.20
Free market               1.39       1.33          1.32        1.15
1982/83    1983/84    1984/85    1985/86
Highest official rate       1.20        1.00       0.77        0.74
Free market                 1.05       0.90        0.70        0.56
The difference between these rates reflects an increasing subsidy for DIB
subborrowers.
22.        The onlending rates under the two loans was agreed on the
assumption that the exchange risk (between US$ and Egjptian pounds) would be
carried by subborrowers. At the time of the loan agreement the rate reflected
approximately the market cost of long-term foreign exchange in the
international capital market, and was therefore satisfactory. The minimum
rates were fixed 9.95% under Loan 1533-EGT and 11X under Loan 1804-EGT.
Since, as noted in para 21, exchange adjustments did not take place the
interest rates gradually became negative in real terms.
23.        Discussion on the foreign exchange risk continued after negotiations
of Loan 2458-EGT which was approved in 1984 but was not signed until
April 1986. The Bank proposed that the exchange risk be shared between the
Government and the subborrowers in order to reduce the implied subsidy and the
burden on the Government's budget. The Government insisted, however, at that
time, on fixing the exchange rate at the highest official rate as of the date
of the signing of each subloan agreement. A fee of 3% was to be levied from
sub-borrowers. Subsequently, during discussions in April 1987, the Government
proposed to DIB and other intermediates under Loan 2458-EGT. the two following
options: (i) the loans could be repaid in foreign currency by subborrowers;
and (ii) the loans could be repaid in local currency and the Government would
charge a fee of 92 over and above the lending rate of DIB, to cover the
exchange rate risk over the life of the subloan. The exchange rate would be
the free market rate and would be fixed as of the date of subloan signature.
This proposal represents a major progress towards eliminating the foreign
exchange risk subsidy. Formal agreement to this proposal is expected by
July 1987. The Bank intends to follow up the implementation of this proposal
under supervision of Loan 2458-EGT.
D. Resource Mobilzation
24.        Nearly all the resources of DIB derive from official international
and domestic sources. DIB has received $747.5 million from international and
bilateral lending agencies of which $430 millian or 58X is from the six Bank
loans (see Annex 2).
25.        In addition, as of December 31, 1986, DIB had borrowed LE
198 million from the CBE and the commercial banks and had received LE 27.5
million deposits from clients. DIB under Loans 1533-EGT and 1804-EGT made



- 8 -
little effort in tapping local savings by offering medium term certificates of
deposits or bonds to the public. Similarly DIB has made no effort to borrow
term loans from the private internatiunal markets as it cannot take the risk
of variable interest rates which have been unacceptable to its borrowers.  DIB
needs to look more closely at ways to mobilize private domestic and private
international resources. Its present dependence on World Bank and
concessional aid funds is excessive. To ensure sufficient resources for
future operations, DIB should, without delay, begin to devise practical ways
to raise money. It is likely that DIB will need technical assistance in this
endeavor.
Iv. Subprojects Finnced
Loan No. 1533-EGT
26.        In addition to the $200,000 loaned to tha Government for the
Technical Assistance Project for SSI, 90 subprojects (Annex 3) were financed
out of the loan of $40 million, $26.8 million for 21 A subprojects above the
free limit of $400,000 and $12.5 million for 69 B projects under the free
limit leaving $0.5 million which was cancelled. Four of the A Loans
aggregating $3.25 million, (well below the $10 million authorized under the
Loan Agreement), were in the public sector. The average size uL. Lnet 'fA"
subloans was $1.25 million, 12 loans were below and 8 loans above $1 million,
the largest was for $4.4 million, a private sector loan. The average
investment cost financed by the A subloans including local financing by DIB
was no more than 282 and the average investment cost financed by B subloans
was only 25X. The average size of "B" loans was $180,000 though the smallest
loan was $14,000.
Loan No. 1804-EGT
27.        A total of 175 projects (Annex 4 ) were financed, with 15 "A"
subloans above the free limit of $650,000 totalling $33.5 million and 160 "B"
subloans below the free limit totalling $16 million; $0.5 million was
cancelled. Only one loan of $4.0 was in the public sector, (below the $10
million limit authorized). On the other hand, nine loans ameunting in the
aggregate to just over $21 million were for joint ventures under Law 43.  The
average size of "A" subloan was $2.2 million, and the average "B" subloans
amounted to $100,000 well below the average of B subloans under 1533-EGT loan,
(94 "B" subloans with an average of $55,000 were made for SSI reflecting DIB's
strong commitment to finance SSI investment under the Bank loan). The average
percentage of investment cost financed decreased to 262 for "A" subprojects
and to 18% for "B" subprojects.
Subproiect Performance
28.        Judging by the performance of "A" subprojects, there were
considerable over-runs in time and cost of the projects under both loans.
The years 1978 to 1981 were the years of oil boom and the building facilities,
utilities, transport and all public services were over-burdened. This
resulted in significant time over-runs during subproject implementation which,
in turn, caused shortages in project financing. This situation could not have
been foreseen at the time of appraisal of the Loan. The actual economic rates
of return of the subprojects, however, were satisfactory and ranged from 18 to
50 percent for Loan 1533-EGT and from 15 to 45 percent for Loan 1804-EGT.



- 9 -
Similarly, the actual financial rates of return ranged between 14 and 36
percent for Loan 1533-EGT and between 14 and 35 percent for Loan 1804-EGT.
The investments under Loan 1533-EGT generated 20,960 jobs at LE 6,000
investment per job and under Loan 1804, 41,606 jobs at LE 5,000 per job
(Annexes 5 and 6).
Qal4ity of Apprasal and Supervision
29.        As mentioned above, during the years 1977- 1980, DIB lost many of
its experienced professional staff to new banks and emigration. The quality
of appraisal and supervision was then under criticism by the Bank because of
weak management and technical aspects of projects, the undere imation of cost
and implementation time, and lack of timely supervision and remedial action
(para 36). The Bank insisted on the employment by DIB of management and
technical advisors and agreed with DIB on a training program to upgrade DIB
management and professional strength. As discussed below, the institution
building took some years to implement, but eventually it resulted in
considerable improvement.
Technical Assitance
30.        Under Loan 1533-EGT, finance for two schemes of technical
assistance was provided: (a) $300,000 loan to DIB for the foreign exchange
costs of advisory and training services for strengthening its management
system and appraisal and supervision capabilities; and (b) $200,000 to be
*      onlent to the Government for setting up a pilot scheme within EIDDC.
Technical Assistance to DIB. This part of the loan was not used for the
purpose intended, as USAID agreed to finance on a grant basis the cost of
Management Advisory services and EEC provided a grant for the technical
advisor. After a trial and error period for the USAID financed management
advisor, USAID secured the services of the firm of Price Waterhouse who, in
association with Nathan Associates, prepared over the period October 14, 1981
to December 14, 1985 a very elaborate review on all aspects of DIB management,
,rganization and procedure. They reviewed all departments and offices of DIB
and made some 286 recommendations covering organizational structure, staffing,
computerization of statistical, accounting and management information,
comparisons with Philippines and Korean development banks, improvement. in
office facilities, co-operation with other institutions, incernal controls and
marketing strategy. DIB management and Board have already implemented all
recommendations which they found appropriate. This part of the program has
been very successful and helped DIB regain its image.
31.        EEC financed an expert from Development Finance Consultants LTD of
London who spent 2 years, April 1984 to April 1986. He worked alongside
appraisal and supervision staff of DIB on some 34 DID financed companies. He
made 15 recommendations on organization and procedures in these areas, most of
which have been put into effect by DIB. This program was also successful and
has been the main reason for DIB's improvements in appraisal and supervision
work.
Technical Assistance for SSI - $200,000 of the Loan 1533-EGT was onlent to the
Egyptian Government to provide technical assistance as follows:
(i) technical assistance services to SSI in the engineering, metal working,
plastics, woodworking and furniture working trades; (ii) skill upgrading of
workers in engineering, metal working, woodworking and furniture trades;



- 10 -
(iii) industrial management training for owners and managers of small
industry; and (iv) accelerated training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers
in the engineering trades. The first three components were implemented by
EIDDC in Cairo and the fourth component by the Productivity and Vocational
Training Department (PVT) of the Ministry of Industry in Cairo and
Alexandria. Many of the assisted SSI's were or became clients of DIB. The
Government granted, in addition to the subloan, LE 200,000 for the local
currency costs of the program. The subloan agreement between DIB and the
Government was not concluded until May 1979 and subsequently further delays
occurred in hiring the technical extension expert for EIDDC who began work in
May 1980, and other delays occurred in obtaining local currency funds from the
Government. The delays caused cost increases which curtailed the scope of the
pilot program to a year instead of the 18 months planned and EIDDC could not
implement the management development component of the pilot program. In spite
of these difficulties, the program was found to be sound in its original
concept and design and was appreciated very much by the beneficiary firms.
Additional funding was arranged through UNDP and Bank funds from an existing
loan to continue the pilot program to June 30, 1982. The second stage of the
program was continued with another $1 million sub-loan under the Bank's fifth
Loan 2074-EGT, and the third stage of the program will continue under the
Bank's sixth loan to DIB. The close co-operation between DIB and EIDDC was
formalized in a protocol between them.  Up to December 31, 1986, some 3,758
i           enterprise visits were made over 5 years to 2,000 SMIs.  Assistance rendered
has covered consultation in production, costing, feasibility and market
studies, record-keeping, finar:ial, technical and general management.  As of
1982, the number of SMI's was estimated at 7,000 and growing at the rate of
500 a year. After these past seven years or so when the EIDDC program has
been effective, it appears that the effort and determination of EIDDC (which
has been enhanced by the permanence and high quality of the management), DIB
and the Bank to establish a modern technical assistance facility for SSI in
Egypt has been very successful. The return on a relatively small budget has
been very high. EIDDC today can be used for other countries at a similar
stage of SSI development as a good example.
V. DIB's Operational and Financial Performance
32.        A breakdown of DIB term loan approvals over the years 1980-86 is
shown in Annex 1. Engineering, chemicals, building and construction, food and
textiles constituted 16 to 17 percent each of total approvals. Much smaller
percentages were given to paper and printing, wood, leather, and tourism which
had been phased out. Overall this spread is satisfactory, covering all
segments of manufacturing industry in Egypt. Cairo Zone received the largest
share at 37% of the loans and, on the whole, the loans were well spread
geographically. As to maturity, 5 to 10 year loans constituted 531 and 3 to 5
year loans 382. As to size, 47% of the loans were for LE 500,000 or under
(Annex 7), reflecting DIB'c focus on small scale industry.
33.        DIB equity participations have amounted to only LE 8.7 million to
ten companies, in the banking field, building materials, food and leasing.
DIB promotional effort has been non-existant. Due to the excesses of the
nationalized banks in 1975 in promoting poorly planned and low feasibility
investments, the present process of authorizing a government bank to invest in
equity is long and complicated, and has to pass through the Government
Organization for Industrialization (GOFI), CBE, the Capital Market Authority
and the Council of Ministers, a process that would take 6 months or longer.



- 11 -
Enterpreneurs, who in any event are reluctant to take a Government bank as a
partner, are not prepared to delay their investment for 6 months. This has
affected DIB's efforts in equity investment as it contends that project
promotion without investment would not attract entrepreneurs. It is clear,
however, that DIB needs to take a broader view of promotional activities. It
would do well to identify and prepare profiles for potentially viable projects
in sectors where Egypt has a comparative advantage. Currently, DIB does not
have inhouse expertise to move forward systematically with project promotion
but it could secure assistance from known Egyptian experts specializing in
particular industrial subsectors.
34.        Judging from the following indicators of profitability, liquidity
and solvency, DIB is financially sound (Annex 8 & 9). The debt/equity ratio,
however, has exceeded the limit of 8 agreed with the Bank under the loans.
DIB was to have a capital increase in 1984, btt so far it has not been paid by
the Government.l/

Arrears
35.      Arrears which were relatively low until 1982 (below 2% of total
portfolio) have increased rapidly since 1983, as shown in the table below
( Annpx 1 n !

(v)  (iii) as 2 of (i)                 1.72             4.52
DIB has carried a conservative provision policy: loan loss provisions
amounting to LE 64 million cover 14% of the portfolio, while total arrears
represent 4.5X and loans affected by arrears 121 of the portfolio. Besides,
DIB secures ample collaterals which, as a result of inflation, constantly
increase in value, and there is no immediate danger at present to DIB
financial health. Unless the growth of arrears is checked, erosion of the
portfolio may go on beyc-d the ability to create provisions. DIB has recently
stepped up its follow-up activities and already, as a percentage of the
portfolio, arrears have declined to from 192 in 1985 to 12% in 1986.

36.      The follow-up department has now 18 staff members who are assisted by
the follow-up staff of the three branches and by the engineering department,
when necessary. This complex has 3,200 clients to monitor. A rehabilitation
sub-departmeait has been created which is constantly working with defaulting
entrepreneurs to find a solution for their problems. If the issues are
technical and managerial, DIB would use EIDDC or other consultants; if the
issues are regulatory, DIB would intervene with the Government departments
and, if necessary, find other entrepreneurs to take over. A report on arrears
is reviewed quarterly by the DIB Board and, once a year for several weeks, the
heads of interested departments meet in a special committee to examine the
profiles prepared for every company in default. DIB has asked the Management
Consulting Center in the Cairo University to provide advisory services on
rehabilitation and is sending staff to other development banks to observe
their salvage operations.
VI. Conclusions
37.      The objectives of the two loans have been achieved successfully as:
(i) a large number of private enterprises have received foreign exchange loans
for feasible projects on appropriate terms, which would have normally been out
of their reach; (ii) DIB has become the paramount lender of private industrial
term loans by phasing out public sector projects. The direct and indirect
assistance of the Bank has achieved the purpose of turning DIB into a
financially strong and competent institution for appraisal and supervision of
industrial projects in Egypt; (iii) as a by-product of these loans, EIDDC, has
been equipped to provide alongside DIB's financing, exttnsion services,
managerial and technical assistance, information services, and sub-contracting
opportunities to small scale enterprises, which not only helped increase
production and employment, but formed the nucleus of larger competitive
enterprises of the future.
38.      In the financial and institutional environment of Egypt in the
seventies and early eighties, the policy of the Bank to support DIB to finance
private sector industrial projects particularly for the SSI was appropriate.
In the first ten years of its life, DIB made much progress in raising its
standards of project appraisal and loan supervision.  It ensured that project
implementation, despite time and cost overruns, was undertaken which required
that the financial package for each project was put together. In the future,
this policy needs to be adjusted. DIB would not be able to maintain its role
as a full-fledged development bank with high reputation and prestige, until it
develops capabilities for: (i) mobilizing substantial resources, in Egypt and
abroad, from sources independent of official financial institutions;
(ii) demonstrating entrepreneurship and promoting projects in new sectors and
regions to broaden industrial development, and helping to develop technology,
markets and modern management in Egypt through assisting foreign investors and
joining joint-venture enterprises; (iii) channeling public savings into
investment in worthwhile industrial enterprises by helping and supplementing
the activities of the authorities for a broader capital market. The Bank
through its future loans to DIB and its continuing dialogue with the
authorities could help remove the obstacles in regulations and in financial
environment and assist DIB in further strengthening its organization to
undertake the above functions.



- 13 -
39.      DIB has been encouraged to become the major, indeed the only
significant, lender to SSIs. The risks of SSI lending are heavy and DIB, as a
matter of self-protection, has had to adopt stringent loan conditions which
only the strongest of the SSIs can comply with. The others, the majority,
have no source of financial help. DIB, a single institution with only owo
branches, cannot be expected to adequately cover this large sector alore. A
broader, more sector-oriented approach, which would include the commercial
banking network with its 600 offices spread through the cotntry, is now
clearly desirable. This is a matter which the Bank and the Government should
now address. EIDDC has a critical role to play in this respect. It would
need to widen its services, assisting and supporting the entire process of SSI
development.
40.      In addition to the three objectives in para 38, DIB could carry out
research into sectors of industry and their requirements for future growth.
This deepening of DIB's developmental activities has clearly become necessary
for its progress as a development bank. While DIB is expected to continue to
remain the Bank's prime channel for assistance to the private sector, the
development of a sectoral strategy would strengthen this relationship at a
time when the Bank itself is taking a broader approach to the policy
requirements of industry.2/
41.      A number of lessons can be drawn from the Bank's experience with
DIB III and IV:
(a)   Advisors.
The job of a management advisor is very demanding and sensitive,
and often is not welcomed by the management of the borrowers. At
the time the DIB III Loan was made, the Bank was rightly
convinced of the need in DIB for a management and a technical
adviser. DIB management welcomed the idea and requested that
members of the Bank staff be seconded. This was not possible.
As other agencies financed DIB's advisers, the Bank was not able
to influenece the choice of the advisors or their performance in
DIB. The result was that some years passed before satisfactory
advisory services were provided. The Bank needs to be more
actively involved in making its views known with respect to the
selection of advisors and their TORs even when this assistance is
financed by other agencies. The Bank, through its supervision
process, can adequately monitor the performance of advisors.
(b)   EIDDC and technical assistance to SSI.
The continuity and performance of EIDDC would remain an important
issue as long as its financial resources are not assured on a
permanent basis. The survival of EIDDC technical assistance to
SSI still depends on Bank Loans and delays in effectiveness of
such loans have hampered its smooth operation. In any further
loan to private industry, the Bank could look for ways to make
EIDDC more self-sufficient than it now is.
(c)   SSI Loans
Elaborate formulas and precise percentages were used to persuade
DIB to devote an increasingly large part of its financial
2/ Recent developments within DIB are described in Annex 11, page 2.



- 14 -
resources for loans to SSI. However, it is not always practical
or necessarily desirable for an ongoing institution to refuse or
delay lending to valuable projects in order to meet specific
percentages required by the Bank.  In addition, the SSI targets
are difficult to reach since DIB had only or.> or two branches to
meet the financial needs of a very large number of widely
scattered SSI. For the future, lending through one or more
commercial banks with a widespread branch network, in addition
to DIB, would allow a better coverage of the SSI Sector.3/
(d)   Foreign Exchange and Interest Rates
The assumption that the exchange rate would be periodically
adjusted to reflect market forces was not borne out by
experience. A better appreciation of the implied subsidy
resulting from the Government's exchange rate policy would have
limited the burden on the Government and the danger of
misallocation of resources. The agreement likely to be reached
under Loan "458-EGT is expected to minimize this issue.
(e)   Resource Mobilization
In hindsight, particularly at the time Loan 2458-EGT and,
perhaps, even 2074t-EGT were being processed, the Bank could have
been more insistent on DIB borrowing from the international and
domestic financial markets. It is critical for DIB, as a
financial institution and a development bank, to broaden its
borrowing base.
(f)   Project Promotion and Capital Market Development.
The focus during DIB III and IV on institutional building was
well placed and explained why little attention was paid to DIB's
business development role. DIB has reached a level of maturity
and experience which It can now use to develop its role in
project promotion and capital market development.
