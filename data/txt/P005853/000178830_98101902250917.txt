REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CEEDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL PROJECI IN THE WADI HADRAMAWT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed devel-
opment credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), for the
equivalent of US$7.0 million on standard terms, to help finance an agricultural
project in Wadi Hadramawt. An amount of US$2.8 million of the credit would be
onlent to the National Bank of Yemen at not less than 3 percent interest, re-
payable in 12 years, including 2 years of grace to be used for subloans to
agricultural organizations in the project area.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen" (189a-YDR), dated November 7, L973, was
distributed to the Executive Directors on November 15, 1973 (R73-262). An up-
dating mission visited the country in October 1975 and its findings al-e re-
flected below. The next economic mission to PDRY is scheduled for the first
quarter of 1976. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        PDRY became independent in 1967.   Building an effective Government ad-
ministration then became an immediate need. With a sudden loss of expatriate
administrators, and the subsequent emigration of a number of educated Yemenis
following internal political struggles, this was a difficult task in the short-
term. However, considerable progress has been made in recent years in building
up public sector administration. Government policies give a leading role to the
public sector. Nationalization of the banking and insurance sectors, of port
services, of petroleum distribution, and of office and residential buildings,
combined with the establishment of state trading companies, brought a large part
of service activities into the public sector. In the industrial sector, public
corporations have built a number of new plants (e.g., textiles, flour milling,
dairy products), while others are shortly to be completed (e.g., cement, fabric,
glass). Agrarian reform has restructured agriculture, and most producers are
now organized in cooperatives and state farms.
4.        Political and social change since independence coincided with an
economic recession. The withdrawal of BrLtish forces in 1967 and the closure
of the Suez Canal in the same year, left the modern service-oriented Economy
concentrated in and around Aden with an a3proximately 30 percent smaller re-
gional income and roughly 20,000 people wLthout employment. Total GDI dropped
by perhaps 20 percent between 1966 and 1968 and virtually stagnated in subse-
quent years. However, agriculture, the slbsistence mainstay for some two-thirds
of PDRY's estimated population of 1.6 milLion, was little affected as the
countryside had only been marginally tour-hed by the administration prior to
independence. GNP per capita was probably about $110 in 1973. Since then,
production appears to have increased at a moderate rate.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



5.         In the face of these difficult-es, budgetary policies have been ef-
fective. Revenue increased from YD 10.4 million ($25 million) in 1969/70 to
about YD 22 million ($62 million) in 1971/75, following new taxes and improved
collection. Severe measures were taken to contain expenditures partly through
heavy salary cuts imposed on the civil service and the armed and security
forces. However, the need for expansion of education, health, social ser-
vices and government administration outside Aden, and price stabilization
of essential foodstuffs, have absorbed the rise in revenues.
6.        The cessation of British budgetary grants and the withdrawal of the
British forces immediately following the country's independence in 1967 put
the balance of payments under severe prersure. This pressure was subsequently
reduced by the substantial inflow of transfers from Yemenis working abroad,
some foreign aid, stringent import control measures, and the establishment
of small import substitution industries. However, since 1973 the rise in oil
prices and the international inflation which affected the prices of imports
have resulted in a worsening of the balance of payments. The current account
deficit for 1974 is estimated at $90 million, compared to $38 million in 1973
and $20 million in 1972. A substantial rise in net inflows of non-monetary
capital of about $56 million in 1974 and the utilization of the IMF Oil Facility
could not fuLly offset the current account deficit, and foreign assets declined
by an estimated $4 million in that year, leaving international reserves equiv-
alent to about 5 months of 1974 retained imports. The precarious balance of
payments situation continued during 1975 although no precise information has
yet become available.
7.        With its heavy dependence on imports, PDRY's economic difficulties
have been accentuated since 1973 by the rise in international prices, partic-
ularly of imported fuels and foodstuffs.    They have increased domestic infla-
tionary pressures, and affected unfavorably PDRY's ability to finance essential
development projects, as their foreign exchange costs increased sharply. Do-
mestic prices rose 24 percent in 1974, compared with 16 percent in 1973 and
with 5 percent annually in previous years. PDRY's net imports of petroleum
were estimated to have increased to about $33 million in 1974 from $9 million
in 1973, despite the Government's effort to keep the volume of imports in 1974
at the same level as in the previous year. Measures to curb demand included
increases in gasoline prices, higher power rates and cutbacks in power supplies.
The PDRY has been included in the UN list of Most Seriously Affected Countries
and received $11 million from the IMF Oil Credit Facility in 1974. OAPEC
provided another $11 million to finance oil imports.
8.         The Government has been making serious efforts to diversify the
economy and to lessen the country's dependence on the Aden-based serv4 ce
sectors. Within the context of PDRY's first Three-Year Development Plan
(1971/72-1973/74) and its current Five-Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79), the Govern-
ment has initiated major investment programs in agriculture and fishing, both
sectors with considerable development potential. It also started extensive
exploration programs for mineral resources, including oil; promoted sniall-scale
industrial activities; built power statiois; and expanded the country's trans-
port infrastructure, especially roads. T;Aese efforts have helped to b,roaden



the productive base of PDRY's economy, to reduce unemployment in urban areas
and to start improving living conditions of the rural population.
9.         Since domestic financial, as well as managerial and technical re-
sources are extremely limited, much of the public investment has in the past
been financed and implemented with foreign assistance. The six projects fi-
nanced by the Association are outlined in para. 15. The Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development has joined the Association in financing the Mukalla-Wadi
Hadramawt road and is currently financing a project to increase production,
especially of cotton, in the Abyan Delta. The Arab Fund for Social and Economic
Development is financing a fish processing project in Al Mukalla. It also
joined the Association in the Aden Port Rehabilitation Project and is currently
considering a road project linking Aden with Taiz in the Yemen Arab Rapublic.
The People's Republic of China is constructing the Am Ayn-Mukalla roal, to be
completed in 1977. The USSR has financed irrigation works in the Wadi Tuban
area. A textile factory is being completed with Chinese assistance aad a flour
mill with the help of the German Democratic Republic. Oil exploratioa is
underway with the collaboration of the Algerian company SONATRACH, thea USSR and
a Canadian firm, and mineral exploration is undertaken with help from the USSR
and the Abu D)habi Fund. Additional contracts with Western firms to pirsue oil
and mineral exploration are being considered. The UNDP is conducting a fish-
eries survey and assisting in education, health and road projects. Schools and
hospitals are being built with the help of the Kuwaiti and Libyan Governments.
Efforts have also been intensified to obtain aid from Western Europe and from
other Arab oilproducing countries. Diplomatic relations with the Federal Re-
public of Germany, severed during the 1967 Middle East war, have been resumed
recently, and new contacts have been made with Arab oil-producing countries in
the Gulf, such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.
10.       The rate of implementation of the first Three-Year Plan, which envis-
aged total investment of $119 million, started slowly but accelerated quickly.
During the first year of the Plan (1971/72), only $11 million, or about one-
third of the planned amount was actually spent. The lag in implementation
reflected difficulties in project preparation and in negotiations with bila-
teral aid donors, as well as scarcities of local skills for efficient project
execution. These difficulties are progressively being overcome and actual
disbursements rose to $25 million in 1972/73 and $35 million in 1973/'4.
The average expenditure rate for the Three-Year Plan reached 79 percent of
target.
11.       In the present Five-Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79), with a total invest-
ment target equivalent to $219 million, the Government intensified its develop-
ment efforts with more emphasis on agricuLture and fisheries projects and envis-
aged the construction of roads to connect the various governorates with Aden,
as well as to link towns in the hinterland. Investment in 1974/75 rose to



- 4 -
1975 (April to December) was increased to $96 million, partly to offset price
rises. These expenditures stimulated the economy, created new productive cap-
acity and increased value added.    In fisheries, the most dynamic sector, output
has continued to expand at an annual rate of over 6 percent in real terms, and
its quality has improved. Agriculture has benefited from the expansion of the
road network, from completion of several projects to increase irrigated areas,
from intensification of cropping patterns, and improvement of seed varieties.
In industry, several new, mostly import substituting factories have been estab-
lished (e.g., textile, plastic wares, aluminum housewares).
12.       The authorities expect that during 1976 economic activity will con-
tinue to expand. The increase in traffic in Aden Port as a result of the
reopening of the Suez Canal is expected to boost service activities includ-
ing ship bunkcering. Rising investments uill provide new employment oppor-
tunities and further stimulate output in the commodity producing sectors.
13.       PDRY's total external debt at the end of 1974 was about $24) mil-
lion of which $94 million was disbursed. The major creditors were China
(with disbursement of $21 million), the USSR ($21 million), Libya ($12 mil-
lion), Traq ($11 million), Germany,    D.R. ($8 million), and Algeria (j6 mil-
lion). All aid to PDRY has been extended on concessionary terms and the
debt service ratio is estimated to be 2.5 percent of exports of goods and
services, and remittances, in 1974. About two-thirds of foreign assistance
was provided in the form of capital goods for specific projects. In view of
the limited resources of the country, low per capita income, and the severe
constraints on the Government budget and the balance of payments, Bank Group
assistance to PDRY should continue to be on IDA terms. For the same reasons,
local cost financing by IDA is justified.
14.       In 1969, under the Nationalization Law No. 37, the Government na-
tionalized most of the foreign-owned enterprises (mainly banks, insurance
companies and port services), but not the refinery and bunkering facilities
in the port. This Law provided for compensation in the form of 20-year
Government bonds bearing interest of 2 percent. Twenty-five percent of the
net annual profits of all these nationalized companies were to be used for
servicing these bonds. In response, some of the foreign banks which were
nationalized froze substantial Yemeni deposits which they had transferred
abroad.   Immediately after the promulgation of Law No. 37, the Government
appointed a British firm of accountants of international repute to audit the
accounts of all the nationalized companies and evaluate their assets. The
audit report was submitted to the Government in September 1971. Settle-
ments have since been reached with three of the foreign banks involved and
discussions with a fourth one are underway. Some claimants have not found
the conditions offered by the Government to be satisfactory, and some debtors
have until recently made no response to tae Government's efforts to settle
claims but now have resumed the dialogue with the Government. The Government
professes its desire to reach a mutually satisfactory solution with all claimant
companies. It has offered to negotiate with the governments of the companies
concerned on the understanding that all claims on and of the Government on these
companies are settled once and for all. It has also expressed its willingness
to consider such settlement outside the terms of the 1969 Nationalization Law.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       The proposed credit for an agr:cultural project in the Wadi Hadramawt
will be the Association's seventh operat;on in PDRY, bringing the total IDA
commitments to $37.8 million. PDRY joined the Bank in 1969, and IDA in 1970.
Assistance to PDRY commenced in 1971, uncder the first Highway Project ($1.6
million) which provided funds for feasibility studies and detailed engineering,
some maintenance equipment and technical assistance to the Ministry of Public
Works. A Highway Engineering Credit ($0.6 million) in 1972 financed an ex-
tension of the technical assistance and the detailed engineering of additional
roads, and was later refinanced under the Second Highway Project. The Fisheries
Project ($3.5 million) in 1973 and the Education Prject ($5.4 million) in 1974
were the Association's first investment projects in PDRY. A Supplementary
Credit ($1.6 million) for the Fisheries Project to help finance anticipated
cost overruns was approved by the Executive Directors in January 1975. Sub-
sequently, a credit of $15.5 million was approved in May 1975 to finance
a Second Highway Project, which includes construction of 358 km of road be-
tween Mukalla and Wadi Hadramawt prepared under the First Highway Project and
the Highway Engineering Credit. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development
participates in financing this project with a loan of $15.3 million equivalent.
Lastly a credit of $3.2 million to finance an Aden Port Rehabilitation Project
providing for essential equipment items to enable the port to serve iacreased
ship traffic (following the reopening of the Suez Canal) was approved on August
21, 1975. The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development extended a loan
of $13.6 million equivalent for this project. Annex II contains a summary
statement of IDA credits as of December 21, 1975, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
16.       The Association's lending program in PDRY aims mainly at supporting
the Government's long-range economic objective of broadening the base of a
service-oriented economy centered around Aden, by developing the productive
capacity of the other sectors of the economy and spreading investments in
the various regions. It also includes assistance for PDRY to take advantage
of the opportunity offered by the reopening of the Suez Canal to increase
foreign exchange earnings and employment in the short- to medium-term. Efforts
have been directed towards projects in the transport sector, which would not
only help to integrate the disparate regions of PDRY, but more importantly,
link production areas with the main markets. Other sectors where the Associa-
tion has assisted and will continue to assist, are in the fields of education
and training and in agricultural, including the key fisheries subsector.
Technical assistance and institution-building will continue to be an integral
feature in the Association's projects in PDRY.
17.       Future operations are still in the study stage.     A second agricul-
tural project may result from an ongoing UNDP/FAO-sponsored study for the Wadi
Tuban area. A second fisheries project (based in a less-developed region of
PDRY) is being studied for possible lending in future years. Studies to



- 6 -
prepare a third hiighway project and a further agricultural project are included
under ongoing operations. As in the recEnt past, the costs of future projects
are expected to be substantially higher thani the amounts the Association can
provide to PORY.  Therefore, efforts will be continued to encourage Arab and
other development agencies to join the Association in thie financing of suitable
projects.  In this way, IDA projects would act as a catalyst [or increasing the
inflow of development aid to this country.   PDRY is not a member of INC.
PART III - AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND PROJECT AREA
General
18.       PDRY's generally mountainous ard desertic topograhy, the arid
climate with high temperatures and littlc precipitation, and the absence of
permanent water streams limit agricultural production to some 12 scattered
wadis with a total area of about 90,000 ha (or 0.3 percent of the country-s
land surface), which predominantly depend on seasonal floods. Although two-
thirds of the population Live in rural areas, the agricultural sector, includ-
ing the well-endowed and fast developing fisheries subsector, contributes only
some 20 percent to the GNP and about 12 percent to exports.    More than half
the cultivated area is planted with cereals, and the remainder with cotton,
the main export commodity, fodder crops, fruits, dates, and vegetables.    Food
production is mainly subsistence-based with only a modest marketable surplus.
Food imports are abouLt one-third of all imports and nearly four times agricul-
tural exports. Wheat imports amount to some 40,000 tons or more than twice
the total voLtume of domestic wheat production.
19.       A ,hanue of the traditional land tenure system to eliminate share
cropping and redistribute land to landless tenants and other target groups was
a major aim of the Government after independence. An Agrarian Reform Law,
issued in 1970, is heing administered1 by a central committee in the Ministry of
Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (tIAAR). It limitts private ownership co 8 ha of
irrigated land and to 16 hna of rainfed land, with thc Covernioent taking over all
land above these ceilings and redistributing it to landless rural workers, small
farmers and urban poor who were willing to resettle in rural areas as main
beneficiaries.   Redistributed lands were reorganized as producers' cooperative
farms and state farms.   Expropriated agricultural equipment was given to newly
established Machine Renting Stations (MRSs), wells and irrigation equipment to
cooperative and state farms, with their operation and maintenance being as-
signed to the "RSs against a fee.   Establishlmenit, organization and operation
of cooperative farms was further defined -in the Cooperative Law of 1972, which
among others provides that members contribute to the cooperative's expenses
with a fee corresponding to 3 percent of the gross value of cereal anc vegetable
production.  While production on cooperative farms is still largely suibsistence
oriented, state farms have been assigned a l(ading role for agricultural develop-
ment. The land they received under the agrarian reform is being expanded by



newly irrigated areas. They own agricultural equipment and only occasionally
rent from MRSs. In most areas they function as seed multiplication farms and
also as demonstration farms and receive substantial technical guidance from the
UNDP/FAO assisted Research and Training Station in El-Kod.
20.       The Government maintains strict control over commodity prices and
the cost of cash inputs. Producer prices are generally in line with [nterna-
tional market prices. All major agricultural commodities are marketed
through the National Company for Home and Foreign Trade (NCHFT) and t'e
Horticulture Cooperative Union (HCU). The NCHFT, which is responsible for
the marketing of cereals and for their import and distribution, performs its
functions through local procurement centers and a chain of wholesale and
retail points. The HCU, responsible for marketing fruits and vegetables
and for their imports, operates local branches, retail stores and also
through private retailers. Agricultural production is comparatively heavily
taxed (15 percent on gross value of cereal production and 5 percent on gross
value of vegetable production), but most cash inputs carry substantial sub-
sidies. The fees charged by MRSs do not cover the cost of their services.
Agricultural and irrigation equipment (for which the NCHFT is the sole im-
porter) is largely financed by the Government and handed over to MRSs, state
farms and cooperative farms. Average prices of fertilizers and insecticides
(imported and distributed by the HCU) are below world market prices reflecting
foreign grants in kind to the Government.
21.       Low-cost credit is a main vehicle the Government uses to encourage
development of agriculture and other productive sectors and to promote pro-
gress in the areas outside Aden. Interest rates are set by the Board of
Directors of the banking system and approved by the Council of Ministers.
For credits with productive purposes, the maximum rate of interest is pre-
sently 5 percent p.a.; although in exceptional circumstances (e.g., high
yielding projects such as IDA's Fisheries Project - Credit 370-YDR) interest
rates of up to 6 percent p.a. have been allowed. Interest rates have only
a limited function for the allocation of resources in PDRY's centrally
managed economy and therefore present low rates are unlikely to lead t:o
misuse of scarce capital funds. Nevertheless, an increase of interest: rates
might conceivably be able to improve mobilization of domestic resources.
The forthcoming economic mission will therefore review the level of interest
rates on agricultural credits as part of the Government's total system of
incentives and fiscal charges to farmers and its findings will subsequently
be reviewed with the Government. Agricultural credit is presently available
from the National Bank of Yemen (NBY) generally at interest rates of up to
5 percent p.a. and from MAAR's Agricultural Development Fund at highly sub-
sidized interest rates of 1 percent and 2 percent (medium-term credits to
state and cooperative farmers). In addition, both NCHFT and HCU occasionally
extend short-term suppliers credits at low interest.
22.       Agricultural research is carried out by the UNDP/FAO assisted re-
search station at El-Kod and a few sub-staions. The main emphasis is on
applied research on new varieties of cotton and wheat. Pre and in-service



- 8 -
training is being given to students and farmers, including most of the staff
of the MAAR, complementing higher agricultural education offered by the
Nasser High Institute of Agriculture in Lahej. To cope with the serious
shortage of trained manpower on cooperative farms, a Cooperative Education
and Training Center has been set up with support from UNDP/ILO. Farm
machinery and rural skills centers and rural development centers in key
agricultural areas are also being providEd under the IDA Education PrDject
(Credit 494-YAR).
23.       Development of agriculture and fisheries was assigned highest
priority in the current 1974/75-1978/79 Plan with an allocation of US'90
million, or over 40 percent of the total planned investment. Agriculcure
alone is to receive two-thirds of this amount.    The Plan envisages an in-
crease in grain, cotton and vegetable prcduction through increased yialds
and expansion of the cultivated area by about 20,000 ha, during the PLan
period. The Government's agricultural investment policy in the past em-
phasized the development of the productive areas in the Second and Third
Governorates (around Aden), which have more regular rainfall than othar
parts of the Republic, and which have adequate access to the main markets
in Aden. Extensive flood water irrigation systems were built in the 'Wadi
Tuban and the Abyan Delta (Wadi Bena and Wadi Hassan) with assistance from
USSR and the Kuwait Fund respectively. Efforts in these areas are con-
tinuing under the present plan, with a view both to expansion of the
irrigated areas and the combined use of flood and groundwater which would
make two harvests per year possible. In the Fourth and Fifth Governorates,
the progressive extension of the transport system also offers opportunities
for development of important agricultural areas further away from Aden,
particularly those which will be served by the Aden-Mukalla road, under con-
struction with assistance from the People's Republic of China, and the
Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt road under construction with financing from Credit
560-YDR and a Kuwait Fund loan.
Wadi Hadramawt
24.       The 1972 feasibility study for the Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt road proj-
ect had highlighted the possibilities for agricultural development in the Wadi
and prompted the Government to request the Associaton's assistance in identi-
fying and preparing an agricultural project in the area. Accordingly, pro-
vision for a study to establish groundwater and soil data was included under
the 1973 Fisheries Credit 370-YDR.    However, an FAO-IBRD/CP mission which
visited the area later that year concluded that the best course of action was
to improve as a first step the use of existing water resources and produc-
tion techniques and to do a more comprehensive study than originally antici-
pated to prepare an agricultural expansion project in the future. In line with
this concept, this Wadi Hadramawt Agricultural Project aims at increasing pro-
duction in existing cultivated areas and also includes funding for the compre-
hensive Wadi Hadramawt Development Study to explore groundwater sources and
their potential in the valley and to prepare a scheme for their development.
Parallel to the development of the Wadi itself, a UN-sponsored rural development
project for the Hadramawt and northern areas addresses itself to the needs of
the Bedouins in the deserts surrounding the Wadi Hadramawt.



- 9 -
25.        The Wadi, about 100 km long and between 2 and 10 km wide has an
average altitude of 600 meters and is bordered by flat-topped cliffs rising
to the main plateau of 1400 to 1800 m. Its cultivated area of 8,500 ha ac-
counts for almost 10 percent of the country's productive agricultura] area.
The climate is hot and arid, rainfall is erratic and spotty, and agriculture,
which provides the livelihood for the Wadi's population of about 180,000
(about 11 percent of the country's total population) depends heavily on well
irrigation. Some 8,000 ha irrigated from 2152 open wells and 102 tutlewells,
are cultivated by five farm cooperatives (covering 95 percent of thiP area)
and four state farms (covering 5 percent of this area). In addition, about
500 ha are under spate irrigation every year. The main crops are wheat and
sorghum which together occupy 70 percent of the cultivated area, the remainder
being occupied by alfalfa, vegetables an(d sesame. There are some 400,000
date palms in the area about half of whifh are interplanted with crops on
well-irrigated land. Farming techniques are antiquated and extension services
are limited to occasional visits of expe:-ts from El-Kod to a small research
substation in Seyun and to the state farms. Irrigation and agricultural
equipment available on the farms and from the MRS is insufficient and largely
obsolete. Fertilizer supply is severely rationed and applied only to a high
yield wheat variety (grown in a third of the wheat area) in less than optimal
dosage; insecticides are not used at all, As a result, yields and productiv-
ity are generally low. The Wadi's rural population of 60,000 is underemployed
during most of the year and, although production costs are heavily subsidized,
the average cooperative member is left with a farm income of only $385 per
year, or $70 per head for the average family of 5.5. This compares with
an average of over $110 per capita for the country as a whole.
26.       With adequate supply of fertilizers, which would make growing of
high yielding wheat and sorghum varieties; possible throughout the area, and
with proper use of insecticides and pest: cides, and improved production tech-
niques, yields of all present field crops could about double. The related
water requirement for the presently cult-ivated area (plus a 1,030 ha expansion
of state farm land, which the Government is currently developing with Russian
assistance by installing 43 new tubewells) would increase from the present
level of 128 m3 to about 160 m3 and could be met by extending pumping hours.
The additional production could easily be absorbed on the domestic market, much
of it in the Fifth Governorate, and would make it possible to reduce imports
of supply commodities.
PART IV - THE l'ROJECT
Project History
27.       The project was identified during an IBRD-FAO/CP mission which
visited PDRY In November 1973. The agricultural project was prepared by
staff of CP and Government appraised in January/February 1975. Negotiations
were held in Washington in December 1975. PDRY's negotiating delegaton was

headed by Mr. Farag bin Ghanem, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of P'lan-
ning, and included representatives of MAAR and the Attorney-General's Office,
and the designated project co-director. An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal
of Wadi Hadramawt Agricultural ProJect (No. 847a-YDR), dated January 12, 1976,
is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. A Credit and
Project Summary is attaclhed as Annex III.
Project Description
28.       The project provides (i) agricultural equipment and farm implements
to the local MRS and to state farms; (ii) irrigation equipment to cooperative
farms; (iii) fertilizer and insecticide to state and cooperative farms; (iv)
construction of about 120 km of feeder roads; (v) water supply systems around
the towns of Shibam and Qatn; (vi) establishment by the HCU of a date fumiga-
tion and packing plant near Seyun; (vii) a feasibility study to determine
the agricultural development potential of the Wadi; (viii) support to agri-
cultural research programs in the area; and (ix) project organization, in
cluding an agricultural extenlsion service, and technical assistance for proj-
ect management and training.
29.       The project represents the first phase in the development of the
Wadi Hadramawt region and aims at converting present subsistence agriculture
in the area to the production of marketable surpluses in support of the Gov-
ernment's long term objective to make the country self sufficient in food
supplies. It will increase productivity of present crop production by sup-
plementing existing agricultural and irrigation equipment, including replace-
ment of worn-out items, and by providing fert:ilizers and insecticides. The
feeder roads under the project would connect villages and production reas
withi the main Qatc-Tarirn road and thereby facilitate the movement of agricul-
tural inputs and outputs and ease the present isolation of village dwellers.
The date fumigation and packing plant would improve quality and marke:ability
as well as reduce spoilage of dates during transport to the urban markets and
thereby make local produce competitive with imports.     The feasibility study,
to be partly financed under the Fisheries Project (Credit 370-YDR), will ex-
plore groundwater resources in the Wadi to create the basis for agricuiltural
expansion in thle future.  The project's investment component will be supported
by research programs and technical assistance, consisting of three experts
for about 3 years and short-term training of Yemeni experts abroad. The ex-
perts will make up the core of the project implementation unit (para. 31), and
with the help of Yemeni counterparts and extension officers will advise farmers
in modern production technicues. In addition, the project will improve health
conditions of some 40,000 people in the towns of Shiham and Qatn and neighboring
villages by providing potable water.
30.       The Government will. relend $2.8 million of the proceeds of the Credit
to NBY which will, in turn, make subloans to finance the purchase of the equip-
ment and supplies provided under the Project by tlhe MRS and the state and coopera-
tive farms. Subloans for agricultural and irrigation equipment would be at
5-1/2 percent p.a. interest and for terms of 5 to 7 years; those for fertili-
zer and insecticides at 6 percent p.a. interest for periods of up to 1 year.
Similarly, the HCU will receive a subLoan from the NBY for the establishment of



the date packing plant, at 5 percent p.a, interest and for 10 years. The
interest rates on the subloans are in line with those NBY currently charges
on agricultural credits for similar purposes and although low, are acceptable
in the special circumstances of the PDRY (para. 21). NBY will repay the Gov-
ernment with 3 percent annual interest over a period of 12 years. The dif-
ference in the terms of subloans and repe.yments to the Government would
cover NBY's administrative expenses and the risk of possible defaults in the
repayment of some of the subloans. Any future upward adjustment of NBY's*
interest rates would also be applied to Lhe project subloans and its repayment
terms to the Government. Execution of the Subsidiary Credit Agreement will be
a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 5.01(b) of draft Credit Agreement).
Project Execution
31.       The overall responsibility for implementation of the project will
be the Planning Department of the IlAAR. The department would discharge this
responsibility through the Hadramawt Project Organization (HPO) to be set up
in Seyun and to be staffed with three key experts, including a project direc-
tor provided under the project, a Yemeni co-director who has already been de-
signated and who participated in negotiations, and seventeen Yemeni officers,
including an agriculturalist, and engineer and an accountant. A local ad-
visory committee will be set up to advise the HPO on local affairs and to
involve loca:L authorities in project management. Agreement was obtained
from the Government that it will (i) select and employ the three key experts
in agreement with IDA within six months of the credit (Section 3.03(c) of
draft Credit Agreement); (ii) appoint the Yemeni co-director in consuLtation
with IDA (Section 3.03(c)(ii) of draft Credit Agreement); (iii) establish HPO
and appoint the three Yemeni experts as conditions of credit effectiveness
(Sections (3.03(a) and (c)(iii) and 5.01(a) of draft Credit Agreement);
and (iv) establish the local advisory committee with appropriate membership
within three months of credit effectiveness (Section 3.04 of draft Credit
Agreement).
32.       The HPO will carry out detailed planning of all project activities
as well as be responsible for their timely implementation. HPO will appraise
the technical aspects of applications for subloans to NBY and prepare technical
specifications and procurement documents for all project items, with the ex-
ception of the date packing plant. Plans for this plant will be worked out by
the HCU with the assistance of a date production and processing expert provided
under the project and subsequently be approved by HPO. HPO will work in close
contact with the existing research substation to implement the research pro-
grams under the project and to render technical advice to farmers. UNDP has
agreed that the HPO could be assisted in its tasks by advice from a drilling
expert and a forestry expert currently employed in PDRY on UN projects. The
Government's agreement was obtained that [t will confirm these arrangements
with the UNDP (Section 3.10 of draft Credit Agreement). Further, a schedule
for project implementation by mid 1979 was discussed and agreed with the Gov-
ernment, at which time the construction of the Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt road is
also expected to be completed.

33.       All organizations concerned with project implementation will main-
tain separate accounts on project expend:tures. These accounts will be audit-
ed annually by the Government's Central Organization for Audit. In addition,
HPO will maintain records on production inputs, yields and other important in-
dicators (Sections 4.01 and 4.02 of draft: Credit Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
34.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $7.7 million includ-
ing contingencies, of which the foreign exchange component would be $5.0 mil-
lion (65 percent). Taxes are not included in the estimate, since the benefi-
ciaries of the project would be exempted from payment of import duties, taxes
and other levies. The proposed IDA credit would finance the foreign cost and
$2.0 million of the local cost, or about 90 percent of the total cost. The
Government and the HCU (for the date packing plant) would contribute the re-
maining local cost of $0.7 million.
35.       The fertilizers and insecticides provided under the project would
cover the total requirement for the first year and the incremental require-
ments during the second and third year oi project implementation. Agreement
was reached that the Government will provide the base requirements of fertil-
izer and insecticide in years two and three and that thereafter, it will con-
tinue to procure and utilize in the project area fertilizer and insecticide
of at least the quantity used in the last year of project implementation
(Section 3.07(a) of draft Credit Agreement).
Procurement
36.       All equipment and material, with the exception of small farm imple-
ments not exceeding in total $50,00 will be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's procurement guide-
lines. The civil works under the project (feeder road construction and rural
water supply) because of their small size and their scattered nature, are not
suitable for international competitive bidding and will be carried out on force
account by the Public Works Department and the National Water Corporation or
under negotiated contracts, under arrangements acceptable to IDA. Construction
equipment and material needed would be tendered internationally.
Disbursement
37.       Disbursements from the credit account will be made on the basis of
100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and material, 85 percent
of the cost of local procured farm implements, 100 percent of the direct cost
of civil works and 100 percent of the total cost of the feasibility st:udy,
research programs and management.

Financial Aspects
38.       With the project, the gross value of agricultural production in
the Wadi is expected to rise from US$3.9 million to US$6.2 million; the net
value, after deducting all costs of production and government subsidies,
would increase from the present level of $1.0 million to $2.2 million,
making it possible for government subsidies to cooperative and state farms
to be reduced to some extent. The Government agreed that (i) fertilizer and
insecticide supplies to project farmers will not be subsidized (Section
3.07(b) of draft Credit Agreement); and (ii) rental rates and maintenance
charges of the MRS will be raised to cover actual operation and maintenance
cost of agricultural equipment and pumpsets (Section 3.08(b)(i) of draft
Credit Agreement). These measures will limit government subsidies to capital
assistance for equipment and machinery and reduce the total amount of subsi-
dies from the present $1.5 million (51 percent of production cost) to about
$1.1 million (or 28 percent of production cost). Net income of cooperative and
state farms after taxes, would increase by 23 percent, bringing per capita
income of an average cooperative member up to about $86, compared with $70 at
present. As these income increases are only modest, further cuts in govern-
ment subsidies are not feasible. Since the expected level of farmer income
does not permit MRS rental rates and cooperative fees to be raised sufficient-
ly to generate the funds required for making repayments on the subloans for
agricultural equipment and pump sets and for financing future replacement,
there would be a continued need for government subsidies for these purposes.
The Government agreed that it will (i) give financial assistance to MRS and
cooperative farms for the repayment of subloans (Section 3.08(a)(i) of draft
Credit Agreement); (ii) finance from its budget needed replacements of agri-
cultural equipment and pumpsets in the future (Section 3.08(a)(ii) of draft
Credit Agreement). A gradual change in the cropping pattern in the Wadi in
favor of the production of high value crops (para. 41) is likely to lead to
higher farm incomes than estimated above (on the basis of the existing
cropping pattern) and partial repayment of subloans by MRS and cooperative
farm may become possible in the future. En order to achieve the maxinmum
practicable cost recovery, the Government agreed to review and readjust at
regular intervals not exceeding 3 years rental rates of the MRS and payments
by cooperative farms for pumpset cost recovery (Section 3.08(b)(ii) of draft
Credit Agreement). The reviews would cover all major cost determining fac-
tors, including interest rates on agricultural credits, production taxes, and
government subsidies.
39.       The foreign exchange cost of the date packing plant to be financed
from the proceeds of the credit under a subloan agreement with the HCU amounts
to about 80 percent of the plant's total cost of about $360,000; the remaining
20 percent of the investment will be contributed by the HCU.     In order to
encourage date growers to sell good quality dates to the plant, differentia-
tion of the presently uniform raw date price in the area is required.      Sim-
ilarly, to ensure financial viability of the plant, differentiation of the
price of processed dates is required.    ThE. Government agreed that HCU can
(i) pay a price premium for high quality raw dates and (ii) charge for its



- 14 -
processed dates prices at appropriate level]s to ensure a reasonable return
on the investment in the date processing plant (Section 3.06 of the draft
Credit Agreement). On the basis of prices of comparable imports, the HCU
would have an annual net income from the plant of about $63,000 and can be
expected to meet fully its debt service cbligations.     The internal fi-ancial
rate of return on the investment is estimated at about 11 percent.
40.        Special project charges to recoup the costs of the non-credit
items of the project are not appropriate since, the benefits of these items
are either social or of a general nature. In part, these investments will
be recovered by rising public revenue from production taxes and coopecative
fees which w:ill increase with the project from the present level of $0.3
million to about $0.5 million, and from $0.1 million to about $0.2 miLlion
respectively. As to operation and maintenance, the Government agreed that
its departments concerned will properly maintain the feeder roads and
water supply facilities to be constructed under t:he project and determine
and collect from the communities concerned appropriate water supply clharges
to cover at least operation and maintenance cost of the water supply works
(Section 3.0!) of draft Credit Agreement).
Economic Benefits and Justification
41.        The project will effect essential institutional and physical im-
provements which are prerequisites for the development of the Wadi lIadramawt
Region. The transition from current subsistence agriculture toward the pro-
duction of marketable surpluses through the training of farmers in modern pro-
duction techniques and rational use of farm inputs will facilitate the shift
to high value crops, particularly when the Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt road link
becomes available in 1979. The infrastructure component of the project will
support agricultural development and improve living conditions and welfare
of the rural population. Possibilities for expansion of agriculture in the
Wadi will be identified in a Wadi Hadramnawt Development Study which will be
partly financed under the project (see para. 24). The principal beneficiaries
in terms of additional employment and income will be about 5,000 member fam-
ilies of farm cooperatives or some 30,000 people, whose per capita income is
now some $70, well. under the national average of about $110 in 1973 (para. 38).
In addition, the project will reduce the need for government subsidie; to
cooperatives and state farms and increase public revenues, resulting :,n a net
reduction in the annuat drain on the Government budget from $1.1 million to
$0.4 million.
42.        The project will generate direct economic benefits by a substantial
increase in yields of all annual crops produced in the area and by a more
modest increase in the value added of packaged dates.     Increased wheat pro-
duction and t:he related reduction in wheat imports will result in annual for-
eign exchange savings of about $1,000,000.    Disregarding the cost of the Wadi
Hadramawt Development Study, the project's rate of return with agricultural



- 15 -
labor valued at one-third of going wage rates to reflect substantial under-
employment 1/ is estimated at 17 percent:. The rate of return would be 21
percent if the two rural water supply schemes are also excluded. The eco-
nomic rate of return of the date packing plant alone is estimated at 11 per-
cent.

C.   Projects in Execution I/
Cr. No. 240-YDR - Highway Project; US$1.6 Million Credit of April 21, 1971;
Effective Date: November 9, 1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
This project consists of (a) feasibility studies of selected roads;
(b) detailed engineering of about 2450 km of roads; (c) highway workshop and
communications equipment and spare parts for existing highway maintenance and
workshop equipment; (d) provision of technical assistance team to advise and
assist in improving the organization, operations and methods of the Public
Works Department (PWD); and (e) overseas fellowships for PWD local staff.
Technical assistance by consultants and overseas staff training was financed
by UNDP with the Association acting as Executing Agency. The consultants'
services, the staff training and the feasibility studies have been satisfac-
torily completed. Delays have occurred in equipment procurement, largely due
to the Government's cumbersome purchasing system. To allow full utilization
of credit funds, the original closing date of June 30, 1974 has been postponed
to March 31, 1975. Spares for road maintenance equipment have been delivered;
the workshop equipment has been ordered and is being delivered. However, since
not all items arrived in time, the Association agreed to a further extension of
the closing date to March 31, 1976.
Cr. No. S12-YDR - Highway Engineering Project; US$0.6 Million Credit of
November 17, 1972; Effective Date:    April 13, 1973; Closing Date:   March 31, 1975.
This engineering credit was provided to help finance (a) detailed en-
gineering of about 110 km of roads, review and amend existing detailed engineering
of about 35 km; and (b) extension of technical assistance which already started
under the previous project. The detailed engineering has been satisfactorily
completed. The original closing date of June 30, 1974 was postponed to March 31,
1975, to accommodate a further extension of technical assistance by consultants
to the Public Works Department. The credit has been fully disbursed and the
credit account was closed as of March 31, 1975. Refinancing of this credit was
provided under the Second Highway Project Credit 560-YDR.
Cr. No. 370-YDR - Fisheries Project: US$3.5 Million Credit of April 12, 1973;
Effective Date: February 14, 1974; and $1.6 Million Supplementary Credit of
February 6, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Due to delays in finding a suitable Project Manager, the original
credit became effective only on February 12, 1974. Since then, project imple-
mentation on the whole is proceeding satisfactorily. A supervision mission in
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular, to report on
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strength and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 4
June 1974 reported that price and physical contingencies included in the proj-
ect were insufficient to cover increases in project cost, which were mainly
due to both foreign and domestic inflation. Since the scope of the project
could not reasonably be reduced and no other sources of financing were avail-
able, the Association agreed to a supplementary credit of $1.6 million to
cover the increased foreign cost of the project. Since no bids were received
for the shore facilities in Al Mukalla and Ash Shihr, the Association agreed
that the original turnkey contract be split into several smaller contracts,
of which the larger ones would be tendered internationally, and that the
Government's Public Corporation for Fish Wealth, which is the main beneficiary
of the project, with the assistance of the consultants, assume the overall re-
sponsibility for supervision and coordination of these contracts.     Under this
arrangement procurement is now in progress. Twenty-six of about 100 fishing
boats to be financed under the credit have been completed in local shipyards;
a further ten are under construction. Most of the completed boats are being
retained by PCFW and have not yet been transferred to fishing cooperatives
as required under the Credit Agreement. The matter has been raised with the
Government.
Cr. No. 494-YDR - Education Project; US$'.4 Million of July 12, 1974;
Effective Date: February 5, 1975; Closirg Date: September 30, 1979.
This credit, which will assist the Government in making quaLitative
improvements in the educational system and to meet priority manpower needs,
became effective on February 5, 1975, after slight delays in setting up the
project unit. Project implementation has now commenced. Arrangements with
UNESCO for the provision of experts on curricula development have been final-
ized. A firm of consultants has been appointed in November 1975 for the de-
sign and construction supervision of school buildings and started work.
Cr. No. 560-YDR - Second Highway Project: US$15.5 Million Credit of June 20,
1975; Effective Date: September 17, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
This project, which will be financed jointly with the Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development, comprises (a) construction of 358 km of roads between
the Wadi Hadramawt agricultural area and the coast, which were prepared under
Credit 240 and Engineering Credit S-12; (b) economic and engineering studies for
320 km of roads; (c) purchase of maintenance equipment and spares; (d) technical
assistance to the MPW, including fellowships for MPW staff abroad; and (e) re-
financing of Engineering Credit S-12. Since international competitive bidding
of the construction element of the project did not lead to an acceptable bid,
arrangements have been made for the works to be carried out by a government
construction unit which will be assisted by the UK - Crown Agents. The credit
became effective on September 17, 1975, and project implementation has started.

Cr. No. 584-YDR - Aden Port Rehabilitation Project; US$3.2 Million Credit of
September 8, 1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
The project which is being cofinanced by the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development will assist the PDRY Government in rehabilitating the
port of Aden to reattract traffic passing through the reopened Suez Canal.
The Project would consist of provision of (a) floating equipment; (b) cargo-
handling equipments; (c) workshop equipment, spares and stocks; (d) diving team
equipment; (e) navigation, mooring and communications equipment; and (f) tech-
nical assistance. The credit was approved on August 21, 1975. The anticipated
effectiveness date is February 9, 1976.
