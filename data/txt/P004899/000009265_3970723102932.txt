Project Description: The project will help expand water production and distribution
In the metropolitan areas of Oran and Constantine to the
levels required to meet the unsatisfied demand (currently
representing 35 percent of production in Oran and 44 percent
in Constantine) and future demand in the areas.  In Oran the
project provides for the construction of a new surface water
production   system,   a   demineralisation   plant   and   the
rehabilitation  of  the  existing  production  facilities.   In
Constantine it provides for :he construction of new water
production works, expansion of the distribution network,
collection  and  treatment  of  wastewater   for   reuse   in
irrigation. Feasibility studies of water supply and sewerage
will be carried out in the areas where present services are
deficient, and technical assistance will be provided to
recently established regional water companies to help them
streamline their organization, operational procedures and
financial systems. The project will benefit about 2.1 million
inhabitants of Oran and Constantine, of whom about two-thirds
are residents of low-income districts.   It will also supply
water for industrial and commercial development. The project
faces no technical risks, though its successful realisation
will   depend   upon  timely  implemeintation  of  recommended
financial policies for EPEOR and EPECO. Those risks, however,
are reduced by the Government commitment, as expressed in the
recently issued Water Code, that water utilities be managed as
commercial and financially self-supporting enterprises.

ALGERIA
NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY ANID SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRASAL REPORT
L INTRODUCTION
1.01     Since Algeria's independence in 1962, its urban population has grown
at a staggering annual rate of more than five percent. The population growth
has been particularly fast in the medium-size cities and the towns adjacent to
the large metropolitan areas of Algiers, Oran and Constantine. The expansion
of social infrastructure, however, has not kept pace with the rapid population
growth and public services such as water supply, sewerage, transport,
telecommunications, etc.  are very deficient.  More specifically, the water
supply systems that were built in Algiers, Oran and Constantine in the fifties
have never been expanded and as a result, severe water shortages are
experienced  in  these  areas.   It  is  estimated  that  the  available  water
production for each of these cities can barely meet two-thirds of the demand.
The water supply systems in the medium-size cities are more recent and can
still meet the demands.
1.02     The Government of Algeria is aware of this situation and is according
a high priority to the improvement of water supply and sewerage in the large
urban areas. To this end the Government is building new water supply works
for Greater Algiers, which are estimated to cost US$770.5 million; the Bank
recently made a loan (2461-AL) of US$290 million to partially finance these
works. Previously, the Bank made a loan (1545-AL) of US$82 million to finance
sewerage works in Algiers and feasibility studies of water supply and sewerage
in Oran and Constantine.  Based on these studies, a construction program of
water supply and sewerage facilities for Oran and Constantine has been
prepared and will soon be underway.
1.03     Within the context of the Algiers Project, the Government has carried
out a reorganization of the water supply and sewerage sector, under which
regional companies, instead of municipalities, now provide such services. The
new organization was a necessary step towards improving the management of all
the services and building up the  sector's  financial  viability.   The  Bank
provided technical assistance to the Government in the formulation of the new
sector organization.  The next step is to expand the service levels in the
remaining urban areas and to consolidate the management of the new regional
companies. The proposed project covers the actions to be undertaken in this
step, for which the Government has requested the Bank's assistance.



-2-
1.04     The  proposed project would involve the construction of additional
water supply works for Oran and Constantine, and of sewage collectors and
treatment  facilities  for Constantine.   Technical  assistance would also be
provided to the regional companies to assist them in the development and
implementation  of  streamlined  policies  and  procedures.   In preparation of
future projects, the companies would undertake a metering program in order to
maintain better records of their production and sales.  Feasibility studies
would also be carried out in the urban areas to determine ways to improve
potable water supply and distribution in these areas.
1.05     The  total  project  cost  is estimated at US$571.7 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$312.8 million.  A Bank loan of US$262 million
to finance part of this component is proposed.  Bids for some of the project
components  have been  received and  construction  is  expected  to  start  by
mid-1985.   The proposed project is technically sound and is the least-cost
alternative for increasing water supply in Oran and Constantine. It would
amount  to an  investment  of about  US$264  per capita, which is acceptable
considering the obsolescence of the existing system and the need to catch up
with demand.
1.06     The project preparation was partially financed with funds of the Bank
loan 1545-AL and carried out by the Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment and
Forestry  with  the  assistance  of  Belgiar. consultants.   The  Bank actively
participated  in the project formulation.   A mission composed of Mr.  Fritz
Rodriguez (Bank staff) and Messrs. Abdeljelil Ben Abid and A. J. D. Hutchins
(Consultants) appraised the project in September 1984.
II. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Back-grouDd
2.01     Algeria is the largest country of North Africa and occupies an area
of about 2.3 million Km2 which is divided by the Saharan Atlas into two
distinct regions. North of the Atlas is a semi-arid area which encompasses a
coastal strip along the Mediterranean, the interior plains, some highlands
near the coast and the high plateaux located at about 200 kms from the coast.
More than 95 percent of the population lives in this region. The mean annual
rainfall in the northern areas varies from 300 mm to 1,000 mm, exceeding 600
mm only in the central and eastern coastal parts where the richest arable land
is found. South of the Atlas is the Sahara where the mean annual rainfall is
less than 100 mm, but which is rich in mineral resources. There are 17 major
river basins in the country.



-3-
2.02     Administratively,    Algeria   is   divided   into    31    provinces
(wilayate),"'  160 counties  (dairate) and 704 communes.  The current total
population is estimated at 21 million. Almost half of the population lives in
urban areas located along the Mediterranean. About 40 percent of the urban
population is concentrated in the three largest metropolitan areas, Algiers,
Oran and Constantine, which have an estimated combined population of about 4
million. Most of the rural population reside in fixed settlements which are
largely equipped with water supply and sanitation facilities; only a small
portion of the rural population, roaming in the high plateaux, can be
considered dispersed.
Water Resources
2.03     Water resources in Algeria are generally limited and difficult to
exploit. Most of the surface water sources are dry in summer, are of poor
quality and thus cannot readily be used for domestic and industrial supply.
In general, regulation of the rivers through costly reservoirs is required in
order to obtain economically exploitable yields. On the other hand, the rate
of infiltration from storm runoff and surface sources is high and as a result,
groundwater is available all over the country and represents more than
two-thirds of the available water resources. The salinity of a large portion
of the groundwater, however, is high, restraining its use for domestic
consumption and irrigation.  Most urban areas are  presently supplied with
groundwater.
2.04     Overall, the average yield of the existing fresh water sources with
full development of storage is estimated at 7 billion m /year, which should
be sufficient to cover the water needs for urban, industrial and agricultural
use until the early part of the next century.   Beyond that time, it will
become necessary to resort to reclamation of wastewaters and later on to
desalination  to meet  the demand.   This  situation already exists  in  some
densely populated river basins where the present demand exceeds the available
resources and water is transferred from adjacent basins.   The scarcity of
water within those basins, and the need for high capital investments in water
production and transmission facilities, may constitute serious constraints to
rapid industrialization.
2.05     In  the  Constantine area,  groundwater  is now used for both urban
supply  and  irrigation.   The  present  water  demand,  however,  exceeds  the
potential capacity of the groundwater aquifer and supplementary surface water
sources must be developed.  Most of the water for Oran comes from surface
water sources which are far away (180 kms) from the consumption centers.
Groundwater in this area is brackish with a high content of total dissolved
-'   Recent proposals  have been made by the Government to establish 48
wilayate.



-4-
solids. Under the project, additional surface water sources would be tapped
to meet the demand.
Seet, O-io
2.06     The  Ministry  of  Hydraulics,  Environment  and  Forestry  (MHEF)
(established in 1977, incorporating the former Secretariat of Hydraulics set
up in 1970) is responsible for the development and conservation of the
country's water resources and the planning and construction of water supply
and sewer systems.  Thirteen regional authorities, recently created, operate
and maintain water supply and sewerage facilities in the country. The first
experience with a regional company started with the creation of a wilaya
authority, the "Societ6 des Eaux de 1'Agglomeration d'Alger - SEDAL", which
provides water supply and sewerage services in Greater Algiers. SEDAL was set
up as part of the Bank's first operation in the sector, the Algiers Sewerage
Project (Loan 1545-AL). The SEDAL experience was good and the Government in
May 1983 established twelve more companies, using SEDAL's organization as a
model.
2.07     In conjunction with the sector reorganization, the Government-issued
a Water Code (Law No. 83-17 of July 16, 1983), to regulate the allocation and
cc.Jection of water resources  and  to set  out financial policies for the
sector.  In addition to dealing with ownership, concession and use of the
water resources, the Water Code prescribes that water utilities should be
managed as commercial enterprises and should set tariffs at levels necessary
to make the entities financially self-supporting.   It also recommends that
tariffs for industrial and commercial usage be set sufficiently high to
encourage economic use of water.
2.08     To coordinate the operations of the regional companies and to some
extent optimize the use of financial resources in the sector, the Ministry of
Hydraulics is considering establishing a national regulatory agency, which
would assist the Ministry in planning water supply and sewerage investments
and in identifying the level of Government contributions to the regional
companies. The agency would also formulate detailed policies for the sector
and oversee the operations of the regional companies.  Technical assistance
for establishing the functions and responsibilities of the agency is being
financed under Loan 2461-AL.
Service Levels
2.09     Presently,  the existing water supply and sewerage systems in the
large cities are obsolete and over-loaded. Though more than 80 percent of the
urban population is provided with direct water service lines, only a third can
be considered well served.  Preliminary results of a survey of water supply
and sanitation services in 36 cities with populations ranging from 500,000 to
2,000 are shown in Annex 1. The overall per capita consumption varies widely
from 286 liters/day in El Golea in the central part of Algeria to 20



-5-
liters/day in Chegoun in the Kabylie Mountains, but in most cases is
considered inadequate. The per capita allowance is further greatly reduced by
the high volume of unaccounted-for water which in some cities reaches around
50 percent of the production. In general, water supply in the large cities is
intermittent and available no more than 12 hours a day.
2.10     About 70 percent of the urban population is connected to public sewer
networks which in most cases are combined systems which also carry stormwater
runoff.  Wastewaters in the cities are generally discharged untreated directly
into  the  Mediterranean  or  into  rivers.   About  70 percent  of  the rural
locations Z are provided with public water supply systems and 60 percent
with  sewer  systems.   About 40 percent of the rural population has direct
access to public water supply networks; only 25 percent to sewerage.
Constraints to Sector Development
2.11     Until recently, the lack of sound sector financial policies was a
major constraint  to the sector development.    Water tariffs, all over the
country,  have  generally  remained  low  during  the  last  decade.    The
municipalities, which were responsible for water supply services, were
reluctant to implement effective tariffs which would have encouraged consumers
to economize on their water use.  This situation had existed because until
recently investments in water supply and sewerage were financed by Government
grants  to  the  municipalities.   The  Government  has  now  decided  that  the
regional companies should finance a substantial portion of their investments
with borrowings and progressively with their internal cash generation.
2.12     Administrative burden has also been another constraint to the sector
development.  The Ministry of Hydraulics has been very slow in implementing
the work programs. In some cases, delays in procuring the works have resulted
in cost  overruns.   Though  procurement  regulations and schedules  are well
defined in codes,  they have not been respected in most cases.   A project
objective is to help the Ministry of Hydraulics streamline the procurement
process and project execution.
Investments in the Sector
2.13     The  second  Four-Year  Investment  Plan  (1974-77)  included  DA  4.0
billion (US$800 million) or about DA 240.0 (US$48.0) per capita for water
supply and sewerage works.  About DA 1.0 billion  (US$200 million) of this
amount was to complete works initiated during the previous investment plan
(1970-73). These investments accounted for about 4 percent of the total
I'   Defined as agglomerations with less than 2,000 inhabitants.



-6--
c-anital expenditures in the public sector. With a few exceptions, so far, all
projects in the water supply and sewerage sector have been financed 100
percent by Government grants, and the regional companies have practically no
debt.
2.14     It is estimated that, during the first Five-Year Plan (1980-1984),
investments in the order of DA 6_0 billion (US$1.2 billion) or about DA 300
(US$60.0) per capita, have been made in the sector. During the forthcoming
Five-Year Plan (1985-1989), the Ministry of Hydraulics is proposing to invest
DA 45.0 billion (US$9.0 billion) in the hydraulic sector, 50 percent of which
in water supply and sewerage works. The projected substantial increase of
investments during the next plan (almost four times the level of investments
during the preceding plan in current prices) demonstrates the Government's
comitment to improving rapidly the conditions and service levels in the
sector.
Previous Bank Loans in the Seetor
2.15     The Bank became involved in the sector in 1978 when Loan 1545-AL of
US$82.0 million was made for the Algiers Sewerage Project, to finance the
construction of sewer interceptors and a sewage treatment plant in Greater
Algiers and management and engineering studies in the cities of Algiers,
Constantine and Oran. One of the objectives of this project was to strengthen
the sector organization in Greater Algiers through the creation of a regional
water supply and sewerage authority (SEDAL).  In spite of some delays in
implementing agreed policies, the SEDAL experience has been good, and has led
to the recent Government decision to set up similar authorities in the rest of
the country.
2.16     To help improve water supply services in the Algiers area, the Bank
in 1980 made a loan (S-17-AL) of US$5.0 million to finance a water resources
study.  On the basis of the recommendations of this study, a water supply
project has been defined for Greater Algiers and is now under construction.
In June 1984 the Bank made a loan (2461-AL) of US$290 million to partly
finance this construction.
2.17     The execution of the works included in the Algiers Sewerage Project,
after some initial delays,  has progressed well.  The project,  though, is
expected to be completed only by the end of 1987, some four years later than
projected at appraisal, because of delays in inscribing the project in the
national budget and appointing consultants, additional review by the Ministry
of Hydraulics of the project design, and slow procurement of the works. All
these problems have since been resolved. Loan S-17-AL was closed at the end
of 1984. The third loan (2461-AL) has recently been declared effective.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.18     From  the  outset  of  its  involvement  in  the  sector,  the  Bank's
objective has been to foster the adoption of more appropriate sectoral



-7-
procedures  and  policies.   The Algiers projects were instrumental in  the
creation of the regional companies and the implementation of more realistic
pricing policies for water supply and sewerage services in the Algiers area.
The proposed project, through the setting of increased tariffs in the rest of
the country, would allow the Government and the Bank to pursue their policy
objectives of strengthening the sector organization by consolidating the
efficiency and financial viability of the regional companies. The Bank can
also provide advice and guidance in the selection and formulation of economic
projects in the cities considered, based on the least cost alternatives.
Additionally, the Bank may play an important role in helping the Algerians
improve their procurement procedures.
IlL THE PROJECT AREA
General Features
3.01     Greater Oran, with a current population of 800,000, is the second
largest metropolitan area in Algeria and includes the cities of Oran, Arzew,
Es Senia and a large group of suburban towns. It is a very industrialized
area where petrochemical plants and liquefied natural gas activities are
concentrated along the Oran-Arzew corridor. The city of Oran, which is an
open sea port, is the commercial center for the country's western part. Its
population is currently estimated at 600,000 and growing at an annual rate of
3.9 percent.  Water supply and sewerage services in Greater Oran are provided
by "Enterprise de Production, de Gestion et de Distribution d'Eau d'Oran"
(EPEOR).
3.02    Commercial  activities  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  country  are
concentrated in Constantine City, the third largest urban agglomeration, which
has a current population of about 500,000, growing at an annual rate of 3.2
percent.   In addition  to Constantine,  the metropolitan area includes  the
cities of El Khroub, Ain Smara and Haimna Bouziane.  The current combined
population of this area is about 600,000.  Water supply and sewerage services
in Greater Constantine are provided by "Enterprise de Production, de Gestion
et de Distribution d'Eau de Constantine" (EPECO).  No large water resources
are available and few industries are located in the area.
Existing Production Systems
3.03     Presently Greater Oran obtains its water supply principally from
three sources: (i) the Higher Tafna River (Beni Babdel) located about 180 kms
to the west; (ii) the Fergoug River system situated about 80 kms to the east;
and (iii) the Bredeah Aquifer located near Oran.  The first two include
treatment facilities which were put in operation in the fifties.  The Beni
Bahdel installation is a gravity system with an average capacity of 48,000
m3/day, a portion of which is used to supply the towns located along the



-8-
transmission pipeline. The Fergoug system, whose production averages 40,000
m3/day, serves the city of Arzew and the large industrial complexes between
Oran and Arzew.  Of the Fergoug production, only 9,000 m3/day reach the city
of Oran.
3.04     The Bredeah system consists of a group of wells producing on average
25,000 m3/day. The groundwater is of poor quality, with the content of
total  dissolved  solids3-  exceeding  4,500  mg/liter.   A  fourth  source,  a
sgring (Raz El Ain), located within the city has an average yield of 8.000
m Iday and mainly supplies the port and some adjacent low level areas.
3.05     In contrast to Oran, the water supply sources of Constantine are all
of groundwater origin.   The Fesguia and Bou Mersoug wells,  located some
25 kms. south of Constantine City, have an average yield of 30,000 m3/day.
These systems  were put  in operation  in the fifties.   More  recently,  an
artesian well at Hammn Bouziane, located some 7 kms. north of the city, was
tapped to supply the area. This well's production averages 17,000 m3/day.
An additional flow of 35,000 m3/day is extracted from the same aquifer for
irrigation in the Hamma Bouziane area.
3.06     In general, drinking water in Constantine is very hard with high
conductivity.   The contents of manganese and chlorides are  close  to  the
maximum permissible levels established under the norms of the World Health
Organization (WHO).
Water Distribution Networks
3.07     Sizes of pipes in the distribution system in Oran City vary from 60
mm. (2.5 ins.) to 600 mm. (24.0 ins.) diameter, with a total length of 450
kms.  Four main  reservoirs,  Eckmulh  (15,000 m3), Ain Beida  (20,000 m3),
Gambetta  (40,000  m3)  and  Montreal  (5,000  m3)  maintain  the  required
pressures  at  different  elevated  areas.   The present  storage capacity  is
considered adequate and no immediate increase in storage is required. Supply
is now intermittent with most of the consumers receiving water every other
day. Most of the distribution network was renovated recently and as a result,
water losses in the city are estimated to be less than 20 percent of
production.
3.08     As in Oran,  the distribution network in Constantine was renovated
recently and water losses in the system do not exceed 15 percent of
production. Because of the rugged configuration of the city, the network has
3/  Refer to matter in dissolved form, which consists mainly of inorganic
salts, small amounts of organic matter and dissolved gases. The total
dissolved and undissolved solids content of potable waters usually
ranged from 20 to 1,000 mg/liter. As a rule, hardness increases with
the solids content.



been divided into two separate pressure zones: a high one served by two main
reservoirs, El Kantara Superieur and Mansourah Superieur and a low one
supplied by three reservoirs, El Kantara Inferieur, Mansourah Inferieur and
Bellevue.  In addition, within  the two zones  there exist 21 reservoirs.
Overall storage in the city amounts to 40,000 m3, which is sufficient to
meet the peak demand during the next eight years.  As in Oran, supply is
intermittent with about 40 percent of consumers receiving water for less than
three hours a day.
Existing Sewerape
3.09     Old areas  in Oran and Constantine are served by combined sever
systems in which wastewaters and storm water runoff are collected and conveyed
in the same conduits. New developments are equipped with separate systems in
which wastewaters and runoff are drained in different conduits. Most of the
water consumers are connected to the sewer networks which are generally in
good condition.  In Constantine a major expansion of the sewer network is
planned under  the proposed project.   In  Oran,  a  sewerage  study,  partly
financed under loan 1545-AL, is now under way. Presently, wastewaters in the
two cities are not treated prior to their discharge into the Rhumel River in
Constantine and the bay in Oran. In both cases the receiving waters have not
sufficient capacity to absorb the pollution load and treatment facilities in
Constantine and a sea outfall in Oran must be built in the future.
VI. DEMAND AND MARKIET ASPECTS
Jurisdiction
4.01     The territory served by EPEOR includes the wilayate of Oran, Tlemcem,
Sidi Bel Abes and Mascara, whose current total population is estimated at 1.7
million (see para. 7.01). Within this jurisdiction, EPEOR is responsible for
providing water supply and sewerage services to 57 towns among which three
have populations of more than 110,000, and 21 -with more than 10,000. So far,
EPEOR has been providing retail supply only in Greater Oran and the large
cities of Sidi Bel Abes, Tlemcem, Mascara and Ghazaouet.  It also provides
bulk water supplies to a number of towns located along its transmission
pipelines. EPEOR is planning to progressively take over both production and
distribution in all the towns, some of which have their own production
facilities.
4.02     EPECO's service area covers the wilayate of Constantine, Jijel and
Oum-El-Bouaghi which had an estimated total population of 915,000 at the end
of 1984. EPECO is to provide water supply and sewerage services to 19 towns
in this territory,  14 of which have populations of more than 10,000.  At
present, EPECO provides water in Constantine, Jijel and Oum-El-Bouaghi, the
capital cities of the wilayate, but expects to take over all the towns in its
jurisdicti'n by the end of 1985.



-10-
Prodm and C
4.03     In  1984  EPEOR  produced  78.6  Hm3  of  potable  water  which  was
estimated to be 35 percent below the potential demand in the Oran area. Of
this production, about one third was sold in bulk to industries and towns, and
the rest distributed directly. For a total sale of 65.4 Mm3 in that year,
unaccounted for water was only 17 percent of the production, but reached 25
percent of the volumes distributed in the cities. Both quantities are within
acceptable limits for unaccounted-for water and reflect effective operation of
the systems. As the next production increase would take effect only at the
end of 1987, supply would have to continue to be rationed in Greater Oran
during the next three years.
4.04     Present available production  in the territory served by EPECO is
estimated  at  50.8  MMn3/year,  but  demand  is  estimated  to  grow  to  79.2
Mm3/year by  1991.   In 1984 EPECO recorded retail  sales  of 15.8 Mm' and
bulk sales of 10.6 Mm3.  Unaccounted for wrLer in that year was about 27
percent of the production. In the Constantine area itself, the demand in 1984
was estimated to be 35.3 Mm3, while the available production was only 19.8
Mm3, resulting in a deficit of 15.5 Mm3 or 44 percent of the demand.
Water sales in that year in this area amounted to 13.9 Mm3.  leaving  29
percent of the production unaccounted for.
Compositon of the Demand
4.05     A large portion of water consumed in EPEOR's jurisdiction is for
industrial use, which accounted for almost 30 percent of the volumes of water
sales in 1984.  In terms of revenue, industrial sales accounted for a much
larger percentage, as the industrial tariff was three times higher than the
domestic  tariff.   A breakdown  of  water consumed  in 1984 apportions  the
different uses as follows:
Usage                    Volume, Mn3                Pert -nt
Domestic                     34.3                     52.4
Industrial                   19.11                    29.2
Public                        7.4                     11.3
Commercial                    4.6                       7.1
TOTAL                   65.4                     100.0



4.06     The  situation  is  very  different  in  the  Constantine  area where
industrial use accounts for less than one percent of the volume consumed.
Water is primarily for domestic use and other uses represent less than 15
percent of the total sales.
Future Water ConSUmption
4.07     A projection of water sales by EPEOR during the period 1986-91 is
shown in Annex 4.  It is estimated that in 1988 the per capita consumption in
Greater Oran would increase after the proposed project becomes operational and
water is more readily available; beyond that year consumption would continue
to increase as the country's economy continues to grow and standards of living
improve. In the other towns served by EPEOR where presently large production
surplus exist, the current per capita consumptions are already high and
presumably would remain unchanged during the next seven years. On this basis
it is forecast that water sales, which in 1984 amounted to 65.4 Mm3, would
rise to 94.3 Mm3 in 1988 and to 118.9 Mm3 in 1991.  Part of the increases
in sales between 1985 and 1988 would result from the takeover of existing
systems by  EPEOR.   During  the projection period,  sales are forecast  to
increase annually by 8.9 percent, with the average per capita consumption
rising from 121/lpcd in 1985 to 153/lpcd in 1991.
4.08     Annex 7 shows a forecast of water sales by EPECO during the 1985-91
period.   Assumptions  similar  to  those used for EPEOR have been made  in
preparing the forecast for EPECO.  It is foreseen that EPECO's water sales
would increase from 15.8 Mm3 in 1984 to 46.4 Mm3 in 1991, resulting in an
annual growth rate of 14.9 percent.  A major part of the growth, however,
would result from EPECO's takeover of existing distribution networks.  The
average per capita consumption is projected to increase from 71/lpcd in 1986
to 109/lpcd in 1991. The sales forecasts assume that by 1991 practically the
entire urban population in the wilayate served by EPEOR and EPECO would be
connected to the networks.
V. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
Proiect Genesis and Concept
5.01     In 1978 the Bank made a loan (1545-AL) of US$82 million to the
Government of Algeria to finance sewerage works in Greater Algiers and
feasibility studies of water supply and sewerage in Oran and Constantine,
Algeria's second and third largest cities. The Government was concerned with
the evident water shortage and the resulting poor sanitary conditions
prevailing  in  these  cities.   The  studies  were  completed  in  1982  and
construction projects identified for both Oran and Constantine.  Previous to
the Bank loan, the Government, with the assistance of the World Health
Organization (WHO) and French consultants, had explored the possibility of
tapping the Cheliff Oued, by constructing a dam in the lower part of the



-12-
river, to supply Greater Oran and the industrial area of Arzew.   Further
studies, however, showed that the proposed dam would be very costly with a
short useful life due to rapid silting of the reservoir and the proposal was
therefore abandoned.
5.02     Most  of  Oran's  present  water supply  comes  from surface  sources
located far away from the city (para. 3.03).  A small portion of the supply is
derived from groundwater close to the city.  The quality of this groundwater,
however, is poor and does not meet accepted standards for potable water.  Some
surface sources, like the lower part of the Tafna River, are relatively close
to Oran (about 90 kms.), but they are at a lower elevation than the city and
the waters would have to be pumped to reach the consumption centers. Thus,
the choice was between going further away from the city and convey the water
by gravity; or staying closer, but having to pump it to the city. An economic
comparison showed that the latter was the least-cost alternative to increase
potable water production for Greater Oran.
5.03     Based on a 32-year stream flow record, it has been estimated that,
with a pumping station of 3 m3/sec, there is a 90 percent probability of
deriving annually 65 Mm3 at the proposed diversion site on the Lower Tafna
River. From the diversion point, water would be pumped to a natural reservoir
(Djebel Zioua) with a capacity of 15Mm3, which would compensate for
variations in the river flows. From this reservoir, water would be withdrawn
and treated in a conventional plant and then conveyed to Oran. To prevent
seepage in the reservoir, an impervious membrane would be laid down over the
ground.  The average yield of the Lower Tafna River system would be about
2.56 m3/sec.
5.04     Contrary to Oran, Greater Constantine's water supply presently comes
from groundwater which is also used for irrigation in the area. As mentioned
previously, the Constantine region is one of the driest areas in the country.
Some surface water sources exist but with relatively small yields and far away
from the populated centers. One of them is the Rhumel River, which would be
diverted to meet some of the water needs in the Constantine area. Reuse of
wastewaters is now considered absolutely necessary if both urban and
agricultural water needs are to be met.
5.05     The proposed project envisages the exclusive use of groundwater for
urban supply and the replacement of the part now used for irrigation by
treated wastewater. At the same time, the Rhumel River would be regulated at
an impounding dam (Hammam Grouz) now under construction, to provide an average
yield of O.5m3/sec.  The dam as well as the treatment facilities would be
located at about 90 kms. from Constantine. With the addition of the Hamma
Bouziane groundwater scheme, the overall supply to Greater Constantine would
be increased by about 1m3/sec. or more than double the present production.
5.06     The feasibility study and detailed design of the Oran project were
prepared by a Belgian consulting firm, Tractionel.  The feasibility of the
Constantine project was carried out by a Belgian firm, De Konnicks.  The



-13-
design as well as tender documents for the Constantine project were prepared
by a British firm, Binnie & Partners, which also designed the Kamam Grouz
dam. The concept and design of the dam were reviewed by a panel of experts of
the Ministry of Hydraulics. The construction of the dam started in 1982 and
is now at an advanced stage.
Objectives of the Project
5.07     The proposed project in the Oran area would increase water production
to meet the unsatisfied demand and future needs through the year 2,000.  In
Constantine, the proposed production increase would meet unsatisfied demand
and future needs but for a much shorter period (up to 1993).   Preliminary
works for the next project in Constantine are already under way. While the
project is being executed, the water companies, with their own resources,
would continue to expand the secondary distribution networks and execute a
leak detection and repair program to improve further the systems' efficiency.
5.08     The project would provide technical assistance to all the regional
companies to help them streamline their organization, operations, management
and finance (paras. 6.07-6.10).  The technical assistance program would also
include staff training.  As part of the project, an analysis of the water
supply and sewerage situation in the urban areas would be undertaken, followed
by the preparation of feasibility studies and detailed design of projects in
the cities with  the most urgent needs.   Operational  equipment,  including
master and domestic water meters, would be provided to all the regional
companies.
Project Description
5.09     The proposed project includes:
(i)    the collection, treatment and conveyance  of  the Lower  Tafna
River waters to increase the supply to Oran by about 221,000
m /day;
(ii)    the construction of a demineralisation plant with a capacity of
400 liters/sec. to lower the total dissolved solids content of
water distributed in Oran to about 1,000 mg/liter;
(iii)    rehabilitation of the Beni Bahdel and Fergoug systems;
(iv)    the treatment and transmission of the Rhumel River water  to
supply about 40,000 m3/day to Constantine;
(v)    the collection and softening of groundwater in the Constantine
area to produce an average flow of 40,000 m3/day;
(vi)    the expansion and improvement of the primary water distribution
network in Constantine City;



-14-
(vii)    the collection and treatment of wastewater in Constantine for
use in agriculture;
(viii)    the  supply  of  operational  equipment,  including  master  and
domestic water meters, to the regional companies;
(ix)    technical assistance to the companies and staff training; and
(x)    the preparation of water supply and sewerage projects to meet
demands in the urban areas.
5.10     A general layout of the project facilities is shown on Maps. nos.
18688  and  18689.   For  the  Oran  system  improvement,  from  the  diversion
structure on the Tafna River, water would be pumped to a grit chamber where
solids with a diameter greater than 0.3 m. would be removed.  The water would
then pass through a microstrainer before being pumped to a reservoir formed by
construction  of  an  embankment  across  a natural  land depression  (with a
capacity of 15 Mm3) which would be used to store and regulate the river
flows. From the reservoir, water would be withdrawn by gravity for treatment
and then conveyed to Oran through a steel pipeline of one meter diameter.
5.11     The demineralisation of groundwater in Oran would be accomplished in
a reverse osmosis plant, with an efficiency of 70 percent, whose output would
have a total dissolved solids content of about 500 mg/liter. The output would
be mixed with the other sources and the resulting dissolved solids content of
water distributed in Oran would be around 1,000 mg/liter.
5.12     For the supplemental supply to Constantine, the Rhumel River water
would be treated in a plant located near the Hammam Grouz Dam and then
conveyed to Constantine through a 800 mm. pipeline. Prior to its distribution
in Constantine, the Hamma Bouziane groundwater would be softened through the
elimination of the carbonate hardness by the addition of lime. New reservoirs
and connecting pipelines would be built to distribute the additional water.
Meanwhile,  additional  sewage  collectors  would  be  installed  in  Greater
Constantine to transport the wastewaters to an extended aeration plant where
they would be treated and then reused for irrigation. A reservoir for storage
of the plant effluent for a limited period and a pipeline connecting it to the
existing irrigation network would also be built under the proposed project.
Cost Estimates
5.13     The estimated  total  cost of  the  project  is  DA  2,859.0  million
(US$571.7 million) with a foreign exchange component of DA 1,564.7 million
(US$312.8 million) or 54.7 percent of the total cost. A suimmary of the cost
estimates follows. Detailed cost estimates and annual project investments in
Oran and Constantine are given in Annexes 10 and 11.

5.14     The cost estimates are based on actual bids for about 60 percent of
the projected works and detailed design for the remaining project components.
The estimates already include customs duties on imported equipment and
materials and other taxes on sales and services. They were increased by 15
percent for  physical  contingencies.   Prices  for  local  expenditures  are
expected to increase annually by about 7.0 percent during the project
execution period; those for foreign expenditures by 5 percent in 1985,



-16-
7.5 percent in 1986 and 8 percent thereafter. Price escalation will affect
only 80 percent of the expenditures for the project components already
tendered.   Overall,  price  escalation  is forecast to account for about 15
percent of the sum of the base costs, physical contingencies and construction
supervision.
5.15     The project provides for an estimated 2,100 man-months of consultancy
services for the technical assistance to the regional companies (paras.
6.07-6.10),   project   preparation   in  different  areas  and  construction
supervision (para. 5.16).
Project Execution
5.16     A bar chart of the project execution is shown in Annex 12.  The
project  construction  would  start  during  the  second half  of  1985  to be
completed by the end of 1990. Contracts for about 60 percent of the project
works are expected to be awarded during the second quarter of 1985 (para.
5.23).  Partial production increases would become available by the end of 1987
in Constantine, and the end of 1988 in Oran.  The Ministry of Hydraulics,
Environment and Forestry (MHEF) would be responsible for the project
construction  supervision.   In  view  of  some  highly  specialized  treatment
processes involved in the project, the Ministry would be assisted by
consulting firms which would be retained in accordance with the Bank Group
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, not later than December 31, [985, and
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Consultants would also
be required for the feasibility studies and retained not later than July 1,
1986, in accordance with the same guidelines and under conditions satisfactory
to the Bank. The project facilities would be operated and maintained by the
water companies (paras. 6.05-6.06).
5.17     The Hanuam Grouz Dam, which is under construction, is an important
structure  whose  stability  should  be  carefully  monitored.   Consequently,
agreement was reached during negotiations that not later than July 1, 1988,
MEEF would employ engineering experts to assist it in inspecting annually the
Hanua  Grouz Dam and related structures.  After 1992, the inspections may be
made once every five years. The experts would be retained in accordance with
the  Bank  Group  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of  Consultants.   Following  an
inspection, MHEF would carry out any necessary remedial actions suggested by
the consultants.
5.18     About US$50.8 million of foreign exchange under the project is for
the supply of a steel transmission pipeline in Oran. The pipe supply has been
reserved for a national firm which has the technical capability and experience
to manufacture the pipes properly.  Its involvement is also not expected to
delay the project execution. Financing of the pipe supply, however, would not
be eligible under a Bank loan.



-17-
ProjectFinancing
5.19     To cover the foreign exchange balance, a Bank loan of US$262 million
is proposed. The loan would be made to the Government to be repaid over 11
years after 4 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.  The
Government would finance the balance of foreign exchange (US$50.8 million) and
the local costs (US$258.9 million equivalent). EPEOR and EPECO would finance
the cost of expanding the secondary distribution networks (para. 8.09).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government would
promptly make available the above amounts and any additional funds needed for
the project execution and completion.
Reimbursement of the Government
5.20     Upon completion of the project construction,  the Government would
transfer the ownership of the facilities to EPEOR and EPECO which would
operate  and  maintain  them.   The  legislation  governing  water  supply  and
sewerage operations in Algeria requires that the regional companies finance
their investments principally by long-term borrowings and eventually develop a
self-financing  capability.   It  is therefore proposed that EPEOR and EPECO
reimburse the Government for the portions of the Bank loan contracted for
their  investments.   These  portions  would  amount  to  US$173  million  and
US$68 million respectively.   To these amounts would be added  interest  and
other charges paid by the Government during the project construction.
5.21     The reimbursement would start in 1991 and would be completed over 20
years, with an interest rate of 10 percent. The foreign exchange risk on the
loan  would  be  borne  by  the  Government.   Details  of  the  reimbursement
modalities, together with the Government's financing conditions of the
project, would be set out in Reimbursement Agreements between the Government
and EPEOR and EPECO.  The execution of  these agreements,  with  terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan
5.22     For  the project  financing,  the Government  would  make  respective
equity contributions of DA 1,090.8 million and DA 402.5 million to EPEOR and
EPECO. As the project facilities become operational, the companies should be
required to reflect such contributions in their statutory capital. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Procurement
5.23     MBEF is in the process of awarding two contracts accounting for about
60 percent of the total project cost or US$343.0 million, following
international  competitive  bidding.   Overall,  the  bidding  procedures  have
conformed to the Bank Guidelines for Procurement and the Bank is proposing to
finance the foreign exchange cost of the two contracts. With the exception of
the pipe supply discussed in para. 5.18, all remaining supply and civil works
contracts  under  the  project  would  be  awarded  following  international



-18-
competitive  bidding  consistent   with   the   Bank  Group  Guidelines   for
Procurement. In evaluating bids for the supply of equipment and materials, a
15 percent margin of preference or the actual customs duties, whichever is
lower, would be allowed for goods manufactured in Algeria.

DO ement
5.25     The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against: (i) 55 percent of
total expenditures for civil works which usually include the supply of
equipment and materials; (ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 70
percent of local expenditures for the supply of equipment and materials; and
(iii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for consultants' services and staff
training.   Retroactive  financing  of  US$12  million,  to  cover  eligible
expenditures made from January 1, 1985, would be allowed under the proposed
loan. On this basis, estimated quarterly disbursements of the loan are given
in Annex 13.  The estimates are not based on disbursement profiles of past
projects in Algeria, in light of the very different preparation status of the
proposed  project.   The  procurement  process  is  very  advanced  and  loan
disbursement is expected to progress rapidly during the project execution.
5.26     In order to make prompt payments to contractors and consultants for
the  project,  the Bank should  agree  to  advance  regularly  funds  for  the
establishment of a Revolving Fund in Algeria to cover these payments. The
Fund would be maintained at the Central Bank of Algeria for a maximum amount
of US$12.0 million which would cover the Bank's share of eligible expenditures
on the project over a period of three months. The Fund would be maintained in
US dollars. Applications with appropriate supporting documentation, covering
the use of the Fund, should be submitted when approximately half the maximum
allowed amount in the Fund has been spent.   A special account for the Fund
would be established at the Central Bank of Algeria.
5.27     The closing date of the loan would be December 31, 1992, or two years
after the provisional acceptance of the works, which is the time needed to
monitor the performance of the works and to return retention money on the
civil works contracts.
VI. PROJECT IMPLENMENTATON AND OPERATION
Executing Agency
6.01     The project would  be  implemented  by  the Ministry  of Hydraulics,
Environment and Forestry (MEEF) whose current organization is shown in Annex
14.  Three departments of this ministry would assure the project execution:
The  Hydraulic  Works  Department  (DGIH)  would  be  responsible  for  the
construction of the project works. This department is currently constructing
new water works for Algiers City, which are partially financed by Bank Loan
2461-AL.   The  Planning  and  Studies  Department  (DGPE)  would  carry  out
feasibility studies and detailed design of water supply and sewerage in the
country's urban areas.  DGPE was the executing agency for the Water Resources
Engineering and Technical Assistance Project in Greater Algiers, financed by
Loan S-17-AL.  Finally the program of management assistance to the regional
companies and staff training would be monitored by the Promotion and Control
Department (DGAC).



-20--
6.02     DGIH is well organized and staffed.  It comprises three divisions:
water resources development, water supply and severage, and irrigation and
drainage. In 1984 the staff numbered 66 civil engineers, 30 technicians and
410 foremen. In addition, 74 foreign advisors were stationed in DGIH during
that year. Special teams would be assigned for the construction supervision
of the subprojects in Oran and Constantine.  In view of some specialized
processes involved in the project (para. 5.16), these teams would be assisted
by engineering consultants.
6.03     The other departments are equally well organized, though they would
be involved to a lesser extent in the project execution. The technical
assistance and feasibility studies would be carried out by engineering
consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.16).
The operational equipment and meters would be purchased in bulk by MHEF and
passed to the regional companies.  A small spread would be added to cover
MHEF's administrative expenses.
6.04     MHEF carries insurance covering motor vehicles,  fire damages and
third party liability.  It is also insured for workmen's compensation.  All
supply and civil works contracts on the project would be insured against loss
and damage in shipmenL, work accidents, fire and property damages.
Operation and Maintnance
6.05     MHEF's Operations Department (DGE) normally operates and maintains
dams and irrigation structures in the country. This department would continue
to provide such services to EPECO for the Hammam Grouz Dam, and to EPEOR for
the Djebel Zioua Embankment. EPECO and EPEOR would pay DGE for its services.
Regular inspections of the Ramman Grouz Dam would be made by engineering
expe-ts and following the inspections, DGE would carry out any necessary
remedial actions suggested by the experts (para. 5.17).
6.06     The remaining project facilities would be operated by EPEOR and
EPECO. Training of the staff that would operate the treatment plants has been
provided in the contracts for construction of the plants. The training would
take place in Algeria and overseas and would be carried out by the plant
manufacturers. Thus, by the time the project becomes operational in 1990, the
staff of EPEOR and EPECO should have the technical capability required to
operate and maintain the project facilities properly.
Manageznent Assistance
6.07     The regional companies were recently established and are as yet in an
early stage of development. As in the case of the water company in Algiers,
they would need management consultants' assistance to help them establish a
sound organizational structure and operational procedures. In order to arrive
at a uniform structure for all the regional companies, the management
assistance program would be coordinated by MHEF which would employ a single
consulting firm to implement the program. The consultants would be retained



-21-
to advise on certain aspects of the companies' organization and management,
financial structure and tariff policies.
6.08     The organization and management assistance would cover four main
topics:
(i)    definition  of  the  broad   lines  of   the   companies'
organizational structure and their consultative or other
relationships with other governmental, provincial and
muni cipal agencies;
(ii)    preparation   of  job  descriptions   and  statements   of
objectives for all functional heads;
(iii)    development of detailed organizational structures for all
divisions and departments, and a comparison of staff
resources with needs; and
(iv)    formulation  of  operational  procedures  for  billing  and
collection, stores and transport.
6.09     The  second  part  of  the  assistance  would  cover  the  companies'
financial structure but would address the particular needs of each of them.
On the basis of the companies' projected revenues, the consultants would
formulate attainable financial objectives  for the  companies.   They  would
indicate which portions of the companies' capital investments would be
financed by loans, internal cash generation, and Government contributions,
based on the companies' goal of progressively increasing their self-financing
capacity.
6.10     Terms of reference for the management assistance program are outlined
in Annex 15. During negotiations assurances were obtained that not later than
u-ly  1, 1986, MHEF would employ qualified consultants  to carry out  the
management assistance in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, and that at the conclusion of the program it would promptly review
the recommendations with the Bank and cause the companies to adopt the agreed
structures and administrative procedures.
6.11     In order to monitor progress in project implementation, agreement was
sought during negotiations that MHEF would submit quarterly reports to the
Bank. The reports would in particular cover;
Ci)   progress in procurement of equipment, materials and civil works;
(ii)    progress in construction of the project facilities; and
(iii)    expenditures  on  the  project  and  updated  cost  estimates  of
remaining works.



-22-
6.12     Assurances were also obtained that, within six months following the
closing date of the loan, MHEF in conjunction with EPEOR and EPECO would
prepare and submit to the Bank a completion report an the execution and
initial operation of the project, its costs and the benefits derived or to be
derived from it, the performance and fulfillment by the Government, MEEF,
EPEOR, EPECO and the Bank of their respective obligations under the Loan and
Project Agreements and the accomplishment of the objectives of the Bank loan.
Project Accounts and Audit
6.13     MEEF maintains separate accounts and records of its projects.  A
financial controller from the Ministry of Finance permanently controls the
accounts, which nevertheless should be audited regularly by independent
auditors. To this end, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
MHEF's accounts on the project, including the Revolving Fund account, would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and submitted
to the Bank not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.
Certified copies of the accounts as well as the auditors' reports would also
be furnished to the Bank.
VIOL THE BENEFICIARIES
Bckmrounad
7.01     Potable  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  in  Algeria  are  now
provided by 13 regional public enterprises which were established by
Presidential Decrees Nos. 83-328 through 340 dated May 14, 1983 (see Map
18687).   Basically,  those  enterprises  were formed through the merger of
municipal water and sewer services with SONADE,-'' a bulk water production
company.  The project facilities would be built by MHEF in the wilayate of
Oran and Constantine and operated by EPEOR and EPECO (paras. 6.01, 6.05 and
6.06). Meanwhile, with the exception of the water company in Greater Algiers,
(EPEAL)!', most of the remaining enterprises would benefit from the rest of
the proposed program.   The feasibility studies would be carried out in the
wilayate with the greatest needs. The program of technical assistance would
be given first to the largest enterprises. Operational equipment would be
provided to all the enterprises.
so   Societe Nationale de Distribution d'Eau Potable et Industrielle.
co Technical assistance is provided to EPEAL under Loan 2461-AL.



-23-
7.02     The regional companies started to function only in early 1984.  They
have a corporate statute, are financially autonomous and managed as comercial
undertakings. They operate under the tutelage of MHEF which exercises overall
governmental control, such as approving their investment programs and annual
budgets, annual financial statements, decisions on borrowing and tariff
levels, etc.
Ormnization and Management
7.03     Annex  16  shows  the interim organizational structure of EPEOR and
EPECO.1'   A  Board  of  seven  members,  chaired  by  the  General  Manager,
supervises  each  company's  activities.   Except  for  two Board members who
represent the workers, the other members  are  full-time  managers  of  the
companies.  The General Managers are appointed by Presidential decree upon
nomination  by  the  Minister  of  Hydraulics.   The  General  Managers  are
responsible for the day-to-day operations of the companies which are usually
handled  by  two  departments:   engineering  and  operations,  finance  and
administration.   The  proposed  project  includes  technical  assistance  by
management consultants for the definition and implementation of a suitable
organization and operational procedures for the companies (paras. 6.07-6.09).
Stnaffing
7.04     At  the  end  of  1984 EPEOR and EPECO had  500 and 420 employees
respectively.   So  far,  however,  the  two  companies  have  only  taken  over
responsibility for a few of the agglomerations in their jurisdiction and the
number of their employees is expected to increase substantially in 1985 and
1986 to reach 1,250 and 710 respectively by mid-1987. This would represent a
ratio of about 7 employees per 10,000 people served, which is considered
adequate. This ratio would be monitored during the project execution (para.
8.12).
7.05     The  salaries  and  employment  conditions  in  the  companies  are
satisfactory,  though  lower than  in the industry and energy sectors.  The
companies are not expected, however, to experience difficulties in recruiting
staff. In addition, MHEF is proposing to carry out a national training
program in the sector, which would help to alleviate any lack of staff
capability (paras. 7.06-7.08).
Training Progamm
7.06     The training program would be organized and executed by MHEF with the
assistance of special advisors. Its execution would start in mid 1987 after
7 / A permanent organization would be put in place following the
completion of the management studies described in paras. 6.07-6.09.



-24-
the regional companies have completed their takeover of the water supply
systems under their jurisdiction.   The development of the training program
would involve the following steps:
(i)    a detailed survey of the short- and long-term training needs;
(ii)    design and preparation of the program, and establishment of a
timetable and instruction manuals for the courses;
(iii)    acquisition of teaching material and equipment;
(iv)    selection of instructors and nomination of trainees;
(v)    holding of seminars, classes, field courses, laboratory and shop
practices; and
(vi)    evaluation of the training results.
7.07     The trainees would be divided into two groups:  (a) management staff
and supervisors; and (b) administrative staff and operatives. The training of
the first group would basically include:
(i)    in-service training by consultants;
(ii)    seminars  and  work  discussions  on  management  techniques  in
general and operation of water supply and sewerage companies in
particular;
(iii)    evaluation of the functions of the other group and participation
in the elaboration of training programs for this group; and
iv)    participation in selected specialized courses abroad.
7.08     Training of the second group would be function-oriented, aiming at
improving the skill of the staff to meet manpower requirements of the
companies.   Thus,  special  training  courses  in plumbing,  water and sewer
operation and maintenance, leak detection and control, metering, clerical
work, administration, finance, accounting, etc., would be given by special
consultants.  Both groups would participate in sessions of instruction of the
corporate procedures developed under the management studies (paras. 6.07-6.09).
7.09     The estimated cost of the training program is US$3.5 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$2.0 million which would be financed under the
proposed loan. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from MHEF that:
(i) it would submit a detailed description and schedule of the training
program for Bank review and comments not later than January 1, 1987; and (ii)
it would subsequently hire instructors and consultants acceptable to the Bank
to execute the program.

EilMg and Colecton
7.10     The billing and collection systems, which were in operation prior to
the creation of the regional companies, differed considerably in detail from
one  city  to  another.   In  places  where  water  supply  was  provided  by
municipalities, billing was on an annual basis.  Customers were granted an
annual consumption allowance; any excess was paid at year end.  In cities
where financially autonomous municipal enterprises (regies) provided water
supply  services,  billing  was  quarterly  or  semi-annually.   For  customers
without meters, a fixed charge was levied. In most cases bills were prepared
manually.
7.11     When EPEOR took over the Oran Regie which was in charge of water
distribution in Greater Oran, it acquired its facilities as well as its
receivables.   In Constantine, however, EPECO received only the fixed assets
from  the  municipal  services.   The  current  assets  remained  with  the
municipality.   The  rationalization of the regional companies' billing and
collection procedures is a major task that would be addressed in the program
of management assistance (para. 6.08).
Accounting System
7.12     Apart from the accounts of the former SONADE and regies, which were
kept independently and on an accrual basis, the accounts for water supply and
sewerage services  in the cities formed an integral part of the municipal
accounts.  In general, fixed assets and inventories were not recorded.  The
existing accounting systems need considerable improvement if they are to
properly reflect the operations of the regional companies. Assistance to the
regional companies in introducing improved systems would be provided under the
proposed technical assistance program (para. 6.08).
Aufit
7.13     The accounts of the entities which were merged into the newly created
regional  companies  have  not  been  audited  for  some  time.   As  public
enterprises, the accounts of EPEOR and EPECO are subject to audit by "La Cour
des Comptes," a Government accounting office.  As this office generally limits
its work to a review of the annual financial statements, a more systematic
audit of the accounts of EPEOR and EPECO would be necessary.  In addition, the
staff of  the companies,  particulary during  their  formative  years,  would
benefit  from  a  regular  exchange  of  views with auditors  who have broad
experience in public utilities practices.
7.14     At negotiations, agreement was reached that EPEOR and EPECO would
appoint auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit their accounts, and that
their annual financial statements certified by their auditors as well as the
audit reports would be submitted to the Bank not later than nine months after
the end of each fiscal year, beginning with 1986. A state audit firm, the
"Societe Nationale de Comptabilite" (SNC), has been carrying out the audit of



-26-
Bank projects in the public utilities sectors.   Provided that SNC has the
necessary staff to carry out the audit of accounts of EPEOR and EPECO, its
appointment should be accepted by the Bank.

7.15     The regional companies carry insurance for workmen's compensation,
third party liability and motor vehicles. Other assets are self-insured by
the Government. All supply and civil works contracts for the project vould be
insured against loss or damage in shipment, accidents, fire and property
-damage.
VUL FINANCAL ANALYSS
Present Financial Situation
8.01     The major entity in the creation of the regional companies was the
municipal water supply and sewerage services. Operations of these services,
however, were integrated in the overall  ulnicipal accounts, and as a result,
uo reliable data regarding the levels of revenues and expenses tor water
supply and sewerage were available at the time of the merger.   Estimated
income statements, balance sheets and sources and applications of funds by
EPEOR and EPECO in 1984 are shown in Annexes 17 and 18.  In that year EPEOR
had an operating deficit of DA 13.5 million (US$2.7 million), and an operating
ratio of 127 percent, while EPECO had a negative income before depreciation of
DA 8.1 million (US$1.6 million) and an operating deficit of DA 15.2 million
(US$3.0 million). These deficits were covered by Government contributions.
8.02     The  bulk  of  existing  fixed  assets  were  financed  by  Government
contributions. As a result, the regional companies virtually have no long
term debt. This is reflected in the estimated debt:equity ratio of 1:99 for
EPEOR and EPECO at the end of 1984. The relatively high level of receivable
is due to the companies' practice of billing a full year's consumption at year
end. Receivables will be reduced with the introduction of quarterly billing
in 1986.
Rev-enues
8.03     The water tariffs of Oran and Constantine have remained unchanged
since  1958.   In 1984  they averaged DA 0.65/m3  (US$0.13/M3)  in Oran and
DA 0.60/m3  (US$0.12/M3)  in  Constantine.   In  addition  to  revenues  from
water sales, the companies derive income from meter rentals, connection
maintenance charges and new connection fees.  The present tariffs are too low
as  shown by  the  large deficits  experienced by EPEOR and EPECO in 1984.
Similar  deficits  occurred  in  previous  years.   But  as  the  water  supply
operations were part of the municipal budgets financed by the Government, the
deficits had little if any visibility.



-27-
8.04     This situation, however, has now changed with the creation of the
financially autonomous regional water companies and the expected approval by
the Government of a national tariff structure which would become effective in
September. The approval by the Government of the new tariff structure is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. It is, however, expected to
be met before loan signature in which case this condition would be deleted
from the loan agreement. Under the new structure, progressive tariffs would
be applied for domestic consumption.   The structure would include a first
usage block of 220m3/year  at  the  rate of  DA  1.0/m3  which  is  considered
affordable  by  low-income  families.   Additional  annual  consumption between
220m3  and  330m3  would be  charged  at DA  1.75/m3.   Consumption  in  excess
of  33Om3  would  be  levied  at  DA  2.50/m3.   Meanwhile,  public  consumption
would be charged at DA  2.5/M3  and  industrial  and  commercial  uses at DA
3.0/m3, in order to induce these consumers to restrict their water usage,
which in turn would help reduce future capital outlays.
8.05     The new tariff structure is expected to yield an average revenue of
DA  1.03/m3  in  1985  and  DA  2.16f/m3  in  1986  for EPEOR,  as  compared  to
DA 0.65/m3 in 1984.  In the case of EPECO, the average revenue would raise
to DA 0.93/iM3  in 1985 and DA L.90/m3 in 1986, compared to DA 0.60/m3 in
1984. As a result, EPEOR and EPECO will have respective operating surplus of
DA 61 million (US$12.2 million) and DA 6.5 million (US$1.3 million) in 1986.
Moreover, in future years, the companies would be able to finance part of
their capital investments with internally generated funds (para. 8.07).
Financi  Performance
8.06     The Government's financing plan for the public sector in 1985 ("Loi
des Finances" for 1985), which applies to EPEOR and EPECO, states that
investments of public enterprises should be financed by local and external
borrowings, Government equity contributions, and the enterprises' internal
cash generation. The share of each of these financing sources would depend on
the nature of the investments and would be determined by the Ministry of
Finance. This reflects the increasing awareness in Algeria of the need to
improve the self-financing capability of public enterprises.   Water tariffs
have been too low for so long, however, that realistically they cannot be
increased in one step to the levels that would generate cash sufficient to
finance a substantial part of the investments.  Tariff increases should be
made progressively in parallel with the improvement of services.
8.07     A forecast of the companies' future financial performance is shown in
Annexes  17 and  18.  The assumptions  made  in  preparing  the  forecast  are
described in Annex 19. Assuming that the tariffs would increase annually by
about 4 percent and 7 percent for EPEOR and EPECO respectively -- a level
within the margin of affordability of the consumers (para. 9.08) - EPEOR
should be able to finance about L5 percent of its investments with internally
generated cash from 1987 onward, while EPECO could finance 10 percent of its
investments  in  1987,  and  15 percent  in  1988 and  subsequent  years.   The
forecast net internal cash generation, though modest in the beginning, would
represent a major improvement over past performance and is acceptable at
present.



-28-
.8.08    At negotiations, agreement was reached with the Gvernment, EPEOR and
EPECO that:
(i)    the Government will authorize EPEOR and EPECO  to  charge  the
tariffs necessary to generate, during each fiscal year, revenues
sufficient  to  cover  their  operating  expenses   (excluding
depreciation), debt service requirement, any increase in working
capital other than cash, and from 1987 not less than 15 percent
of the annual average of EPEOR's estimated capital expenditures
in the year considered and the two following years, and by EPECO
not less than 10 percent in 1987, and not less than 15 percent
in 1988 and thereafter;
%iii)   not later than November 30 of each year, starting in 1986, EPEOR
and EPECO will prepare and review with the Government and the
Bank  their  financial  forecast  for  the  next  three  years,
indicating the necessary actions they will take to generate
adequate revenues during the ensuing year.

Future Financial Performance
8.11     The financial performance of EPEOR and EPECO is expected to improve
substantially  in  the  years  following  the  project  completion.   EPEOR's
operating ratio is projected to decrease from 110 percent in 1985 to
67 percent in 1992, that of EPECO from 155 percent to 71 percent during the
same period.   Their rate of return on net fixed assets would be somewhat
adequate during the project construction period (about 3 percent) and would
substantially increase in the following period.   The debt service coverage
would be adequate for both companies, about 1.3 times for EPEOR and EPECO in
1991, the year in which they will start servicing the debt contracted for the
project.
Momtoring System
8.12     Annex 20 shows the technical and financial indicators which would be
monitored during the project execution.  This Annex also gives the values
forecast for the indicators in the years 1986 through 1992. These values were
discussed and agreed with EPEOR and EPECO during negotiations. Agreement was
also reached with EPEOR and EPECO that they will:  (i) report the evolution of
the indicators to the Bank on a quarterly basis during the project execution,
and on an annual basis for five years after the project completion; and (ii)
carry out any reasonable remedial action suggested by the Bank, aiming at
meeting the targeted values of the indicators.
DC. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Objectives of the Proposed Investments
9.O     The need for improving and increasing urban water supply to Oran and
Constantine is self-evident. The present supply is about 35 percent short of
the demand in Oran and 44 percent in Constantine. The current per capita
consumption in the two cities does not exceed i40 liters/day; it reaches 200
liters/day in Algeria's neighboring countries where per capita income is much
less. The shortage of running potable water inside the dwellings, coupled
with population congestion and defective sanitation, appears to be the leading
cause of some infectious diseases in the large urban areas. Cholera, typhoid,
paratyphoid, dysentery and infectious hepatitis are endemic in Oran and
Constantine.
9.02     The proposed works in Oran would increase water production to the
level required to eliminate the current supply deficit and to meet the demand
up to the year 2,000. The quality of water served in this city also would be
greatly improved.  In Constantine the production increase would only meet the
1993 average demand; the construction of another larger project, which is
under design, and which would meet longer term demands, would start in early



-31-
1989. The project would benefit some 2.1 million people living in the two
urban areas.   It would help meet water supply needs in the developing and
poorer districts where a majority of the population lives. The proposed works
would also provide water for industry in the Constantine area where industrial
development has been slowed down because of lack of basic services.
Technoloyical Aspects
9.03     Close to Oran the water sources are brackish and need to be treated
before they can be used for domestic consumption. Fresh water is located far
away (more than 100 kms) from the urban centers and sometime needs to be
elevated to reach them. Various alternatives were studied for increasing the
supply  to  Oran,  covering  desalination,  gravity  or  pumping  supply.   The
proposed project for Oran was found to be the least-cost solution at discount
rates of 8 to 12 percent. As some of the Oran facilities, like the diversion
dam  and  the  Djebel  Zioua  Reservoir,  cannot  be  built  in  stages,  full
development of the Lower Tafna River scheme is scheduled to be carried out in
a sirgle stage.  It is also the most economical alternative, since in this
case, the pumping stations' equipment would be most efficiently utilized.
9.04     In Constantine the two sources considered are the closest to the city
and the least-cost alternative to increase the city's supply. The proposed
project, however, would only meet the short-term demand. A new project must
be developed to satisfy the long-term demand. The groundwater presently used
for irrigation would be taken away for domestic consumption. In compensation,
wastewaters would be collected and treated for reuse in irrigation. To ensure
the highest possible degree of purification of the wastewaters at reasonable
costs and thus the safety of farmers, an extended aeration process followed by
secondary settling and disinfection by ozone have been retained for the
treatment plant. Similar results at a slightly lesser cost could be obtained
with lagoons. But the large area needed for this process is not available
close to Constantine.
Economic AccePabiity
9.05     The overriding justification for the proposed investments is the need
to provide the large metropolitan areas of Oran and Constantine with adequate
public water supply services. The proposed project is the least-cost solution
to meet that need. If the production increase, valued at the proposed tariff
in 1985, is taken as a minimum measure of the project benefits, the internal
economic rate of return on the investments is about 9 percent.
9.06     The calculated return, however, understates other project benefits.
The many health and environmental benefits that the project would generate,
such as (i) reduced expenses for health care;  (ii) welfare improvement of
women and  children who actually spend much time looking for water;  (iii)
higher productivity of children in school; (iv) improved welfare of the
population, stemming from a cleaner and better environment; and (v) workers'
higher productivity as a result of better health, should produce a higher



-32-
economic return on the proposed investments.   These benefits, however, are
difficult to quantify and a more comprehensive return cannot be calculated.
9.07     A  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  return  shows  that  it  is  not
significantly sensitive to moderate changes in the capital costs and water
sales.  Should the costs increase or the sales decrease by 10 percent,  the
rate of  return would decrease to about 8 percent.   Should both the cost
increases and sales decreases take place simultaneously for the project, the
return would decrease to about 7 percent, which is still acceptable
considering the social character of the project. Variations in the operating
expenses were not considered, as any increase of these expenses should be
compensated by a proportional increase of the revenues.
Affordability
9.08     In 1980 the relative poverty level in urban areas was estimated to be
DA 1,270.   The results of a survey of household expenses for basic items,
carried out in that year, are given in Annex 22. At present, water supply
accounts for less than 1 percent of a household's total expenses and is not
considered a burden on the household budget.   It is estimated that even the
lowest income population segment in the project ar2a would spend not more than
1.3 percent of their income for water supply services, well below the usually
accepted level of 5 percent.
Environmental !Mpact of the Project
9.09     The shortage of potable water in Oran and Constantine has resulted in
deplorable sanitary conditions in these urban areas.  The objectives of the
project are to alleviate this shortage and to contribute to the improvement of
environmental  conditions   in  the  country's   second  and  third   largest
agglomerations.   As a result of the project, wastewater in the two cities
would increase and would need to be disposed of by acceptable means. The Oran
sewer system has the required capacity to convey the expected additional
wastewater.  The project includes a sewerage component in Constantine where
wastewater would be reused in irrigation.
Lstitution Building
9.10     A  first  step  towards the reorganization and strengthening of the
water supply and sanitation sector in Algeria was taken with the Algiers
Sewerage Project (Loan 1545-AL), which included the establishment of a new
water authority (SEDAL) in Greater Algiers, and feasibility studies in Oran
and Constantine, the second and third largest cities.  The objective was to
put in place a financially viable water authority that could be used as a
model  in establishing  similar organizations  in other cities and wilayate.
This was attained, as the Government has set up water companies similar to
SEDAL in twelve regions of the country.
9.11     The next step would be to strengthen the management and financial



-33-
performance of the regional companies. The proposed project is conceived to
reach that goal.  It includes  (i) technical assistance to the companies to
develop their organization and training; and (ii) feasibility studies to
improve water supply and sewerage services throughout the country.  Solving
the water supply problem of the urban areas is a difficult task for which the
Government and the regional companies are conscious of the need for outside
technical assistance.   The Bank can help  provide  such assistance  and  the
leverage required to support the implementation of sound managerial and
financial policies in the sector.
RLk
9.12     There is a risk that the Government might not implement the projected
tariff increases in the time required to attain the financial objectives set
out for EPEOR and EPECO. This risk, however, is reduced by the Government's
recent decision regarding the financial framework and objectives for the
sector, which emphasize that the water companies would be managed as
commercial enterprises and would charge the tariffs necessary to finance their
investments through a mix of borrowings and internal cash generation.
9.13     There are no special risks involved in the technical execution of the
project. The accuracy of the cost estimates is higher than usual, as they are
based on bids submitted for about 60 percent of the contracts.
X. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01    Agreement having been reached on the issues outlined in Chapters V
through VIII, and subject to the condition of effectivmnes; set forth in para.
5.21 and 8.04, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$262
million to the Government of Algeria for a term of 15 years including 4 years
of grace.

ALGERIA
NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT,
TARIFF AND FINANCIAL STUDIES
Introduction
1.       The Government of Algeria has recently established thirteen regional
companies to be responsible for the provision of drinking water and the
collection and treatment of wastewater in the country. The territorial
jurisdiction of each of them is shown on Map 18687. The companies replaced
previous regies and municipal services which were in charge of water supply
and sewerage services in the urban areas. They are public-owned enterprises,
are financially autonomous and managed as conmmercial undertakings. They
operate under the tutelage of the Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment and
Forestry (MHEF) and are subject to the principles of socialist management
applicable to all Algerian Enterprises.
2.       The Companies are about to embark on a substantial capital program
involving the construction of new treatment plants, water distribution and
sewer systems. In particular, two of them, the '"Etreprise de Production, de
Gestion et de Distribution d'Eau d'Oran" (EPEOR) and the "Entreprise de
Production, de Gestion et de Distribution d'Eau de Constantine" (EPECO) would
invest US$539 million in the Oran and Constantine areas. Part of this
investment would be financed by a loan of US$262 million from the World Bank.
3.       In order that the companies should be fully equipped to tackle the
investment program in the most effective way, consultants are to be retained
to advise on the companies' organization and management, financial structure
and tariff policies. The required services are described below:
Organization and Management Studies
4.       The objectives of the organization and management studies are to
establish the most effective organization structure to enable the regional
companies to discharge their responsibilities, and to determine the best means
of integrating the operations and staff of the constituent entities into the
new structure. To this end, it is envisaged that the consultant's studies
will cover (but will not necessarily be limited to) the following aspects of
corporate organization:
(i)    definition of the main functions within the companies and the
principal line and staff relationships;



-52-
ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 7
(ii)    establishment of appropriate procedures for planning and
decision-making;
(iii)    definition of appropriate machinery for liaison and consultation
with concerned agencies of the cities, the Wilayate and central
government;
(iv)    preparation of statements of objectives and responsibility for
each senior management position; and
(v)    preparation of detailed organization charts for each
division/department within the proposed structure.
5.       After completion and agreement of the organizational proposals, the
consultant is required to proceed to a number of detailed studies as follows:
(i)   the development of proposals for the rationalization of services
such as purchasing, storekeeping and transport;
(ii)    formulation of procedures for meter reading, billing and
collection (including the use of data processing equipment) and
development of proposals for the harmonization of these
procedures;
(iii)    the desirability of maintaining master meters and use of
individual meters;
(iv)    development of budgeting system and procedures;
(v)    organization plan and staffing schedule for the establishment of
a budget section within the finance department;
(vi)    the design of an organization plan, staffing requirement, terms
of reference and work schedule for an internal audit function
covering all aspects of the companies' activities; and
(vii)    development of general and cost accounting manuals.  The
Algerian "Plan Comptable National" should be the base for the
chart of accounts and financial reports. Special attention
should be paid to the fact that major capital works are carried
out by MHEF's agencies. Accounting for liaison, and reporting
requirements to ensure prompt recording of these works and
associated transaction in the companies' books, should be given
full attention.

ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 7
Tariff Studies
6.       The consultant is required to develop a tariff structure which the
companies might use for charging water supply and sewerage services, together
with a schedule of proposed rates for the years 1987-1992. In the course of
this part of the study the consultant is first expected to develop forecasts
of:
(i)    consumer use of the services, in terms of numbers of
connections, volume of water sold, and any other measures he
considers relevant; and
(ii)    the operating costs of the services, taking into account the
organization structure proposed in the organization and
management study, and including depreciation of fixed assets
valued at estimated replacement cost, and any taxes or duties
likely to be imposed on the companies.
7.       in developing his proposals for the tariff structure and rates, the
consultant should thoroughly examine and evaluate the following:
(i)    the economic efficiency of the proposed tariffs, in terms of
their reflection of the estimated long-run marginal costs of the
services;
(ii)    the extent to which the companies' activities convey benefits to
a wider public than their own connected customers - for example,
by safeguarding health and protecting against stormwater damage
- and the possibility of recovering (by taxes or otherwise) such
benefits in the form of income for them;
(iii)    the effect (if any) of the proposed tariffs on the forecast of
water sales, and the adequacy of the resultant total revenues to
cover costs as defined in para. 6(ii) above;
(iv)    the extent to which identifiable groups or classes of consumers
impose special costs on the systems, which should be reflected
in special charges to those consumers;
(v)    the possibility and justification of charging to industries
rates which would take into account the quality of the liquid
wastes discharged by these industries;
(vi)    whether the proposed levels of charges are within the reasonable
ability-to-pay of all consumer groups, and whether a case exists
on these or any other grounds for concessionary rates to be
applied to particular consumer groups or levels of consumption;



-54-
ANNEX 15
Page 4 of 7
(vii)    the effectiveness of the proposed water rates in discouraging
waste and inessential use of water;
(viii)    the means of recovering the cost of supplies delivered free
through public taps; and
(ix)    consistency of the tariffs with the methods of assessment and
billing proposed under terms of reference 5(ii) and 5(iii) above.
8.       The consultant should review the cost of providing other services
associated with the provision of water by the companies to their customers.
They include fees for meter rental and maintenance, new connections, special
fees for reading and billing of individual meters, etc. The consultant should
provide the companies with proposals for:
{i)    methods for establishing the fees;
(ii)    the calculation of new connection cost, shut-off and
reconnection fees, meter rental and repairs; and
(iii)    methods for updating the cost of the services and a mechanism
for updating the fees.
9.       On the basis of his forecasts of operating costs, future investments
and replacement of obsolete assets, and revenues available from the proposed
tariffs, the consultant should prepare projections of the resultant cash flows
from operations. The consultant is then required to propose:
i)   the proportions in which it would be appropriate to apply this
cash flow to:
(a) debt service on borrowed funds; and
(b) contributions to the companies' current or future capital
expenditures;
(ii)    the proportions in which funds provided to the companies  by the
Government should accordingly be divided between capital
contributions and loans;
(iii)    the appropriate terms (interest, maturity and grace periods) for
any loan funds so provided; and
(iv)    the life expectancy of assets acquired or built with the funds
so provided.
10.      In carrying out this part of the studies, it is expected that the
consultant would wish to examine a number of alternatives. In evaluating



-55-
A1PIEJC 1
Page 5 of 7
these alternatives he should pay particular regard to the declared objectives
of the Government with respect to the financing of investments by enterprises,
as set out in the Finance Law of 1986.
11.      At the conclusion of this part of the studies, the consultant should
prepare complete financial projections (income statements, balance sheets and
cash flow statements) for the recommended alternative. In the event he wishes
to submit alternative schemes for consideration, financial projections should
be completed for each alternative.
Financial Obiectives and Performance Indicators
12.      The final part of the studies comprises the formulation of financial
objectives for the companies' management, and perfc.- mance indicators by whicb
their progress towards these objectives may be monitored. The objectives
should be consistent with the policies proposed for tariffs and
capitalization.  They and the performance indicators should be capable of
precise and unambiguous expression, and within the capacity of the companies'
information systems to calculate and report promptly and accurately. They may
include (but are not necessarily limited to) cash generation ratios, balance
sheet ratios, measures of unit costs and service levels. If appropriate,
separate indicators may be developed for different parts of the companies'
operation, including in particular the water supply and sewerage operations.
Implementation and Training
13.      As the work proceeds on items described in para. 6 and following the
completion of the tasks described in para. 4 above, the consultant should
assist the companies in implementing the organizational proposals, and the new
systems and procedures. The companies' staff would carry out the
implementation with assistance from the consultant mainly in the following
areas.
(i)    overall planning and coordination of the implementation process,
follow-up, reporting and update of schedules;
(ii)    training of the companies' staff assigned for implementation.
This would include conducting workshops and provision of
on-the-job training to ensure smooth implementation;
(iii)    provision of guidance and establishment of procedures to
reconcile and consolidate the companies' current accounts, and
establishment of balances along the recommended chart of
accounts; and
(iv)    computerization of the companies' activities, such as billing
and collection, accounting, stocks, inventories, etc.



-56-
ANNEX 15
Page 6 of 7
14.      The consultant should also establish a methodology for updating the
findings of the tariff studies and the preparation of updated financial
projections. To ensure that this task is carried out properly, the consultant
should:
(i)    provide relevant training to the companies' assigned staff
during the preparation of the studies; and
(ii)    coordinate this task with the development of budget systems and
the setting up of a budgeting section (para. 5(iv)).
Timetables and Reports
15.      It is envisaged that the organization/management study and the
tariff/financial study would be carried out in parallel, and an elapsed time
of not more than 12 months (from mobilization of the consultant's team in
Algiers) is allowed for completion of the studies. Assistance in implementing
the organizational changes and new systems (paras. 13 and 14) would continue
for another 12 months.
16.      The following reports are .o be submitted:
i)   not later than the end of the sixth month, a first report on
organization and management, containing recommendations on the
matters set out in terms of reference (paras. 4 and 5). Two
months would be allowed for consideration of this report by MHEF
and the companies, discussion with the consultant, and
determination of any revision which may be necessary;
(ii)    not later than the end of the eight month, operational  manuals
as per para. 5(vii) should be submitted together with a detailed
implementation plan; and
(iii)    by the end of the twelfth month of the assignment:
(a) a final report on organization and management,
incorporating any revision made to the first report and
including an updated plan of action for implementation; and
(b) a report on tariffs and finance, covering the matters
described in terms of reference (paras. 6-12) and setting
out the financial projections referred to in para. 11 of
the terms of reference.
17.      The interim reports are to be submitted in 20 copies, and the final
reports in 50 copies, in the French language, and delivered initially to MHEF.

language should be submitted separately in sealed envelopes by
--     to:
19.      Proposals should contain, inter alia:
(i)    a description of the consulting firm (or firms) and its areas of
specialism;
(ii)    a description of other relevant assignments previously carried
out by the firm;
(iii)    an explanation of the way in which the consultant proposes to

make on the terms of referenc- or any modifications he may wish
to propose in the interests of better achieving the objectives
of the assignment;
Civ)    a brief description of any special methodology to be employed
(for example, use of computers);
(v)   a staffing chart for the assignment, showing each specialist to

the Algerian authorities may be able to provide in regard to accommodation,
local transportation and other administrative matters should be indicated in
the proposal.

ANNEX 19
Page 1 of 4
ALGERIA
NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF EPEOR AND EPECO
Assumptions for Financial Analysis
Opening Balance Sheet
1.       EPEOR and EPECO balance sheets for 1984 are based on the companies'
opening balances when they started taking over services in their
jurisdictional areas:
(i)   Fixed assets, comprising water supply and sewerage facilities
which are to be transferred to EPEOR and EPECO were tentatively
assessed at their current (1984) replacement cost net of
depreciation. These assets include facilities previously owned
by SONADE and the municipalities.
(ii)    EPECO's current assets and liabilities represent only those
transferred by SONADE - Constantine to EPECO at their book
values. EPECO has not taken over the current assets and
liabilities of the municipalities.  For EPEOR they represent the
current assets and liabilities inherited from SONADE - Oran and
the Oran Regie.
(iii)    The net value of the companies' assets is assumed to be a
Government contribution to equity. The negative balance of
retained earnings by EPECO represents accumulated losses of
SONADE - Constantine as transferred to EPECO's books. For EPEOR
they represent the same as taken over from SONADE - Oran and the
Oran Regie.
Income Statements
2.       Internal Inflation:  The following inflation rates were used:
1985 - 1988: 7%
1989 - 1990: 6X
1991 - 1992: 5X
3.       Operating Revenues
(i)    Projection of Water Sales
In 1984 the companies provided services only in the capital



-67-
ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 4
cities of the wilayate within their jurisdiction. Water sales
are assumed to increase in 1985 and 1986 as the companies
continue to take over other towns in their jurisdiction. Sales
will further increase after the proposed project is completed.
The increased sales also reflect expected improvement in
unaccounted-for water which is projected to reach 231 in 1992.
Water sales from 1987 onward are projected on the basis of
expected demand and the production levels as envisaged under the
project.
(ii)    Revenues
Revenues in 1985 are based on the assumption that the new
tariff increase would be introduced as from September 1, 1985.
It is expected that more tariff increases would be applied in
the future starting in 1987. Increases throughout the
projection period are projected to average about 41 annually for
EPEOR and 7X for EPECO.
(iii)    Meter Rental and Connection Maintenance
In projecting revenues for these two items, the following was
assumed:
(a)  Fees for meter rental and connection maintenance will be
the same in all the wilayate and will average DA 60.0 per
year in 1985. They were DA 10.0 in 1984.
(b)  Revenues are based on the mid-year average numbers of
connections, taking into account the gradual take over of
operations in the wilayate.
(iv)    New Connections
Connections are the property of the customers. They are billed
at their cost (currently at about DA 1,700 for master meters),
plus a service tax of 11.1X. The number of connections is
projected on the basis of population growth in the project area,
in addition to new connections (which are expected as a result
of the project) to meet unsatisfied demand.
4.       Operating Expenses
(i)    Personnel:  Personnel expenses are projected to increase in
proportion to the required number of staff and salary
adjustments. Additional staff, needed for operating the new
project facilities, are taken into account from the years the
facilities are put in operation.

APO= 19
Page 3 of 4
(ii)    Energy and Fuel:  Future levels of consumption are
projected assuming gradual improvement of efficiency.
Energy required for operating the project is estimated on
the basis of the 1984 prices adjusted for inflation.
(iii)    Materials and Maintenance:  Their quantities are based on
the estimated number of new connections and forecast
maintenance programs.
(iv)    Taxes:  Calculated according to their nature:  a tax of
2.53Z on gross revenues, a tax of 11.1X on all purchases of
materials, plus a 6% tax on salaries.
(v)    Capital Expenses:  This represents the cost of connection
extensions (material, labor, overhead and taxes) included
in the foregoing items, which are constructed by EPEOR and
EPECO and incorporated in their assets.
(vi)    Depreciation:  Calculated at straight-line rates based on
the estimated service lives of major assets components.
The annual average depreciation rates of 2.6 percent for
EPEOR and approximately 14 percent for EPECO, through the
projection period are somewhat lower than usual because of
the dams and pipelines which have long useful lives.
Accounts Receivable
5.       Receivables for water consumption are assumed to decline
following improvement in billing and collection envisaged under the
project, and are based on target collection periods. Accounts receivable
are expected to reach three months of billing by 1987. Other accounts
are projected to vary slightly over the projection period.
Inventories
6.       In 1984 inventories represented about 12 months of consumption
of materials and chemicals. This level is expected to decrease through
the implementation of new materials control systems which will be
proposed under the management studies. It is projected to represent six
months by 1990.
Accounts Payable
7.       They are projected as follows:
{i)    Customers' deposits:  They are calculated on an average of
three-month consumption, plus other fees, and are adjusted
along expected tariff increases.



-69-
ANN( 19
Page 4 of 4
(ii)    Suppliers (including retention money):  A declining ratio
per month of total purchase of materials and investments is
projected, but this is not expected to go below three
months of total purchase (excluding the projected
investments for which working capital would be financed by
the Ministry of Hydraulics, the executing agency).
Long and Medium-Term Loans
8.       They include:
(i)    Proceeds of the proposed Bank loan, which are to be
reimbursed by EPEOR and EPECO to the Government. An annual
interest rate of 10X as well as a commitment fee of 0.75
percent per annum will be charged on the loan . The loan
is repayable by EPEOR and EPECO in twenty-five years
including five years of grace.
(ii)    Proceeds of unidentified long-term loan to finance foreign
exchange components of EPEOR's next plan of investments
starting from 1989. The loan would be repayable after five
years of grace at an annual interest rate of 10 as well as
a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum.
(iii)    Current medium-term loans are from local government-owned
development and comuercial banks and were used for
financing previous investments by SONADE. They are payable
over five years after two years of grace with an interest
rate of 5.5 percent.
