MEMORANDUM AND RECOMAM AON OF THE PRISE5T
of Ti IDBRD To TH  ExEcunv  Dntz'rots ON A PRoposED LOAN TO
THE STATz OF Mis GERAIS van TE GUARAmE
OF THE FE EtA    REIUBUC OF BRA:L
FOR A BAsic EDUCAToN QUALITY IMPRovMENTr PRoicr
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the State of Minas Gerais, with the
guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brai, for the equivalent of
US$150.0 million to help finmce a project for Basic Education Quality
Improvement. The loan will be for 15 years, on a fixed amortzation
schedule with a five-year grace period, in accordance with the amortizaton
schedule chosen by the Borrower at negotiations.
2.   Bacgmud. In many rects, Minas Gerais is a microcosm of
Brazil, with unusually high- and low-income localities found in its eight
macro-regions. It has an economy almost as diversified as that of Brazil as a
whole, and displays the same social inequities. The socioeconomic
conditions of the largely agricultural notheastn corner of the state resemble
those found in the poverty-stricken northeast of Brzil, whereas the southeast
portion of the state is one of the richest agricultural regions in the country.
The industrial success of the state is largely concentratd in the area
surrounding the state capital of Belo Horizonte. With almost 16 miion
inhabitants (11 percent of the Brazilian population) in an area equivalent in
size to France, Minas Gerais' estimated per capita GDP of $2,500 in 1990
was below the national average of $2,680. As a result of significant
migration flows within as well as from outside the state's boundaries, the
urban population in 1990-75 percent of the state's total-was more than
double that of 1960. The relatively favorable socioeconomic stats of the
state masks a skewed income distribution, with 35 percent of the
economically active population in 1987 surviving on less than half the
country's average per capita income. Despite the divesity of the state's
economy, Minas Gerais has suffered in recent years from the economic
problems resWling from the country's overall   economic instability.
3.    Swoal Issues. Even though access to primary school has become
essentially universal in Brazi today, the education levels of the Bilian
population are still extremely low when compared with those of ote upper
middle-income countries. On average, Brazilias have anly 3.9 years of
schooling, and 62 percent of the Brazlian population has four years or fewe
of schooling. The situation is no different in Minas Gerais. In comparison,
Argentima and Venezula, both with about the same per capita income as
Brazil, have achieved an average educational level of 8.7 and 7.1 years,
respectively. Public basic education in Minas Gerais is also affected by
extremely low school productivity. This is reflected in low achievement



-2-
Vels (or quality)-most of the students master only half of the curriculum
content It is also reflected in persistently low graduadon rates (or low
cfflciency)a mere 2.5 percent complete eighth grade without repetition, and
only 40 percent ever graduate, afer spending, on average, II years in
school. The frequency with which students repeat grades plays a critical role
in the low output of schools. High repetition is simultaneously a result of
low achievement and a cause of low graduation. In elementary school as a
whole, 30 percent of students on average are repeaters; in first gade alone,
43 percent of students are repeaters. Repetition also accounts for the fact
that of the 34 percent of the older student population (aged 15-19) attending
school, two thirds are still in elementary school. In Minas Gerais, these
sectora= inefficiencies affect a student population of three million, 74 percet
of whom go to state schools, 19 percent to municipal schools, and 7 percent
to private schools.
4.   In addition to undermining Brazil's long-term economic growth, such
a low level of educational attainment thatens the estshment of a stable
society. It is highly questionable whether the Bilian society, including that
of Minas Gerais, can expwect to meet the challenges of today's highly
competitve world economy with a labor force that possesses, on averge,
barely four years of primary education. Furthermore, since low income
levels are associated with low levels of education, pverty alleviation efforts
wil continue to be constrained in Brazil unless significant investments in
education parallel these eforts.
5.     Q      t St=Sy. Chronically low school productivity results
from a complex set of social factors, some of which are external to the
sector, such as the low socio-economic background of the children's families.
But most can be attributed to poor instruction that results from:
(a) insufficient provision of essential instructional inputs, such as adequate
quantities of books and classroom time; (b) inadequately trained teachers who
lack competence and incentives for improving their classroom performance;
(c) inappropiate use of rigid pedagogical practices; (d) absence of cost-
effecve management tools and policies; and (e) unduly complex govemance
and management. These sector problems, all of which are in the realm of
policy action, are compounded by the inadequacy of spending on primary
education.
6.    To address these issues, the government of Minas Gerais has already
implemented a set of policy measures that together foster autonomy and
accountability-two critical ingredients of education quality-in schools. The
govemment has issued direcves and decrees in support of these pjlicy
measures, and followed them up with concrete intiatives. Minas Jerais is
the first Brazilian state to have created an enabling policy environment for
increased school productivity by having concunrently: (a) instituted automatic



-3-
promotion from first to second grade; (b) carried out standardized testing of
student achievement; (c) adopted an objective process for selection and
appointment of school principals; (d) empowered school councils with the
authority and means to assist principals in school administration; (e) initiated
regular and transparent transfers of selected nonsalary resources directly to
schools; and (t) decentralized selected administative functions to schools.
The govemnment has agreed to maintain the policy directives required to
support these ongoing initiatives.
7.   Project         . The goal of the proposed project is the
improvement of educadonal antainment in the State of Minas Gerais through
support to policies and inestments to: (a) provide managers in the cental
and regional offices with tools desiped for information-based decision-
malkng; (b) help school directors assume their roles as both leaders and
managers in a more decent   state education system; (c) increase
teachersV access to training opportunities; (d) deliver a package of
intuctional marials, especially books, to students in public classrooms;
and (e) upgrade facility management to ensure equitable access of pupils to
classroom time as well as rational use of school space. Progress towards the
achievement of the project's goal will be monitored through yearly
meumement of increases in the number of students reaching grade 5 with no
more than one repetiton-a proxy for both incased stdent achievement and
improved student flow across each of the lower primary grades. This will be
the dma= Mect manc M      ndzatr. The target is to increase by about
half, from the baseline level of 32 percent to about 50 percent, the number of
students who reach grade 5 with no more than one repetition by the end of
the project period. This target level assumes that: (a) student achievement
will increase consistently and gradually over the project period; (b) student
promotion between grades 1 and 2 will approach 95 percent by the time of
the project's mid-term review; and N) the repetition rates in the lower grades
will decrease by about 5-10 percent in each of the lwr  primary grades.
These three measures will constitute the s         f
indicators and targs, and they will also be tracked regularly under the
project.
8.   s i       Rdon. The proposed project will consist of five main
components: (a)   =n& 3A=-WIde Manment (US$21.5 million, 7
percent of total cost) for student assessment, educational monitoring systems,
and opeaonal studies to stimulate infomaton-based decision-maldng;
(b) Streng&big School Administation (US$47.3 million, 16 percent of
total cost) in support Of school planning (including school development
grants), leadship development, and office technology systems;
(c) D(UlXng Teacn              (US$57.2 million, 19 percent of total
cost) to increase public school teachers' access to training in classroom
management (including textbook use and subject knowledge), enhance



-4-
curriculum developmel.t, and support evaluation research; (d) Providing
trctionl Mdaterials (US$121.6 million, 40 percent of total cost) to
improve learing by supporting the delivery of instructional materials,
espeally books, to students in public classrooms; and (e) Upggading Eilif
Management (US$49.9 million, 16.5 percent of total cost) in support of
classroom construction and rational school space uilization necessary to
ensure that all pupils attending state schools have access to standard four and
a half hour school shifts. The project will also finance project management
costs of about US$4.4 million equivalent.
9.    Total project cost is estimated at US$302.0 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of about US$53.3 million. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule,
are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$10.0 million
equivalent will be granted for eligible expenditures incurred up to 12 months
prior to lorn signing, but not before July 1, 1993. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Brazl are given
in Schedules C and D, repectively. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12477-
BR dated March 24, 1994, is being distributed separately.
10.  Prdect Implentation. Responsibility for prcoect implementation
will be vested in the Minas Gerais State Secretariat of Education (SEE/MG).
For this purpose, SEE/MG will maintain a small central project coordination
unit (UCP) reporting directly to the State Education Secretary, as well as a
high-level advisory committee (CA) reporting directly to the State Govenor.
The UCP will have overall responsibility for project coordination through an
operational network of representatives selected from staff already at the
regional offices and schools. Actual execution of project activities will be
caried out by the existing SEE/MG administrative units alrady responsible
for these functions. The State Departnent of Public Works (DEOP) will
assist SEE/MG in implementing construction of schools. UNDP will be
contracted to implement technical assistnce and carry out procurement of
equipment. SEE/MG will work with MEC to implement the project's
textbook subcomponent within the framework set out by the national
resolution issued in July 1993, which reafflimed the federal government's
obligation to finance, procure, and distribute textbooks for all public students
in Brazil. Under the project, all stace transfers to municipalities will be in
kdnd (e.g., books, training, and student testing). The project will be
implemented over a six year period, starting in 1994.
11.  Priect Sustainability. By the time of the closing date, it is expected
that the nonsalary recurrent costs of SEEIMG will be about 25 percent above
the current level. This increase will be necessary to maintain an adequate
level of nonsalary expenditures on basic education, and thus sustain project



investnents aftr the project ends. This figure excludes funds for textbook
provision (about US$10 million per year), which Resolur&o No. 6 of July 13,
1993 rearflmed as a federal government obligation. The increase is
esimated at about US$20 million per year, which reprets approximately
2.8 percent of the current state annual budget of about US$700 million
(excluding transfers), and is equivalent to the annual counterpart funding
contribution of the state to project financing. During the life of the projet,
the Bank and the State government will share these costs; no declining basis
is being proposed, in light of the fact that, when the project ends, the
estimaed aggregate incremental recurrent costs to be assumed by the
govenment are equivalent to the aggregate government contribution during
project execution. This increase should be fully within the absorptive
capacity of the state budget. The commitment of the State government to
project objectives, as set forth in the Policy Letter on Basic Education
Quality Improvement, is also expected to contribute to the sustainability of
project benefits.
12.   I. Bank experience indicates that the following
ifctors, all of which are taken into account in the design of the proposed
project, are keys to success in education projects: (a) good balance between
policy reforms and investments; (b) simple and robust project design, with
sulcient flexibility to respond to changing cirumstances; (c) adequate
prvision of educational software, particularly textbooks, selective teacher
training, time allotted to learning, and curriculum development; (d) early
establisment of programming, monitoring, and evaluaton systems;
(e) strong project management, staffed with qualified personnel with access
to the highest levels of decision makers; (f) up-front attention to careful
synchrorntion of project activities; (g) realistic assessment of the time
required for project implementation; (h) limitation of covenants to
monitorable areas directly related to the project; and (i) enhanced Bank
performance in project supervision, including early development of
supervision plans, a mid-term review, and regular visits to project sites.
13.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. There are several reasons for Bank
financing in support of the basic education progam of Minas Gerais.
Investment in primary education quality, as a means of incrasing educational
attainment and thus developing human resources and reducing poverty, is a
key element of the Bank's country assistance strategy for Brazil, discussed at
the Board on June 29, 1993. The project is designed so that all actions
specifically promote these objectives, and it is therefore fully consistent with
the Bank's country assistance strategy for Brazil. The project is also
responsive to critical sectoral issues and lessons learned through past Bank
education lending to Brai and elsewhere, which call for investment lwns
with an appropriate balance of policy changes, hardware and software
investments, institutional development, and technical assistance. More



importanly, Minas Gais has already demonstated its willingness and
capacity to pursue meaningful secto  ivements, as well as to pioneer
controversial but necessary changes in educational policy and practices, some
of which are innovations that may be replicable elsewhere. To implement
these policies and prctices, however, Mis  3eais needs resources and
advice in their deployment. The Bank is wdl positioned to render such
advice, given its experience with similar operations in other countries. Of
course, the Bank is also well positioned to contribute with resources (which
are not available from commercial banlk). Some project activities have
already been initiaed with SEE/MG's own resources, and these ongoing
initiatives are already showing positive results. Without Bank support,
however, the state will have to scale back its education program significantly,
thereby threatening its potential impact. Bank support will provide tie means
for implementing these policies and practices in a state that has already
adopted an appropriate policy framework for improving the quality of public
basic education in Brazil. Bank support will also give the Bank the
Opportunity to contribute substantively to interventions that are relatively new
in Brazil, but which the Bank has experience in supporting elsewhere.
Moreover, in Minas Gerais, as in the other Brazilian states, children from the
upper and middle classes generally attend private schools from preschool
thrugh secondary school, while poor and lowe middle-class children attend
public schools. Hence, by focusing on public primary schools, the proposed
project will improve equity, as it will be directed toward less advantaged
groups within the stat. Finally, this project was identified during the field-
based project identification exercise (PIE) carried out by the division as part
Of its sategy in FY92 for successfuly building an adequate lending pipeline
for education in Brazil. Because the PIE was undertake in close
collaboration with local counteparts, the project has enjoyed strong
government commitment. As a result, project preparation advanced quickly
and smoothly, as reflected by the fict that the project was appraised one year
after the first Bank mission to the State.
14.  Etvironmental Impact. The project is not ewected to have any
significant environmental impact as a consequence of the urban school
construction planned under the Upgrading Facility Management component
15.  Program Objective Categories. Consstent with the Bank's assistance
strategy for Brazil, the project contributes to human resource development
and poverty reduction by investing in a program of targeted prmary school
interventions aimed at raising educational attainment among the less
advantaged groups in the State of Minas Gerais.
16.  Issues and Actions. At negQAtioQns, assurances weic obtained that
the Borrower will: (a) carry out project activities with due diligence and in
conformity with terms, arrangements, and timetable atsfctory to the Bank,



-7-
as specified in the project implementation plan (PIP), which can be i. Aified
only with the consent of the Bank; (b) by June 15, 1994, adopt a project
monitoring matrix, satisfactory to the Bank, including time-bound quantitative
indicators of project performance; (c) ensure that every public elementary
school student in the State of Minas Gerais has a set of textbooks in hand at
the beginning of each school year, starting in 1995, regardless of the nature
of support from the federal govemment; (d) maintain a policy directive that
charges SEE/MG with the responsibility to set appropriate standards of
facility utilization; (e) by December 31, 1995, enter into colaborative
agreements, under terms satisfactory to the Bank, with as many
municipalities as required to compose a sample of at least 10 percent of the
students in municipal elementary schools for the purpose of extending student
assessment testing by 1996 to students attending schools under the
jurisdictions of the subject municipalities; (f) maintain the high-level advisory
committee (CA, appointed by Decree No. 35423 of March 3, 1994) with
composition and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; (g) maintain in
the SEE/MG a project management unit (UCP) operating in accordance with
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, including the operation of a
computerized system for tracking commitments, contracting, procurement,
and disbursement under the project; (h) carry out all procurement of goods
and civil works financed by the Bank in accordance with Bank guidelines and
project-specific arrangements, including the use of ICB and LCB model
bidding documents satisfactory to the Bank; (i) carry out all contracting of
services under the project on a timely basis and in accordance with terms of
reference, including a timetable of critical actions, satisfactory to the Bank;
(j) no later than July 15 of each year, startng in 1994, furnish to the Bank
for its review and approval a proposed annual operating plan for project
activities to be executed in the subsequent year of project execution, prepared
n accordance with a pre-agreed format and including a detailed schedule,
physical targets, and a proposed budget; (k) not later than June 15 of each
year, starting in 1Y95, hold annual project implementation reviews jointly
with the Bank, based on annual progress reports of such scope, detil, and
format as the Bank may reasonably request, to be furnished to the Bank no
later than 60 days prior to the annual review date; (O) thirty-six months after
the Effectiveness Date, hold jointly with the Bank a mid-term review of the
project, in conformity with terms agreed during negotiations, and based on a
mid-term progress reports of such scope, detail, and format as the Bank may
reasonably request, to be furnished to the Bank no later than 60 days prior to
the mid-term review date; and (m) no later than June 30 of each year,
startng in 1995, fnish to the Bank audit reports of the operation of all
project accounts in the previous year, prepared by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
and practices, and in conformity with auditing arrangements to be in place by
June 30, 1994. Also during negotiations, the state provided evidence that it:
had allocated in its budget sufficient counterpart funds for financing the



-8-
state's share of activities in the first year of project execution; and had
obtained the endorsement of the Ministry of Education (MEC) to its
operational plan for implementing the textbook component of the project in
partnership with that Ministry.
17.   As a condition of Board presentation, the state will provide to the
Bank a final version of its Policy Letter on Basic Education Quality
Improvement, based on the draft discussed at negotiations. As a condidon of
loan efectiveness, the state will appoint a project management team with
experience and qualifications acceptable to the Bank. As a condition of
disbursement for civil works, the state will provide evidence that it has
completed a survey of school facilities within the vicinity of the proposed
schoo', in conformity with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to
substantiate actual excess demand for classroom space in the targeted
neighborhood. As a condition of disbursement for school awards, the state
will submit to the Bank guidelines for the operation of its support program
for school innovation.
18.   Benefits. Through an additional expenditure of US$20 per beneficiary
pupil annually, the project will directly improve the quality of schooling for
approximately 3 million primary school children per year in public schools in
the State of Minas Gerais. The project will contribute to overall development
of the civil service in the state by providing training and upgrading
opportunities to teachers, who account for almost half of the civil service in
Minas Gerais. Improved student flows will also increase the efficiency of
public spending on prinary education. The project will test potentially
replicable methodologies by supporting the establishment of systematic
educational monitoring, including student assessment--a pioneering concept in
Brazil. The project will also help establish an improved empirical basis for
decision-maldng by policymakers and practitioners by financing studies aimed
at assessing the relative cost-effectiveness and impact of various educational
interventions.
19.   Risks. At present, implementation risks are relatively low because of
reasonably strong government commitment and leadership, matched by staff
ownership in the project design and openness to external technical assistance.
Nonetheless, there are four main risks associated with this project. The first
risk is the possibility of diminished political commitment following the
change in government that will take place in 1995. A decline in political
commitment could lead to the failure of the government to provide adequate
counterpart funds in a timely manner. This risk will be mitigated by having
representatives from selected stakeholder groups and constituencies
participate in the High-Level Advisory Committee (CA) to be maintained
throughout the life of the project. This CA will serve as an agent for



-9-
resolving eventual inter-agency coordination problems and as a guardian of
project interests across SkE/MG administrations.
20.   The second risk is the possibility that the enabling policy framework,
supported by decrees and directives, might backslide with tnw change in the
state government cabinet in early 1995. This risk will be mitigated by
seeking formal assurance from the government of its commitment to the
policy frarmework. This will be done through the Government's transmission
to the Bank as a condition of Board presentadon of a Policy Letter of Basic
Education Quality Improvement of the State of Minas Gerais Public School
System. The CA is also expected to play a strong role in protecting project
interests during government transitions. A third risk is the potential
resistance that school principals and teachers may pose to project objectives
and means, as they have not been involved in project design and preparation.
This risk will be mitigated through the execution of a sound Information,
Education and Communication program (IEC) at the outset of project
implementation. The purpose of this IEC program is to foster greater
awareness and acceptance of ongoing policy and management initiatives by
al interested parties, especially school principals, teachers, and parents.
21. Finally, there is the risk that the agreed federal-state partnership for
textbook financing and procurement will not work as planned. This risk will
be mitigated by making use of loan conditionality that requires the State to
assume responsibility for ensuring that every public elementary school
student in Minas Gerais has a basic set of textbooks in hand at the beginning
of each school year, regardless of the nature of support from the federal
government. To this end, SEE/MG has included in the overall project
implementation plan (PIP), an operational schedule, endorsed by MEC, for
implementing the project's textbook provision component within the
parameters of the current federal-state partnership. Also in the PIP is a
backup strategy for textbook financing and procurement, should MEC fail to
deliver textbooks of acceptable quality on time and in sufficient quantities.
The project midterm review will also provide an opportunity for re-
assessment of implementation risks and adjustments, if necessary.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
