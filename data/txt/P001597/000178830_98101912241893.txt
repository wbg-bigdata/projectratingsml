APPRAISAL OF SECOND POWER PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.          This report appraises a Project which consists of Stage II of the
Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi's (ESCOM) Tedzani Falls hydroelectric
development and a 12-MW gas turbine generating unit to be installed at Blantyre.
The estimated cost of the Project is US$14.3 million, excluding interest dur-
i.ng construction, and the Government of Malawi has requested the assistance
of the Association and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) ifn fi-
nancing thLe foreign exchange costs and part of the local costs. An IDA Credit
of US$7.5 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of the hydro station
and a tariff study, and a CDC loan to finance the foreign exchange cost of
the gas turbine and engineering and administration plus 50% of local costs
are proposed. The Credit would be IDA's second to the power sector in Malawi.
ii.         The first Credit (178-MAI) financed the offshore cost of Stage I
of the Tedzani Falls hydroelectric development and a 3-M4W diesel generating
unit.  This project had substantial cost overruns, due in the first place to
an excess cf about MK 1 million over the original estimates when the main
civil contract was placed and, later, to additional work caused by faults
in the rock formation which were revealed during the course of construction
of the head race conduit, the desilting chamber and the power station. The
overruns were financed by CDC and INDEBANK (Industrial Development Bank of
Malawi) loans aggregating MK 1.6 million. The project went into commercial
operation in May 1973 approximately four months behind the target completion
date.
iii.        The Project consists of a hydroelectric power station containing
two 10-MW generating sets as an extension to an existing hydroelectric power
station and the construction of a barrage to increase the output of the exist-
ing 16-MW power station by a further 4-MW. It also includes associated trans-
mission equipment and a 12-MW gas turbine which is required to overcome power
shortages in the immediate future and for peaking and standby purposes.
iv.         The Project is essential to meet the growth in demand and is the
least cost method of doing so. It has been compared with an alternative gas
turbine installation whtich wold be located at Blantyre.  The analysis gave
an equalizing discount rate of abot t 2X. and a sensitivity analysis showed
that an increase of 10% in the capita. costs of the Project combined with
a 10% lower rate of load growth than that forecast reduced the equalizing
discount rate to little over 8%. The probability of this happening is es-
timated at less than 10%. Compared with the alternative the hydro project
will mean a larger use of unskilled labor in a situation where unemployment
is widespread and a saving of foreign exchange. The rate of return on the
investment is about 15%.



- ii -
v.          Demand for electrical energy in Malawi has been growing at an aver-
age rate of about 14% per annum and this rate of growth is expected to con-
tinue for 1973, gradually falling to 10% per annum by 1977. Additional ca-
pacity will be required by 1975, when the gas turbine would be commissioned.
vi.         Procurement, for contracts to be financed from the proposed Credit,
would be by international competitive bidding. CDC has advised tnlat pro-
curement of the 12-MW gas turbine could also be by international competitive
bidding.
vii.        Effectiveness of the CDC loan will be contingent upon effective-
ness of the IDA Credit.
viii.       The Project is not likely to cause any ecological problems but a
reconnaissance study would examine the possibility of ecological change
arising from the Project and determine the actions which should be taken to
mitigate undesirable effects.
ix.         A recently completed UNDP study indicates that likely abstraction
of water for irrigation from the Middle and Upper Shire River would have no
detrimental effect on the Project, but it would eventually reduce the power
potential of the river unless action is taken to increase the minimum flow
by increasing the storage in Lake Malawi.
x.          ESCOM is well managed although the quality of its senior and
managerial staff has been adversely affected by high turnover. It has a
well thought out training program and it, perhaps optimistically, hopes
to replace all existing expatriate staff with Malawi nationals by 1980.
xi.         ESCOM's earnings over the last few years have grown substantially
and the rate of return on net fixed assets in service has increased from 10%
in 1969 to 14% in 1972. ESCOM is expected to substantially increase its
capital assets in the future and, to maintain a sound cash position and
capital structure, its financial objectives will include a minimum rate of
return of 10% and a 25% contribution from internal cash generation towards
its capital expenditures between 1973 and 1977.  To achieve these objectives
an increase in the average tariff of about 9% may be required in 1975. A
tariff study to determine any required changes in both the level and struc-
ture of tariffs is to be carried out.
xii.        It has been agreed that the Government will onlend the proceeds
of the proposed Credit at 7-1/2% interest over a term of 24 years with a
grace period of 4 years. It has been confirmed that the proposed CDC loan
would also be at 7-1/2% interest rate over a period of 23 years with a 3-1/2
year grace period.
xiii. The Project would be suitable for an IDA Credit of US$7.5 million.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND POWER PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01        This report appraises the Electricity Supply Commission of Maalawi's
(ESCOM) Tedzani Stage II hydroelectric power development (24-MW), and a 12-MW
gas turbine generating unit to be installed at Blantyre. The estimated cost
of the Project is MK11.7 million (US$14.3 million), excluding interest during
construction with a foreign currency component of MK8.2 million (US$.O.C mi $
lion). The Government of Malawi has asked the International Development As-
sociation (IDA) and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) to fin-
ance the foreign exchange and, in view of ESCOM's tight financial position,
it has also asked CDC to finarnce 50% of the local costs.
1.02        This will be the second credit for power to the Government of Malawi,
Credit 178-HAI having been made in 1970 for US$5.25 million to finance the
foreign exchange component of Tedzani Stage I hydroelectric development (16-MW)
together with a 3-MW diesel generating unit. The Project also included the
related 66-kV transmission system and some distribution extensions and im-
provements, the foreign components of which were financed by a loan of US$3
million equivalent from the African Development Bank (ADB).
1.03         Construction of the project has proceeded satisfactorily although
there have been serious cost overruns. An initial increase in the cost of
civil works was due to bids containing a much larger sum for establishment
costs than allowed by the consultants who had based their estimates on actual
costs for the Nkula hydro project completed some two years earlier,  Costs
later escalated still further because of unexpectedly bad rock conditions
along the route of the headrace conduit, the silt chamber and the power
station excavation, which suggests inadequate pre-project sub-surface explora-
tion. CDC subsequently made a loan of MK 1.0 million to cover the initial
cost overrun and a further loan of MK 0.6 million has been made jointly
by CDC and INDEBANK (Industrial Development Bank of Malawi) to cover the
later cost overrun to complete the work. The project has now been completed
and the hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 16 MW went into
commercial operation in May, 1973, some four months behind schedule.
Background
1 .04       There are a number of potential hydro sites on the Middle Shire
River and the first stage of one of these sites (Nkula Falls) was developed
in 1966 with the construction of a 24-MW power station. CDC assisted in fi-
nancing this project.



2-
1.05        The Government of Malawi commissioned Messrs. Kennedy and Donkirn
and Messrs. Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlmann, both of the United Kingdom,
in late 1966 to prepare a ranking report to determine if it would be more
economic to further develop the Nkula Falls site or to develop one of the
other hydro sites. This study recommended the development of the hydro-
electric potential at Tedzani.
1.06        The Stage I project was appraised in May 1968 but construction of
the project was postponed pending a clearer picture of the general economic
and financial situation of Malawi. The project was reappraised in August
1969 and the US$5.25 million IDA Credit (see paragraph 1.02) was made in
February 1970. Because of the delay, it was necessary to include provision
in the project for a 3-MW diesel generating unit to avoid a power shortage
before completion of the Tedzani Stage I hydroelectric development.
1.07        The Government of Malawi commissioned the same consultants early
in 1972 to carry out a further study of the hydro potential of the Middle
Shire River and this was followed by a further instruction in August 1972
to carry out another ranking study to determine the next hydroelectric de-
velopment to follow Tedzani Stage I. Their report concluded that Stage II
of the Tedzani hydroelectric project is the next logical development, and
that 10-MW generating units are the correct size for this development. it
concluded that a 12-MW gas turbine unit would be required by 1975 to meet
the projected power demand before the Tedzani Stage II could be commissioned
(early 1977).
1.08        This report is based on the findings of an appraisal by Messrs.
A.E. Bailey, E. Bolte and E. Greenwood who visited Malawi in February 1973
and on information provided by ESCOM, Messrs. Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and
Uhlmanan and Kennedy and Donkin, ESCOM's consultants for the Project.
2. GENERAL ECONOMY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01        Malawi is a land-locked country in south eastern Africa, border%d
by Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique.  About one quarter of the ccuntry is
cover(ed by lakes, the largest being Lake Malawi with an area of some 11,500
sq mi. Total land area is about 36,000 sq mi., which consists largely of
plateau about 4,800 ft above sea level; the mountainous north rises to 8,000
ft and the extreme south is only 600 ft above sea level.  With a population
of about 4.7 million growing at about 2.6% per year, Malawi is one or the
most dlensely populated countries in Africa. The population is concentrated
in the Southern Region, with 169 persons per sq mi. in 1966, compared with
109 and 49 in the Central and Northern Regions.



- 3-
2.02        Since independence in 1964, GDP at constant prices has grown at a
comparatively high rate of 6% per year; the GDP per capita of US$90 is, how-
ever, still one of the lowest in the world. The manufacturing sector has
grown to 13% of GDP from 8% in 1964, while the share of agriculture has de-
clined from 58% to about 52%. The agricultural sector still produces a live-
lihood for about 90% of the population and it supplies more than 90% of the
exports (mainly tobacco, tea, and groundnuts).  High growth of investments
and domestic savings (25% and 14% per year), played an important role in the
favorablet development of Malawis economy. On the basis of past performance
and present potential, an accelerated growth of the economy of about 7% per
year might be possible, with the manufacturing and service sectors, including
electricity, growing at a higher rate than the economy as a whole.
Energy Resources
2.03        The only known fossil fuels in Malawi suitable for thermal genera-
tion are coal deposits in a remote area of the Northern Region. The develop-
ment of these deposits is, at present, uneconomic due to their distance from
the main centers of population and rain head. Good quality coal is imported
free of du,t, from the Wankie coal field in Rhodesia at a cost delivered of
about US$G054I per million Btu.  Fuel oil is not imported in bulk because
there is little demand for it; diesel fuel in Blantyre now costs about US$1.48
per million Btu.
2.04        Geothermal power potential exists in the north of the country but
extensive investigations have still to be carried out before a real apprecia-
tion of the potential can be obtained. There is also the possibility of im-
ported power from the Cabora Bassa development in Mozambique but this is un-
likely to be economically feasible for some years due to the distance and
the small demand in Malawi.
2.05        There is some hydroelectric potential in the north of the country
which has yet to be investigated, but the principal large potential source
of power in Malawi is the Shire River which flows out of Lake Malawi through
the southern part of the country to join the Zambezi in Mozambique (see map).
Lake MalaLwi is a large natural reservoir and the Shire River, which carries
the overf low from the Southern end of the lake, falls about 1 ,260 ft in a
Iistance of 50 miles between Kholombidzo Falls and Kapachira Falls. The
total power potential in this stretch of river has been estimated at 415 MW
with a productive capacity of some 3,600 GWh at 100% load factor.
The Power Sector
2.06        ESCOM is responsible for public electricity supplies.  The market
for power increased at an average annual rate of 15% during the period 1967-
1972, compared with an average rate of 25% per annum during the previous
three year period. Statistics for 1967 and 1972 together with the forecast
position for 1975 and 1980 are summarized below; details are given in Annexes
1 through 3. Annual growth of sales ranged from a high of 21% in 1968 to a
low of 8% in 1971, increasing to 20% in 1972; for 1969 through 1972 it
averaged 14% annually.

2.07        Industry, which takes more than 60% of ESCOM's output, expanded
rapidly until 1968, after which growth settled down to an annual rate of
about 15%. Industrial load can be expected to continue to expand more
rapidly than the other categories of load and a 14% rate of growth is fore-
cast through 1973, falling gradually to 10% by 1977.
2.08        Electricity consumption in the Commercial sector increased during
the past six years at a rate of 14% per year. This high rate is not expected
to continue in the future and a drop in demand growth to roughly 9% has been
proj,ected.
2.09        Low Density Residential consumers, who are mainly higher ranking
government officials and Europeans living in Blantyre, Zomba and Lilongwe will
continue to have a lower growth rate of demand than the average. Their part
in total consumption should drop further from 17% in 1972 to 15% in 1975 and
1980.
2.10      High Density Residential consumers, who live in low rent houses,
supplied to them by the government in the larger towns of Malawi, had
the highest annual rate of growth in demand of all consumer groups between
1967 and 1972, ranging between 35% in 1971 and 48% in 1970. In spite of this
high rate of growth, High Density Residential consumers still comprise only
2% of total consumption and about 4% of the non-industrial electricity sales,
while they represent about 40% of all electricity consumers. Depending on
the program of the government to supply cheap housing to low income groups,
the number of High Density Residential consumers is expected to continue its
steep rise. On the other hand, this group has a low consumption level per
connection and it is anticipated, therefore, that the annual growth of sales
to the High Density Residential consumer group will gradually drop to about
10% by 1977.



2.11        Generating plant operated under private license aggregates some
4,500 kW, of which some 1,600 kW is operated as standby to ESCOM's supply.
The remaining 2,900 kW consists of units, mainly between 25 kW and 150 kW
capacity, located at isolated tea estates.
Existing zacilities of ESCOM
2.12        ESCOM's principal generating facilities are located in the South-
ern Region, which accounts for about 90% of the kWh sold. A small, self-
contained undertaking, comprising some 700 kW of diesel plant, is operated
at Mzuzu in the Northern Region.  Generating plant operated in the south
by ESCOM (shown in detail in Annex 4) consists of:
Interconnected System
Hydro                              40.6 MW
Steam                               7.0 MW
Diesel                              8.3 MW
Total                         55.9 MW
2.13        The Tedzani Stage I hydroelectric installation (16-W) which went
i-nto commercial operation in Mfay of this year, is included in the above total.
This power station, together with the 24-MW Nkula Falls hydroelectric power
station, are the largest installations. A 66-kV transmission line inter-
connects these power stations with Blantyre and a 66-kV line has now been
extended to Lilongwe, the new capital, in the Central Region (see Map). The
66-kV system has also been extended to supply the irrigation and factory
load of ESCOM's largest consumer, the Sugar Corporation of Malawi (SUCOMA).
2.14        Zomba and the tea growing areas in the south are supplied at 33 kV.
Distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V. The supply is reliable and
losses, in the neighborhood of 9%, are low.
Future Development
2.15        ESCOM has prepared a 10-year capital development program for the
period 1973 through 1982 for the expansion of its generation, transmission
and distribution facilities. The program provides for total expenditures
during this period of some MK50 million, the major part of which will be
spent on the generation development program (including the Project) and
associated transmission.
2.16        ESCOM's generation development program provides, in addition to the
Project, a further 12-MW standby gas turbine generating unit by 1979/80 to
replace 12-MW of steam and diesel plant due for retirement by that time. The
latter comprises all the thermal plant presently connected to the interconnected
system, iwith the exception of the recently installed 3-MW diesel unit which
will remain at Lilongwe for standby purposes.



- 6 -
2.17        The program provides for the construction of a ' 32-kV transmission
liine from Nkula to Lilongwe to meet the anticipated growth of demand in that
area, and the next hydroelectric power station, assumed to be Nkula Stage II,
for commissioning by 1981/82. Provision is also included for a small hydro-
electric power station and associated transmission to be installed at Nazam7ba
in the Northern Region to provide power for a proposed pulp industry.
2.118       The distribution development in the 10-year capital developaent
program provides for expenditures of about MK2.8 million on extending the
33-kV system to new areas and streng1thening supplies to existing areas to
meet the increasing demand. Additionally, provision is included for expend-
itures of about MKO.4 million annually on routine development of ESCOM's
lower voltage networks.
3. THE PROJECT
Description
3,0i        The Project comprises part of ESCOM s generation development
program for the 5-year period FY 1973 through FY 1977, It consists of:
(a)  the construction of a barrage over the submerged weir
constructed in Tedzani Stage I, thereby increasing the
output of Stage I from 16 MW to 20 MW;
(b) the construction of a 20-MW hydroelectric power station
as an extension of the existing Stage I power station;
(c)  the addition of a 12-MW gas turbine unit, initially to
avoid a power shortage in 1975176 and subsequently for
operation as a standby and peaking unit; and
(d) a tariff study.
3.02         Items (a) and (b) above are described in detail in Annex 5.
3.03      A major factor influencing the need for the 12-MW gas turbine
is an increase in the demand (from 6.7 MW in 1973 to 12.2 MW in 1975)
forecast by SUCOMA.  The reliability of tnis forecast demand and the practic-
ability of securing revenues to cover the annual charges on the plant by amending
SUCOA's present supply agreement, with provision for minimum annual revenues
throughout the life of the agreement, based on SUCOMA's forecast demands, were
discussed with ESCOM and the Government during negotiations. ESCOM explained
that the forecast 5-year agreement was signed as recently as September 1972
and to ask for an amendment of the nature described would involve a reciprocal
concession on the part of ESCOM. Since both ESCOM and the Government, following



-7-
recent discussion with SUCOMA, are convinced that its forecasts will be
substantially achieved, such an amendment, far from securing ESCOM's revenues,
could well result in a loss of revenue. The Association accepted the assurances
of ESCOM and the Government in this matter.
Estimated Cost
3.04         The estimated cost of the Project is MK11.7 million (US$14.3
million), with a foreign currency component of MK8.2 million (US$10 million),
excluding duties and interest during construction. For the construction of
Tedzani Stage 1, Government waived duties for all imported goods and services
It was confirmed at negotiations that Government will in like manner waive
all duties relating to goods and services financed by the proposed IDA
Credit: and CDC loan. The estimated costs of the Project's principal features
are shown in the following table, and in more detail in Annex 6.

Procurement
3.10         Procurement will be on the basis of international competitive bidding
for all equipment and works which are to be financed in whole or in part from
the IDA Credit. The foreign exchange requirements of the remaining project
works plus 50% of the local costs of the Project would be met from the proposed
CDC loan. CDC advised, during preliminary discussions, that it would have no
problem with international competitive bidding in the procurement of the 12-MW
gas turbine. This was confirmed during negotiations.
3.11         The Statutory Bodies (Control of Contracts) Act Cap 18.07 authorizes
the Minister of Trade and Industry to give directions to ESCOM with regard to
parties to, and terms of contracts for procuring materials and services. In
order to avoid possible conflict over the use of IDA funds, it was pointed
out during negotiations that the Credit Agreement requires that Government
will not take any action or issue any directions to ESCOM that would conflict
with ESCOM's obligations in respect of the Associations Guidelines on Procure-
ment.
Disbursements
3.12         CDC has intimated to the Association that disbursements from its
loan will not be permitted until the IDA Credit becomes effective. No work
on the Project has commenced other thian engineering design, and no purchases
have been made. Engineering costs are estimated to amount to about US$250,000
equivalent by September 30, 1973, and CDC has intimated it will meet these
retroactive costs from its loan.
3.13         Disbursement of the proposed Credit would be made for the actual
foreign exchange cost of the equipment, materials and services procured under
the Credit and for the foreign exchange component of the erection costs as
specified in the contracts. Any unused balance of the Credit on completion of
the Project should be cancelled. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 8.
Ecological Aspects
3.14         Experiences on Tedzani Stage I and Nkula, 4.5 miles upstream of
Tedzani, indicates that the Project should not cause major ecological problems.
There are no permanent human habitations and no crops which are likely to be
inundated when the barrage is commissioned. Notwithstanding, this is a matter
which merits further examination and assurances were obtained during negotiations
that ESCOM will arrange a reconnaissance study satisfactory to the Association
to examine the possible ecological changes arising from the Project and the
steps which should be taken to avoid or mitigate undesirable side effects.
ESCOM also agreed to review the conclusions of the study and appropriate
remedial measures with the Association.
Irrigation Aspects
3.15         There is a large reserve of hydroelectric potential on the Shire
River which, because of the natural storage provided by Lake Malawi and the



- 10 -
relatively high cost of fossil fuels, is likely to be competitive with all
forms of thermal power. However, above the river's middle reaches, where
this potential lies, there are competing claims on the lake waters for
irrigation and other purposes. Minimtm river discharge at the Liwonde Barrage
is 6,000 cusecs and to determine the extent to which this will be affected in
the future because of abstraction of water for irrigation and other require-
ments the Government agreed, during negotiations for Credit 178-MAI, to have
a study carried out to determine the potential usage of the water resources of
Lake Malawi and the Upper Shire River, and to recommend allocations between
irrigation, power production, and other requirements.
3.16         This study has been carried out by the UNDP and the Draft Finz!
Report, a copy of which has been received by IDA, indicates thaat foreseeable
phased abstraction of water from the Middle and Upper Shire Rivers to the vear
2000 for agriculture, irrigation and other non-hydro uses would reduce the
flow by a maximum of 800 cusecs. The Lake is presently reguiated to provide
a minimum continuous flow of 6,000 cusecs and since planned development of the
hydro potential of the Middle Shire is based on this minimum continuous flow,2
it wotl-d seem that abstraction of water on the scale envisaged could eveantually
reduce the power potential of the river unless action is taken to increase
the minimum flow by increasing the storage in Lake Malawi. However, since the
total diversion for power generation when the Project is completed will still
be well below the present minimum continuous flow of 6,000 cusecs there will be
no int:erference with present or future foreseeable abstraction of water from
Lake Nalawi and the Middle and Upper Shire for agriculture, irrigation and
other purposes and the Project, as such, represents a balanced development of
the river system.
3.17         The Government has already agreed to the diversion of water, up
to 2,100 cusecs, from the Shire River, or such larger quantity as is required
from time to time for the purpose of power generation at Nkula and Tedzani
Falls (Section 4.06 of 178 MAI Development Credit Agreement). However, the
total diversion at full load when Tedzani Stage II is commissioned will be
4,400 cusecs and to ensure the position is quite clear on the amount of water
which can be diverted for power, the Government agreed during negotiations
that ESCOM will be authorized to divert water from the Shire River, for a
period of 50 years commencing from January 1, 1977 in such amounts as may be
necessary (but in any case not less than 4,400 cusecs) for the purpose of
power generation at Nkula and Tedzani Falls.
4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Compari.son of Alternatives
4.01         The proposed Project, which was shown by ESCOM's consultants to
be the least cost alternative of the several hydro sites examined in their
ranking study, represents the most economic way of satisfying the growing



- .11 -
demand for power during the late 1970's. Several other alternatives were
examined, including imported power from Cabora Bassa in Mozambique, a gas
turbine installation and a conventional steam power station. This examina-
tion showed that the next best non-hydro alternative to the Project is a gas
turbine installation comprising three 12-MW industrial gas turbines (the
Project is the best hydro solution, see paragraph 1.07). Comparison of
the Project with the different alternatives based on discounted cash flows
are described in detail in Annex 9.
4.02         The three 12-MW gas turbine installation would be located in a new
power station adjacent to the existing power station at Blantyre and the com-
parison of the Project with this alternative shows an equalizing discount rate
of 21%. This result is sensitive to changes in some important variables,
(capital cost of Second Power Project and load growth). tHowever, it does not
change the result, that the Project is more economic than its best alterna-
tive. An increase of 10% in the capital cost of the Project reduces the
equalizing discount rate to 16%, and if a 10% lower rate of load growth is
assumed the equalizing discount rate is reduced to just over 12%. Taking
the pessimistic view and assuming a 10% increase in the capital cost of the
Project and a 10% lower load growth than that forecast (a reduction in the
price of fuel is highly improbable), the equalizing discount rate is reduced
to just over 8%. This is below the opportunity cost of capital in Malawi
which ranges between 10% and 13%. However, it is estimated that the prob-
ability of a 10% variation in both cost and load growth estimates is less
than 101%. Bearing this in mind, together with the higher amount of unskilled
labor employed in the construction of a hydro plant and the savings of foreign
exchange involved, which could add a percentage point or two to the equalizing
discount rate, it does not alter the conclusion that the Project is the least
cost method of meeting ESCOM's expanding demand during the late 1970's.
Rate of Return on the Investment
4.03         The rate of return on the investment is defined as the discount
rate at which the present worth of the estimated capital and operating costs
of the Project over its life equals the present worth of the attributable
benefits. If these benefits are measured by the Project related incremental
revenues, the rate of return on the investment lies within the range of 12% -
18% with a likely rate, based on the best estimate, of about 15%. However, the
incremental revenue understates the benefits consumers receive from the proj-
ect. A tariff increase of about 9%, which is proposed for implementation in
1975, has been excluded from the calculation of the rate of return on the
investment, but it is not expected that this increase in tariffs will reduce
the projected demand. The assumptions underlying the above calculations are
described in Annex 10.
Gas Turbine
4.04         A similar exercise to determine the return on the gas turbine
alone showed a negative result due to the fact that under the present tariff
structure prices charged for peak units do not adequately reflect the costs



- 12 -
to produce them. However the cost of this unit is justified on ether grounds.
On the basis of the load forecast, the demand will exceed the firm plant
capacity by 1975, i.e. two years before Tedzani Stage II is commissioned, and
without the gas turbine, load shedding would result with consequent heavy
loss to the economy for about two years. Annex 10 shows that the estimated
benefits of installing the plant exceed its estimated costs.
4.05         ESCOM also considered a 6-MW diesel unit for operation in conjunctlion
with existing diesel plant. The 6-MW diesel unit would be cheaper in capital
and maintenance costs but the gas turbine would be cheaper per kW installed.
ESCOM chose the 12-MW gas turbine generating unit because it would fit better
into its future generating program, and because it would be more likely to be
available in 1975 when required. An economic comparison of both alternatives
was marginally in favor of the gas turbine at all discount rates up to 13%
and, bearing in mind the other considerations, it is reasonable to accept
ESCOM's decision in this matter.
5.    BENEFICIARY - ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
LegLation
5.01         ESCOM was established by Electricity Act Cap. 73.01 4n 1963.  It
took over the staff, assets and liabilities of its predecessor, the Nyasaland
Electr-icity Supply Commission.
5.02         The Board consists of a part-time chairman and five part-time mem-
bers, all of whom are appointed by the Minister to whom ESCOM is attached
(presently the Minister of Trade and Industry). Appointments are for an in--
definite period, but the Minister may terminate them at any time.  The present
chairmnan is a leading businessman, one of the members is a representative of
the Ccommonwealth Development Corporation, another is a representative of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry, and the remaining three members are local
businessmen.
5.03         Although ESCOM is a "body corporate" and in many respects has the
appearance of an autonomous agency, it is dependent on the Minister's approval
for much of its activities and is subject to the Minister's decisions. The
most important limitations arise from the following provisions iti the Electri-
city Act.
1.   The Commission has, at all times, to comply with the
general directions of the Minister without limitation.
2.   Any person failing to carry out any order or decision
of the Minister made under the provision of the Act is
guilty of an offence and is liable to a penalty of
MK1,000 and/or two years in jail.



- 13 -
3.   The Minister has the power at any time and for any
reason to terminate the appointment of any member
of the Commission.
5.04         Working relations between the Minister and ESCOM are good and
although the large measure of Government control and the low level of its
representation on the Board have led to difficulties and delays, no serious
problems have arisen in this connection during the construction period of
Credit 178-MAI. However, in order to safeguard the continuity of efficient
operations, assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations,
as in the case of Credit 178-MAI, that Government would exercise its powers
under the Act, or any other legislation relating to the operations of ESCOM,
only to the extent necessary to ensure the continued operation and develop-
ment of ESCOM on appropriate commercial lines.
Organization and Management
5.05         ESCOM is, generally speaking, well managed and its operations
are in accordance with sound public utility practice. However, there has been
a fairly rapid turnover in senior expatriate staff during the last two to
three years and the quality of management is not of the high standard which
was evident at the time of the 1969 appraisal of Tedzani Stage I. The problem
is principally the salary grades which are not sufficiently high to attract
staff of the same quality as those who have been leaving. The Government has
been alerted to the problem and a review of ESCOM's salary grades was taking
place at the time of the mission's visit. Increasing salaries would slow
down the drift and should attract a higher caliber of staff in the future
to replac,e those who are leaving.
5.06         All senior management and most professional staff are expatriates
with wide experience in public utilities, and ESCOM's General Manager states
that Government has no intention of replacing them until such time as qualified
Malawi staff are available. In this connection, ESCOM anticipates that with
the present extensive training program (see paragraph 5.09) all expatriate
staff will be replaced with Malawi staff by 1980. This target might prove
optimistic in the case of specialist senior and management staff, such as
the General Manager and the Chief Electrical and Generation Engineers. The
present expatriate General Manager appears to be a competent administrator.
5.07         The staff of ESCOM at the end of February 1973 numbered 1,054,
of whom 75 were senior or professional staff and of whom 45 were expatriates.
The number of connected consumers was about 11,700 and consumers per employee
about 11. This seems to be an unduly high staff level, even bearing in mind
the diversification of generating units, the amount of construction carried
out by the Commission's staff and the distances involved. This matter was



- 14 -
2-ls.sed with the General Manager who explained that, to alleviate the un-
e.oym.ent problem in Malawi, the Government's policy is that all construction
an>d c1neration works should be as labor intensive as possible. He agreed that
ESCOM carries a disproportionately high level of staff but this is in confor-
,anze wjith Government policy.  Some 400 of these are temporary labor, the
-u*e of which can in theory float up and down as the construction program
'.ayes aad wanes, but in practice the number employed seems to hold steadv at
this level.  The desirability of maintaining staff at the present levei,
_c -`xing additional generation staff to operate the Project, despite the
--nand'na system demand, was discussed during negotiations.  ESCOM explained
--le dvifficulties in meeting this goal such as government policies on employ-
j .igck of contractors in Malawi, etc.  However, they agreed that they
k *>eep the point in mind and, as far as possible, would endeavor to meet
th.S 03jective.
i-;5S        The present management and staff are experienced and competent to
o eaate the Commission efficiently. They are also competent to carry out the
ProJect with the assistance of consultants and to carry out the other construc-
'   paDrkS covered by ESCOMt's capital development program.  It is important
tc ensLre that ESCOM remains under sound management at all times and is capable
o- Carrying out the Project and managing the Commission efficiently.  These
._-.er were discussed during negotiations and assurances were obtained that
ES13  -'7ill notify IDA about any proposed changes in the appointments of General
xaLnagezr Chief Engineer, Secretary and Chief Accountant and will make changes
-i?ntn.iee appointments only after consideration of the views expressed by IDA.
As mentioned in paragraph 5.06, ESCOM envisages filling all posts
.`-h  allawi nationals by 1980.  To achieve this it has recruited a full-time
:raining officer who has been given head of department status and has embarked
upon an extensive training program in conjunction with the Malawi Polytechnical
TnsLitute, At present six Malawi nationals have qualified; five electrical
ani ;ne mechanical engineer.  Three of these have completed their post
g~racza te training and are filling professional appointments with ESCOM,  Two
e*. Aeer students are currently overseas at University, and five prospective
3,aliCents are going through ESCOM's training course whilst awaiting university
e-"tr~a-e. The annual intake target has been set at five per annum for two
yaers, then three for one year and two per annum thereafter.
Technicians are obtained from the Polytechnic or by direct recruit-
me-. from secondary schools. In the latter case they are sent to the Poly-
technic for one year and then, in company with direct recruits from the
rolytechnic, sent overseas for four to five years technical training with
-l lfacturers.  There are usually five under training at any one time and
E`C,M hopes to raise the intake to eight per annum by 1974.
: ;-       Malawi nationals in training as craftsmen are recruited from the
Nat4cnal Apprenticeship Scheme, sent to the Polytechnic for one year, then
-aken on by employers, including ESCOM, for three year apprenticeship training.
"here are no problems in obtaining this type of employee.

5.12         There are also no problems in the recruitment and training of
accountants. One qualified accountant has been engaged as a Branch Account-
ant, one is presently studying overseas, and two more, one with a degree in
economics, have been recruited for overseas training. This covers the four
posts presently available.
5.13         In addition to the foregoing program, ESCOM also operates a flexible
program of classroom training. There are several fixed classes each week
with Polytechnic teachers and three or four casual classes each week for
refresher lessons and to deal with problems as they arise.
5.14         The training program as described above and the availability of
finance for its implementation was discussed during negotiations. ESCOM
presently finances the training program from revenue and anticipates no
difficulty in maintaining the program at its planned level.
6. FINANCIAL
6.01         ESCOM's operating performance since Credit 178-MAI was made in 1970
has been satisfactory, although both its capital structure and cash position
at the end of 1972 need to be strengthened. It is expected that with the
growth in the volume of electricity sales and a proposed tariff increase in
1975 (see paragraphs 6.05 through 6.08), ESCOM's financial position and
capita:L structure will be strengthened by the end of the construction period,
and that it will be able to contribute a reasonable proportion of the funds
required for capital expenditures. ESCOM's actual and projected financial
statements, consisting of income statements, cash flow projections and bal-
ance sheets, are given in Annexes 11, 12 and 13 respectively. The notes and
assumptions for the financial statements are in Annex 14 and a statement of
loans outstanding at December 31, 1972 is presented in Annex 15.
Financial Position and Past Earnings
6.02         The following summary of ESCOM's operating performance from 1969 to
1972 shows a satisfactory growth in revenues, net income and rate of return
on net fixed assets.

Between 1969 and 1972, ESCOM financed about 25% of its capital expenditures
from internal cash generation.
'The following is ESCObl's summarized balance sheet at December 31,
1`:72,  At this date, debt formed too high a proportion of ESCOM's capitaliza-
t.cn (dabt/equity ratio is 81/19).

6.04          Fixed assets are valued at historical cost, less depreciation.
Capital expenditures in. recent years have been substantial and by 1980, with
the planned increases in the level of capital expenditures during the period
1973-1980, expenditures over the previous nine years will equal nearly 75%
of fixed assets.  Miost of the current liabilities at December 31, 1972 con-
sist of obligations to contractors for capital works and tnese will be met
largely from subsequent borrowings.
Tariffs
6.05          ESCOM's tariffs were increased by 10% in 1968 and a development
surcharge of 3% was Ievied in the Southern Region, excluding high density
areas, since February 1970 to provide sufficient cash to meet the local cur-
rency requirements for the Tedzani Stage I development program. The average
tariff levels need to be increased further to provide an adequate contribution
from internal sources towiards ESCOM's capital expenditure program, both dur-
ing the project implsementation period 1973-1978 and in subsequent years.
Expenditures on the Nkula Falls power station, which are expected to commence
in 1976, will be especially heavy in 1979 and 1980.  In the financial pro-
jectionls, an increase in the average tariff of 9% from FY 1975 has been
assumed, which would perimit ESCOM to meet about 25% of its capital expendi-
tures for 1973-1980 from internal cash generation.
6.06          Credit 178-MAI contains a covenant requiring ESCOM to maintain a
9% rate of return on its average net fixed assets from January 1, 1974,  Over
t,he last few years, the actual rate of return has increased to a level well
in excess of this floor (para. 6.02), The projected rate of return for



- 17 -
FY 1974 based on current tariff levels is 10.4%.  During negotiations assurances
were obtained that, considering the need for ESCOM to finance a reasonable pro-
portion oJE its capital expenditures and to strengthen -Its financial position
by increasing the proportion of long term capital provided from equity, the
required minimum rate of return on average net fixed assets will be increased
from 9% to 10%. Assurances were also obtained that in order that cash resources
are maintained at an adequate level during the project implementation period3,
ESCOM will contribute from internal cash generation not less than 25% bf its
capital development program during this period.
6.07         Before a tariff increase is introduced, it wou:Ld be -prudent for
ESCOM to have its basic tariff structure examined. The cost structure of the
system and the proportion of kWh sales to the different consumer groups have
changed ovrer the last few years. The rate base will more than double over the
next seven years and the proportion of hydro plant to thermal is steadily in-
creasing. The position, which is described in more detail in Annex 16, clear-
ly indicates that the structure of ESCOM's tariffs now require careful investi-
gation. Any changes implemented as a result of such an investigation should
be implemented at the same time as the proposed tariff increase, when the
present 3% development surcharge can also be absorbed.
6.08         ESCOM does not have the expertise to carry out such a study and
provision has been included in the Project cost estimates to cover the cost
of a consulltant for this purpose. Both this matter and the proposed tariff
increase were discussed during negotiations and assurances were obtained from
the Government and ESCOM that:
(a)  a consultant satisfactory to the Association would
be engaged within 6 months of signing the Credit
Agreement, with terms of reference to be agreed
with the Association, to carry out an investigation
of and report on ESCOM's tariff structure; and
(b)  the conclusions of the study and changes in the tariff
proposed as a result would be discussed with the Govern-
ment and the Association, and the agreed changes would be
introduced at the time of the next tariff increase.
Proposed Financing Plan
6.09         The proposed financing plan during the project implementation ?earlod
1973-1977 is given below. The Second Power Project, which is est iLated to cost
MK 11.7 million (US$14.3 million), excluding interest during construction,
represents 45% of the 1973-1977 expenditures. The plan calls for ESCOMI to
finance 25% of capital expenditures and additions to working capital between
FY 1973 and FY 1977.

6.10         It was agreed during negotiations that the Government will relend
the proceeds of the IDA Credit for the Second Power Project to ESCOM at an
interest rate of 7-1/2% per annum over a term of 24 years, including a grace
period of about 4 years.
1/      The increase in working capital consists largely of cash
accumulations to be used to finance post 1977 caDital expansion.



- 19 -
6.11      Other borrowings for the Second Power Project are to come from CDC
at an interest rate of 7-1/2% per annum over a period of 23 years, including
a grace period of about 3-1/2 years. The CDC loan is expected to be approved
after the proposed IDA Credit and it was agreed during negotiations that
effectiveness of the IDA Credit will be conditional upon fulfillment of the
conditions precedent to the effectiveaess of the CDC loan. In the case of
the onlending of the IDA loan, interest during construction will be financed
by adding it to the principal amount of debt. Interest on the CDC loan will
be payable half yearly from the date of withdrawal. The terms of the proposed
CDC loan were confirmed subsequent to negotiations.
6,12         In addition to the project, during the financing period FY 1973-
1977, expenditures of MK 8.2 million (US$10 million) are estimated to be in-
curred on the Nkula-Lilongwe transmission line which is expected to be com-
pleted in FY 1979 at an estimated cost of M1K 8.6 million (US$10.5 million).
During the same period, expenditures are assumed to commence on the next hydro
development, which is expected to be completed in FY 1982 at an estimated
cost of MK 26 million (US$32 million).  Expenditures on both these projects
are expected to commence in FY 1976. Financing has yet to be arranged.
Future Operating Results and Financial Position
6,13         Income statements for FY 1974, 1977 and 1980 illustrating the
growth in revenues and income are given below.  Both the operating ratio and
financial rate of return are satisfactory.  The financial rate of return peaks
at 14.7% in FY 1976, after which it progressively declines to 10.4% in FY 1980
because of substantial increments to the rate base.

6.14         With the proposed tariff increase (paragraph 6.05), ESCOM's cash
resources should be adequate throughout the period covered, with the excep-
tion of FY 1973 when a short-term accomodation would be required to meet a
projected cash deficit of about MK 300,000. ESCOM already has overdraft

rranging thle extenslion of these facilitdes to MK 300Q000 if it should prove
to be required.  The debt l iitation covenant for Credit 178-MAI, under which
ESCOM is required not to 4incur long-term debt with less than 1.5 times debt
service coverage without the Association's consent, has beesn repeated in the
proposed Credit.
AccourLts and Audit
5.15          ESCOM's accoanting records are well maintained and financial reports
are prepared promptly.  Billing and collection performance are both good.  The
audit has been carried out by the international accounting firm of Deloitte
& Company and this arrangement is satisfactory.  The covenant under Credit
178-MA,I  urnder which ESCOM is to have its accounts audited annually by an
independent auditor or accounting firm acceptable to the Association, has
been r epeated for the proposed Credit.

7.03         During negotiations ESCOM agreed:
(a) that consultants satisfactory to the Association would continue
to be employed for the design and supervision of construction
of the Project (paragraph 3.08);
(b) to arrange for a study to be carried out to examine the measures
to mitigate the possible ecological effects of the Project (para-

7,04         During negotiations, the following event was agreed as a condition
of effectiveness:
(a) the execution and delivery of the CDC Loan Agreement and
fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of
said Agreement (paragraph 6.11).
7.05         On the basis of the foregoing, the project is suitable for a

SECOND POWER PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
Detailed Description of Tedzani Stage II
1.        That stretch of the Shire River between Kholombidzo and Kapachira
Falls, some 80 and 130 miles respectively below Lake Malawi, is known as t:he
Middle Shire.  Livonde Barrage, completed in 1965, lies approximately fifty
miles below the lake. In the 50 miles of the Middle Shire the river falls
some 1,260 feet in a series of falls and rapids and the total power potential
has been estimated at 415 MW. The first development, amounting to 24 :Hw at
Nkula Falls, is already_in operation and at Tedzani Falls, 4.5 miles down-
stream, a 16-MW scheme has recently been commissioned. The second stage of
development at Tedzani Falls, which will effectively increase the installed
capacity to 40 MW, constitutes the major part of the Project.
Hydrology and Geolojy
2.        The hydrology of Lake Malawi and the estimation of the outflow
from the lake into its single drain, the Shire River, has been thoroughly
investigated in the past and is the subject of a number of studies,  These
studies show that the lake can be regulated to provide a continuous flow of
6,000 cusecs with a one year in 80 chance of failure.  In addition to the lake
outflow there is significant seasonal augmentation of the Shire River flows
by the tributaries entering below the Liwonde Barrage.
3.        The Liwonde Barrage was completed in August 1965 to provide a means
of regulating the lake and after completion it was closed for a period of
about five months to facilitate construction of -ha Nkula Falls power station.
During this period detailed geological and topographical surveys of the other
potential hydroelectric sites on the river, including Tedzani, were carried
out.
4.        The principal geological feature affecting the first stage of the
Tedzani development was the poor condition of the rock between the intake
and tunnel entrance. For tne Stage II development it is proposed to avoid
this prievious constructional difficulty by adopting a tunnel alignment further
south aind at a greater depth. An, extensive drilling program has been carried
out in all relevant areas, and other zones of poor rock thus proven have been
avoided when detailing the Stage II designs.
5,        It is expected that the gneiss through which the underground works
will be driven, will be sound and water tight and tunnels should require the
minimum of support. A few narrow,heavily weathered zones, which will need
special treatment, may be encountereC over short sections of the tunnel, but
on the whole, excavation should se through sound rock.

z  z; ztwergad weir constructed in Stage I would be replaced with
eran7ant barrage gates thereby creating diurnal storage0  The barrage would
be a gated structure having five symetrical openings across the water way
and spanned be a bridge for ve"hicular traffic and maintenance access to the
gates and their. control eouipment.
7.        The intake for Stage 1fl has already been constructed together with
that for Stage :.  The tunne'l connecting the intake to the extended power
statioin tould follow a route to the south of the No0 I aqueduct and, in the
light of geological inform-ation revealed during the construction of Stage I,
tne second aqueduct would be built at greater deptn for most of its length
in the tunnel. The second stage inlet tunnel, whiich would be concrete lined
throughout, would be conrnected by drop shaft to a bifurcation from which point
steel lined penstocks would lead to the power station.  Provision would be
made for a surge chanter at the downstream end of the inlet tunnel, before
t;e junction with the two steel lined penstocks.  The surge chamber would
also be concrete lin-ed.
8.        The power house, which will lbe a reinforced concrete substructure
with the steel framed bullding above grourd level, would be extended in a
southerly or downstream direction beyond the existing loading bay, with a
short 'intervening section to span a zone of poor rock. The plant installa-
tion and power house general arrangement would be similar to the first stage,
the mac.ines having virtually the same basic dimensions.
9.        The turDines would be vertical snaft Francis mac hir,es operatIng
at 273 r.t.m. and designed to produce a rated output of 14,000  a...t-  .  at an
effecrtve head of approximately  22  ft0  Tet turbine diseharge for each
machine at full load would be about 1 050 cusecs with a turbine efficiency of
91%. The generators would be siimzlar to those provided for the two sets at
Stage I. They would be of the vertical shaft design of the two bearing type,
and with a thrust bearing mounuted;    the top bracket.  Each generator would
have a rat.ed output of 1.0 uW at 0.9 ?O er Factor.  Power would be conveyed
at generated voltage by cables to the swltchyard wnere it would be transformed
to tranusission voltage.

MALAWI
SECOND POWER PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
Comparison of Project with Thermal Alternative
1.        The economic assessment of power projects involves a cost analysis
of the electrical supply system under alternative expansion programs. The
consultants Ranking Study showed the Second Power Project to be the least cost
alternative of the several hydro sites which are available for development.
This was checked and verified and the Project as selected was then compared
with the following non-hydro alternatives:
(a) Imported Power - The alternative examined was the importa-
tion of power from Cabora Bassa (Mozambique) over 132-kV
transmission lines approximately 200 miles long. To ensure
continuity of supply, one single circuit line with gas tur-
bine back-up at Blantyre or two single circuit lines would
be required. It is pertinent to mention that, due to the
paucity of the Malawi demand and the proposed exploitation
by the 1980s of the bauxite deposits at Mount Mulange which
involves importing power at a higher voltage than 132 kV,
both Government and ESCOM consider it premature to consider
importing power at this time. For this reason and also be-
cause the Government wishes to first exploit fully the hydro
potential of the Shire River, the wish was expressed that no
discussions should be entered into at this time with Mozambique
concerning imported power. In the circumstances broad assump-
tions had to be made to facilitate a comparison with the Proj-
ect. It was assumed that the alternative would be two single
circuit 132-kV transmission lines at a cost of tS12.5 million
and the cost of imported power would be 0.26 tambala per kWh,
with line operating costs of NX120000 per annum. The compari-
son on the basis of these assumptions and based on a discounted
cash flow of costs showed an equalizing discount rate of 53%.
(b) Steam Generating Plant - The second alternative which was
examined was a 6-MW diesel generating set and a steam power
station with two 15-MW sets using coal as fuel. The 6-MW
diesel unit would be located in the existing power station
at Blantyre, and the new steam station, which would also be
located in Blantyre, would burn coal from Rhodesia. A com-
parison of the Project and this alternative based on dis-
counted cash flow of costs showed a very high equalizing
discount rate of 71%.



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 4 pages
CY  Gas T=ubine - 'TDhe last alternative examined comprised three
12MW gas turhines insta lled at Blantyre power station.  A
COMParison of the Project and this alternative showed an equaliz-
ing discount rate of 20.5%  sse page 4 of this Annex). This was
snown to be the best non-hydro alternative and was selected for
further examination and a sensitivity analysis.
2         Tfhe capital costs of the Project (Tedzani II, the Barrage and the
Gas Turbine) are higher thanA the capical costs of the best nion-hydro alter-
native Cthe gas turbine installation£). Eowever, the Project has mich  lower
runni¢lllg costs than tre thermal alternative.  irn the case of the Project, an
analysis of the future operatior of the system  shows that the Gas Turbine
wrill be used for peak power production in i975 and 1976  but thereafter it
will serve as a standby in case of planned or forced outage of a ilydro set.
5is operating regime results in low fuel costs.  The alternative thermal
project, on the ot;her handt-id,   curs high fuel costs during the first years of
operatxion.  Tne gas turbine paunt   hichn would take the place of Tedzani II,
wuld have to supply base load during four years (1977-1980), implying high
consumption of fuel.  In th.e followi'ng years dsring the time of the construc-
tiorn of a raew hydra  power pl ant (probably Nkula II" it w-vould produce power
durin.g 3eak 'hours and from 1987 On ilt would serve as a standby with only a
nomin,al amount of fuel cost0  Considering the extremsely high price of fuel
in Blantyre, the use of thermal7  ower for generation of base load power is
less economic and a comparison of 'the two alternatives shows an advantage
for the proposed Project. As shown above the equalizing discount rate is
20 .5% .,
3.        The seuasitivi-ty of the equalizing discount rate v7as tested to
determine the effects of changes in the main variables. 'eiie resu'Lts of tne
sensitivity analysis are described below.
4.        T     ie first stage of Ted zar.'u hyroel ectri  Power Station, which is
to be comissioned this year, experiencec a cost overrun of about 30%, mainly
because of unexpectedly cba;i rock conditions but La view oL the imowledge since
gained., a cost overrun of simi$lar size for Tedzana  II is improbab Le. However,
the e:fect of a 10% cost overrun was tested and this reduced the equalizing
discoULnt rate to 16.1%.
load Growth'
5.        TIhe et2ualizing discount r-ate is most sensitive to a change ir. load
growth.  A reduction in the projected dema-nd of ESCOM's largest consumer,
SUC0XM, and the probability of a shift of power consumption for irrigation
and pumping demand, to tnie night peak period was examined.  SUCOMAs expan-
sior, plans, wenich will raise. its dlemand during peak hours from 6.6  4 in
1972 to a little over 12 lv$N in 1977, may wealI be partly influenced by the
recent rise in the -world market price for sugar.  A drop in the world price



ANNEX 9

of sugar could result bi a cut back in their development plans.  Therefore,
it may be possible that SUCOMA will modify its expansion plan and reduce
its projected demand growth correspondingly. Additionally, the introduc-
tion of marginal cost tariffs might provide an incentive to SUCe:MA and the
Blantyre Water Board who can transfer a substantial part of their power
demand to off peak night hours by installing larger pumping capacity to
use cheap power during off-peak hours. Accordingly, a total reduction of
load growth of 10%v might result.  This would involve a considerable reduc-
tion in fuel consumption of the gas turbine plant by about 25% during the
period of base load generat4on (1977 to 1980), reducing further by about
60% thereafter.  Reducn.Lg load growth in the manner described above reduces
the equalizing discount rate to 12.4%.
6.        Under conditions most unfavorable to the Project - a 10%Z reduction
in l oad growth and a 10% rise in the capital cost of the Second Power Project
the equalizing discount rate drops to 8.4%.
7.        Tne marginal cost of capital in  ialawi is estimated between 10% and
13%, and under conditions most unfavorable to the Project, as described in
paragraph 6 above, the equalizing discount rate is somewhat below this range.
However, the probability of the equalizing discount rate being below thne mar--
ginal cost of capital is small  It is estimated that the probability ' of a
10% drol? in load growth is about 33% (one-third), and the chance of a 10%
rise in the capital cost of the Second Power Project is about 25% (one-quarter).
Therefore, there is a 60% probability that the equalizing discount rate will be
higher ithan the estimated range of the marginal cost of capital and about
10% that it will be lower.  This is without crediting the project for the
higher ;mount of unskilled labor employed in the con-struction of a hydro
scheme, for savings in foreign exchange or for rising fuel prices. The
unemployment rate indicates that the opportunity cost of unskilled labor
is lower tharn the Vage rate, and the use of a shadow wage rate would raise
the equalizing discount rate. Equally, foreign exchange costs have not
been estimated at shadow rates.  A rough calculation on the basis of data
for the year 1972 indicates that application of the shadow exchange rate is
about 10% above the officiaL rate*.  This would also raise the calculated
equalizing discount rates.  Finally, fuel prices are expected to rise more
rapidly than average prices, which again wou'ld favor the Project with lower
fuel consumption.
*    The Malawi Kwacha is fixed to the floating Pound Sterling and the
shadow exchange rate may have changed since 1972.

MALAWI
SECOND POWER PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
Method and AssumDtions Made to Determine the
Return on the Investment anid Justification for the
12-MW Gas Turbine
1.        The rate of return on the investment in the Project at 1973 costs
is defined as the discount rate at which the present worth of the estimated
capital and operating costs of the Project over its life equals the present
worth of attributable revenues.
Capital Costs
2.        The capital costs are assumed to comprise estimated expenditures
on the Project as defined, together with the estimated cost of distribution
and secondary transmission extensions, to cope with the increase in generat-
ing capacity. ESCOM's expenditure prograrn for the years 1977 through 1980
on these facilities have been accepted for this purpose.  It was further
assumed that from 1978 Tedzani Stage II would be operating within the plant
operating program at an annual load factor of 60%.
3.        For the purpose of this exercise the economic life of the power
station, barrage and other civil works was assumed to be 80 years, the
electrical and mechanical plant, transmission equipment and distribution
30 years and the gas turbine 15 years. Plant renewal costs were assumed in
all cases to be the same as original costs. It was assumed the gas turbine
would not be renewed at the end of its economic life.
Operating Costs
4.        The consultants' estimates of operational and maintenance costs
were assumed and in the case of the gas turbine these were extended to cover
the full life of the plant. These costs were held constant from 1980 over
the balance of the 80 year period considered. To these costs were added MK
20,000 which is 50% of the estimated annual increase in ESCOM's distribution,
operation, maintenance and management costs. This figure was also held con-
stant throughout the 80 year period.
Benefits
5.        The output from Tedzani Stage II was estimated at 55 million kWh
in 1977, building up to its full output of 126 million by 1979 and trans-
mission and distribution losses were assumed at 9% when calculating sales.
An income of 2.04 tambala per kWh was assumed and was held steady at that
figure throughout. The annual output from the gas turbine, from its assumed
operating regime within the plant operating program, was estimated, and income



ANNEX 1 0
Page 2 of 4 pages
cz_culated in accordance with the fuel cost surcharge was added to the
b,e f4 ts.
6.        The streams of costs and benefits based on the above assumptionas
are shown in the table on Page 4 of this Arnnex. An incremental rate of re-
turn of 15% was obtained. To examine the effect of uncertainties irn the main
assumptions a sensitivity analysis was carried out, taking 10% variations
in the estimated costs and revenues. The most pessimistic estimate which
assumed a 10% increase in cost and a 10% decrease in benefits resulted in a
rate of return of 12.0%; the most optimistic estimate which assumed a 10%
decrease in costs and a 10% increase in revenues resulted in a rate of return
of 18%.,
Tnterim Gas Turbine Unit
7.        The interim thermal plant is required to meet the growing demand
some two years before Tedzani Stage II hydroelectric power station goes into
commercial operation3but apart from the period 1975/1977 when it will operate
as a peaking unit,it will  not generate any appreciable amount of energy.  An
attempt to determine the return on the investment in the gas turbine, with-
out making any allowance for the risks in not insta1lling it, gave a negative
result and the justification for this unit is assessed on the effect of drop-
ping it from the program.
8.        Many of the principal benefits whieh would be foregone if the
interim thermal plant is not installed are:
(a)  ESCOM's largest consumer, SUCO.'A is pla.ning to expand its
acreage under cultivation, and consequently its irrigation
load by something like another 6 ;Bi between 1974 and 1976.
This is the principal reason for the need for interima generat-
ing plant, and if not provided, this expansion would have to
be delayed by 2 or 3 years until nydro plant is commissioned,
or SUCO:>A would have to 1nstall its own plant.
(b)  The 12-?W gas turbine unit would be available as a peaking
unit when redundant thermal plant is retired in the late
1 970 s . Enis is a more economical replacement, for such
limited usage, than an.other hydro generating plant which
would be the alternative.
(c)  The installation of a 12-2V gas turbine now effectively
defers the next large hydro development by one year.
(d)  The gas turbine would be available to meet the further
developing demand in the event Tedzani Stage II is delayed.



ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 4 pages
9.        It is not possible to quantify all the consequences outlined above
but those that are quantifiable; loss of revenues to ESCOM if SUCOMA defers
its expansion plans by 2 to 3 years (about US$0.7 million) and availability of
a gas turbine for peaking with consequent saving on additional hydro capacity,
aggregate about US$2.2 million which is more than the cost of the 12-MW gas
turbine plant, estimated at US$2.1 million.
10.       Having established the need for interim thermal plant, ESCOM was
faced witb the decision whether or not to opt for the alternative of a 6-MW
diesel unit, which would be adequate to meet the growing demand until Tedzani
Stage II is commissioned. An economic comparison of the alternatives was
marginally in favor of the 12-MW gas turbine and, bearing in mind the benefits
outlined under paragraph 8 above and the doubt that a 6-MW diesel would be
ready when required (a 3-MW diesel unit ordered by ESCOM three years ago has
only recently been commissioned), ESCOM opted for the 12-MW gas turbine.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
1.        At the time this report was prepared, audited financial statements
for 1972 were not yet available and the income statements and balance sheets
in the Annexes are based on umaudited figures. Since then the audited finan-
cial statements have been provided to IDA and they are not materially dif-
ferent from the unaudited statements.
Revenues and Expenses
2.        It has been assumed that from FY 1975 a new tariff will be put into
effect which will increase revenues by 9%.
3.        Expenses have been estimated using adjusted 1973 budget figures.
Operating and maintenance costs have been projected to increase by 10% per
annum and administration and general expenses by 8% per annum.
4.        The interconnected system in the Southern Region is supplied mainly
by hydro power. However, when fuel costs are incurred they are recovered by
means of a surcharge to customers. From FY 1973 onwards, fuel costs recover-
able from customers are excluded from both revenues and expenses.
Balance Sheets
5.        Fixed assets are valued at historical cost less depreciation.  De-
preciation is estimated at 3% of the cost of fixed assets. ProJect expendi-
tures are recognized on an accrual basis.
6.        It has been assumed that accounts receivable will equal about 35
average daily sales for each fiscal year. Bad debts, which have been
negligible up to now, have been ignored.
7.        Creditors for operating expenses are assmed to equal about two
months' operating expenses and it is further assumed that there will be a
paymernt lag of about two Twnths in meeting obligations to contractors and
suppliers for major capital projects.
8.        ESCOM has loan facilities up to MK200,000 available to it from the
Nation8al Bank of Malawi.  No difficulty is expected in extending this aount
to MK300,000 if required.

B.   P rincipal is assumed to be repayable in 20 equal aniiual installments
commencing December 31, 1977.
C,   Exnenditures on the next nydro- de ebopment are expected to occur between
-FP!t 10,76 anid FY 1982.  T-he total cost has been estimated at IEK 26 m22.on

E.   Expenditures on the gas turbine are assimed to occur between FY 1977
and -Y 1980.  Of the total estimated cost of MK2.02 million (US$2.68
mi' llion), it is assurLed that 75% will be met by borrowings. No prin-
cipal repayments will be due during the period covered by the pro-
jections.

10.       In the financial projections it is assumed that 75% of the proposed
expenditures on the Nkula-Lilongwe Transmission Line, the Nkula Hydro Station
and the second Gas Turbine will be financed from external sources. Funds
will not be required before 1976.
11.       With the exception of the CDC loan for the Second Power Project,
it is assumed that interest during construction will be financed from borrow-
ings.
12.       The loan agreement between ESCOM and CDC will be for an amount up
to MK5 million (US$6.1 million). The financial projections take into account
only the MK.3.78 million (US$4.61 million) estimated to be required for the
Second Power Project. The remaining part of the loan may, subject to CDC's
approval, be used to finance other parts of ESCOM's development program and
to meet any cost overruns on the Second Power Project.

Economic Analysis of ESCOM's Tariffs
ESCOM's Tariffs
1.         In this Annex ESCOM's tariffs are compared with economic tariffs
based on marginal cost pricing. The only changes in ESCOM's tariffs since
1966 when they were reduced by 20% to recognize lower generating costs fol-
lowing the commissioning of Nkula hydroelectric power station, were a 10%
increase in 1968, and a 3% development surcharge I/ in 1970 to assist in
generating sufficient internal cash to make a meaningful contribution to
the cost of Tedzani  Stage I.
2.         ESCOM's tariffs which are shown on Page 6 of this Annex are open
to criticism on the following counts:
(a)   The tariffs are not economically efficient, since they do not
reflect marginal costs. In the cost of a system, which is
and will be predominantly hydro, with thermal sets only used
as standby and for peaking, the fixed costs should be higher,
with lower variable costs than are indicated by ESCOMts
tariffs. Further, the marginal costs of supplying power
during peak hours, are different from the costs of off-peak
generation, when only the hydro sets are running. Only the
tariff applicable to ESCOM's largest consumer, SUCOMA, recog-      _
nizes the difference in off-peak and on-peak costs and even
in this case the special agreement does not provide SUCOMA
with an adequate incentive to shift some of its consumption
peak to the low demand night period.
(b)   The tariffs have an undesirable effect on income distribution.
The domestic, high density residential, and commercial tariffs
are strongly regressive, consumers using more electricity and
probably having higher incomes paying less per kWh than con-
sumers with low consumption. Additionally, consumers on high
voltage tariffs (large industrial consumers) are subsidized by
all other consumers, since they pay less than the costs (marginal
and average) related to their supplies.
1/    The high density tariff was excluded from the surcharge.

ESCOM's generating system is predominantly hydro, with a small
eanit Oower station and a number of diesel generating units.  As more hydro
benerating capacity is installed and the older diesel and steam plants are
retired the relation between different types of generation will change from
60% hydro and 40% thermal to about 70% hydro and 30% thermal, thermal plant
probably being gas turbines for stansdby and peaking.
4.         Tne distribulion of consumption be-tween high k. IKV) and low
voltage consumers and ESCOMis forecast for 1977 are presented in the table
below;

This illustrates that the peak demand of high voltage consumers will grow
between 1972 and 1977 from about 40% to about 50% of the total peak demarnd
but the percentage of GWh cons-amption of this category of consumer will change
much less dramatically from 48% of total consumption in 1972 to 47% in 1977,
5.         The load curve for a typical working day has a daytime 2eak of
about 50 hours and an off-peak of about 6 hours. The off-peak demand is, Oa,
average, about 20% below the on-peak demand. The base load during the night
has a duration of 8 hours and is about 50% of the peak load, Thae 1long dur-
ation of peak demand (more than 2000 hours a year) and the relatively high
base load is due to the pumping demand (irrigation and water supply) of
about 10 MW during system peak and the nI?gIht.  By 1977 the peak load demand
for pumiping will double to albout 20 MY.

1/    The fixed costs are very high and it is not known to what extent they
are marginal. However, ESCOM's government-influenced policy of "over-
employment" indicates that fixed costs could increase further as the
system is extended. To this extent a small part of the fixed costS
may not be marginal.

7.         The marginal energy costs are the extra fuel costs per kWh, in-
cluding the energy losses in the transmission and distribution system. The
marginal energy costs per kWh based on 1972 results are 0.12 tambala for
high voltage consumers and 0.13 tambala for low voltage consumers.
8.         A rough estimation of the operation of thermal plant in the
generation system on the basis of time of peak demand, planned outage and
forced outage of hydro sets, indicates that about 95% of total thermal plant
operation will occur during the time of peak demand with 5% occurring during
day off-peak period.  The marginal energy costs of the thermal plant are:
Peak            Day off-peak         Night off-peak

1/    The marginal fixed costs are based on average demand per connection
during system peak hours: Commerce 3.3 kW, Domestic 1 kW and High
Density 50 W.
2/    ESCOM's charges per kWh for Commercial, Domestic and High density con-
sumers are based on average consumption per connection in 1972. The
average charges per kWh in these consumer groups have been calculated
by excluding the minimum charge which is a fixed charge.

Conclusions
10.       The comparison between ESCOM's tariffs and alternatives charges
based on marginal costing shows the following:
(a) ESCOI4's fixed charges are generally too low, while charges
per kWh are higher than marginal costs, with the exception
of charges to high voltage and industrial consumers during
peak hours.
(b) ESCOM makes no difference between off-peak and on-peak
consumption (with the exception of large industrial con-
sumers on special agreements). The marginal costs, however1
differ considerably depending on the time of demand. Con-
sumption during the night (and holidays), about 5,000 hours
per year, does not induce any variable cost at all.
(c) Total revenue from tariffs based on marginal costing would
have been practically the same in 1972 as with ESCOM1s
tariffs (assuming an unchanged consumption pattern of all
consumer groups). However, a comparison indicates that
high voltage consumers would have paid a considerably
h-igher amount, if charged on the basis of a marginal cost
tariff (MK 1.3 million as compared to MK 0.9 million),
while all other groups would have paid less. In particular,
consumers living in high density housing, having a monthly
income of about MK 25, would have paid MK 0.5 per month
(including MK 1 per year as a charge for kMh consumed)
compared with MK 1.5 on ESCOM's existing tariff.
(d) A shift to pumping during off-peak hoUrs would be one of
the most important effects of marginal cost tariffs. This
would involve substantial savings for Malawi's economy
because the cost of additional generating capacity is much
higher than the cost of additional pumping capacity which
might be required.
11.       This comprises a general approach to the problem of ESCOM's
tariffs and any restructuring of these based on marginal costing will re-
quire further detailed studies of the different consumer categories and
related costs and also the political implications of restructured tariffs
which could radically change the cost of power to the different consumer
groups. The study is included in the Project.
