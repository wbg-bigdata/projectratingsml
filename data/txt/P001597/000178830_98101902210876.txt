INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECONMMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTTVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMNT CREDIT
TO MALAWI FOR A
SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to I+hlawi of US$7.5 million on standard IDA terms to help
finance a power project.  The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the
ELectricity Supply Cormassion of Malawi for a term of 24 years, including four
years of grace at an interest rate of 7.5 percent per year.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report, "'Recent Economic Developments and Prospects of Nhlawil
(67a-YiAI), was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 17, 1973 (R73-77).
Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Since independence in 1964, Y.lawi Ts economy has grcim  an average by
just aver 7 percent a year in real terms, though with a per capita income of
about $90, Nalawi remains one of the poorest countries in the world, and is
included in the United Nations List of least developed countries. Natural resources
are limited to moderately fertile soils, substantial -water resources and a climate
favorable to crop production.  The economr is dependent on agriculture, and subject
to annual fluctuations in output. For example, GDP decreased in real terms in
1968, but increased by 13 percent in 1971.
4.        A substantial savings and investment effort and generally efficient
management of the economy have contributed to econoimic growth in the past. At
independence, domestic savings were negligible and gross domestic investment wa,
8.7 percent of GDP. By 1972, domestic savings had increased to 9 percent of- G-Di
and gross domestic investment to 20 percent of GDP, leaving a resource gap of
US$48 million, A significant improvement in the financial position of the
Government has contributed to this overall improvement in savings performance-
At independence, the Government was able to finance only about half of its
recurrent expenditures from local resources. The deficit was met by grants and
loans from the U.K. Between 1964 and 1972, however, improvements in tax
administration and some changes in the tax system caused domestic revenue to rise
by 16 percent a year, while the average annual increase in recurrent expenditure
was only 8 percent. Consequently, the deficit in the recurrent budget di:ini shed
steadily and the financial position of the Government is expected to continue to
improve.
The Government has increased its outlay for development at the average
rate of 25 percent annually in the last five years with heavy emphasis on
infrastrncture and agriculture. Infrastructure investments included the
construction and improvement of roads and emphasized the operning up of the central
and northern regions of the country. The rail link to Nacala in Nbzambique,
completed in 1970, has provided a second outlet to the sea, additional to the
already existing railway to Baira. Since 1969, the construction of a new capital
at Lilongwe has taken up about 10 percent of the Goveruwent s development
expenditures. After 1968, a nurnber of large agricultu-ral schemes, incorporating



inputs, miarketing and some rnfrastrncttre, were started near Salina (with
GermaTln aid) and near Lilongwe, Chikwa-wa and Karonga (with IDA credits)0
ir>P oximately one--' fth of the Government's investment program has been spent on
agr c-.Ltural projects ln the past, th.ough more recently greater emphasis is being
placed or this sector.   f a total p-blic investment program of US$38 million
per arnualm for 1972/73 to 1974l/75 kclose to the average level fo, the two previous
years), mne-third is to be spen-t on investment in agriculture.  The Goverment's
Statement of Development Policies emphasizes that with tle couriCryS 1 liiated
enao-ment of resources, development strategy should concentrate on raising the
produactivity of small farmers.
6.        In the future, private investments are expected to b6 equal to those of
tne ou!zl1ic sector, with approx-iimately one-tenth of private sector `i`_nvestie.n.t i-!^
thae non-monekarir sector, 'The Large size of private capilal foroaticno envi.sage-d

the end of^ the decade. In v;iew of' its low per capita incoime and the unreliability

of future export earnings, Mlawi should continue to receive substantial amounts
of external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II  -  BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       1I4lawi has to date received eight IDA credits totalling $57el million,
Five credits representing $34 mi:lion have been for agriculture. Tae other
three credits have been for highways ($11o5 million), education ($6.3 million)
and power ($5.25 million). There have been no Bank loans or IFC investments.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of July,r 31, 1973
notes on the execution of on-going projects. Project execution if generally
satisfactory.
11.       In 1972,  DA' s share in Malawi' s total external debt was about twenty
percent, while servicing of the IDA credits accounted for 2.8 percent of total
debt service. For 1977, these figures are projected at twenty-one and four
percent respectively, assuming a moderate growth in IDA lending.
12,       Prospective Bank Group operations in Milawi will continue to focus
primarily, but not exclusively, on rural development. An agricultural sector
mission visited Malawi in April, 1973 to review with the Governnent its strategy
for agricultural development.  Specific proposals for Bank Group lending are
being forimulated, based on the mission's findings. These are expected to
include further stages of sgoing integrated rural development projects in
Lilongwe (Credit 244-.HI) and Karonga (Credit 282-MJI), and projects centering
on the production of export crops, as well as on extension services and credit
and marketing facilities outside the current major projec`4 areas. A second
education project is being prepared by the Government and the Bank is acting a-
executing agency for a UNDP-financed detailed engineering study of the Lilcng-
Kassungu road. A request for financing of the construction oi' this road by ITDk
is expected. Tne Bank is also executing agency for a UNDP sttL.dy of the
feasibility of exploiting forest resources on the Vipya Plateau irn the Noc-rter
region. A pulp export project has been identified and a credit by tu
Association may be proposed to finance investigations require` to co;:,plete
planning of the project. Finally, the Government has requested IDA financing
for a site and services project in Elantyre, which is oeing prepared, A
water supply project for the city of Elantyre is also being prepared with
assistance from the United Kingdom for which the Government irtends to request
IDA financing.
PART III - THE POdER SECTOR
13.       Malawi is rich in water resources.  The falls and rapids of several
rivers offer a source of power Which can be harnessed to provide electricity
at low operational costs and without dependence upon costly imported fuel.
Lake Yblawi, the third largest lake in Africa, forms a gigantic natural
reservoir which discharges at its southern end into MIlawi's principal river
and major source of potential power, the Shire.  In the central and northern
regions some of the rivers which flow into Lake Malawi also possess hydro-
electric potential.  The use of alternative domestic energy resources, which
include some coal deposits and some geo-thermal power potential in the northern
region, would be costly as is inport of petroleum, due to Malawi's landlocked

'__ )A 24-1ŽJ hydroelect4ric power station at Nkula Falls on the Middle Shire
F6.ve, w5lich was financed by -the Coxmncnwealth Developmnr-t Corporation (CDC) was
cominrLssioned in 1965. A second major scheme was the 16-2V Tedzanai Falls hydro-
eled-tric station, Stage L, wich went into operation in Tvy of this year, with
linancing from !DA under Credit 178-MAI. These two majo- power sta'tions, alcrig
vith smaller ones, have been connected by a grid of tra-13MIssior lines tG cover
the sorataern region which accounts for 90 percent of po-er consa--rptlion. T.he t7vri
of Mzuzu in the north and some of- the larger tea estates in areEs where ellectri3ity
is not supplied by the grid have independent supplies. A general northward
extens-ion of the grid has been uneconomic to date, give-n the low; -cp-ulatio-n density
in the north.
15.       The T21ectricity Supp'Ly Ctmission of Malawi (ESCOM) iE. responsible f,or
public electricity supply and has successfully supplied a market for power
increasing at 25 percent annually from 1964 to 1967,, and at 15 percent an-nuaLly
since then. In the future, the grovth of demard is expect-ed to diminish gradually,
levelling off at around 10 percent annual growt,h after 1977. Demand for powr is
?rincipally from industry, wLich conswued 64 percent of total suppl,y in -107  _...
growth of industrial demand is expected to continue to exceed that, of' c- ti c
consumption and by 1980, it  i-ll account for around 63 percent cf the total<
16.       To -meet future demand,L ESCON has prepared a 10-year capitv- develcprvent
program for the period 1973 through 1982, which prow-des for total expenditurres
of sone IK50 million. The program includes, in addition to tl-Le proposed PrCI23ct
a further 12-, gas turbine to replace 12-4W of stean. ad iesel. plant due 2 or
retirement by '1980, a 132 kv transmission line from INua to ilzngwe, -nd t-he
next hydroelectric power station9 Nk&Lua Stage II, for co.X:r,fLssioning by 1981/82.

HLectricity 93pply Commissica of Ialawi'" No. l7Lk-A-MAI dated Aug-ust 6, 1973 is
being circulated separat-ely'  A credit and project summary is provided in Annex III
and the locaticn of existing and proposed works is shown in map No. IBRD 2369R3,
vwiich is attached.
lOe       The project was ap-praised in the field in Febr-aay 197.3. Iegotiations
i.ere hrield in Washington duriag July 16-20, 1973. Tze  lawi GovernaentIs
delegation was h1eaded by Mr. L.P. Anthony, Permanent Sec-retary of' the Treasury,
and included Niessrs. Lo3. 3 fhowa, Undersecretary of' the Treas-ra. M Je KalaxruI2a3
Cenior Assistant Secr-etar-y  `iistry of Trade, Industry &r'L Tc:is,, DXJ, Dalton,
~eneral Ianager, E"C0,M and W.S.S. Clark, Secretary, ESCOM.
19.       The proposed credit -ril be the second credit to Tivawi for power
developmrient. Credit 178-1N1AT of  ebr-laary 11, 1970 f or the equivalent of US$5.25
million helped fina-nce the foreign exchange component of the 16 :/W Tedzani Stage I
hydroelectric development, c;ogether -with a 3 1W diesel generating unit.  The project
also included a 66 i( transmi.ssion line between Nkula arLd Li'ong-;.^e and distribution



5-
extension and improvements, the foreign exchange components of -iich were financed
by a loan of US$3 million equivalent from the African Development Bank (ADB).
Construction of the project has proceeded satisfactorily and the credit has been
fully disbursed. However, higher than estimated establishment costs and unexpected
poor rock conditions encountered during tunnel construction resulted in cost
overruns of US$2.0 million. Additional financing was obtained from CDC and the
Industrial Development Bank of MIlawi (INDEBANK). In preparing the proposed project,
which will be located at the same site, an extensive drilling program was carried
out and zones of poor rock conditions have been avoided in the design,
20,         In 1972, the Gavernment commissioned consultants to carry out a faSer
study of the hydropower potential of YMiddle Shire River to determine priorities among
various development possibilities. The report recommended a second stage of the
Tedzani Project and concluded that two 10 MW generating units wolld be the optimam
size for this project and that a complementary 12 MW gas turbine unit would be
required by 1975 to meet projected power demand before Tedzani Stage II could be
commissioned early in 1977.
21.         The project has been designed by ESCOM with assistance from Mbssrs.
Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlmann (civil consultants) and Kennedy and ;DonXin
(mechanical and electrical consultants), both of the United Kingdom. It coimrises
ESCOM's generation development program for the period FY1973 through FY1977, and
consists of:
(a)  The construction of a 20 MW hydroelectric power station as
an extension of the existing Stage I power station;
(b)  The construction of a barrage over the submerged weir
constructed under Tedzani Stage I, thereby providing an
adequate water level upstream to enable generation of 20
NW by the new plant and to increase the output of the
generation equipment installed under Stage I from 16 to
?0 MW;
(c) The addition of a 12 MW gas turbine unit located in Mantyre:
initially to avoid a power shortage in 1975/76 and subsequently
for operation as a standby and peaking unit; and
(d)  A study of the adequacy of ESCON s tariff structure.
Project Implementation
22.         The project will be carried out by the Electricity Supply Commission
of Ynlawi (ESCOM), a corporate body fully owned by the GovernmneC, established
under the ELectricity Act of September 1, 1963. Its Board consists of a part-time
Chairman and five part-time members, all appointed by the Minister of Trade and
Industry who is responsible for the power sector.  Although ESCOM is dependent on
the MiLnister's approval for major appointments and decisions, the company operates
with a large degree of autonomy.
23.         ESCOM is well managed and follows sound public utility practices. All
senior management and most professional staff are expatriates with experience in
public utilities. There has, however, been a fairly rapid tur.over in senior
expatriate staff during the last three years which has tended to affect the



-6-
quality of management. ESCOM envisages that all posts will be filled with Malawi
na-tionals by 1980 and to achieve this has embarked upon an extersive training
yrogram, partly in conjunctian wiath the Malawi Polytechnimc Institute, under a
full-time training officer inith the status of Head of Department.

cost of' the barrage, civil wo;^ks and electrical and mecherical p1ant,, as wel1 as
of the tariff study. The CDC loan of U$6o.l million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of the gas turbine, engineering and admlnistratioan  as well as
fifty percent of all local costs.  These conponents are estimated at US      .6 mlion
equilvalent, including contingenLcies. The balance of' US$1.5 million would pro=ide
a margin for possibie short-fall uue to currency fluctuations and cost overruns.
3SCOM would finance fifty oercent of' all local costs, i.e. US  -   r5 rllion- f rc
internally gerLerated cash,
20.       The Government wouLd relend the proceeds of the IDA credit to ESCO-M at
initerest ratQe of 7.5 percent per ainuam and a term of 24 years, including a
-race perico. o-f =r years.  C3JC vil lend directly to ESCOIK at  -interest ra-.
o   percernt per arnum and a term of 23 years, including a gra-e period of three

Procurement and Disbursement
270       Procurement of' eq- pmient and works financed by IDA will be on the basis
of international cumpetitive bidding in accordance with TDA guidelines.



- 7 -
Procurement of the gas turbine, financed from the CDC loan, will also be on the
basis of international campetitive bidding.
28.       Disbursenent of the IDA credit would be made for the actual foreign
exchange cost of equipment, materials and services procured under the credit.
Finances of ESCOM
29.       ESCOMTs financial performance to date has been satisfactory. Vhile,
under the Project Agreement concluded in connection with Credit 178-MAI., ESCOM
is required to maintain a 9 percent rate of return on its average net fixed
assets in operation, the rate achieved in 1972 wvas 14 percent.  However, as the
investment program outlined above is implemented, ESCOMIs internal cash generation
will have to increase substantially.  During negotiations, it wqas agreed that
ESCOX would set its tariffs so as to ensure a return of at least 10 percent on
its net fixed assets in operation and to enable it to contribute fram internal
cash generation not less than 25 percent of the cost of its capital development
program during the execution of the project. Tnis is expected to require an
increase in tariffs by 1975. Before such a tariff increase is introduced, an
examination of ESCOM's basic tariff structure is advisable to reflect changes in
power consumption patterns that occurred over the last few years.   ESCOM does not
have the expertise to carry out such a study and the estimated cost of consultants
for this purpose has therefore been included in the Credit.
Irrigation Aspects
30.       The Shire River has a large hydroelectric potential 4hich. because of
the natural storage provided by Lake Malawi, is likely to remain competitive
with other forms of power generation.  However, above the river's middle reaches,
where most of this potential lies, there are competing claims on the water,
mainly for irrigation. The Government agreed, during negotiations for Creditu
178-MAI, to studv the potential use of the water resources of Lake  ala,i a-td tne
Upper Shire River, and the desirable allocations between irrigation, pc-er
production and other requirements. This study, which was carr-ied out with UNDF
financing, has been completed and shows that irrigation on the scale presently
envisaged would, in the long-run, reduce the power potential of the river unless
action is ultimately taken to increase the minimum flow by increasing the storage
in Lake Malawi. The total diversion at full load when Tedzani Stage II is
commissioned, is expected to be well below the present minimum flow. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that, in any event, diversion of sufficient
water for power generation will be allowed.
Ecological Aspects
31.       Ecperience with the Tedzani Stage I and the Nacula hydropower stations,
4.5 miles upstream of Tedzani, indicate that the project should not cause major
ecological problems.  There are no permanent habitations and no crops Which will
be inundated when the barrage is completed.  Nonetheless, ESCO4 will examine the
possible ecological changes arising from the project and the steps which should
be taken to avoid or mitigate undesirable side effects. The conclusion of the
study and appropriate remedial measures will be reviewed with the Association.



-renefits
32.         The proposed project has been compared to various alternatives and
rep:rese:-its the most econordc way o,' satisfying the growiLng demand for power
ca:ring the late 1970s.  The rate of retu.- orL the investment is expected to
range between 12 and 18 percent.
PART V  - LEGAL INSTRUPEDNTS AND AUTHORITY
3,3.        The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Yhlarwi and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and ESCCO,M and
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V., ection I (d)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approvLdg the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Ececutive Directors separately. The draft
agreements conform to the normal pattern of credits for public utility projects.
Effectiveness of the IDA credit is subject to effectiveness of thDe CDC loar and
vice versa.  The Credit Agreement, therefore, includes as a condition to its
effectiveness that execution and delivery of the CDC loan agreeme>-it on behalf of
,SCC PI and CDC shall have beer, duly authorized and that all conditions precede)
to effectiveness of the CDC agreement shall have been fulfilled e:ccept the
declaration of effectiveness itself.
34.         I am satlsfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Art^ices
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VT -  REC OMEND)ATION
35.         I reconmrend that the Executive Directors approve the oroposed creditc.

health services and the rehabilitation of freight service on Lake Malawi.  The
Credit became effective in August, 1972 and implementation is 'mnderway. Cost
overruns are expected on the improvement of the lake ports involved, due to
lack of experience with marine works in Yalawi, remoteness of the northern
terminal and basic material price increases. The latter also affects the cost
of civil works under the agricultural component.  Construction of the southern
terminal will be delayed by eight months, mainly because further soil
investigations are required.
