PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
TWELFTH, THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH POWER PROJECTS
(Loans 2214-IND. 2300-IND and 2443-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.        The principal objectives of the Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth
Power Projects (Loans 2214-IND, 2300-IND, and 2443-IND), in addition to
assisting the sector in meeting the electricity demand, were to:
(a) diversify the sources of electricity generation by utilizing indigenous
non-tradeable energy such as geothermal (Kamojang thermal power station under
Loan 2214-IND) and hydropower (Cirata hydroelectric power project under Loan
2300-IND) and other indigenous energy such as coal (Suralaya thermal power
project units 3 and 4 under Loans 2214-IND and 2443-IND); (b) improve and
extend PLN's distribution networks in urban as well as rural areas to provide
electricity service to the people and also to reduce system losses and improve
operating efficiency; (c) support institutional building efforts in the areas
of PLN's manpower development and training, construction management of large
generation projects, financial performance.and engineering; and (d) provide
technical assistance for carrying out studies to prepare future projects (Part
1, paras. 2, 3 and 4).
Implementation Experience
2.         All of the main physical components under the three projects were
completed successfully and are operating satisfactorily although there were
some initial delays in implementation. Almost all of the delays were due to
slow process of bid evaluation and contract awarding. The delays would have
been much longer, if PLN, its consultants and its contractors had not made
special efforts to meet the targets of the revised schedule of the contracts
(Part I, paras. 16, 17, 22, 24 and 55).
3.        The actual costs of the three projects, expressed in US dollars
equivalent, were all lower than those estimated at appraisal. 1982/83 to
1988/89 was a period of volatile movements in exchange rates (Indonesian
Rupiah devalued and currencies for major contractors and equipment suppliers,
particularly the Japanese Yen, appreciated). However, the decrease in the
cost of local components due to devaluation of Indonesian Rupiah compensated
for some of the increase in the cost of foreign components due to appreciation
of foreign currencies (Part I, paras. 26, 30 and 37).
4.        The closing dates of all the three loans were extended.  Payments of
retention money (1-year guarantee period after acceptance tests) was one of
the reasons, but the main one was due to the slow progress in the
implementation of subprojects such as the distribution components under Loans
2214-IND and 2443-IND, and the energy sector support program under Loan
2300-IND that involved several studies and additional works (Part I,
paras. 27, 31 and 37).



- iii -
5.        The technical assistance components of the three projects
strengthened not only PLN's human resource development functions, and
capability in utility management, in-house engineering, and construction and
operation of large power plants, but also successfully enabled PLN to prepare
its future development program in a systematic manner (Part I, paras. 6 and
53).
6.        All the covenants contained in the Loan Agreements and Project
Agreements were met.
Results
7.        All of these three projects were successful with their main
objectives achieved. They contributed substantially to expanding PLN's power
generation capacity by a total of 1,410 MW (Kamojang geothermal - 110 MW;
Cirata hydropower - 500 MW; and Suralaya thermal - 800 MW) through
diversification of domestic energy consumption away from petroleum products
towards using alternative more economical fuels of geothermal, hydropower and
coal. They also substantially achieved the objectives of reduction of system
losses (from an overall 20.8 percent in 1983/84 to 15.6 percent in 1990/91)
and improvement in system reliability through the strengthening and expansion
of distribution systems, and strengthened PLN's operational and managerial
capabilities through institutional development and training. The Bank's
involvement in the achievement of these objectives by the Indonesian power
subsector was effective and successful (Part I, paras. 25, 29, 36 and 50).
8.        The economic reevaluation for the Twelfth Power Project was carried
out on the basis of a 10-year time slice of PLN's power development program,
and for the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Power Projects for their major
components, in a manner similar to that used in the SARs of the respective
projects. The prevailing average tariffs were used as the minimum proxy of
the economic value of electricity. On these bases, the ex-post internal
economic rates of return (IERR) for the three projects were all lower than
those estimated in the SARs, i.e. 3, 9 and 15 percent under the Twelfth,
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Power Projects respectively, compared to the related
appraisal estimate of 11, 14 and 28 percent respectively. The lower returns
are due primarily to the fact that the increases in electricity tariffs were
not sufficient to maintain the levels in real terms. If the prevailing
average tariffs in 1982/83 or 1983/84 were used and assumed to be maintained
constant in real terms over the life of the projects, as were assumed in the
SARs, the ex-post IERR of the projects would be higher than or same as the
appraisal estimates, i.e. 17, 14 and 38 percent under the Twelfth, Thirteenth
and Fourteenth Power Projects respectively (Part I, paras. 28, 32 and 39).
Sustainabilitv
9.        The benefits that Indonesia is reaping from the projects are
definitely sustainable as (a) PLN has demonstrated its ability to operate and
maintain its facilities efficiently; (b) PLN has a long history of steady
institutional improvements; (c) GOI has consistently shown its commitment to
the continued development of a strong power sector; and (d) the electricity
demand in Indonesia is expected to continue to grow to absorb fully the output
of the power plants that were constructed under the three projects, and that
are fueled by economic indigenous sources of energy. Also, PLN's financial



- iv -
position is satisfactory and is expected to remain so, which would enable it
to meet its financial obligations.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.       Major findings were as follows:
(a) all the major components of the three projects, such as expansion of
the Kamojang geothermal plant, the Cirata hydroelectric project, the
Suralaya thermal Units 3 and 4, the distribution improvement
program, Minihydro program in North Sumatra, and the Energy Sector
Support Program and other technical assistance components, were all
well designed and implemented. The power generation projects meet
the international standard for these types of projects. (Part I,
para. 54);
(b) thrdugh these projects, PLN's capacity for project implementation,
as well as operation and maintenance of power stations, grew
substantially (Part I, para. 55);
(c) substantial investment and concerted efforts are required over an
extended period of time, to improve distribution system reliability
and achieve reductions in system losses. PLN is making specific
efforts to curb illegal use of electricity (Part I, paras. 25 and
56); and
(d) PLN's financial performance suffered from a lack of timely and
adequate electricity tariff increases to meet increases in PLN's
costs. There is need to institutionalize the process of tariff
adjustment by introducing formula-based periodic tariff adjustments
to account for changes in PLN's major input costs (Part I,
paras. 43 and 47).
11.       Major lessons to be learned from the three projects are summarized
below:
(a) In the hydropower project, good project management by the consulting
engineer and sound advice by a competent Board of Consultants
throughout project preparation and implementation were key elements
in successful project implementation (Part I, para. 53);
(b) In the thermal power projects, good engineering design, a multiple
contracts strategy for equipment specification, good quality control
and competent management by the consulting engineer and the owner of
construction, and operation and maintenance played an important role
in achieving satisfactory project implementation and operation of
the plants (Part I, para. 53);
(c) Delays in project implementation could have been avoided by
undertaking advance procurement actions and completing contract
award and signing in an expeditious manner (Part I, para. 53);



(d) "piggy-backing" under the Bank-financed projects, of feasibility
studies and engineering design of future projects helped ensure
timely project preparation and implementation (Part I, para. 53);
and
(e) Well designed technical assistance for manpower development and
training enhanced PLN's capability in utility management functions,
in-house engineering and construction and operation of large power
plants, and has prepared a number of its staff to become the
backbone of PLN's middle-level management. PLN has effectively
utilized such capability in implementing subsequent operations
(Part I, para. 53).

Background
1.        Until 1981, the Indonesian economy was growing at almost 8 percent
per annum for over a decade. The dominant external influence during this
period was the huge expansion resulting from the foreign exchange earnings
from oil, which rose from US$0.6 billion in 1973/74 to US$10.6 billion in
1980/81. During 1982, the Indonesian economy was affected adversely by the
protracted international recession and the accompanying declilsd in export
earnings. The primary objective of the Government energy policy is,
therefore, to maintain the level of oil export earnings by diversification of
domestic energy consumption away from heavy reliance on petroleum products
towards alternative and more economical fuels for which there is a non-
exportable surplus (coal and natural gas) or which are non-tradeable
(hydropower and geothermal). The power subsector has been playing a central
role in this respect.
Project Obiectives
2.        The objectives of the Twelfth Power Project (Loan 2214-IND) were to:
(a) diversify the sources of electricity production through the use of
geothermal or coal; (b) improve efficiency of PLN's distribution networks;
(c) reduce PLN's system losses; and (d) provide consulting services for the
continued institutional development of PLN.
3.        The objectives of the Thirteenth Power Project (Loan 2300-IND) were
to develop non-tradeable hydro potential on the Citarum river to provide the
needed peaking capacity to the Java System, strengthen PLN's institutional
development for construction management of complex major generation projects,
and carry out studies to prepare for future development of the energy sector.



4.        The objectives of the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) were
to support GOI's energy policy of diversification away from oil in the
generation of electricity by the construction of the coal-fired base-load
plant at Suralaya, to extend and improve the distribution facilities and to
further institutional building in the areas of financial performance and
engineering.
Proiect Description
5.        The Twelfth Power Project comprised the following five components:
(a) construction of a 110 (2 x 55) MW extension of the Kamojang
geothermal station in West Java and substation equipment to
interconnect with the existing transmission system;
(b) construction of the third 400 MW, coal-fired, generating unit at
Suralaya and step-up substation equipment to connect it with the
500 kV system, including engineering services for the third and
fourth generating units. The turbine and steam-generator islands
(excluding the auxiliary equipment) for the third unit (No. 3) were
financed under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND).
(c) distribution system improvements in Java, North Sumatra and South
Sulawesi;
(d) a mini-hydro development program in North Sumatra; and
(e) training facilities and services to assist PLN's manpower
development program.
6.        The Thirteenth Power Project comprised the following:
(a) construction of the Cirata hydroelectric project on the Citarum
river in West Java including a 125 m high concrete faced rockfill
dam at Cirata, two diversion tunnels, two spillway tunnels, an
intake structure, a water conductor system and an underground power
house with an initial installed capacity of 500 MW (4 x 125 MW);
(b) a 500 kV switchyard and a 25 km long, 500 kV transmission line to
connect the station to the Java EHV grid at Saguling; and
(c) consultancy services for the Cirata project and an energy sector
support program to support engineering and design for major thermal
stations, an information management system study, and feasibility
studies for hydro, thermal and transmission and distribution schemes
to sustain PLN's future development.
7.        The Fourteenth Power Project comprised the following:
(a) construction of 2 x 400 MW coal-fired thermal units (Nos. 3 and 4)
at Suralaya in West Java.



-3-
(b) extension of the distribution network in Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang,
Bekasi (the Jabotabek area), East Java and Central Java.
(c) consulting services for detailed engineering and construction
supervision for the construction of transmission lines and
substations in Java and for engineering and design of hydro
projects.
Proiect Design and Organization
Twelfth Power Proiect
8.        The feasibility study on the 110 MW extension at Kamojang was
carried out by the Geothermal Energy of New Zealand (GENZL) in 1981. GENZL
had been used since 1982 to carry out engineering and design, procurement and
construction supervision of the geothermal component. PLN's project office
undertook the day to day supervision of construction activities. GENZL
assisted PLN in the inspection of construction in order to ensure that the
contractors fulfilled the technical requirements of their contracts.
9.        The Montreal Engineering Company (MONENCO) of Canada/UK had been
involved in the feasibility study, engineering and design, procurement and
construction supervision for the first and second 400 MW generating units of
the Suralaya plant under Loan 1708-IND and Loan 1872-IND.  The Suralaya
extension was carried out by PLN, with the assistance of MONENCO in
association with a local consulting firm, PT Central Development Enterprise.
10.       The Beca Worley International (BWI) of New Zealand in association
with PT. Citaconas, Indonesia had been involved since 1981, using funds out of
Loan 1365-IND, to review the adequacy of PLN's transmission and distribution
program up to 1987 to match the ongoing programs of generating facilities.
BWI's final report was submitted in April 1982. It recommended
(a) development of an extensive 20 kV backbone network; particularly in Java;
and (b) a number of measures for improving the reliability of PLN's
distribution system and reducing losses. Following a review in 1981 of PLN's
progress in meeting the construction targets for the national five-year
development plan for 1979/80-1983/84 (REPELITA III), GOI authorized the
funding of an Accelerated Investment Program (AIP) amounting to some US$1.4
billion for disbursement through 1984(85, that was designed to rapidly expand
the power distribution network to meet GOI's aim of attracting industry to
rural areas and help develop comprehensive and viable rural electrification
projects. As the AIP did not provide funding for the distribution improvement
measures that were recommended in the BVI study, it was included in the
distribution component of the project. BWI was later appointed as consultant
for the implementation phase of the project, known as the Loss Reduction and
System Reliability Improvement Project that included a loss reduction and
system reliability component, a West Java transformer component, a system
control centers extension component, and a Java telecommunications trunk
system development component. Its services included assistance in
investigation and design, procurement, implementation programming, monitoring
and reporting. The distribution component was carried out by PLN's regional
or dictribution offices under the supervision of the Directorate of
Operations.



11.       The feasibility studies for three thermal power plants outside Java
were carried put by: (a) E5B International along with Colenco, in association
with PT. Citra Teknik Nasional Sejati, for the Pontianak thermal power plant;
(b) Ewbank Preece Ltd. in association with PT. Indra Karya, for the
Banjarmasin thermal power plant; and (c) Black and Veatch International in
association with PT. Encona Engineering Inc., for the Samarinda combined-cycle
power plant.
Thirteenth Power Proiect
12.       The New Japan Engineering Consultants Inc. (NEWJEC) in association
with PT. Indra Karya (Indonesia) were the consulting engineers for the Cirata
hydroelectric project, responsible for feasibility study, engineering and
detailed design, procurement, and construction supervision of the project. A
Board of Consultants (BOC) had been closely supervising the feasibility and
engineering studies since 1980. They were also employed throughout the entire
construction period. Consultants involved for studies under the energy sector
support program are mentioned in the section on project implementation
(para. 23), as appropriate.
13.       The Cirata Hydroelectric Project Office under the Directorate of
Construction carried out day to day supervision of construction activities
with the assistance of consultants.
Fourteenth Power Proiect
14.       Based on the operating experience gained with Suralaya Units 1 and 2
financed under Loans 1708-IND and 1872-IND, a number of improvements were
incorporated in the design and equipment provided for Units 3 and 4. During
the implementation stage MONENCO's site staff provided assistance to PLN's
project staff in matters relating to construction supervision, quality
control, contract administration and commissioning of Units 3 and 4.
15.       As a conditionality for the Fourteenth Power Project, in the
interest of integration of expertise and optimum use of scarce skilled human
resources then available, PLN agreed to centralize and strengthen its project
implementation, engineering, procurement and construction monitoring
activities by establishing an Engineering Services Center. The engineering
and construction supervision of the distribution component of the project was
carried out by PLN's own staff in the regional distribution offices. All
procurement was centrally carried out in PLN's head office.
Prolect Implementation
Twelfth Power Proiect (Loan 2214-IND)
16.       Units 2 and 3 of the Kamojang geothermal station were put into
comercial operation on October 5, 1987 and November 16, 1987 respectively.
They were about 14 months and 11 months behind the appraisal estimate but were
only about 2 months behind the contracted date for Unit 2 (July 31, 1987) and
half a month earlier than the contracted date for Unit 3 (November 30, 1987).
The major reason for delay was the extremely long bid evaluation and contract



-5-
discussion period (May 1983 - August 1984 for turbine-generator contract and
October 1984 - December 1985 for station services contract).
17.       The implementation of the distribution component was about 14-15
months behind the contracted dates. The major reasons for the delay were
(a) budgetary constraints in local cost financing, particularly in 1984/85 and
1985/86; (b) late delivery of materials; (c) considerable amount of materials
having been diverted to uses considered to have a higher priority; and
(d) some consumers were not ready to convert from 117/220 V system to
230/380 V system due to investment involved for their own facilities. A lack
of effective project coordination and monitoring also contributed to some
extent to such delays.
18.       Works completed under this project for Suralaya thermal power
station extension (Loan 2214-IND) were site preparation, marine works for
coal-yard reclamation and harbor improvements, pilings and ground improvement,
circulating water ducts, ash disposal works and civil works. They all
involved local currency expenditures financed by GOI/PLN. Bank-financed items
included only structural steelworks and cladding, stack, ash handling plant,
coal handling plant and station electrical equipment. The Bank also financed
the engineering services for both Units 3 and 4.
19.       The feasibility studies for the three thermal power plants outside
Java were completed. The final report for the Banjarmasin plant was issued in
April 1991. The final report for the Pontianak plant was issued in
December 1991, and that for the Samarinda plant in 1989. A resource
feasibility study for the Kamojang geothermal power station Unit 4, was
included later on under the project. The final draft report was submitted by
GENZL in December 1991.
20.       Mini-Hydro Development in North Sumatra.  Eight mini-hydro power
plants were designed and constructed under the supervision of BWI as detailed
in Annex 1. This is a pilot mini-hydro project in Indonesia, using two
standard sizes of 750 kW and 200 kW respectively. They are all located within
4 km off existing roads and less than 20 km from the population centers. They
will be connected to the nearby distribution systems by 20 kV lines to form
the backbone for the rural electrification development in the future. In
spite of the relatively high initial investment at an overall average cost of
US$2,173/kW, economic analysis indicated that hydropower is still less
expensive than the diesel alternative at a discount rate up to 12.8 percent
for Raison 2, and 17.8 percent for Silang. In addition, a local system
supplied by a mini-hydro power station in combination with the existing diesel
units can be operated more economically by fully taking advantage of hydro
output during wet seasons to save fuel, but using diesel generation to take
the base load during dry seasons.
21.       Manpower Development and Training.  The Personnel Management and
Training Program was successfully carried out with the assistance of
consultants (Pacific Engineering Constructors, Ltd-PECL, and PT. Indra Karya).
The personnel management component of the program focused on the preparation
of standardized job descriptions and job titles, development of human resource
information and manpower planning systems, employee performance evaluation and
ranking, and development of curricula for supervisory and vocational training.



-6-
For the training component of the program, a Professional Training Program was
designed to provide individtualized training to specially selected PLN staff in
order to prepare them to fill specific positions in various functional areas.
Under the Professional Training Program, 50 middle-level staff were trained in
USA, totalling about 600 staff months. These staff were placed in positions
commensurate with their respective training fields and are now forming the
backbone of PLN's middle-level managers in the areas of planning, operation
and maintenance, distribution, finance, accounting and management. Four
existing training centers were equipped with new training facilities and two
new training centers were established at Semarang and Suralaya. In 1990/91,
9,455 staff received domestic training of various durations in different
fields; in addition, 123 staff received overseas training 1/ of which 59
were for generation, 31 for transmission, 22 for distribution and 11 for
administration and management.
Thirteenth Power Proiect (Loan 2300-IND)
22.       The completion of civil works for the Cirata hydroelectric project
was about three months behind the appraisal estimate, but was one month ahead
of the contracted date. The commercial operation of Unit 1 was on May 25,
1988, about seven months behind the appraisal estimate and one month behind
the contracted date (May 1, 1988). Units 2, 3 and 4, were commissioned on
February 29, 1988, September 30, 1988 and August 10, 1988 respectively, about
four months, five months, and 3.5 months behind the appraisal estimate but
were about two months, one day, and two months earlier than the contracted
dates respectively (May 1, 1988 for Unit 2 and October 1, 1988 for Units
3 and 4). The delay was due to the late award of contracts, which was about
six months for civil works and 12 months for turbines and generators.
23.       Energy Sector Support Program.  This program included the following
major components:
(a) Feasibility study of Central Java Steam Power Plant. This study was
carried out by Shawinigan Integ-Sargent & Lundy/PT. Citaconas. The
first phase of the investigation work for the three candidate sites
was completed in February 1988 and a site (Tanjung Jati) was
selected. The second phase of investigation work indicated that the
site is adequate to accommodate' eight units of 600 MW each with a
total capacity of 4,800 MW. An environmental impact assessment was
completed at end 1988 and a final report in October 1989. This
would be a candidate project for Bank and/or private sector
financing in the future.
(b) Feasibility Studies for Seven Hvdro Sites. These studies were
carried out by three groups of consultants:
(i) Electroconsult, Motor Columbus, PT. Arkonin and PT. Asianenco
for the Isal 2 and Ira Lalaro hydro power projects on Maluku
and East Timor with a proposed capacity of 3 x 20 MW and
3 x 9 MW respectively;
1/   Financed by different sources of funds.



-7-
(ii) PT Yodia Karya and Coyne et Bellier Group for the Cimandiri 3
and Palu 3 hydro power projects on Java and Sulawesi with a
proposed capacity of 2 x 176 MW and 4 x 19 MW respectively; and
(iii)  PT Wiratman and Associates and C.T. Main International Inc. for
the Merangin 2, Kataun 1 and Kusan 3 hydro power projects on
Sumatra and Kalimantan with a proposed capacity of 338.5 MW,
84.0 MW and 67.7 MW respectively.
The feasibility reports of these projects were completed by August 1990.
It appeared that most of the projects would be too large in terms of
installed capacity and estimated energy production versus the forecasted
power market requirements in the 1990s. Staging of the project to tailor
the project to market needs would be needed. The Cimandiri 3 project,
which is located on the Cimandiri River in West Java, would be connected
to the Java integrated system. All of these projects are currently
included in PLN's power development program for commissioning after 1999.
(c) Engineering Design for Salak Geothermal Station. A reservoir
assessment study was completed by Electro-Consult, who was later
appointed to carry out the engineering and design of the project.
Construction has been started using bilateral aid from Italy.
(d) Feasibility Study for Transmission and Distribution Schemes. The
feasibility study for transmission and distribution schemes outside
Java was carried out by Beca Worley International and PT. Citaconas.
A final report was completed in June 1989. Some of the recommended
projects were selected by the Asian Development Bank for financing.
(e)  Management Information System.  Two parallel activities were carried
out under this component with the assistance of consultants (PT.
Binaman Utama, assisted by PA Consultants of UK). One related to an
overall Management Information System (MIS), and the other also
called MIS for Immediate Improvement (MISIP). The MISIP generates a
collection of reports on key operational and financial results, and
performance indicators. This report is issued monthly for use of
PLN's senior management. For the overall MIS, outline designs were
completed for forty subsystems, structure analysis for two
subsystems (consumer administration and service) and structure
design of the consumer administration subsystem.. The consultant,
whose assignment terminated in July 1989, prepared a completion
report including suggestions for organizing future work on system
development. A steering committee and working groups have been set
up for further developing the various subsystems.
Fourteenth Power Prolect (Loan 2443-IND)
24.       Suralaya Units 3 and 4 were originally scheduled for commercial
operation by June 1988 and April 1989 respectively, as per the staff appraisal
report of the Fourteenth Power Project. As a result of delays in awarding
contracts (8 months for boilers and 19 months for turbine generators and
station electrical equipment), the full commercial loading dates for Units 3
and 4 were revised to February 1989 and November 1989 at contract signing.



-8-
Actual full commercial loading of these two units were achieved on February 6,
1989 and October 17, 1989 respectively, about 8 months and 6.5 months behind
the appraisal estimate. They were, however, on or even ahead of the
contracted dates. The distribution component was about 12 months behind the
contracted date of completion.
Proiect Results
Twelfth Power Proiect (Loan 2214-IND)
25.       The project substantially achieved its main objectives through the
successful completion of 2 x 55 MW units at the Kamojang geothermal power
station and substantial reduction in system losses of PLN's distribution
networks in five regions. The energy generation from the Kamojang project was
879 GWh in 1990/91 with a capacity factor of about 91 percent. The unit-wise
details are given in Part III. The only operating problem facing these two
units is the silicon deposits on turbine blades which require periodic
cleaning. The Loss Reduction and System Reliability Improvement Program was
carried out successfully. The related activities financed under the Bank loan
(2214-IND), coupled with other efforts carried out by PLN including those with
assistance from other lending agencies, helped reduce PLN's overall
transmission and distribution losses from 20.8 percent in 1983/84 to
15.6 percent in 1990/91, as follows:
Fiscal Year           1983/84 1984/85 1985/86 1986/87 1987/88 1988/89 1989190 1990/91
Transmission and
distribution losses (X)  20.8   20.6   19.8   19.7'   18.7   16.9   15.8   15.6
26.       The estimated cost of the project at appraisal was US$1,189.6
million.  The final cost was about US$689.4 million as shown in Part III.  The
decrease in total cost of about US$500.2 million was mainly due to:
(a) savings from the Kamojang geothermal project at about US$46.7 million;
(b) turbine-generator for Unit 3 was financed under the Fourteenth Power
Project instead resulting in a savings of about US$62.0 million from the
project cost; and (c) scope of work for the distribution component was reduced
considerably and the Accelerated Investment Program for distribution was not
fully carried out (and completion of some power generation projects was
postponed), because of the stringent economic situation in Indonesia over the
project period. While financing under the Bank loan for the distribution
component increased from US$115.7 million to US$120.5 million, ADB financing
for four projects reduced from US$95.5 million to US$86.0 million, Export
Credits reduced from the original plan of US$245.0 million to US$158.8 million
(including US$81.2 million equivalent from the Export-Import Bank of Japan for
local cost financing) and local funds from GOI/PLN reduced from US$266.1
million to only US$18.4 million.
27.       The estimated disbursements at appraisal and actual disbursements
are given in Part III. The original loan closing date was December 31, 1988.
The revised closing date was June 30, 1991, after two extensions.
USS7,500,000 was canceled from the loan, effective December 22, 1989. An
undisbursed amount of US$13,865,713.25 was canceled on November 22, 1991.
Total loan amount disbursed was US$278,634,286.75.

28.       The economic reevaluation for the project was carried out as
follows: (a) the internal economic rate of return (IERR) was calculated on a
10-year time slice of PLN's power development program basis (1982/83 -
1991/92), the same method as used in the SAR; (b) using PLN's actual data for
investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, fuel costs and annual
energy sales, and (c) revenue based on the prevailing average tariff was used
as benefit. On this basis, the ex-post IERR of PLN's development program for
1982/83-1991/92 is about 3 percent (see Annex 2 for details), compared with
the appraisal estimate of 11.6 percent. The calculation made in the SAR
assumed a much higher tariff level for calculating the benefit. Instead of
using the prevailing average tariff as a proxy for economic benefits, it had
been assumed that tariffs would be increased in three annual steps to the
level of long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of eclectricity supply by 1985/86
(USt12.5 per kWh in 1981/82 prices). A sensitivity analysis was made that if
the prevailing average tariff in 1982/83 were used and assumed to be
maintained in real terms over the 20-year period 2/, the ex-post IERR of the
project would increase to about 17 percent.
Thirteenth Power Proiect (Loan 2300-IND)
29.       The project objectives of developing hydro potential by the
installation of 4 x 125 MW units at Cirata hydropower station and supporting
GOI's energy policy of diversification away from oil have been realized. The
energy generation at Cirata in 1990/91 was 1,177 GWh as compared with the
expected long-term average of 1,426 GWh/year. 1990/91 was apparently a dry
hydro year. The availability factor of the plant was as high as 92 percent in
1990/91 and plant factor of about 26.9 percent. It is operated as a peaking
plant to provide needed generating capacity to the system during peak hours.
The dam is being inspected periodically as required. The project is
functioning satisfactorily in all respects.
30.       The total project cost including the energy sector support program
was US$609.2 million compared with the appraisal estimate of US$625.7 million,
a decrease of about 3 percent. A considerable amount of the physical
contingency provision was spent for the civil works stemming from additional
works to cope with unforeseen adverse geological conditions and measures to
meet with the targeted date of completion.
31.       The revised loan closing date was December 31, 1990, after extension
for a year. US$6,000,000 was canceled from the loan on July 6, 1990. An
undisbursed balance of US$2,674,871.42 was cancelled on May 8, 1991. Total
disbursement of the loan was US$270,325,128.58.
32.       Based on PLN's prevailing average tariffs adjusted upwards by
33 percent to account for the composite revenue for peaking operation, the ex-
post IERR for the Cirata Hydroelectric Project is 9 percent, as shown in Annex
3. If the tariffs adopted in the SAR were used (US¢7.7/kWh for 1988/89 and
US¢9.68/kWh for 1989/90 and thereafter), the IERR would be about 14 percent,
the same as the appraisal estimate.

33.       Resettlement.  The resettlement component was based on the
experience with the Saguling hydroelectric project financed under Loan 1950-
IND, and was carefully planned. It was implemented on schedule, and in
accordance with a plan agreed between the GOI and the Bank at the time of
project appraisal. All families who lost land or property were given fair
compensation in cash, based on procedures agreed with the Bank. The owners of
private land were compensated based on market value of the land, and the users
of state forest lands were compensated through purchase and transfer of
equivalent acreage of forest land in other locations. Prior to inundation,
the submerged land was used for rice cultivation (30 percent), rubber and
other plantations (38 percent), teak forests and other wood lands
(13 percent), and agriculture and gardens (19Z).
34.       In addition to compensation for the loss of land and other property,
the Cirata project also necessitated the resettlement, as of August 31, 1989,
of 8,469 families from the reservoir area and 2,593 families from above the
reservoir area. A comparison of the planned resettlement program and the
actual number of families compensated, resettled and trained is given in Annex
4. About 34 percent of the affected families were resettled through the
Transmigration, and Nucleus Estate and Smallholder (NES) programs. Those who
elected to remain in the area, were assisted through training in aquaculture
and industrial skills. Both of these training programs were reserved for
members of households who had not received any other form of compensation.
The aquaculture program, which was modelled on a similar program developed for
the Saguling Hydroelectric Project, was particularly successful. At project
completion (end-1990), about 575 families had been trained and employed in
fish farming and related activities. During 1991, the fish production from
the floating-net aquaculture in the Cirata reservoir averaged about 200 tons
per month.
35.       To monitor the effects of the Cirata project in the villages
surrounding the reservoir, the project included follow-up surveys that were
carried out at one-year intervals for the three years (the last one in 19)
following the impoundment of the reservoir. Among the positive impacts of the
project, the surveys identified electrification and improved roads. Among the
negative impacts, the surveys noted the increased population density in the
host villages, leading to reductions in average size of landholding, working
hours per person, income and nutrition levels. The authors of the surveys
concluded that these impacts should be regarded as transitional, given the
timing of the surveys shortly after the resettlement.
Fourteenth Power Proiect (Loan 2443-IND)
36.       The objective of the Fourteenth Power Project by adding 2 x 400 MW
coal-fired units at the existing Suralaya thermal power station for
diversification of energy resources have been met. The energy generation for
Units 3 and 4 in 1990/91 was 2,510 GWh and 2,362 GWh, with a capacity factor
of 71.4 percent and 67.4 percent respectively. The lower capacity factor for
Unit 4 was due to scheduled maintenance work in July 1990. Given the teething
troubles that are associated with any new generating unit, this record of
performance is highly commendable. The initial operating problem facing Units
3 and 4 was the piping for the secondary superheater of the boilers. It was



- 11 -
investigated and rectified by the manufacturer. The performance test results
of major plant equipment were as follows:

37.       The total project cost, including that for the distribution and
other components, was US$596.3 million compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$656.7 million, a decrease of about 10 percent. The project cost table in
Part III gives a comparison for different components of the project, including
contingencies. The loan closing date was extended by one year from September
30, 1990 to September 30, 1991. An undisbursed amount of US$4,889,943.62 was
cancelled effective February 18, 1992.
38.       The Engineering Services Center was established in May 1985, where
activities such as project formulation, engineering, design, procurement and
construction monitoring were unified. Technical assistance under the next
Bank operation for PLN helped in developing the center.
39.       The ex-post IERR for Suralaya units 3 and 4 is estimated at about
15 percent by using the actual prevailing average tariffs, PLN's actual
operating and maintenance costs and by following the criteria used in the SAR
for generation, sales and fuel costs (see Annex 5 for details). This is lower
than the IERR of 28 percent estimated at appraisal. However, if the same
average tariff level of USt9.8 per kWh in constant 1983/84 prices used in SAR
was also assumed for the ex-post evaluation, then the IERR would be as high as
38 percent.
40.       Environmental Monitorin .  The ambient air quality monitoring
carried out by PLN in the plant area includes the following: (a) one
continuous monitoring station for SO2 and NO.; (b) nine portable monitoring
stations for SO2, NO. and total suspended particulate (TSP); and (c) four high
volume sampler stations for TSP. The maximum observed 24 hour ground level
concentrations are summarized in Annex 6. All measurements were below the
standard limits of 500 pg/m3 for SO, and TSP. Besides, further investigation
indicated that the high concentration at the Salira station was apparently due
to fugitive dust coming from traffic activities (only 40 m away from a
highway). The stack emission standard limits established by the US
Environmental Protection Agency have been mainly controlled by the use of high



- 12 -
efficiency electrostatic precipitators for TSP and low sulfur coal for SO2,
combined with a stack height of 250 meters each.
Financial Performance
41.       A comparison of the appraisal projections under the Fourteenth Power
Project (Loan 2443-IND) 3/ and the actual financial results for 1984/85 -
1989/90 is sumarized in Annex 7, Table 1; detailed comparative financial
statements are given in Annex 7, Tables 2 to 4. PLN's actual financial
performance for 1990/91 and the estimate for 1991/92, and related income
statements for its Java and outside Java operations are provided in Annex 8,
Tables I to 5.
42.       Under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND), a self-financing
ratio (SFR) covenant was adopted for the first time, with the objective of
financing out of internal cash generation, a reasonable proportion of PLN's
investment program. The agreed SFR was 30 percent by 1985/86, with interim
targets for the intervening years. The SFR interim targets were revised in
1979 and 1980, and subsequently in 1982 under the Twelfth Power Project (Loan
2214-IND), to take into account significant changes in PLN's capital
expenditures and fuel costs. The SFR target for 1985/86 and onwards was
reduced to 20 percent at the same time to adjust the minimum indicative
targets inversely with any significant changes in PLN's capital expenditures
and fuel costs. Similar SFR targets were adopted under the Thirteenth Power
Project (Loan 2300-IND). While PLN was able to meet the revised interim SFR
targets of 10 percent until 1984/85, the rate of return on assets remained
negative.
43.       The necessity to build in adjustments to modify the SFR targets and
the fact that PLN was able to meet the SFR covenant while its operations had
been incurring losses indicated that the SFR type of measure with the
covenanted levels was less than appropriate from the view point of financial
viability. Under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND, 1984), GOI/PLN
agreed to a covenant requiring annual rates of return (ROR) of at least
8 percent on average net revalued assets from 1986/87 onwards, with a minimum
target of 6 percent in 1985/86. The SFR was retained as one of the
performance indicators to be monitored regularly to ensure PLN's self-
financing capability. However, PLN fell short of both the SFR and ROR targets
for 1985/86. In 1986, it became increasingly apparent that PLN will be unable
to satisfy the requirements of the ROR covenant adopted under Loan 2443-IND.
The Government, PLN and the Bank then concluded that an ROR covenant for PLN's
operations as a whole was inappropriate in view of the largely socially-
oriented and fragmented nature of PLN's operations outside Java, and the
revenue covenant was modified. Under the modified revenue covenant, PLN was
3/   Only the appraisal projections for the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan
2443-IND) have been used in this completion report for purposes of
comparison with actual performance, as the appraisal of that project was
carried out within eighteen months of those for the Twelfth and
Thirteenth Power Projects (Loans 2214-IND and 2300-IND), and since for
the three projects the financial projections and the period covered by
them were substantially the same.

required to achieve annual RORs of not less than 8 percent by no later than
1988/89 for its operations in Java, and a financial break-even situation for
its operations outside Java by no later than 1990/91 (revised to 1993/94 under
the Power Transmission Project-Loan 3349-IND). Projections showed that PLN
would be able to achieve a self-financing level of 25-30 percent with these
covenants. However, the Government did not permit the corresponding tariff
adjustment in 1987/89, even though during this period PLN's operating cots
were substantially impacted by a large devaluation of the Indonesian currency
in September 1986, increases in the proportion of oil-based generation due to
drought, and inflation. The Government increased electricity tariff by about
25 percent effective April 1, 1989 and again by 20 percent from August 1,
1991. As a result, PLN's financial performance has been satisfactory.
44.       Under the Sixth Power Project (Loan 1365-IND), two covenants were
introduced to ensure PLN's continued prudent debt management: (a) minimum
future debt service coverage of 1.3 times; and (b) a debt/equity ratio of
60/40. These covenants were continued until the Thirteenth Power Project
(Loan 2300-IND) which adopted only one debt management covenant which required
a minimum of 1.5 times coverage of future debt service each year out of the
forecast internal funds for that year; this requirement replaced all earlier
debt limitation covenants. This change reflected the growth of PLN, and at
the same time, made allowance for the added future earning power. PLN has
been complying with this covenant, except in 1987/88 and 1988/89 when the debt
coverage had declined to 1.1 times and 0.9 times respectively.
45.       PLN's collection performance has been generally satisfactory.  The
accounts receivable position of customers other than government users has been
kept at less than one and one-half months of the yearly billing. The overdues
from Government users, which account for about 10 percent of PLN's sales, have
also been brought down to less than two months of annual billing, as
covenanted under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND); they currently
remain so since end of FY1986/87.
46.       PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
Government auditors. The audit reports are acceptable to the Bank, but have
been subject of long delays and have received qualified opinions from the
auditors, most recently with respect to inventory accounts. PLN has made
substantial improvements in the areas commented upon by the auditors. As a
result, in the reports for 1989/90 and 1990/91 there were no qualifications.
During the past several years, PLN has also made significant improvements in
its procedures for the closing of accounts, and has succeeded in completing
them usually within six months after the close of the fiscal year. The audit
submission covenant under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND)
required PLN to submit to the Bank its unaudited accounts no later than six
months, and audited financial statements and the report of such audit no later
than nine months after the close of the fiscal year. While the unaudited
accounts have generally been received in time, there have been delays in the
auditing of accounts. Remedial action is being taken; the audited accounts
for 1990/91 were received in time.
47.       While PLN's financial performance is currently satisfactory, there
is need to provide financial stability to its operations. Towards this end,
there is need to institutionalize the process of adjustment of electricity



- 14 -
tariff by designing and implementing a mechanism that would permit periodic
and formula-based adjustment of electricity price to account for changes in
the cost of fuel, inflation and exchange rate variations. Also, in view of
the large and rapidly growing investment requirements of the sector, there is
need to develop a strategy for the long-term financing requirements of PLN,
including defining the targets for PLN's self-financing, government
contribution and borrowing. There is also a need to develop a strategy for
promoting PLN's access to domestic capital markets for borrowing, and
eventually, for equity participation.
Proiect Sustainability
48.       The growth of PLN's electricity sales has been averaging about
17 percent a year over the past three years (1988/89-1990/91), it is expected
that the electricity sales will continue to grow on average about 13 percent
per annum into the 1990o. The expansion of the Kamojang geothermal power
station, the completion of the Cirata hydroelectric project and the Suralaya
Units 3 and 4 were very timely to provide the system with needed capacity and
electricity energy. These projects not only formed a part of the least-cost
development program for PLN, but also met the objectives of GOI's energy
policy by making optimum utilization of Indonesia's indigenous energy
resources of geothermal, hydro potential and coal. A 500 kV extra high
transmission network from Suralaya to Jakarta, Bandung and Ungaran (Central
Java) has already been constructed under Loan 1872-IND and its extension to
Surabaya in East Java under a German Credit (KfW) has also been completed.
The output of Units 1 to 4 of the Suralaya plant is being fully utilized, and
accounts for over 35 percent of the electricity produced in Java. PLN has
adequately trained staff and competent management to operate efficiently the
facilities constructed under the projects. Also, PLN's financial position is
satisfactory and is expected to remain so, which would enable it to meet its
financial obligations.
49.       The geothermal reservoir at Kamojang may sustain another 55 MW of
power generation. In due course, this site should be further developed. A
delineation drilling program is still needed to confirm the proven field
reserves and investigate the productivity of the wider environs of the
Kamojang geothermal field. During the construction of the Cirata
hydroelectric project, provision has already been made for the second stage
development at Cirata by adding another four units of 125 MW each. All the
civil works for the intake structure and underground powerhouse have been
completed. A Cirata Phase II project is under preparation for possible Bank
financing. The Bank is currently processing a project to finance Units 5, 6
and 7 at Suralaya. There is no problem of coal supply, as sufficient
quantities of indigenous coal are expected to be available to sustain such
development. This fully demonstrates the sustainability of the project
benefits over the economic life of the plants.
Bank Performance
50.       Maior Strenzths and Weaknesses.  The performance of the Bank from
the project preparation through project completion was satisfactory. The Bank
maintained good relations with PLN throughout the execution of the projects
and fostered an environment conducive to increased Bank involvement with PLN.



- 15 -
To date the Bank has assisted PLN in implementing a total of 20 projects with
a total assistance of about US$3.6 billion. Through these projects and the
concomitant technical assistance programs, the Bank has helped strengthen the
institutional capabilities of PLN in many areas of utilities operation and
management, as well as its financial position. However, the only common
shortcoming in all of the related projects lies in the Bank being unable to
prevent the initial delays in the award of major contracts. In spite of
constant reminders and prodding, these delays still could not be avoided.
While some improvement has been achieved in subsequent operations, there is
need for PLN to reduce the procurement time cycle further, particularly for
the bid evaluation phase.
51.       The Bank has continued to address a number of issues of broader
sectoral concern, the major among them are:
(a) adoption of efficiency prices as a basis for the determination of
domestic prices of petroleum products, so as to help achieve, inter
alia, the objective of energy resource diversification;
(b) reform of the regulatory framework to promote efficiency by
increasing the financial and managerial autonomy and accountability
of the state enterprises in the sector;
(c) enhancement of the private sector's contribution; and
(d) strengthening of the regulatory framework for establishing,
monitoring and enforcing appropriate environmental standards in the
sector.
52.       To meet these targets and to address other important constraints in
the power subsector, the Bank is pursuing the following principal actions
through its operational work:
(a) maintaining and improving PLN's financial performance through timely
and adequate tariff adjustments;
(b) institutionalizing the process of electricity price adjustment, by
introducing formula-based periodic tariff adjustments to account for
changes in PLN's input costs resulting from inflation, fuel cost
changes and exchange rate variations;
(c) delegation and decentralization of authority, and greater
accountability of divisional and regional managers in PLN to achieve
higher efficiency, leading to possible corporatization;
(d) developing a strategy for the financing of the power investment
program, by defining the targets for PLN's self-financing,
government equity contribution, PLN's borrowing (including access to
domestic capital markets), and the role of private investors; and
(e) improving the efficiency of PLN through changes in its internal
procurement procedures that would optimize the procurement cycle for
major projects.

53.       Lessons Learned.
(a) The Cirata hydroelectric project was well-designed and well
constructed. The project benefited from good project management by
the consulting engineer, with sound advice from a very competent
Board of Consultants whose use from feasibility study stage to
engineering and design and throughout construction was fully
justified (Loan 2300-IND);
(b) The high standard of the operating performance of Suralaya Units 1,
2, 3 and 4 confirms that good engineering design, a multiple
contracts strategy for equipment specification, good quality control
and competent management by the consulting engineer and the owner of
construction, and operation and maintenance of the plant play an
important role in achieving satisfactory project implementation and
operation of thermal power plants (Loans 2214-IND and 2443-IND);
(c) Technical assistance for manpower development and training that was
well designed, has enhanced PLN's capability in utility management,
in-house engineering, and construction and operation of large power
plants, and has prepared a number of its staff to become the
backbone of PLN's middle-level management. PLN has effectively
utilized such capability in implementing subsequent operations
(general);
(d) The "piggy-backing" under Bank-financed projects, of feasibility
studies and engineering design of future projects out of PLN's long-
range development programs has ensured timely project preparation
and enabled PLN to maintain a constant pipeline of projects for
financing by the Bank and other lending agencies (general);
(e) While project implementation and the Bank's monitoring should start
immediately after loan negotiations, to avoid implementation delays
suitable procedures need to be developed that would enable PLN to
undertake advance procurement actions and complete contract award
and signing in an expeditious manner (general);
(f) Institutional reforms within PLN and the regulatory framework need
to be implemented that would improve decision-making and
accountability within PLN, and transform PLN into a more autonomous
entity by reducing centralized control and administrative
intervention in PLN's operations, particularly in matters of
procurement and electricity tariff adjustment (general).
Borrower Performance
54.       The performance of PLN was generally commendable and met most of the
expectations of the appraisal report. All the major components of the three
projects, such as the expansion of Kamojang geothermal plant, the Cirata
hydroelectric project, and the Suralaya Units 3 and 4, were all well designed
and implemented. They met the international standard of any projects of these
kinds.



- 17 -
55.       After the initial delays (primarily due to protracted bid
evaluations and contract discussions), project implementation by PLN has been
generally satisfactory. The original schedules were revised to account for
the project slippage before contract signing. In most cases, PLN was able to
maintain the revised schedule and put the generating units into commercial
operation, sometimes even ahead of schedule. Staff deployment and the use of
consultant resources vere done prudently to the best advantage of project
implementation. The quality control during construction was also satisfactory
as evidenced by the smooth manner in which the units were brought on line and
placed into commercial operation. The Construction Directorate of PLN and the
project offices have developed a good level of in-house expertise in
supervising power plant construction and installation. A procurement
efficiency program is currently being worked out between PLN and the Bank in
order to reduce the procurement cycle from the current 18 months to about 11
months. To achieve economy in the purchase of coal for future coal-fired
generating units, the Bank has initiated a dialogue with PLN to procure coal
on competitive basis instead of allocating contracts to selected coal
suppliers.
56.       As for the distribution components, the extension of distribution
networks in Jabotabek, East Java and Central Java under Loan 2443-IND was
about 12 months behind the contracted date of completion. The Loss Reduction
Program under Loan 2214-IND was delayed for more than 14-15 months for
Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 materials. The reasons of delays are discussed
in para. 17. As a result of concerted efforts and substantial investments
made by PLN (financed by different sources of funds) to improve the
distribution systems, distribution losses have been reduced for five regions
involved under Loan 2214-IND (see Part III, Project Results), with the
exception of the Jakarta area which still had a loss of about 17 percent in
1990/91.  The main reason for such a high loss is the illegal use of
electricity.  PLN is making specific efforts such as physical inspection and
legal action against violators, to reduce this kind of losses as much as
possible.
57.       PLN had an active involvement in the formulation of the various
technical assistance components included in the three projects, and in the
selection of consultants and the supervision of their work.
Project Relationship
58.       Bank-Borrower relationship on the three projects was not only one of
mutual trust and faith, but also was highly complementary in all aspects of
project implementation. Constraints and bottlenecks were removed efficiently
and expeditiously without negative impacts on the Bank-Borrower relationship.
59.       Bank's relationship with the GOI, other national agencies and
participating institutions has also been very cordial. Bank has had no
problem gaining access to the highest level of government authorities for
policy dialogues and rendering professional advice.



- 18 -
Consulting Services
60.       All consultants for the three projects were employed under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank and their work on these projects have been
generally satisfactory. The Bank was very actively involved in reviewing
design documents and their work progress, making appropriate professional
recommendations as required, to ensure a quality product. The performance of
the consultants has been highly professional and in the beat interest of PLN,
throughout the implementation of these projects.
61.       The project completion report prepared by the consultants for the
Cirata hydroelectric project, was highly professional and comprehensive. No
final project completion report has been prepared by the consultants for
Suralaya Units 3 and 4.
Proiect Documentation and Data
62.       The legal agreements for the three projects were quite appropriate
for achieving the project objectives and adequately reflected the Bank's
interest for the satisfactory execution of the projects. The staff appraisal
reports were comprehensive, well prepared and provided a useful framework for
the Bank and PLN during the project implementation. PLN regularly submitted
quarterly progress reports for each ongoing project. They served as a
valuable tool for project supervision and monitoring. It is highly
recommended that all the financial tables include not only expenditures
relating to the Bank loan, but also for other foreign financing sources and
local expenditures financed by PLN/GOI, specially for project components not
managed by PLN's project offices.
63.       PLN is currently organizing a management information system in which
the data base for project cost and accounting will be integrated to serve as a
useful tool for project management and monitoring in the future.
64.       The Analysis and Evaluation Division of PLN's Planning Department
contributed substantially to the preparation of this PCR. It is recommended
that this unit be strengthened by providing more staff and by upgrading the
existing staff with specific training, including overseas as appropriate, so
that it can play a more substantive role in project monitoring and evaluation
in the future.

Part II. Proiect Review From Borrower's Perspective 1/
Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III:
1.   Annex 1   :    The name of the plant must be revised as follows:
Raison II become Raisan II.
Sibudong become Sibundong.
Comments on the Analysis in Part I:
2.   Para. 15  :    PLN's own staff in the regional distribution offices
carried out the engineering and construction supervision.
3.   Para. 17  :    The last statement must be corrected as below:
The lack of an effective project coordination and
monitoring have also contributed to some extent to such
delays.
4.   Para. 23
23.b.ii.        The statement must be corrected as below:
P.T. Yodia Karya and Coyne at Bellier Group for the
Cimandiri 3 and Palu 3 hydro power projects on Java and
Sulawesi with a proposed capacity of 2 x 176 MW and
4 x 19 MW respectively; and
23.b.iii.       The statement must be corrected as below:
P.T. Wiratman and Associates and C.T. Main 'International
Inc. for the Merangin 2, Kataun 1 and Kusan 3 hydro power
projects on Sumatra and Kalimantan with a proposed
capacity of 338.5 MW, 84.9 MW and 67.7 MW respectively.
5.   Para. 25  :    PLN's overall transmission and distribution losses
reduction from 20.8 percent in 1983/84 to 15.6 percent in
1990/91 was caused by many programs; not only as a result
of LRP project. The transmission and distribution losses
in 1986/87 and 1989/90 were 19.7 Percent and 15.8 percent.
j/   Text supplied by PLN.  With respect to comments in paras. 1 to 8,
necessary factual corrections have been made in Parts I and III.



- 20 -
6.   Para. 34  :   During 1991, the average fish production from the floating
net aquaculture in the Cirata reservoire was 200 tons.
7.   Para. 36  :    It is not clear what is meant by the sentence of:
"The performance test results of major plant equipment
were as follows:" at the end of this paragraph.
8.   Para. 48  :   The output of unit 1 to 4 of the Suralaya plant have not
been being fully utilized to serve the demand in Java,
because of there are still constraints in 500 kV interbus
substation in Bekasi, Gandul & Krian, as well as in 500 kV
single circuit transmission line. These problems are
being carried out by PLN through projects financed by
IBRD, ADB & KFW.
Evaluation of the Bank's Performance:
9.        Bank performance was generally satisfactory and has been effective
in helping the process of project implementation. However, it is considered
that PLN still requires Bank advice to improve the process in certain areas
for decreasing project implementation delays.
10.       The new version of PCR whereby the report is prepared by both Bank
and PLN is considered tb be better than previous one. However, PLN highly
recommend that a separate PCR is prepared for each loan.
Evaluation of the Borrower's own Performance:
11.       PLN has made many effort in the process of project implementation,
from project appraisal to project completion, but still need to be improved;
especially in the area of Proiect Database which includes target, schedule and
finance for supplying accurate information timely.
12.       PLN developed the organization to implement projects as a response
to increasing volume and complexity of projects. However, it is realized that
PLN has to improve continuously the internal coordination in PLN for
controlling the on going projects and to expect the external interventions in
PLN's operation be reduced.

(1) Suralaya Units 3 and 4 were about 8 months and 6.5 months behind the
appraisal estimate due to delay in issuance of bidding documents and the
requirement to retender the turbine generator. The revised dates were
however met or about 20 days ahead of the contracted dates respectively.
(2) Technical assistance for the construction supervision of transmission
lines and substations that are financed under the Power Transmission and
Distribution Project (Loan 2778-IND), was financed partly by Loan 2443-IND
(up to 9/30/91).
(3) Out of 4 hydro projects proposed in the SAR, only Besai hydro project was
selected for engineering design.

Comments:
1. The lower rates of return are due primarily to the increases in tariffs not
being sufficient to maintain the levels in real terms.
2. If the prevailing average tariffs in 1982/83 and 1983/84 at the time of
appraisal were used and assumed to be maintained in real terms over the life
of the project, the ex-post IERR would be 17 percent, 14 percent and
38 percent respectively for the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Power
Projects.
