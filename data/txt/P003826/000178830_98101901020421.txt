I. THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY SECTORS
A. Economic Background
1.01       Indonesia is endowed with abundant energy resources and has large,
as yet undeveloped, reserves of natural gas, coal, geothermal energy and
hydroelectric power, but the availability of indigenous oil and subsidized
domestic prices caused it to develop a primarily petroleum-based energy
sector. Seventy eight percent of the total commercial energy consumption
now derives from petroleum (Annex 1). Currently oil and liquified natural
gas (LNG) exports generate 70% of government-s revenues and finance almost
all of its non-oil imports. Domestic oil consumption has been growing at
12% per year. If this trend continues Indonesia could become a net importer
of oil in the mid-1990's with devastating effects on its economy. To avoid
this, Government's energy policy, developed in 1978, has been to accelerate
oil exploration and development, encourage conservation measures, including
adjustment of domestic prices of petroleum products and development of
appropriate norr-oil sources. The following paragraphs explain the progress
in implementing this policy since 1978.
B. Energy Resources and Status of Development
Oil
1.02       The proven oil reserves are reported to be 9.5 billion barrels,
amounting to 16 years production at the annual production rate of about
575 million barrels during 1981-82. Currently it is about 20% below that
level. Exploration of much of Indonesia is still at an early stage. During
1975-77, after a period of rapid increases in oil exploration, there was
little activity as a result of uncertainty following GOIs moves to
renegotiate terms of production-sharing contracts. An active program of
exploration and development is now being carried out after resolution of this
problem in 1978. Investment in oil exploration and development last year
was expected to reach $3.8 billion. Undiscovered reserves are estimated
between 10 billion and 40 billion barrels. There have not been any major
discoveries in recent years. Unless further massive reserves are discovered,
it is considered unlikely that annual production will increase beyond 700
million barrels.
Natural Gas
1.03       Reserves of natural gas are estimated at some 69 trillion cubic
feet (TCF), almost equivalent to the proven level of oil reserves. The bulk
(85%) of this gas is non-associated and can be developed independently of the
level of oil production. However, the reserves are generally located far
away from major population and industrial centres. Arun field in North
Sumatra contains 17 TCF and the recently discovered Natuma field in the South
China sea contains 35 TCF.



- 2-
1.04      The largest increases in non-oil development have been in the
natural gas sector, due both to the shorter lead times and the domestic need
for gas as feedstock for fertilizer plants and for reduction in steel plants.
Production of natural gas during 1979 was equivalent to one-third of the
country's oil production. Nearly half of that production was exported as LNG
to Japan from liquefaction centers at Arun and Badak. An integrated pipeline
system - some 450 km long in South Sumatra and 420 km long in West Java is now
in operation.  Domestic consumption of natural gas is expected to increase at
about 15% per year during the next few years.  LNG production is expected to
reach 15 million tons per year by 1985 and 28 million tons by 1990.
1.05      About 30% of the natural gas associated with oil production is
currently flared much of it associated with small oil production scattered
all over the country.  The constraints on increased use of natural gas
resources within Indonesia are pricing, and institutional/contracting
arrangements. The price paid to private producers has been too low to provide
sufficient incentives for them to produce and deliver non-associated gas for
domestic users or to conserve associated gas by reinjection. To accelerate
the gas development program the Government is considering setting the price
paid to consumer at $3.0 per million BTU which could double the availability
of gas in West Java during the next 2-3 years to the equivalent of 50,000
barrels of oil per day. Government is also carrying out studies of (a) flared
gas use; (b) city gas distribution systems; and (c) domestic LPG marketing
as a potential replacement of kerosene.
Coal
1.06      After natural gas, coal is the next most promising source of energy
in Indonesia. The total coal resources of Indonesia are large, perhaps as
high as 20 billion tons. The bulk of it (15.5 billion tons) is lignite and
brown coal, followed by sub-bituminous coal (4.0 billion tons) and just over
0.6 billion tons of bituminous coal. Coal bearing formations are scattered
throughout the country but the major Jeposits (about 99% of known resources)
are located in West and South Sumatra, 'nl &tlong the coast of East and South
Kalimantan.
1.07      Coal iias been produced in Indonesia for a long time.  The Ombilin
mine, dating back to 1892, reached a peak of 665,000 tons in 1930. Around
1941, the annual production at Bukit Asam was 850,000 tons and 600,000 tons
from mines in East Kalimantan. The industry declined thereafter. Current
coal development and production is undertaken by two large state companies,
PN Batuba.:  nn-' PT Bukit Asam, and a number of small private firms.
PN Batubara covers major coal reserves outside South Sumatra, whereas
recently formed PT Bukit Asam covers the South Sumatra coal fields, maiAl
Bukit Asam and Banko. The production in 1982 was about 450,000 tons, of
which Ombilin provided about 300,000 tons, and Bukit Asam, about 150,000 tons.



-3-
1.08       There is considerable uncertainty about the true quantity and
quality characteristics of the various deposits.  Enough information is
available, however, to establish the basic features and to draw up a short-
term development strategy, while, at the same time, organizing systematic
coal exploration which would lead to firm long-term plans. The best quality
coal of all reserves is that from Ombilin in West Sumatra. It is low in ash
and sulfur, has a heating value of 6,800-7,500 kcal/kg, and most of it has
to be mined by underground methods. The limited reserve and its high
quality requires that it be earmarked for special industrial uses. Although
lower in heat value (5,000-6,500 kcal/kg) the sub-bituminous coals of South
Sumatra which are accessible to surface mining are eminently suitable for
steam generation and general industrial purposes. This is also true of East
Kalimantan coal. The large South Sumatra reserves at Banko and surrounding
areas, which are estimated at 15 billion tons, represent a large surface
mining area, but the high moisture content (35-60%) and low heating value
render the coal uneconomic to transport over long distances. Further,
several technical and economic problems associated with development and
utilization of this type of coal remain to be tackled and solved. The
government's short- and medium-term coal development strategy has therefore
concentrated mainly on the Bukit Asam and Kalimantan sub-bituminous deposits
(paras. 1.09-1.10). However, GOI is also implementing a crash program of
expansion of production at Ombilin to about 1.3 million tons per year by
1989.
1.09      Work started early in 1982 on an integrated coal mining and trans-
portation project. It includes a 3.2 million ton per year coal mine at
Bukit Asam in South Sumatra, extending and upgrading the railway line from
Tanjung Enim to Panjang port, constructing a new coal loading terminal at
Tarahan near Panjang and upgrading one at Palembang, and a self-unloading
ship to carry coal across Sunda strait to the 800 MW (initial) Suralaya
power plant in West Java. This station is being constructed by the national
power .entity (PLN) with assistance from the Bank under the eighth and ninth
power projects (Loan 1708-IND and Loan 1872-IND). The cost of the mining
and transportation project to be completed in 1986 is about $1,124 million.
A Bank loan of $185 million (Loan No. 2079-IND) was approved in December
1981 for this project.  Loans from several foreign aid agencies and export
credit sources will meet the balance of foreign costs. Work has also
started on a new shallow mine in the adjoining Muara Tiga area to the west
of Bukit Asam to produce about 0.6 million tons per year by 1986.  It has
the potential to produce 2.8 million tons per year and GOI plans to achieve
this by 1990. Besides these developments, which are expected to provide
enough coal for four 400 MW generating sets at Suralaya by the end of the
decade, a comprehensive coal exploration program in South Sumatra and East
Kalimantan has been initiated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) for
which the Bank approved a $25 million loan (2153-IND) in 1982.

1.10       The bulk of domestic coal production is expected to take place in
East and South Kalimantan. These areas have been set aside for exploration
and development by private companies. Tenders were invited in 1978 but
agreements were not reached until 1981 when bidders agreed to the establish-
ment of local companies and on principles of production sharing. Between
May and November 1981, the government signed four production sharing agree-
ments with joint ventures of Atlantic Richfield and Utah International of
the USA; AGIP Overseas of Italy; Conzino Rio-Tinto of Australia and British
Petroleum of the U.K.; and separately with Utah of U.S.A. The agreements are
patterned on those now in successful use in the Indonesian oil sector, with
the difference that the partners get a guaranteed share in output rather than
a share of gross profits. Three of these contractors are now actively engaged
,in surveying and drilling in the Senakin and Mahakam areas. It is to be
followed by mine development and production in the mid 1980s. The contracts
provide that 13.5% of the production would be given to PN Batubara and the
balance would be exported subject to Indonesia's own needs. If the country
requires large quantities of coal, they would be paid for at current average
sale prices in the South West Pacific Region. A period of 8 years is
specified for general surveys, exploration and construction of mining
facilities but it is expected that actual production would start well before
that, reaching up to 10 million tons per year at the end of the 1980s. The
government intends that a part of this production should be used at the 4,000
MW (ultimate) Paiton power station in East Java, which is planned to be
commissioned in 1989. PLN is currently studying the location of a new site
for a third coal fired station located either in Central or in West Java, to
be developed by about 1992. The proposed loan would provide funds to carry
out a feasibility study of this project. A second round of negotiations was
started in March 1982 with 10 contenders for further exploration and develop-
ment work in Kalimantan. Three contracts now await Government approval.
Investment in coal is expected to come primarily from the private sector.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.11       Indonesia-s total hydroelectric energy resources are large but
its development is limited by its geographic distribution relative to demand.
The greatest potential (over 35%) lies in Irian Jaya where the current
electricity demand is less than 1%; Java, which accounts for 80% of the
current demand, has less than 10% of the total potential.  Hydro resources
have an increasingly important role in electrical energy generation in the
islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. It will have
continuing significance until the 1990s in Java and some smaller islands.

(including 600 MW at the Asahan site developed jointly by the governments
of Japan and Indonesia primarily for meeting the demands of an aluminum
smelter); Sulawesi 181 MW (including 165 MW at Larona I, owned by the
International Nickel Company and constructed in 1978) and Kalimantan, 30 MW.
1.14      PLN has assumed the role of the lead agency in the country for
investigation and development of hydroelectric power, which it does in close
concert with the Department of Water Resources Development (DGWRP). An
important nation-wide study of hydroelectric potential was commenced in 1981
by PLN, with the assistance of Nippon Koei of Japan using funds provided
under the Sixth Power Project (Loan 1365-IND). It is being carried out with
the active involvement of a team of about 30 of PLN-s staff and an
Indonesian consulting engineer (Indra Karya) to ensure that adequate
technical capabilities are developed within the country to continue the work
of hydro electric surveys and detailed investigations after the first phase
of this study is completed. The entire data base and all previous studies
have now been reviewed. By mid-1983, PLN will prepare (i) a detailed
inventory of sites; (ii) a priority list of schemes to be considered for
implementation by the year 2000 taking into account access to power markets,
status of electricity supply, demand growth and alternative sources; and
(iii) a program of field investigations.
1.15      As an interim step, the Bank has agreed that feasibility stage
investigations of four sites, and prefeasibility site studies of 21 others -
all revealed by the study described in para. 1.14 - could be carried out
during FY84 using funds under Loan 1365-IND. Feasibility studies of 6 more
sites, and prefeasibility investigations of' 20 others, will be included in
the scope of this project (para. 4.33(e)).



-6-
1.16      Development of hydroelectric resources requires considerable engi-
neering and administrative skills, particularly in construction supervision.
In the past, apart from PLN, GOI has utilized independent public agencies,
e.g., the Jatiluhur Dam Authority (POJ), and the Indonesianr-Japanese joint
enterprise - the Indalum Company - (for development of the 600 MW Asahan
site in Sumatra), as well as private companies, e.g. the International
Nickel Company (to whom the 165 MW Larona site in Sulawesi has been leased).
MME and PLN are associated with all these developments. In order to extend
development possibilities beyond the administrative and financial resources
of these agencies in March 1982, GOI, through PLN, entered into an innova-
tive turnkey (design-and-construct) contract with an Anglo-Swedish
consortium for the 180 MW Mrica hydroelectric project in Central Java. The
contract is valued at about $650 million and will be financed entirely by
commercial credits. Completion is scheduled by 1988. If this project is
completed on schedule and within the estimated cost it could be a factor in
accelerating development of hydroelectric resources in future.
Geothermal Energy
1.17      Surface manifestations of geothermal energy sources are found on
all the major islands of Indonesia with the exception of Kalimantan.
However, only a half a dozen or so of these sites have been investigated
thoroughly and only one, Kamojang in West Java, has been explored suffi-
ciently to enable its energy potential to be classified as proven. Conse-
quently, estimates of geothermal reserves, all of which are owned by the
state, vary considerably. Identified reserves are currently about 1,500 MW,
mostly in Java where most of the exploration work has been carried out. It
is believed that potential reserves may approach 10,000 MW though the
economic and technical feasibility of their exploitation is not known at
present. Of these 5,500 MW are in Java, 1,400 MW in Sulawesi, 1,100 MW in
Sumatra, and the rest (2,000 MW) in the other islands.
1.18      Exploration began as early as 1920 but it proceeded in a slow and
sporadic manner until the early 1970s when the changing international energy
environment caused a renewed interest in geothermal resources. In 1973, a
bilateral grant from the New Zealand Government was used to develop the
geothermal resources in the Kamojang field, where a 30 MW geothermal power
plant was commissioned in January 1983. Under the twelfth power project
(Loan 2214-IND) the capacity of the station would be increased by addition
of two more generating sets, each rated at 55 MW, which will be commissioned
during FY87. PERTAMINA, the national oil company, is in charge of produc-
tion and supply of steam to the power station site and PLN is responsible
for construction and operation of the power station. This pattern of
separate and distinct responsibilities has been formalized in 1981 for all
future geothermal developments in the country by a Presidential Decree.



- 7 -
1.19      GOI has accorded geothermal energy development a high priority in
its energy program and has announced its intention to develop about 900 MW
by the end of the decade. To accelerate work it has decided to rely on
private capital and its entrepreneurial skills. In February 1982 PERTAMINA
signed a 30-year joint operation contract with Union Geothermal of Indonesia
Ltd (a subsidiary of Union Oil of California) to explore and develop the
56,650 hectare Salak geothermal field in West Java, wherein up to about 495 MW
could be installed in increments of 55 MW. Union Geothermal would operate and
maintain the wells, pipelines and other facilities. An energy sales contract
has been signed at the same time between PERTAMINA (which will own the steam)
and PLN (which has to install the power plant within a stipulated time from
notice by Union Geothermal). This agreement assures Union Geothermal a price
set to yield a rate of return of 20% on its estimated development and
construction costs of the Salak field at December 1980 price levels and
escalated thereafter by an agreed formula. There will be an upper limit of
not more than 80% of the fuel cost (ex Singapore) generated by an equivalent
oil fired power plant. This agreement would set the future pattern for
development of other areas such as Darajat in West Java, and Dieng in Central
Java. The first generating set at Salak is expected to commence operation in
1989.
Nuclear Power
1.20      Since 1976 several studies have been carried out on the need for
nuclear power in Java. The most recent study carried out by NIRA-ENEL of
Italy in 1981 concluded that introduction of the first nuclear power station
with a 636 MWe CANDU type reactor by FY90 would be feasible. GOI has,
however, decided to defer action on this recommendation for a few years. It
has recently ordered a small (50 MW) reactor for experimental use. PLN-s
latest development plans assume that no large nuclear power stations would
be operational before FY97.
Non-Commercial Sources
1.21      Non-commercial fuels (fuelwood and agricultural wastes) contri-
buted over 60% of total energy in 1960 but its share declined to just under
half now. These fuels are almost entirely used in rural areas. Forests
cover 64% of the land surface areas constituting biomass capacity far in
excess of current usage. However, demand is heavily concentrated in Java
and as a result there have been increased instances of deforestation there.
About 16 million tons of logs are exported annually from Kalimantan and
Sulawesi rainforests and provide the second largest source of export
earnings. A substantial increase in indigenous milling industries, which
would result in substantial quantities of residues, is expected. Agricul-
tural residues (from coconuts, paddy, cassava, etc) contribute an equally
large source which accounts for almost all the biomass production in Java.
1.22      Precise and reliable information on the sources and distribution
of noncommercial energy sources are not yet available despite some recent



- 8 -
surveys. Further studies are needed to refine them. They are relevant
because of apparent trends of substitution by kerosine, whose consumption
has been increasing by about 10% annually causing concern because of the
heavy subsidies involved.  The extent to which rural electrification could
have a beneficial impact also requires examination in this context.
C. Organization of the Energy Sector
1.23      In May 1978, the MME was established as part of a general reor-
ganization of government departments to coordinate all activities in the
e-nergy sector. MME has overall responsibility for mining, oil, natural gas
and electricity.  It controls the state enterprises responsible for the
execution of the government policies in the energy subsectors - e.g. the
national oil and gas entity (PERTAMINA), the coal agencies (PN Batubara and
PT Bukit Asam) and PLN. MME-s organization chart is shown in Annex 2.
1.24.     GO  has established a Technical Committee on Energy Resources.
The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee are the MME's Directors-
General of Oil and Gas and of Electric Power (DGEP), respectively. A
Permanent Committee on energy problems has also been formed by the minister
and entrusted with the tasks of assessing energy technologies, dealing with
day-to-day energy problems and preparing long-term projections for demand and
supply. A ministerial level National Energy Board (BAKOREN) was formed in
1981 to review proposals emerging from the technical comnmittee. It is
functioning actively.  Perhaps one of the most important of these
organizational steps was the establishment of a unit for energy planning in
the MME under the control of DGEP. The Bank is assisting MME in ths area
of institutional development (para. 1.27).
D. Bank Role and Strategy in the Energy Sector
1.25      The Bank has been actively involved in some of the sector devel-
opments described above.  During 1981, at the invitation of GOI the
Bank/UNDP carried out a detailed assessment of the Indonesian energy sector,
identifying policy options and analyzing investment priorities to provide a
framework for technical assistance and advice to GOI on institutional
aspects. The results have been incorporated in a report (No. 3453, August
1981) entitled "Indonesia - Issues and Options in the Energy Sector." This
report confirms earlier findings that alternatives for oil must be developed
quickly for electricity generation, and recommends that this should be
extended to industry, transportation and households. It further points out
that subsidized oil prices, weak institutions, manpower shortages and a lack
of detailed energy sector planning remain the chief obstacles to rapid
substitution of oil. During 1982 the Bank carried out a follow-up study
whose specific focus is on the pricing of energy products and the implica-
tions of increasing energy prices in the industrial, household and trans-
portation sectors and on the macroeconomic environment.



- 9 -
The report is being finalized. It is expected to assist GOI in formulating
the future course of its energy policy.
1.26      In 1979, in the context of the seventh power project (Loan
1513-IND), GOI and PLN agreed that tariffs for electricity should reflect
long-run marginal costs (LRMC) as closely as possible. In 1980, in the
context of the ninth power project (Loan 1872-IND), GOI agreed in principle
to the eventual elimination of all energy subsidies, subject to the
consumers  ability to pay.  Domestic oil price increases of about 50% in May
1980, 60% in January 1982 and about 60% again in January 1983 have since
reduced the oil subsidies significantly.
1.27      The Bank is providing, through the tenth power project (Loan
1950-IND), assistance to the energy planning init of the MME by financing the
services of a few experts. Under the seventh power project (Loan 1513-IND)
a consultant, PA International of the UK, also carried out a study and has
reported last year on installation of a management information system for
all DGEP activities. It will be implemented during the next two years.
1.28      The magnitude of investments necessary to implement GOI s policy
of diversification of energy sources is large. The Bank estimates that the
annual investments in the sector will increase from about $1.27 billion in
1980 to about $10 billion (at 1980 levels) in the year 2000. About half of
these will be directly in the electricity subsector. The Bank-s lending
strategy for the energy sector that has emerged from the study referred to
in para. 1.25 is to continue its support for the investment program in the
electricity and coal sectors during the next few years with a focus on steps
to overcome institutional weaknesses and manpower shortages.
E. The Electricity Subsector
1.29      The Electricity subsector is regulated by MME through DGEP.  It
comprises (i) PLN, (ii) captive plants installed by private parties for
their own use, (iii) some small municipal franchises, and (iv) a small
number of cooperatives which were set up to provide electricity in certain
rural areas remote from PLN supply systems. Legislation was enacted in 1979
to provide for private and cooperative franchise participation in the elec-
tricity sector.
1.30      DGEP.  Since its inception in 1978 DGEP has been responsible for
electricity policy in the country. Until its establishment, PLN had been
responsible for giving advice to the Minister on sector policy and for
planning and licensing. Legislation enacted in 1979 transferred these
responsibilities, particularly in policy planning, licensing of franchises,
and general supervision of the sector from PLN to DGEP.



- 10 -
1.31      PLN.  PLN was first formed in 1961 when three Dutch-owned electri-
city utility companies were nationalized but its growth as an effective
modern organization started around 1972 when its status was changed from
that of a department of a ministry to a public corporation and foreign
financing became available for its urgently needed rehabilitation of exist-
ing systems and for its expansion programs. PLN now has 3.9 million con-
sumers and provides about 70% of the total electricity consumed in the
country. It has made impressive progress during the past decade. The
improvement is discernible not only in the trend of PLN-s sales growth - an
average of about 22% p.a. since 1978, but also in the decline in the growth
of captive (oil-consuming) private generating plants, whose total capacity
rivalled that of PLN in the mid-1970s (and was growing faster) and is now
virtually halted in areas (e.g. Java) where public supply has proved its
reliability (para. 1.32).
1.32      Captive Plants.  Until the mid-1970s public sector development was
severely constrained mainly because of lack of finance. Consequently PLN
could not meet the demand for electricity with any reliability. Captive
plants therefore grew rapidly. The total capacity of such plants is
currently about 2,200 MW compared to about 3,000 MW of PLN. Most of the
plants are small diesel installations with a few larger gas turbines.
During 1973-76, the average annual growth rate of captive plant was 15
percent (with a peak of 22 percent in 1975). Since then the growth rate has
fallen rapidly to an average of about one percent during 1980-1982 (Annex
3). This is a direct consequence of the rapid augmentation of PLN-s system
capacity, significant improvements in reliability standards and positive
marketing measures. It is PLN-s policy when connecting owners of captive
plant to allow such plant to remain in use as reserve until the end of its
economic life. Some captive plants will continue to be installed as PLN's
investment program is not large enough to meet the entire demand at all
locations in the country; but the rate of growth is likely to remain below
five percent.
Rural Electrification (RE)
1.33      As explained in para. 2.02, access to electricity supply is still
very limited in Indonesia. This is true both of urban areas and more so of
rural areas. There are an estimated 60,000 villages, less than 10% of which
have electricity. As about 80% of the population live in these villages GOI
attaches high priority to RE and it is expected that the Repelita IV (FY85
to FY90) target will be substantially higher than in the preceeding one
(4,700 villages). Several Indonesian agencies are presently involved in RE.
They are PLN (which carries the bulk of the responsibility), the Director
General of Cooperatives, regional agencies and some private parties. Donor
countries such as the USA and Holland have made concessionary finance and
technical assistance available. The costs of ongoing projects are high
and there is little evidence of their profitability. The programs bear the
stamp of the experiences of donor countries elsewhere and have been slow in



- 11 -
getting off the ground and making the expected impact.  The poor institu-
tional base and the absence, so far, of productive uses for electricity,
e.g. pumping for irrigation, or village industries, have been the main
limiting factors. However there is evidence that a greater number of
households than originally expected are connecting up, spending a larger
proportion of income on energy. The implications of this require further
study. While the Bank has been keeping in close touch with these
developments, it has not been actively involved in investments.  The main
focus is expected to remain on the policy side.
1.34      Any strategy for RE in Indonesia must recognize (a) the very
different pattern of population distribution in Java (where habitations are
practically contiguous) compared with the other islands where they are
dispersed into distinct villages; (b) the state of development of public
supply systems, which are the only ones likely to conform to the national
energy policy of oil conservation; and (c) the status of institutional
development. Java is far better placed for rapid development of RE because
of the existence of a main grid (para. 3.06) and ongoing extensions of its
main distribution systems. However, RE in Java will be so closely inter-
woven with the development of the main electricity system as to be physi-
cally indistinguishable. In the other islands, almost all extensions of
electricity outside the few main urban centers, at the present stage of
development, would fall in the category of rural electrification.
F. Bank Role and Strategy in the Electricity Subsector
1.35      The Bank strategy in the electricity subsector has been to assist
PLN in its institutional growth and to support its development program. It
has already provided $1,590 million through twelve projects for generation,
transmission and distribution and institutional development measures. In
view of PLN's impressive progress during the last decade, the size of its
investment program and the greater need in the future to influence policy in
the entire energy sector, the Bank plans to move towards subsector lending
as rapidly as possible. The timing would depend on:
(a)  the progress made by GOI and PLN on measures agreed under the
eleventh power project (Loan 2056-IND) to prepare short and medium
term financing plans for PLN's investment program to provide
adequate assurances on availability of funds;
(b)  improvements in PLN-s planning capability on the basis of measures
agreed in connection with the tenth power project
(Loan 1950-IND);



- 12 -
(c) improvements in construction management on the basis of studies
initiated through the eighth power project (Loan 1708-IND) and
measures which will be agreed under the proposed project (paras.
4.43-4.46); and
(d) reorganization of procurement of goods and services agreed under
the twelfth power project (Loan 2214-IND).
1.36      The electricity subsector continues to be a major focus of the
Bank's lending program in Indonesia. Further power projects have been
proposed by PLN and are in course of preparation with the Bank-s assistance.
It is expected that the Bank's future lending program would include these
projects as appropriate.
II. THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
A. Status of Surveys
2.01      Several attempts were made during the 1970s to prepare a meaning-
ful demand forecast for the Indonesian power sector in a difficult situation
characterized by very low per capita consumption levels (on the order of
10-14 kWh), haphazard development of captive plants (para. 1.32) and imper-
fect records. The most useful of these was the study carried out for Java
in 1974-76 by consultants financed by IDA Credit 399 for the third power
project. Similar studies have recently been made for the islands of
Sulawesi and Bali and other areas in Sumatra. Thus about 90% of PLN's
market has been reasonably surveyed. During the negotiations of the tenth
power project (Loan 1950-IND) PLN agreed to build up its own expertise to
keep these studies updated and to extend them throughout the country. PLN
has recently established a new sub-division in the Planning Directorate for
power market surveys. The work will be carried out both at the headquarters
and the wilayah (regional) levels. PLN has recently built up a data base
from billing records. Consultants have been selected to assist PLN in this
work. Their services would be financed out of Loan 1950-IND. To improve
the quality of PLN-s future surveys, DGEP of MME has undertaken to provide
PLN with guidelines on national energy policies and firm data on energy
availability, energy usage and pricing policies as these would influence the
future demand for electricity. New forecasts are now being compiled. Until
they are available surveys carried out earlier by consultants and updated by
PLN (para. 2.03) constitute the basis for planning the development of
Indonesia's power sector.



- 13 -
B. Present Consumption and Access to Service
2.02       The per capita consumption of electricity in Indonesia is very low
at about 85 kWh (FY82).  This compares with about 800 kWh in Malaysia and
about 300 kWh in the Philippines and Thailand. Only about 9.4% of all the
households have access to electricity though in electrified urban areas
about 40-60% of the households have been connected. The degree of electri-
fication in different regions varies, being about 10% of households in Java,
7.8% in Sumatra, 9.8% in Kalimantan, 10.3% in Sulawesi and about 5.8% in the
other islands.
C. Projections of PLN's Sales
2.03       The initial results of the Java study (para. 2.01) suggested that
the magnitude of the underlying demand was so large that annual growth rates
of public electricity supply would have to be on the order of 30-35% during
FY76-85, compared with historic rates of 10-12%. It was recognized, how-
ever, that PLN-s sales in Java could not rise quickly to such levels and
that, in the short and medium term, the growth of sales would depend on the
rate at which PLN could build up its facilities and meet an increasing
proportion of the existing demand. In the longer term, PLN sales would
reflect more closely the growth of the power market itself. Extensive
discussion of these forecasts and their assumptions and methodology took
place during the period 1977-79 and eventually agreement was reached between
GOI and the Bank on the sales forecasts to be adopted in Java for planning
purposes up to 1990.  The development program for electric power incorpora-
ted in Repelita III is based on these and PLN-s estimates for the other
islands. PLN increased its sales during the period 1978 to 1982 by an
average of about 22% per year (Annex 4). Its future targets are given in
para. 2.04. PLN is now poised to meet them.
2.04       PLN's energy sales targets are summarized below:

D. Connection Program
2.05      As a necessary instrument of meeting its sales targets, PLN agreed
with the Bank in 1978 that it would prepare and actively implement a consumer
connection program consistent with its improving capabilities. The growth
of PLN-s consumers, connected load and sales since 1976 are summarized in
Annex 4.
2.06      PLN exceeded its customer connection targets each year from FY78
through FY80, but energy sales grew rather less rapidly. In FY81 energy
sales growth overtook that of both connections and connected load, reflecting
mainly the diminishing use of captive plant by PLN's industrial consumers.
Targets for FY82 have been met; those for FY83 are also expected to be
achieved.
2.07      In some of the wilayahs, notably East Java and North Sumatra, the
results of PLN's efforts at expediting consumer connections have been
striking. For example, in East Java the growth rates in FY79 to FY81 were
30%, 36% and 33% respectively. These growth rates give some indications of
the extent to which potential demand exceeds PLN-s near-term sales targets.
Of more immediate concern is the fact that growth rates of new connections
are ahead of PLN's capacity to provide adequate and reliable supplies. In
particular, the gains made so far need to be urgently consolidated, but
equal, if not greater, emphasis needs to be given to programs for improving
operational reliability and reducing system losses. These needs are being
addressed under the twelfth power project, which has allocated $80 million
specifically for equipment requirements of a program currently being final-
ized by consultants, to reduce transmission and distribution losses by 5% by
1986.  Special teams have been established at PLN-s Wilayah and headquarter
organization and the work is being personally supervised by Director
(Operations).
E. Long-term Development Program
2.08      On the basis of its forecast of power sales, PLN prepares annually
a long-term development plan to cover the projected requirements of genera-
tion, transmission, distribution and other facilities based on least-cost
studies. The latest plan finalized in April 1983, covers the 12-year
development period from FY83 to FY94. The development plan has been formu-
lated specifically to: (a) optimize resource utilization by substituting
coal for oil, by greater exploitation of hydro and geothermal resources for
power generation and by reducing the use of fuel inefficient installations;
(b) realize economies of scale by larger sized installations; (c) achieve
operational economy by coordinating the utilization of plants through
interconnected operations; and (d) provide acceptable standards of relia-
bility of supply. The plan is acceptable, subject to the observations at
para. 2.12.

2.10      The details of the generation expansion program in Java and other
islands are given in Annex 5. Coal-fired steam, hydro-electric, and geo-
thermal plants will register the greatest growth in a program which will
increase generating capacity about six and one-half times. These sources
presently account for only 18.6% of the total generating capacity but will
increase their share to over 70% by FY94. Oil accounted for about 80% of
PLN's energy generation during FY82. Its share will decline to about 20% in
FY94 (See Annex 6). It is thus a vital part of GOI's program of development
of non-oil energy sources.
2.11      The corresponding investments are detailed in Annex 7.  Excluding
the Rural Electrification component, the physical features of this invest-
ment program are substantially the same as discussed in connection with the
twelfth power project a few months ago. The cost estimates have been
updated. The annual investments increase (in constant 1983 prices) from
$1.05 billion in 1982/83, to about $2.56 billion at the end of the decade.
It is a balanced program and is fully justified. PLN should be able to
implement it substantially given the necessary financial resources if it
continues to maintain the impressive progress of its institutional growth
(para. 3.10). The same confidence cannot be extended to the new RE program
recently added to PLN's investment program, both because no supporting data
and justification of such a separate distribution component have yet been



- 16 -
provided by PLN and because of what has been stated at paras. 1.33 and 1.36
above. Presently it should be taken merely as an indication of the great
scope for evential extension of electricity supply to rural areas.
2.12      Thus far, PLN's development plans have not been supported by
complementary manpower plans or financing plans. Measures to address these
weaknesses in the planning process are described in paras. 3.14 and
5.17-5.18 respectively.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The beneficiary of the proposed loan would be PLN, the sole
government-owned national power utility in Indonesia.
A. Lregal Status and Responsibility
3.02      PLN was constituted by Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1972 as a
public corporation with exclusive responsibility in the country for
planning, construction and operation of facilities for generation, trans-
mission and distribution of electricity. In 1979, GOI amended PLN-s charter
giving MME the role of policy and planning in the electricity sector. The
1979 regulation also provided for the establishment, under license from MME,
of private utilities and cooperatives in the hope of accelerating the pace
of expansion of electricity supply. Hiowever, none has been licensed so far.
3.03      Financially, PLN is required to cover all operation and mainten-
ance costs (including depreciation and financing costs) from current
revenues and to generate a contribution to the financing of its expansion
programs. PLN-s major policies and programs - including its investment
plans, budgets and tariffs - are subject to review by a supervisory board,
established in 1981 and chaired by the DGEP and ultimately to approval by
GOI.  PLN is also bound by a number of GOI procedures affecting all public
sector enterprises. Of particular importance are those set out in
Presidential Decrees 10 and 14A of 1980, relating to the award of procure-
ment contracts and for the award of consultants contracts (para. 4.50).
3.04      PLN participates in the national economic planning process.  It is
instrumental in implementing the country's energy policy of developing
non-oil energy sources.  In recent years it has been the lead agency for
national surveys and planning for development of hydroelectric power (para.
1.14), and it now plays an active role in utilizing geothermal energy,
builds large coal-fired thermal power stations, and participates in national
energy studies and research on energy problems.



- 17 -
B. Organization
3.05      PLN-s organization chart is at Annex 8.  PLN's operations are
managed by a board of directors headed by a President-Director who is
appointed by the President and is responsible to the Minister of Mines and
Energy. The board includes five directors, respectively of planning, con-
struction, operations, finance and administration, who are all responsible
to the President-Director. The President-Director is the chief executive
empowered to issue directives, supervise and guide the work of directors
and managers responsible to him. Responsibility for major construction
work devolves from the board as a whole to 14 project managers, and for
operations (and minor construction work) from the board to 17 regional
(wilayah) managers and the manager of the new all-Java load despatch center.
-Also responsible to the Board are three staff departments respectively for
power research, education and training, and management services, and an
audit unit - the corporation inspectorate.
C. Facilities
3.06      PLN has about 3,000 MIJ of installed generating capacity - 1150 MW
of steam (oil-fired), 800 MW of gas turbines, 500 MW of diesel and the
balance in hydroelectric installations. It operates about 6,400 km of
transmission lines at 70 and 150 kV and about 50,000 km of distribution
lines, the bulk of which are in Java. Java now has an interconnected grid
at 150 kV. By 1984, a 500 kV system will effectively link West and Central
Java; it will be extended to East Java by 1986.
D. Corporate Development
3.07      Over the past ten years PLN has grown impressively from a depart-
ment of a Ministry, unable to meet even half the country's demand and
leaving industries and commercial establishments to install their own
captive power plants, to become the largest infrastructure public utility in
the country. The first five years (1972-77) was a period during which
rehabilitation of distribution systems, crash programs to expand generating
capacity (mostly gas-turbines), and establishing proper financial management
(the Financial Recovery Program under Credit 399) had precedence. Growth of
PLN's sales averaged 12%, whereas captive plants grew at a higher rate about
15-20%.
3.08      During the past four years (1978-1982) PLN has connected new
consumers at the rate of about half a million every year, and its sales
increased annually by an average of 22%. Access to service increased by
about 50%. Performance indicators such as the number of consumers per
employee and the energy sold per employee improved. Transmission and
distribution losses were reduced by 5%. Standards of reliability of supply
were improved. The growth of uneconomic captive plants in the country



- 1 -
declined after 1977 and seems to have been virtually eliminated (Annex 3).
On the financial side the corporation gained in strength, mainly as a
result of increasing sales, and the rate of capital investment almost
doubled.
E. Management
3.09      Inevitably, such rates of growth have been attained at the cost of
considerable strain on the management system. Areas in which a need for
strengthening has been recognized as a condition of maintaining the rate of
growth are described elsewhere in this report and summarized below:
(a)  planning:  the need for a more comprehensive corporate
planning process, including manpower and financial plans:
paras. 3.14, 5.17-18;
(b)  construction:  the need to rationalize and clarify responsi-
bilities for, and to improve control of progress and cost
of, major projects, including arrangements for procurement:
para. 3.23-3.24;
(c)  finance:  the need to rebuild the accounting system to provide
accurate and timely information, and develop the budgeting
system into a useful tool of management control: paras.
3.15-3.19; and
(d)  manpower development:  the need for improved manpower planning
and enhanced training facilities, including manager training:
paras. 3.14 and 3.20.
3.10      As described in more detail at the references quoted above, in all
these areas technical assistance is either already underway or planned, in
many cases with support from the Bank. A major consulting assignment is
well advanced in the construction area, and others are about to start in
accounting/budgteing and manpower development/training; smaller technical
assistance inputs have been arranged to address specific weaknesses in most
ares of PLN's operations. As the results of these inputs materialize over
the course of the next few years, improvements in efficiency can be expected
in the management areas affected. To maximize the benefits however, and to
sustain the planned rate of growth over the next decade (20% per annum
averge in sales, 15% in facilities), PLN could with advantage consider new
approaches to its system of general management. The present system is
characterized by a high degree of centralization, a preference for
consensus decision making, and a practice of communication through strict
hierarchial channels. The consequences are a heavy and growing workload on
senior managers, over-dependence of regions and projects on decisions from
headquarters, and sometimes poor coordination between directorates at the



- 19 -
staff level. A management system based on greater delegation of
responsibility - both from senior to junior management levels and from
headquarters to regions - could yield considerable gains in efficiency and
motivation if carried out prudently and under adequate control. The
Minister has already initiated a move in this direction by instigating a
review of PLN's organization structure and the job descriptions of managers
designed to clarify responsibilities and remove anomalies (completed in
1981), and hy encouraging PLN to move towards a management-by-objectives
(MB0) system of control between headquarters and regions. To this latter
purpose, regional management have received MB0 training, and a system of
regional performance targets has been in experimental use for a year or so.
The Bank has given, and will continue to give, full support to these
initiatives. Nevertheless these measures have so far had a mixed reception
and it must be recognized that progress will be slow both because MB0
principles represent a radical departure from established practice, and
because there is understandably little experience of large corporation
management in Indonesia. Hasty introduction of unfamiliar procedures in
these circumstances could be counter-productive.
F. Manpower and Training
3.11      PLN now has a staff of about 32,100, 19,700 of whom are employed
in technical and 12,400 in administrative jobs. About 21,000 of these are
on the permanent payroll. A manpower study carried out late in 1981 by
Electricite de Frace (EdF) confirmed PLN-s own projections of manpower
growth over the next decade. By FY86 the labor force will number 42,000 of
whom 25,900 would be technical and by FY91 these figures will increase to
54,500 and 33,400 respectively. These estimates constitute a sound basis
for planning.
3.12      PLN has had no difficulty in recruiting staff at levels up to
technical high school, but the proportion of technical graduates at only 4%
of the total, is unusually low for an electricity utility. It needs to be
raised considerably, particularly if PLN seriously intends to limit its
reliance on foreign consultants. Though it has been sponsoring 30-40
student scholarships annually to meet the need for graduates it has had
difficulty in recruiting them. PLN has recently begun recruitment of
technical graduates working elsewhere and is retraining them in electricity
work.
3.13      PLN has a separate center, known as Pusdiklat, for education and
training. Its staff of about 200, including 48 trained instructors, manage
various training centers and programs and play an important supporting role.
The Bank accorded high priority to training in its earlier lending
operations starting in 1973 with the establishment of six training centers.
They now train/retrain about 1,300 personnel annually, providing induction
training to new technical recruits and financial/administrative training to
others. The centers were set up with EdF acting as consultants and have



- 20 -
adequately met requirements of existirng smaller installations and systems.
As these were due to be replaced by larger thermal power stations, and
existing power systems would be overlain by extra-high voltage power
systems, special training programs were arranged under various earlier power
projects for training thermal power station operators and supervisors.
These culminated in the program under the ninth power project (Loan
1872-IND), which provides for an advanced training school (now under
construction at Suralaya in West Java for commencement in 1983/84), which
includes a fascimile digital training simulator. It will upgrade existing
training facilities for thermal station operators at Tanjung Priok. About
300 such personnel have been trained so far and now hold key positions at
the 500 MW Muara Karang (West Java) and Gresik (East Java) thermal stations.
More are under training in operation of ve-ry large generating units (400 MW)
to meet future needs. Additionally, training is being arranged in Canada
under the ninth power project in the fields of system protection, design of
thermal stations, their special maintenance problems, and in extra-high
voltage (500 kV) practice.  Under the tenth power project (Loan 1950-IND)
on-the-job training is being arranged in the country, with the help of
consultants in selected specialisms, e.g., civil works contract
administration, power system planning and operation, and power market
surveys.  These programs have been proceeding reasonably satisfactorily.
3.14      PLN's training program was reviewed in 1982 in the context of
overall staffing requirements in the decade ahead. The twelfth power loan
(Loan 2214-IND) includes a large training component ($25.0 million) to (a)
reorganize and enlarge the entire manpower development, training and
personnel management functions for middle and lower level staff by starting
five more training centers, improving job-performance evaluation systems and
introducing in-house management training and (b) develop by end December
1983 a training/development program for PLN-s senior technical staff. About
30 man-years of expatriate assistance will be involved.
G. Accounting and Budgeting
3.15      PLN prepares its financial statements according to generally
accepted accounting principles and normal utility practice.  The present
accounting system was originally installed in the early 1970s. While this
system served the company generally well in the past, it is now in urgent
need of redesigning and restructuring.
3.16      Under the present system the local branch offices, besides their
main function of providing customer services, also maintain accounts and
prepare financial reports; there are about 120 such branch offices scattered
all over the country. With the increased complexity and volume of
accounting transactions, and extensions of services to new and distant
areas, the closing of PLN-s accounts and preparation of consolidated
financial statements has been increasingly delayed by cumbersome and
timeconsuming inter-office reconciliation procedures.



- Z1 -
i.17      As a state company, PLN's budgets are subject to review by a
supervisory board and Government's approval (para. 3.03). PLN-s internal
procedures for budget preparation and for monitoring actual expenditures are
not effective. Coordination among various departmental units and between
regional offices is also weak. PLN's management has started reviewing the
current procedures and identifying areas for improvement.
3.18      Under the eleventh power project (Loan 2056-IND), funds have been
provided for the foreign costs of management consultancy to assist PLN in
setting up a more appropriate accounting system and in strengthening
procedures for budgetary control. The assignment will address weaknesses of
basic accounting and budgeting and the inadequate provision of financial
information to management. It will also cover utilization of computer
facilities for accounting and financial reporting. The assignment is of 20
months duration. The consultants have just been appointed after a delay of
about a year through GOI contractual formalities.
3.19      As an experimental measure to expedite the processing of accounts,
PLN is currently planning to prepare consolidated financial statements in
some areas at the wilayah level. The results of this consolidation of
accounts will be reviewed and evaluated under the financial management
consultancy assistance assignment. PLN has also engaged an outside
accounting firm to improve its procedures for fixed assets and work in
progress, inventory control and project cost accounting (the latter is
funded under an ADB loan). PLN has agreed to use these new procedures on
the Bank-financed Saguling (Loan 1950-IND) and the proposed Cirata hydro-
electric projects as part of its program of improving project management and
cost control systems.
3.20      A major constraint to PLN's accounting has been an almost total
lack of trained senior accountants. To address this fundamental problem,
PLN, with support of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), has made an effort to
strengthen its training program and, at the same time, to recruit qualified
and experienced accountants to fill more senior posts. A senior accountant
has recently been transferred from MOF to PLN as Sub-Director, Accounting;
two more accountants have been promised by MOF. In addition to its regular
in-house training program for new recruits, PLN is in the process of
preparing a crash program of training regional and branch office staff in
accounting practices and procedures. PLN is also preparing a program for
appropriate overseas training for certain accounting/finance staff in areas
of financial projection and planning, tariff setting, etc.
H. Audit
3.21      As prescribed in its charter, PLN's accounts are required to be
audited by the Directorate General of State Financial Control of the
Government. The Directorate General follows the standards of the
International Accounting Standards Committee and the International Auditing



- 22 -
Guidelines of the International Federation of Accountants and their audit
reports are acceptable to the Bank. But PLN-s audits have been subject to
increasing delays due to the problems affecting PLN-s accounting system
(para. 3.16). As a result, the submission of audited accounts to the Bank
by PLN has been falling behind the required dates by nearly a year. This
situation is expected to be corrected after PLN has implemented the measures
for accounting improvement. PLN also has an internal audit group reporting
to the President Director; this group carries out various special investiga-
tions in addition to keeping general accounting matters under review.
I. Insurance
3.22      PLN carries motor vehicle insurance, and transit and marine
insurance on equipment and materials in transit. Fire and other hazards are
self-insured. In view of the geographical spread of PLN's assets, any
single loss would be relatively small by comparison with total assets and
operations, and this policy is therefore considered satisfactory.
J. Construction
3.23      The position of the Project Manager within PLN's organizational
structure (with direct responsibility to the Board rather than to any
Director of the Board), and the job description are entirely consistent with
delegation of responsibility and authority for (a) the timely completion of
their projects and (b) the financial as well as the physical aspects of the
project under their management in accordance with the approved budget.
However, the situation in practice is clearly the opposite, with responsi-
bility being dispersed through various directorates at headquarters, and
with considerable interference by headquarters staff in day to day
operations at different stages. During 1980 and 1981, as PLN took over
construction of very large and complex coalfired thermal and hydroelectric
power stations, construction work faltered behind tight schedules and rates
of disbursement on foreign loans and budgeted rupiah expenditures dropped
sharply. A major consulting assignment (PMAS) was commissioned, funded by
the Bank under the Eighth Power Project (Loan 1708-IND), to review all                     t
aspects of PLN-s construction management organization and procedures, and
recommend and implement measures for improvement. The consultants- prelir-
inary recommendations have very recently been presented and are under review
by PLN and the Bank. In the interest of efficent implementation of the
proposed project, certain specific assurances as to the construction
arrangements were obtained from PLN at negotiations; these are described at
paras. 4.42-4.48.
K. Procurement
3.24      Efficient procurement of goods and services is essential for PLN
to implement its large investment program in time as most construction
delays arise from tardy beginnings in this area. It is equally important



- 23 -
for PLN to achieve self sufficiency in this regard as early as possible.
Starting from total dependence on consultants ten years ago, last year 90%
of the work on diesel power plants, 72% on transmission and distribution and
13% of thermal power station work was handled directly by PLN without con-
sultants. But procurement responsibility is fragmented within PLN and not
well coordinated with construction. Procurement arrangments are also being
reviewed in the PMAS study. It was agreed under the twelfth power project
that PLN would (a) prepare an action plan no later than January 1, 1984 to
deal with its internal reorganization of procurement to cope adequately with
the scope and complexity of the tasks in the decade ahead; and (b) implement
this plan promptly thereafter; PLN agreed that the draft of such a plan
would be forwarded to the Bank during October 1983 for comments.
L. Performance under Earlier Bank Operations
3.25      The Bank has provided $1,590 million for power generation/
distribution facilities in and around Jakarta and in West and Central Java.
Four distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334, and Loans 1259 and 2056)
rehabilitated and expanded the distribution facilities in the greater
Jakarta area. These early power loans enabled some major institutional
training, organizational and financial reforms to be carried out in the
electricity subsector, including providing PLN with a new charter giving it
some autonomy. Eight power generation projects (Credits 399, and Loans
1127, 1365, 1513, 1708, 1872, 1950 and 2214) in West and Central Java were
undertaken to help PLN expand electricity generation capacity in Java and
provide a strong all Java 500 kV grid and to introduce a program of micro
hydro development in Sumatra. Past loans and credits have also provided
funds for various consulting services such as that of SOFRELEC of France (to
establish PLN-s original accounting systems), the Java System Development
Study undertaken by Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the UK, and feasibil-
ity studies for a number of thermal, hydroelectric, transmission and
distribution projects.
3.26      A completion report on the first two projects (Credits 165 and
334) was issued in November 1979. It describes how, after an initial period
of difficulty and delay (the two projects were completed some three and a
half years behind schedule) many institutional and operational improvements
were effected, greater reliability of supply was achieved, and PLN-s sales
began to increase rapidly. The completion report on the third and fourth
projects was prepared in 1981 and is still under review by OED. Lessons
learned from all these operations have been applied to subsequent opera-
tions. They relate mainly to timely appointment of consultants, effective
supervision, and lending as late as possible in the project cycle. A
specific program for financial recovery, designed to improve PLN's manage-
ment capabilities and to reach financial breakeven, was incorporated in
Credit 399 and was accomplished ahead of target during FY76.



- 24 -
3.27      PLN-s performance in implementing twelve Bank-assisted power
projects was uneven at first. The earliest generation project (Credit
399-IND) covering the first and second 100 MW units at Muara Karang thermal
station was completed about two years behind schedule; the next (Loan
1127-IND) for the third 100 MW unit, had a delay of less than one year. The
2 x 200 MW extensions at Muara Karang (Loan 1365-IND) have just been
completed, over a year late and are operating satisfactorily. The Semarang
project (Loan 1513-IND) is about 18 months behind the appraisal schedule.
The two projects at Suralaya (Loans 1708-IND and 1872-IND) are also about a
year behind the original program. Physical progress of construction at the
Saguling hydropower project (Loan 1950-IND) was poor at start but it has
since improved and is now proceeding fairly satisfactorily. Completion of
the Saguling dam is expected close to the appraisal target date though the
commissioning of the power station may be delayed by a few months mainly due
to landslide problems in the power house area. Good progress has been made
on procurement under the eleventh power project (Loan 2056-IND) with
contracts for about 87% of the loan amount having been approved within six
months of effectiveness of the loan. As agreed with the Bank, under the
twelfth power project contracts valued at about $40 million for urgently
needed equipment, were approved before Board Presentation. The overall
record of implementation of agreements reached in connectiion with these
power operations has been satisfactory.
3.28      Responding to the slowdown in pace of disbursements on earlier
loans during early 1982 a system of joint monitoring of disbursement per-
formance on Bank loans by PLN and the Bank on a monthly basis was estab-
lished. It identified the causes of slippages and enabled management to
take timely remedial steps. It has been working satisfactorily.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives of the Project
4.01      The main objective of the project is to provide complimentary
hydroelectric generating capacity needed by the Java system in view of the
steady growth of base-load thermal generating capacity from 1984 onwards.
The project forms part of a comprehensive least-cost program to meet future
demands for electricity by developing domestic non-oil energy sources as far
as possible and it will utilize the remaining hydroelectric potential of
about 1,426 GWh of the Citarum river in West Java, the third largest river
in Java. It will also strengthen PLN-s ongoing institutional development
measures, particularly in regard to improved construction management of
complex major generation projects and studies for further development of the
energy sector (para. 4.33).



- 25 -
B. Project Description
4.02      The project comprises construction of:
(a)  a 125 m high concrete faced, rockfill dam at Cirata, with a
crest length of about 450 m and volume of 3.9 million cu m;
(b)  two circular diversion tunnels, 10.0 m diameter, and 800 m long;
(c) two inclined spillway tunnels, 185 m long, connected to the
diversion tunnels, to carry 2,600 cu m/sec;
(d)  a bottom outlet tunnel 610 m long, 5.0 m diameter;
(e)  a tower type intake structure with a capacity of 540.0 cu m
m/sec;
(f) a water conductor system comprising (i) two 640 m long,
circular, 8.4 m diameter, concrete lined headrace tunnels,
(ii) two 18.6 m diameter, 80.0 m high surge tanks, (iii) four
200 m long penstock tunnels with inside diameters varying
from 5.2 to 4.5 m, lined with mild steel 20-34 mm thick, and
(iv) four 155 m long, 6.4 m diameter, tailrace tunnels;
(g)  an underground power station, 30 x 50 x 240 m, with an initial
installed generating capacity of 500 MW (4 x 125 MW); and
(h)  a 500 kV switchyard and a 25 km, 500 kV, transmission line
to connect the station to the Java EHV grid at Saguling.
The Cirata power station will generate 1,426 GWh annually on the average, of
which about 70% will be firm. Salient features of the project are given
at Annex 9.
4.03      Preparatory works cover 25 km of new roads, upgrading of 24.5 km
of existing roads, three bridges and two camps at Cirata base and Cilangkap
and 70/20 kV lines for construction power. The project also involves
relocation of 22.0 km of roads, building of several small bridges for this
purpose, resettlement of 10,121 families (about 40,000 people) and miscell-
aneous environment-related activities. Consultancy services for the Cirata
project, and energy sector support (para. 4.33) are included in the scope of
the project.
C. Status of Development of the Citarum River
4.04      Three storage dam sites on the Citarum river viz Jatiluhur,
Saguling and Cirata (see Map nos. 16802-16750) have been known to be
suitable for development for many years. The overall Citarum river



- 26 -
development plan is shown schematically in Annex 10. It would enable about
4,400 GWh of energy to be generated annually on the average, irrigate about
300,000 ha of land and provide about 34 m3/sec of water for municipal uses
in and around Jakarta. Jatiluhur (150 MW) was developed in 1964 primarily
for irrigation of 244,000 ha, and now provides about 820 GWh annually to the
PLN system and about 7 m3/sec of water supplies to Jakarta. The Saguling
power project (700 MW) is currently under construction for operation in 1985
with financial assistance from the Bank's tenth power loan (1950-IND). It
will generate 2 156 GWh annually and increase assured water supplies to
Jakarta to 14 ms/sec which is considered adequate until about 1995.
D. Status of Investigations and Engineering of the Cirata Project
4.05      The feasibility study of the Cirata site was carried out during
1980-81 with financial assistance from the sixth power loan (1365-IND) by
New Japan Consulting Engineers (Newjec) of Japan.  The study considered
optimum development of the resources of this river for development of
irrigation, water supply and hydroelectric generation. It concluded that
(a) the Cirata site was suitable for construction of a 120 m high dam, and
(b) the normal operating reservoir level (NORL) at Cirata should be +220 m
for purposes of conservation of the entire Citarum river flows and optimum
energy generation. The DGWRD and POJ concurred with PLN on these conclu-
sions but they explained that some experts had pointed out that possibili-
ties may exist of trans-basin diversion of surplus flows from some rivers in
Western Java which could be used in other arid regions of Java. This might
require a higher NORL at Cirata at a future date. As this possibility
though remote cannot be ruled out at this stage it was decided that during
detailed engineering the possibility of an eventual increase in NORL to the
extent technically feasible at Cirata would be borne in mind so as not to
pre-empt development of storage at one of the few remaining large storage
sites in Java.
4.06      Detailed engineering of Cirata project was commenced by Newjec in
February 1981, using funds provided for this purpose under the tenth power
project (Loan 1950-IND). The basic design was finalized in February 1982.
The Board of Consultants (BOC) appointed to review the progress of investi-
gation and engineering of the Cirata project (para. 4.25) opined that
geological features at higher reservoir elevations on both the river banks
limit the maximum safe reservoir operating level at Cirata to +235 m.
Further investigations and designs have since proceeded on the basis of
construction of the Cirata dam with an initial NORL of +220 m, but capable
of being eventually raised, if necessary, to +235 m. This entails a
relatively small initial expenditure of about $5.0 million now and about $40
million (1983 prices) later. Detailed engineering was completed in October
1982. Tender documents for civil and metal works issued to prequalified
bidders were opened on February 1, 1983, and for electrical and mechanical
works were opened in April 1983.

E. Dam Site and Other Features
4.07      The Cirata dam site is located at the base of Pasir (Mt) Cirata,
just upstream of the foreshore of Jatiluhur reservoir. Two alternative damr
sites, about 2 km apart, were investigated at the feasibility stage. The
downstream site was selected because of superior geological conditions and
advantages for location of the spillway. At the downstream site, options
were available for construction of a concrete-gravity dam, a conventional
rockfill dam with an impervious core, and a concrete-faced, homogeneous
rockfill dam. During detailed engineering these were evaluated in detail
taking into account availability of construction materials and costs. The
concrete faced rockfill dam emerged as the most economic.
4.08      Both overground and underground powerhouse sites were explored for
location of the power station. An underground site located in sound rock
(para. 4.14), about 300 m from the river bank, was chosen on technical and
economic considerations. The associated water-conductor system is a short
one, totalling just over 1.0 km, including head race, penstock, and tailrace
tunnels. The water-conductor system and power station sites have been well
investigated with adequate drillings and an adit to the location of the
power station.
F. Optimization of Project Features
4.09      The project features subject to optimization studies were the
following: (a) the minimum and normal maximum operating levels of the
reservoir; (b) the tail water level (TWL); and (c) the power station
generating capacity.
4.10      The tail water level of Cirata power station was fixed at +103 m
(about 4 m below the NORL at Jatiluhur) considering (a) the duration of high
water levels at Jatiluhur ultimately and (b) the length of the waterway.
Several alternatives were considered to utilize the remnant head between
Saguling TWL (+252 m) and Jatiluhur, including construction of a supple-
mentary lifting dam at Rajamandala (where the average bed level is at
+225 m). They included a critical review of Cirata-s NORL in the range of
+200 m to +235 m and alternative minimum drawdown (MDD) levels. It was
found that the power output was most sensitive to the depth of drawdown of
Cirata reservoir. The optimum solution, based both on effective reservoir
storage at Cirata and total power output was obtained by construction of a
dam at Cirata with a NORL of +220 and MDDL of +205 m, and construction at
a later stage of Rajamandala lifting dam and its associated power station of
about 100 MW.
4.11      By virtue of its proximity to the main load center of West Java,
and the fact that the investment cost per KW installed of incremental
generating capacity at Cirata is of the order of $300, the site is well
located to provide a major source of economic peaking capacity to the Java
grid. Newjec's studies indicate that an ultimate conventional generating



- 28 -
capacity of 1,000 MW should be provided, though, consistent with the growth
of base load coal-fired thermal station capacity, the appropriate initial
generating capacity during FY88 would be 500 MW. Further expansion of
peaking capacity would be required commencing 1992 and has been planned as
an extension of the first stage works. The conceptual layout of the power
station area also provides for an eventual further increase in peaking
capacity by the addition of a separate 500 MW pumped-storage station at a
later stage. This would merit consideration along with large base-load
nuclear power stations in the late nineties. The short transmission line to
Saguling (25 km) will have double circuit towers to carry the full planned
station output of 1,500 MW. Initially only a single circuit will be strung.
G.  Geology
4.12      The foundation rocks at the dam site are breccia, sandstone and
mudstone. Breccia, interbedded with sandstone and claystone lamina, is
widely distributed over the entire left abuttment of the dam and the lower
portion (below +155 m) of the right abuttment.  It forms a sound and stable
foundation for the concrete-faced rockfill dam. The mudstone at elevations
above +155 m on the right abuttment is soft and careful foundation treatment
is necessary. No fault of any significance has been found in the river bed
or flanks. Over the initial 60% of its length the diversion tunnels pass
through breccia, which presents no problems, but the final traverse in soft
mudstone would require careful design of the tunnel support system.
4.13      The breccia zone extends over the headrace tunnel and power house
areas. Investigations have confirmed that the structural and lithic condi-
tions of the rock are good and that the 8.4 m diameter tunnels could be
driven without difficulty.
4.14      The powerhouse cavern will be in the breccia zone.  The rock is
homogeneous and massive in composition and has few cracks or joints. It is
suitable for an underground power station.
4.15      The tailrace tunnel traverses both breccia and mudstone areas.
The mudstone here contains montomorillorite which could cause swelling and
may require special treatment, e.g., shotcreting immediately after
excavation.
H. Seismology
4.16      Seismological studies have been made by Newjec with earthquake
data available for the last 57 years. They indicate a low probability of
earthquake occurances in or around Cirata. Newjec has used a seismic
coefficient of acceleration of 0.15 g for design. This is acceptable.



- 29 -
I. Reservoir Area
4.17      There are a number of small landslides in the reservoir area.
Their sliding planes are generally shallow in depth and their danger of
sliding after reservoir filling is considered very low. There is little
concern about leakage of water from the reservoir because it is largely
covered with thick lake deposits.
J. Hydrology, Reservoir Operation and Energy Assessment Studies
4.18      The project area has a rainy season from November to April result-
ing from a western monsoon and a dry season for the rest of the year. The
mean annual rainfall is about 2,160 mm. River discharge data are available
at the dam site from 1923 onwards with an interruption during 1944-1962.
This data was used to establish a long-term (62 years) pattern of flows at
the dam site for energy assessment studies.
4.19      There are about 90 rainguage stations in the drainage area dating
back to 1919. The available data was ample to compute probable maximum
flood flows. Floods with the following return periods were computed to have
peak flows as follows:
Return period                 Peak flow cu m/sec
Probable maximum flood              8,391
Once in 10,000 years                6,360
Once in 1,000 years                 4,976
Once in 100 years                   3,667
Once in 50 years                    3,306
The hydrological data and studies used to support the project are accept-
able. The project has been designed for the probable maximum flood of
8,391 cu m/sec. Moderation by the Saguling reservoir and the Cirata storage
will limit the outflow to about 2,600 cu m/sec.
4.20      In view of the facts that the Jatiluhur reservoir is located
closest to the Tarum Irrigation and Water Supply Systems, and it has the
largest effective storage (about 3,000 million cu m), reservoir operation
studies have been carried out assuming that this major reservoir would
continue to be operated primarily to meet irrigation and water-supply
requirements.  At POJ request a reservoir minimum level of +75 m was assumed
to ensure that the Jatiluhur station is operable throughout the 62 year
period. This is higher than the low level irrigation off take level of



- 30 -
+48 m and would reduce effective storage to about 2,000 million cu m. The
Saguling reservoir is the smallest of the three reservoirs but in view of
its high elevation (+645 m) it offers the greatest advantage for power
generation. It was therefore assumed that the Saguling reservoir would be
operated to maximize power generation whereas Cirata reservoir releases were
assumed to be adjustable according to the needs of both irrigation and
power. Detailed reservoir operation studies made by Newjec on the above
assumptions have shown that the storages available in the Citarum valley and
the Cirata reservoir could meet the overall targets of multi-sectoral
development in the valley (para. 4.04). These studies have been explained
by Newjec and PLN to DGWRD and POJ and their consultants. In view of the
large reregulating storage available at Jatilihur no difficulties in
operating these three reservoirs in accordance with the above assumptions
are expected. The energy assessment of the Cirata project has been based on
detailed studies carried out over a 62-year period and the results are
acceptable.
K. Sedimentation
4.21      The Institute of Hydraulic Engineering (DPMA) in Bandung has been
carrying out measurements of the silt carried by the Citarum river and of
river bed loads since 1975. DPMA carried out intensive observations of
suspended silt loads at those key points from December 1980. On the basis
of analyses of this data Newjec has estimated the erosion rate from the
1,836 sq km between Saguling and Cirata catchment at 2.5 mm/year. The
corresponding sediment volume was estimated at 5.7 million cu m per year.
The storage in the reservoir below the intake level (+190 m) is 110 times
this volume. Newjec has also carried out a study of the likely effect on
live storage at Cirata by aggradation at the reservoir entrances, taking
topographic characteristics into account. Its conclusion is that
sedimentation at the top levels of the reservoir would be small and will not
be significant for at least 50 years after construction.
4.22      A supplementary sediment monitoring program has been included
under environment-related measures. It would consist of daily monitoring at
Palumbong during the wet season. The measuring site will be shifted to the
foreshore of the reservoir after construction of the Cirata dam.
L. Construction Materials
4.23      During 1980-82 several field and laboratory investigations were
carried out by Newjec under the supervision of the BOC. These have
confirmed the availability and suitability of sufficient rock for the
construction of the main dam and for aggregate.
4.24      Two quarry sites have been identified for rockfill materials - one
very near the dam site for rockfill and the other about 14 km away for
andesite required for structural concrete aggregate. The main quarry site,



- 31 -
1.0 km upstream of the dam (see Map 16751) and comprising sound breccia, was
investigated with 20 drillings of 1,050 m and 4 adits of 240 m. It has been
established that it could provide an adequate quantity of good quality rock-
fill suitable for the dam embankment. The location of the andesite quarry
at Aseupan is shown in Map no. 16750. Investigations with 29 drillings
totalling 1,300 m here have indicated that the rock, though suitable, is
highly weathered and wastage would therefore be heavy. This has been
allowed for in the cost estimates and necessary contingencies have been
provided (para. 4.37). Basic concrete tests using local cement and
aggregates from the andesite quarry site were carried out in Japan.
M. Engineering and Design and the Board of Consultants
4.25      Newjec of Japan is the consulting engineer and is responsible for
design and construction supervision of the project. The status of engineer-
ing has been explained at paras. 4.05 - 4.06. A Board of Consultants (BOC)
has been closely supervising the feasibility and engineering studies since
1980. It comprises Professor G. Sowers (USA), Dr. L. Mueller (Austria),
Mr. I. Pinkerton (Australia) and Dr. Tanaka (Japan) and has terms of refer-
ence to review the project concept and designs giving due consideration to
all aspects involving safety of the structures. The BOC has worked extremely
well and because of its association from the start of investigations of this
project it has been a major factor in the rapid progress of work achieved.
During negotiations, it was agreed that PLN would continue to employ these
consultants, including the BOC, under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank for the entire construction period (Section 2.08(b) of the draft
Project Agreement).
N. Environmental Aspects
4.26      Environmental aspects have been given due consideration from the
initiation of the project investigations in 1980. Thanks largely to the
pioneering efforts of PLN's ecological group set up for the Saguling project
(Loan 1950-IND), which experts have described as representing a quantum jump
ahead of such dam or other large development projects elsewhere in
Indonesia, issues were identified in time and necessary action taken to
ensure that proposals incorporated in the project:
(a) are sound in terms of cost estimates, schedule, and practical
considerations;
(b) minimize the risks which could delay construction or cause budget
overruns;
(c) are acceptable to both project management and the administrative
hierarchy of the project area; and
(d) are sensitive and responsive to the expectations of families who
will be displaced from their homes or otherwise directly affected
by the project.



- 32 -
4.27      There has been extensive involvement of environmental specialists
in baseline and impact studies, design review, and implementation planning.
Senior environmental specialists and managers from the Institute of Ecology
of Padjadjaran University, Bandung, (LE UNPAD) have contributed two
man-years of effort to the project supplemented by 18 man-years by junior
specialists, technicians and students. Cooperation of project management
and provincial and kabupaten leaders has been commendable. The Governor of
West Java and the Bhupatis of the three kabupatens viz. Bandung, Cianjur and
Purwokarta have supported the project by issuing seven decrees to facilitate
land acquisition, resettlement planning and implementation. In January
1983, the Minister for Environment, GOI, cleared the project for
construction.
4.28      Compensation and resettlement of persons with houses or other
major interests in the reservoir areas is the most serious environmental
problem because:
(a) areas surrounding the reservoir are densely populated; 10,121
families have to be dealt with, 6,355 of whom reside in the
reservoir area and 3,766 reside above it but own land or work in
the reservoir area;
(b) of complex proprietary and inheritance rights and out of date
records of land ownership; and
(c) traditions, customs, economic conditions, and perceptions of
transmigration are such that most families prefer to remain in the
vicinity of the reservoir and are reluctant to leave Java.
4.29      The following actions have been taken to date to deal with the
resettlement problem, based on the experiences with the ongoing Saguling
hydroelectric project located in the same vicinity (Loan 1950-IND) where
about 9,500 families had to be dealt with:
(a) a two-year, anthropological, socioeconomic, and ecological
baseline and impact study (including censuses and property
inventories) has been completed;
(b) practical alternatives to transmigration (of about 2,000 fami-
lies) have been developed, scheduled and evaluated for the
6,355 families residing in the reservoir area. These include
development of aquaculture (for 2,000 families), employment
training (for 1,250 families) and simple compensation (for
1,105 families). The employment training option is currently
under review by the authorities in view of Bank comments during
appraisal that it does not appear to be a meaningful long term
resettlement option. Other alternatives, e.g. employment under
nucleus estate small-holders (NES) projects are under
consideration;



- 33 -
(c) decrees freezing land transactions, creating a Resettlement
Coordinating Board, stating resettlement policy, and creating
resettlement implementation teams have been issued and are now
in effect;
(d) a direct-payment compensation system has been in satisfactory
operation for about a year;
(e) a resettlement cost estimate has been prepared on the basis of
recent experience in land acquisition, compensation adminis-
tration, access road construction, and site planning and
development;
(f) detailed implementation planning has been initiated; and
(g) an aide memoire listing and scheduling additional resettlement
necessities has been prepared and agreed by PLN and the Bank.
4.30      To ensure successful implementation of the measures described in
para. 4.29, the following assurances were obtained from GOI during negotia-
tions of the proposed loan that it will continue:
(a) to carry out an environmental/resettlement Plan of Action
satisfactory to the Bank;
(b) to monitor closely resettlement and environmental activities;
and
(c) to furnish to the Bank quarterly reports on the progress and
implementation of the Plan of Action and other aspects related
to resettlement and environmental activities (Section 3.06 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
4.31      There are no archaelogical sites or artifacts of any significance
in the submergence area. Construction of the project is not expected to
adversely affect fauna in the valley.
0. Special Equipment Requirements
4.32      Basically all the project works will be done by contract.  How-
ever, PLN has built up a small construction task force of its own, equipped
to repair and maintain roads other than those covered by the main contract,
construction camps, etc. Some construction equipment estimated to cost
about US$1.2 million, is required for this unit and is therefore included in
the scope of the project.



- 34 -
P. Energy Sector Support Program
4.33      As PLN-s development program increases in size and complexity and
major complex projects, such as Cirata, Saguling (hydroelectric), Suralaya
and Paiton (thermal) are being constructed, PLN would require a variety of
consultancy services, both to support specialized activities on these
projects, for specialized equipment for information processing and for
feasibility studies to sustain its future development. These have been
identified and detailed in Annex 11. In order to introduce some flexibility
that is required in dealing with these and other essential sector support
activities, it is proposed that a fund of about US$37.0 million be set apart
in the proposed loan for such purposes. During negotiations, it was agreed
that GOI and PLN would undertake the studies listed in Annex 11 in accordance
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.07 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
Q. Project Cost Estimates
4.34      The total project cost over the six-year implementation period
(1983-1988) is estimated at $625.7 million equivalent of which $346.3 million
represents the foreign component. The costs are summarized in the table
below and detailed in Annexes 12 and 13.
4.35      The cost estimates of the main civil works to be carried out
through contracts under ICB have been prepared by Newjec after first prepar-
ing a detailed construction program and then assessing the equipment and
manpower required. Their costs were calculated and applied to a bill of
quantities estimated from the final designs incorporated in the bidding
documents. Other items such as fuel, power, compressed air, lighting etc.
were added. Foreign costs cover the following: (a) mobilization and
supervision costs; (b) foreign skilled labor; (c) main structural steel
materials and principal reinforcement; (d) freight and transportation of
equipment and materials; (e) depreciation on equipment; (f) explosives; and
(g) indirect foreign costs of certain items, e.g., cement, timber and
reinforcing steel bar. Local costs cover: (a) applicable mobilization and
supervision costs; (b) local labor; (c) costs of fuel and lubricants;
(d) timber; and (e) cement and supplementary reinforcement bars. Where
applicable the rates were checked with prevailing costs. The method
followed and the resulting estimates are acceptable.
4.36      The costs of penstock steel have been estimated on the basis of
designs prepared by Newjec and recent international prices for mild steel.
The costs of turbines, generators, transformers and switchgear (all items to
be procured through bids inviting suppliers credits) are based on prices
relevant to this type of bidding.

R. Contingencies
4.37      Physical contingencies have been provided at the following rates:
(a) a preparatory civil works - 15%; (b) main civil works - 12%; (c) metal
works and electrical and mechanical equipment - 5%. An additional physical



- 36 -
contingency is provided for unforseeable conditions especially expected on
this project due to: (a) complications of geology in the Andesite quarry
site (para. 4.24); and (b) potential landslides of volcanic breccia and
mudstone zones. These have been assessed in rough detail and work out to
about 10% of the base cost of the civil works. Base prices are at June 1983
levels. Price contingencies on the local currency portion have been
estimated at the following rates: 20% for 1983, 15% for 1984, 11% for 1985,
and 7% for 1986 and beyond. Escalation on foreign costs was calculated at
the following annual rates: 8.0% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7.0% for 1985 and
6% for 1986 and beyond.
S. Consulting Services
4.38       The cost estimate for engineering covers about 600 man-months for
pre-construction stage work and about 2,400 man-months for supervision of
construction.  The average man-month cost, including basic salary, overhead
and fee, international travel, overseas allowance for resident field
engineers and subsistence allowances for staff on short field visits, is
about US$10,400. In addition, local sub-consultants will contribute about
700 manmonths of work estimated to cost about US$2,600 per man-month. The
cost of consulting services for energy sector support is based on a rough
estimate of the periods of use, prevailing rates, and contingencies.
T. Financing
4.39       The project would be financed as shown in Table 4.2 below.

An amount of about $6.2 million is proposed to be retroactively financed on
Newjec's consultancy contract from April 1, 1983.



- 37 -
4.40      The CDC loan will cover part of the estimated local cost of the
civil works contracts. The Bank loan will cover (a) the estimated foreign
costs of the civil works contracts, including the estimated indirect foreign
costs, (b) the foreign costs of the metal works, and (c) the total costs of
engineering and construction supervision. Export credits will cover the
estimated foreign costs of electrical and mechanical equipment. The local
costs of the project will be financed partly from PLN's own internal
resources, borrowings and partly from contributions from the GOI. These are
assured because of the high priority accorded to the project by PLN/GOI.
4.41      As in the past loans, GOI will relend the proceeds of the proposed
loan to PLN. The onlending rate will be equivalent to the variable interest
rate charged on the Bank loan, plus a quarter percent as the administration
charge. Under GOI's present policy the foreign exchange risk will be borne
by Government. Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement will be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
U. Construction Arrangements
4.42      The project will be implemented by PLN with the help of consult-
ants engaged in consultation with the Bank. Newjec of Japan is the engineer
so appointed (para. 4.06). Newjec's performance on feasibility studies and
detailed engineering of the Cirata project has been favorably commented upon
by the BOC. However, Newjec's construction supervision on the Saguling
hydroelectric project required close supervision by the Bank during 1981 and
1982 and several discussions with Newjec's top management on measures for
improvement which have generally been implemented with improved results.
Close supervision by the Bank would continue to be required during the next
two years.
4.43      PLN's own organization for construction supervision of the Cirata
project has been prepared.taking into account the need for the highest
possible quality of staff, the close proximity of the two major hydroelec-
tric projects in West Java (viz Cirata and Saguling), and their overlapping
construction periods. The Project Manager for Saguling, who has been quite
effective on that project and was also concurrently responsible for super-
vision of the feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Cirata
project, will be in overall charge of construction of both projects as the
General Project Manager (GPM). For the work on the Cirata project, the GPM
will be assisted by a Project Manager (PM) who was appointed in October 1982
and has assumed full-time responsibilities effective March 1983. This
arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank subject to certain specific
assurances explained in para. 4.46.
4.44      In the context of paras. 4.42 and 4.43 above, PLN has agreed that
it will employ an expert in hydroelectric construction (dams and underground
works) on a full-time basis. Hle will assure from PLN's side that (a) major



- 38 -
construction problems are adequately foreseen, (b) response to changing
conditions due to geological or other factors is as rapid as possible, and
(c) there is good communication all around on these problems. The latter,
(b) and (c), have been areas of weaknesses on the Saguling project. PLN is
currently negotiating for the services of a suitably qualified specialist.
His appointment should both reduce construction delays at Cirata to the
minimum, and on the institutinal side, train up PLN engineers to shoulder
increasing responsibilities on such major projects in future. Employment of
this expert in construction of hydroelectric works on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of the proposed Bank loan (Section
2.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
4.45      For effective management of major civil works contracts of the
type involved on Saguling and Cirata projects, PLN now uses the services of
an expert, on-call, financed out of Loan 1950-IND. This practice will be
continued on the Cirata project and the proposed Bank loan would provide
funds for the purpose. During negotiations assurances were obtained from
PLN that it will continue to use the services of a civil works contract
specialist, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, for the
duration of the Cirata project (Section 2.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
4.46      In view of the scale of the two construction operations at
Saguling and Cirata sites, during negotiations PLN agreed that the Project
Manager (Cirata) shall be responsible for the implementation plan of the
project, the cost estimating and expenditure controls and forecasting and
monitoring all disbursement on loans for the project, and making Rupiah
payments to contractors with respect to the Project (Section 3.05(a) of the
draft Project Agreement). It was agreed during negotiations that PLN shall
ensure that the Project Manager (Cirata) is adequately trained for and
assisted in carrying out the said responsibilities (Section 3.05(b) of the
draft Project Agreement).
4.47      The preparatory works on the project started in April 1982 by
local contractors selected on the basis of local bidding. Upgrading of
existing roads has been completed. Progress of construction of new roads so
far has been adequate to meet the deadlines for providing access and other
facilities to the contractors for the main works.
4.48      On the basis of the recommendations at paras. 4.42-4.46 above, it
is considered that PLN's construction organization and arrangements proposed
are appropriate for the nature of work involved and would enable PLN to
complete the project within the short construction period programmed.
V. Implementation Program
4.49      Following established procedures for the Saguling project (Loan
1950-IND) the implementation program has been drawn up to achieve the short-
est possible construction period. The main project works have been divided



- 39 -
into eight contracts, of which two will cover the civil works, two will
deal with metal works (penstock steel and gates), and the balance, the
electrical and mechanical equipments and the 500 kV transmission line. A
very detailed implementation program has been prepared (Annex 14) and it is
summarized in Annex 15. The target is to commence construction of the main
civil works on September 1, 1983, divert the river in June 1985 and to start
impounding of the reservoir in May 1987. This will enable commissioning of
the first two generating sets in November 1987 and the remaining two in
April 1988. Detailed procurement milestone schedules have been prepared
(Annex 16) as also lists of key dates of construction (Annex 17).
4.50      Crucial to the success of the implementation program of the Cirata
project is the timely award of the main civil works contract, no later than
June 1983, to enable the main civil works contractor to mobilize and start
work on the dam by 1st September. Prequalification of civil works and
penstock contractors was carried out from 47 applicants. Bids were invited
from the successful contractors on November 1, 1982 and they were received
on February 1, 1983. Evaluation of proposals and award of contracts is the
next critical step. Under the Saguling hydroelectric project (Loan
1950-IND) delays of a few crucial months in obtaining approval of the GOI's
Central Procurement Committee (SEKNEG) led to acceleration payments of
several millions of dollars to the chosen contractors, serious construction
difficulties due to consequent limitations in an already tight construction
program and further alterations in construction plans with cost implications
even though the final completion date of the Sagauling dam is still expected
to be achieved. During negotiations the progress on the evaluation of bids
for the main civil and penstock metal works was reviewed and found to be
good. The Bank reiterated its view that PLN submission of its award
recommendation to SEKNEG would be essential to maintain the tight
construction schedule. The GOI delegation agreed that PLN will closely
monitor the progress, take corrective measures required and keep the Bank
informed.
W. Procurement
4.51      Works.  The construction of major civil works on the dam, water
conductor system and underground powerhouse totalling US$249.5 million,
including contingencies, and metal works totalling US$20.8 million, includ-
ing contingencies, would be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank's
Guidelines. The balance of the construction to be financed under the
project totalling US$45.1 including contingencies consisting of site
preparation, road relocation and miscellaneous environment-related works
(excluding resettlement/compensation) would be procured through local
competitive bidding procedures which were found at appraisal to be
satisfactory to the Bank.



- 40 -
4.52      Goods.  Electrical and mechanical equipment consisting of turbines,
generators, transformers, switchgear and transmission lines totalling
US$76.9 million including contingencies will be procured under supplier's
credits in accordance with GOI regulations. Certain special vehicles
required for the project organization totalling $1.2 million including
contingencies will be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.53      All bidding packages for works and equipment over US$1 million
equivalent would be subject to Bank's prior review of procurement documenta-
tion resulting in coverage of about 86% of total estimated value of works
contracts.
X. Disbursement
4.54      The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 71.5% of the total
cost of the main civil works,/l (b) 100% of the foreign expenditures of the
metal works and equipment; or 100% of the local expenditures (ex-factory)
for locally manufactured equipment, (c) insurance - 65% of expenditures, and
(d) 100% of expenditures on consultants' services and the services covered
under the energy sector support program. In order to assist in project
financing during the Special Assistance Program years it has been decided to
increase the percentage disbursement under (a) to 90% through November 1985
and to reduce the same thereafter to achieve the overall disbursement
percentage.
4.55      The schedule of disbursement of the project is at Annex 18.  It is
based on the special disbursement provision (para. 4.54) and the experiences
to date on the similar Saguling hydroelectric project (Loan 1950-IND of
1980), rather than other regional hydroelectric projects. The latter are
considered less satisfactory as a guide to project disbursement in view of
the unusually short planned construction period and the fact that the loan
application is being processed at a more advanced stage of the project
cycle.
Y.  Maintenance for Dam Safety
4.56      In order to ensure that the project works are maintained satisfac-
torily, assurances were obtained that before completion of the project,
PLN would prepare a program of periodic inspection and maintenance of the
project works which is satisfactory to the Bank, and to implement it
throughout the operational period of the project (Sections 2.08(a) and 2.09
of the draft Project Agreement).
Z. Operation
4.57      At present the only operating facility on the Citarum river is
Jatiluhur, operated by the Jatiluhur Dam Authority (POJ). Arrangements for
coordination between POJ and PLN for irrigation releases and power generation
/I The Bank-s disbursement against the main civil works will be equivalent
to about 80% of the balance of the total value of the contracts after $20
W^jgijU-  CDC funds have first been fully disbursed against the same



- 41 -
are presently satisfactory. With the commissioning of the first generating
units at Saguling at the end of 1985 and Cirata at the end of 1987, arrange-
ments will need to be firmly established for the coordinated operation of
the three reservoirs for power generation, irrigation, potable water and
flood control. The Bank will monitor the setting up of satisfactory
arrangements during supervision of this project and the Saguling project.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. General
5.01      In the financial sphere, PLN has advanced considerably from the
near chaotic conditions in the late 1960s to reasonably sound operations in
the 1980s. The history of PLN can be divided into three stages for the
review of its financial performance: (a) the pre-recovery period prior to
FY72; (b) the financial recovery period from FY72 to FY76; and (c) the post
recovery period from FY76 until the present.
B. The Past Operating Results
(a) The pre-recovery period
5.02      When PLN was formed in 1961, its revenue and expense accounts were
incomplete and distorted; accounting was further handicapped by inadequate
systems and a severe shortage of trained staff. Government provided all the
funds required for PLN's operations. Tariff increases had lagged far behind
inflation and PLN could not generate sufficient revenues to cover the high
expenses because of rundown facilities and inefficient operations.
5.03      When IDA undertook its first lending operation in the power
sector in 1969, no meaningful financial statements could be prepared from
PLN's accounts to ascertain its financial situation. Accordingly, Credit
165-IND (1969) provided funds for the services of consultants to assist PLN
in setting up an accounting system and an operating budget, and in preparing
a balance sheet after proper valuation of assets and classification of the
ownership of properties. This was accomplished by 1972 with the completion
of revalued FY71 accounts and preliminary FY72 budgets.
(b) The financial recovery period
5.04      With the information available from the consultants  work, it
became apparent that PLN's financial situation was critical with substantial
operating losses being incurred. Operating cash flow including depreciation
was barely positive and capital expenditure was at a low level and funded
entirely by Government contributions.



- 42 -
5.05       When PLN-s status was changed to a public corporation (para.
3.02), its new charter specifically provided that PLN should produce
revenues sufficient to cover all operating expenditures, including
depreciation, debt service in excess of depreciation, and taxes, and to
provide a surplus for financing of further expansion. Its tariffs, however,
would be subject to Government's approval.
5.06       Elimination of operating losses became the first priority for this
period and an earnings test was devised under Credit 399-IND (1973) which
required PLN to achieve full cost coverage from revenues in FY79 with
interim targets given for the revenue/cost ratios for intermediate years. A
financial recovery plan aimed at strengthening PLN's operation efficiency
and improving both costs and revenues was made a specific part of the
project; the plan included an extension of consultant services to all
managerial aspects and the timely planning and implementation of adequate
tariff adjustments by PLN. Under the recovery plan, PLN achieved full cost
coverage three years ahead of schedule (in FY76 instead of FY79). But, as
the following table indicates, the recovery was attained mainly through
increases in the average revenue per kWh totalling 105% between FY72 and
FY76; these increases were effected, not by changes in the basic tariff
structure, but mainly through the mechanism of surcharges, which was applied
only to energy consumption (para. 5.13). This system was instituted in May
1974 and revised upwards in November 1974, April 1975 and April 1976.
(c) The Post Recovery Period
5.07       The revenue/cost target of the recovery plan was of a temporary
nature. Given the characteristics of PLN's operating systems and the
desirability of financing a reasonable share of the increasingly large
investment programs by debt and internal cash generation, a new set of
financial targets was introduced under the seventh loan (1513-IND, 1978).
These targets included a debt service limitation of 1.3 times, a maximum
debt:equity ratio of 60:40 and an internal cash contribution of 30% of
construction (on a 3-year moving total basis), starting from FY86, with
lower interim targets for intermediate years (para. 5.19).
5.08       The progress of PLN's operating results since the recovery has
been impressive. Energy sales increased from 2,804 GWh in FY76 to over
9,400 GWh in FY83 and, beginning from FY78, the rate of growth has been
exceeding 20% per year. However, tariffs were not increased between FY77
and FY80 and PLN's net income was kept around breakeven point with its cash
flow derived mainly from depreciation (assets are revalued every fourth
year) and customers contributions. The major source of its funding has been
equity capital subscriptions by GOI (para. 5.15).

- 46 -
5.11      As shown in Table 5.3, the change in PLN's financial position over
the last decade has been remarkable. Total net fixed assets have increased
by more than 20 times since the beginning of the financial recovery period
in FY72. Reflecting the trend of increasing debt financing, PLN's
debt:equity ratio has risen from zero in FY72 to about 30:70 in FY83,
leaving PLN a comfortable margin for future borrowing. The current ratio
stands around four times, with inventory and accounts receivable positions
at acceptable levels; the high current ratio reflects the liquid position
(currently about Rp 100 billion) part of which PLN has built up to cover any
need that might occur in project progress as a result of the Government's
budget appropriation constraints./l
D. Tariffs
5.12      PLN's present tariff schedule comprises 17 consumer categories.
For all except the smallest domestic class, two-part charges are applied,
and for industrial and large commercial consumers time-of-day pricing is in
effect. Provision can be made for surcharges on energy consumption to cover
cost increases. Variation of surcharges requires the Minister's approval;
alteration of the basic rate, however, requires Presidential approval.
PLNs latest tariff increase was made in February, 1983 by about 38% over
the previous level mainly to pass on the impact of a 67% fuel price increase
in January 1983. Like the two preceding tariff increases, it was effected
entirely through the energy charge.
5.13      While this practice is adequate from a revenue viewpoint, the
failure to adjust the demand charge has severely distorted the tariff
structure. The present basic rate schedule was introduced by PLN in May
1980 as a first step to structure its electricity tariffs according to the
LRMC pricing principles as agreed with the Bank under the seventh power
project (Loan 1708-IND, 1978). However, some compromises were inevitable
and were left to be adjusted in subsequent changes. One of these was a
lower charge on peak hour consumption than the LRMC in this category. This
represents an unjustifiable subsidy and would encourage unwarranted growth
/1 The project budgeting (DIP) system through which PLN obtains its capital
funds from GOI involves approval of expenditures on a project-by-project
basis in advance of the beginning of each fiscal year. Under this
system, the insertion of new projects and the redeployment of funds from
one project to another, during any fiscal year, while technically
permissible, are in practice difficult and time-consuming. PLN's flexi-
bility to deal with unforeseen contingencies and to accommodate diver-
gencies between planned and actual project progress, is to this extent
constrained.

of demand at peak hours. Such tariffs would also depress the rate of return
on otherwise economical schemes of expansion such as hydro-electric projects
(para. 6.02). During negotiations for the proposed project, agreement was
reached with PLN that it:
(a)  would complete a study of the structure of LRMC by
December 31, 1983, following the lines of the study made
in 1979 to meet the covenant under the seventh power project;
(b) would design by March 31, 1984, after consultation with GOI and
the Bank, a new tariff structure to better reflect the LRMC
of supplies including peak hour characteristics; and
(c) should thereafter implement the appropriate recommendations, and
routinely update its analysis of LRMC each year and review the
results with GOI and the Bank.
5.14       In April 1983, PLN calculated its average LRMC level at about
Rp 114 per kWh in 1983 prices and on the basis of its latest development
program. The present average tariff of Rp 75 per kWh is about 65% of the
LRMC. In line with agreements reached under Power XII (Loan 2214-IND),
it is intended that the average tariff level will approach the LRMC in real
terms by FY86; domestic oil prices to PLN are expected to be raised to
international levels at the same time.
E. The Financing Policy
5.15       Around FY75, PLN's investment program began to accelerate rapidly
from its previous low level. With negligible net income, PLN's only sources
of internal funds have been depreciation retentions and customers' connec-
tion fees. According to its charter, PLN is authorized to borrow from local
and foreign lenders, and to issue its own obligations. In practice, the
remainder of PLN's investment program which is not financed from internal
cash generation has been. funded exclusively by GOI. Local currency
expenditures are customarily reimbursed to PLN in the form of equity
contributions. Foreign exchange expenditures have been funded partly as
equity and partly by the onlending on terms of finance similar to that
secured by GOI from overseas lenders; this latter source of financing has
become increasingly important as illustrated in the following paragraph.
5.16       The pattern of PLN's financing of its investment program over the
period from FY72 through FY83 can be summarized under two 6-year subperiods
as follows:



- 48 -
Table 5.4:  FINANCING PLANS FOR FY72-77 AND FY78-83
FY72-77               FY78-83
Financing plans                     Billion Rp      %      Billion Rp      %
Capital expenditures                   466        100.0      2,881      100.0
Financed by:
Net internal sources                   8          1.7        555        19.3
Borrowings                            12          2.6        955       33.1
Equity                               446         95.7      1,371        47.6
Total                            466        100.0     2,881       100.0
5.17      Budgetary constraints facing GOI in the near term strongly suggest
that it would be difficult for PLN to count on continuing to receive the
same level of Government equity contribution as in the past. It would be
prudent for PLN to plan its longterm investment program by carefully
analyzing its financing requirements and preparing a feasible financing
plan. For this purpose, an agreement was reached under the eleventh power
project (Loan 2056-IND, 1981) to institute financial forecasting as part of
the annual planning process for the preparation of a rolling five-year
financing plan for review by GOI and the Bank. PLN has been given
professional assistance with this task (para. 5.18).
5.18      In reviewing PLN-s present position and its financial forecasts,
it is evident that PLN is currently well placed to increase its level of
borrowing; its balance sheet is sound; its debt:equity ratio is notably low
(para. 5.11) and the debt service is currently covered over five times.
Given these considerations, PLN should be attractive to lenders both inside
and outside Indonesia. Therefore, its near-term objective should be to
secure a significantly higher degree of leverage in its financing plan by
increasing its long-term borrowing from sources including commercial banks,
supplier credits and possibly even local insurance companies and pension
funds. The possibility of a limited amount of funding through bond issues
can also be considered. To develop these concepts, define a capitalization
policy and prepare a financing plan as agreed with the Bank, GOI has
assigned its banking advisors (Lazard Freres, S.G. Warburg and Lehman
Bros., Kuhn Loeb) to work with the corporation. Their work is expected to
be completed in the second half of 1983 and the conclusions will be reviewed
with the Bank.



- 49 -
F.   Future Financial Performance
5.19      In 1976, PLN adopted cash generation targets /1 as a measure of
financial performance. The quantification of the targets has been revised
from time to time; the latest agreement (Twelfth Power Project - loan
2214-IND) provides for a rate of 20% to be achieved in FY86. Interim targets
are presently set at 10% for FY84 and 85. These targets will be retained
under the proposed loan.
5.20      In order to facilitate steady progress towards the pricing
objectives (para. 5.14), it is necessary that the cash flow targets be
protected so far as possible from the risk of erosion, particularly as a
result of possible slippage in the investment program. Accordingly, the
current agreement provides that in the event of significant variation
(upwards or downwards) of capital expenditures from those on which the above
targets were predicated,/2 the target cash generation percentages would be
adjusted correspondingly (downwards or upwards). It is also provided that
additional costs that might be imposed on PLN in any year as a result of
increases in the price of fuel oil above the levels of the base year (1982),
should be allowed as a deduction from the cash generation requirement for
that year; this provision is designed to avoid the risk of exceeding LRMC
when cash generation targets are set on top of cost recovery.
5.21      The necessity to build in adjustments such as those described
above is an indication that the cash generation targets are less
appropriate to PLN's circumstances now than they were five years ago.
Adoption of a rate-of-return formulation for PLN's objective would have a
number of advantages including in particular the following:
(a)  it is very little affected by non-operating revenues, which
have made an important contribution to PLN's cash flow in the
past, and so bears more directly on the level of prices and the
efficiency of operations;
(b)  the value of assets in use can usually be established with
certainty at the beginning of each year, and so the rate base
for tariff setting is less susceptible to error; and
(c)  it is neutral as to the disposal of net cash flow, and so it
does not highlight self-financing rather than any other
financing policy.
/I The percentage of capital expenditures for the target year plus the
two preceding years covered by its net revenue plus depreciation
retentions less debt service for the same three years.
/2 These are set out in the side letter dated October 22, 1982, under
Loan 2214-IND.



- 50 -
PLN itself endorses this view; but GOI has indicated that it does not wish
to initiate any change until they have received the report of their finan-
cial advisers on PLN's financial structure and policies (para. 5.18). /1
5.22      Beginning from FY86, PLN is expected to benefit from declining
unit costs by 1 to 2% per year in real terms. The contributing factors
include the expected impact of the loss reduction program (para. 2.07);
increased efficiency of operation as a result of the completion of the EHV
grid in Java, expected savings in fuel cost from diversified sources of
production, and improved economy of scale in the main systems. Currently,
PLN is also considering plans to implement measures to reduce other
operating expenditures. PLN's latest financial projections show that, with
adjustments for fuel cost increase (para. 5.20), the targets for the
self-financing ratio can be comfortably met in FY84 at the present average
tariff level. The target for FY86 will require the average tariff to be
raised to the current equivalent of LRMC in FY86 and be maintained in real
terms thereafter. In terms of operating income, PLN is expected to improve
its rate of return (on fully revalued net fixed assets in service) from
around 3% in FY84 to about 17% in FY86 after LRMC tariff adjustment, and
should maintain the annual rate of return not less than 12% thereafter./I
Forecast financial statements for the period FY84 through FY89 are given at
Annex 20.
5.23      Existing covenants binding PLN to a maximum debt:equity ratio of
60:40 and a minimum 1.3 times coverage of future maximum debt service out of
current revenue are changed under the proposed loan. The new covenant
requires a minimum of 1.5 times coverage of future debt service each year
out of the forecast internal funds for that year (Section 4.03 of the draft
Project Agreement). This change reflects the growing recognition that the
new covenant would suffice for PLN's prudent debt management and, at the same
time, make allowance for the added earning power to be expected from an
investment being financed by borrowed funds. For the new covenant, debt
shall be deemed to incur when the agreement providing for such debt or
guarantee is signed. This new definition of the timing of debt incurrence
gives the debt limitation covenant a more practical application for PLN,
especially as PLN is expected to rely more on external borrowing to finance
its large investment program over a long period. The financial projections
assume international borrowing at 2% above LIBOR on l9-year maturities
(including four years' grace), and domestic borrowing at 13.5% over 12-year
maturities (including four years grace). These assumptions are probably
fairly severe, considering that certain concessionary financing is likely
to be available to PLN for some years; nevertheless, debt service remains
covered at least three times at a debt:equity ratio approaching 50:50.
These projections are satisfactory.
/1 The study by GOI's banking advisors on PLN-s future financing policy
will also review alternative monitoring indicators for PLN's financial
performance including a rate of return criterion (paras. 5.18, 5.21,
5.22). The Bank will pursue this topic in the context of possible future
lending operations.



- 51 -
5.24      The recommended financing policy will substantially reduce the
equity funding expected from GOI and initiate a declining trend; annual
requirements could be expected to average around Rp 540 billion during the
proposed project period. Pressure on the GOI budget would be still further
reduced by the elimination of fuel oil subsidies to PLN, which would have
reached a level of around Rp 900 billion in constant 1983 prices (or Rp 150
billion per year) for the period FY84-89.
5.25      PLN's financing plan for the period of project construction would
appear as follows:
Table 5.5: FINANCING PLAN FOR FY84-89
By FY84-89
Financing plan                 Rp billion        %
Capital Expenditure              18,706        100.0
Financed by:
Net internal sources            4,826         25.8
Borrowings                     10,660         57.0
Equity                          3,220         17.2
Total                    18,706        100.0
By comparison with the financing plan for the past twelve years set out in
para. 5.16, the future plan shows the following main changes:
(a) the proportion of debt financing has risen from less than 3% of
the FY72-77 program to 33% of the FY78-83 program, and is
projected to reach 57% of the FY84-89 program;
(b) the proportion of equity required from GOI has fallen from
over 95% to 47% and finally to about 17% of the programs for the
corresponding three periods; and
(c) the self-financing percentage increased from less than 2% of the
FY72-77 program to about 19% of the FY78-83 program and is
projected to increase to about 26% of the FY84-89 program, after
charging Rp 1,191 billion for debt service, which was negligible
in prior years.

G. Corporate Income Tax
5.26      In accordance with prevailing tax legislation, PLN's profit is
subject to corporate income tax. Since FY81 PLN has begun to earn profit;
but, as an investment incentive, which is also being applied to some revenue
earning corporations in Indonesia, PLN has been exempted the income tax
payment. PLN's financial projections do not assume an income tax liability
and the self-financing ratios are computed on this basis.
VI. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Growth of Demand and Need for the Project
6.01      The forecast of electricity demand and the growth of supply in
Java from FY82 to FY94 is shown in Annex 5. Even though these sales targets
were set some time ago, before the onset of the present recession, it is
felt that the latter is likely to affect them - if at all- only temporarily,
and that sales growth would soon resume the trend indicated in the fore-
casts.  It is also believed that for the period of the forecast, sales are
likely to be relatively price-inelastic, so that sales growth will continue
even when the tariff is raised to the level of LRMC. Grounds for, this
belief are given by PLN's maintenance of a steady rate of sales growth of
over 20% through the last four years despite two substantial tariff
increases; by the present relatively low utilization of electric power in
Indonesia by comparison with neighboring countries (para. 2.02); and by the
virtual cessation of growth of competitive private and captive generating
capacity (paras. 1.31-1.32). Based on projects now under construction, the
available generating capacity would not be adequate to reliably meet the
anticipated demand during FY89. The corresponding firm energy supply of
21,000 GWh would also be well short of the required 25,000 GWh during FY89.
It is therefore necessary to plan to augment generating capacity by about
650 MW during FY88; the proposed project would provide 250 MW in FY88 and a
further 250 MW in FY89.
B. Least Cost Solution
6.02      The Java System Development Study for the period up to 1995
carried out in 1976 by PCR with Bank assistance (Credit 399-IND) established
the least cost sequence of expansion of generating capacity for discount
rates up to 15%. It recommended the highest priority for development of
Java's remaining hydroelectric potential, emphasizing their role in meeting
peak capacity requirements wherever technically feasible. Newjec's
feasibility study of the Cirata project which was completed in 1981 further
confirmed the above conclusions for a range of discount rates from 6-20%,
based on prevailing international fuel prices and comparisons with available
alternatives in Java viz. thermal power stations and gas turbine



- 53 -
installations.  The Cirata hydroelectric project which can be commissioned
in 1987 is therefore the next step in the least cost sequence of expansion
of power supply in Java.
C. Economic Rate of Return
6.03      The economic rate of return (ERR) is the discount rate which
equalizes present values of the streams of economic costs and benefits
attributable to the project.  The costs include all the direct costs of
construction of the project and those required to deal with rehabilitation
and environmental measures. Extensions of the transmission and the distri-
bution systems required have also been allowed for in the cost estimates.
6.04      The cost and benefit streams are provided in Annex 21.  The ERR is
14%. Benefits have been assessed at the prevailing average tariff level for
the first two years of operation and thereafter at the peak-hour tariff, as
appropriate to the intended use of the plant. Benefits assessed in this
way, however, ignore consumer surpluses. Finally, the project would provide
additional power benefits in the next stages as also downstream benefits of
improved water supplies, both of which have not been evaluated.
6.05      The ERR of the project would be reduced to about 12.3% if there
is a delay in construction of 6 months and a cost increase of 10%. The
thorough investigations carried out, ample physical and price contingencies
and adequate rates for base cost estimates, and assurances by PLN and GOI
authorities and expeditious action on contract approvals make it unlikely
that such an increase in cost would actually occur on this project.
D. Risks
6.06      The risks associated with the proposed project are, first, the
uncertainties inherent in most hydroelectric projects, such as hydrological
complexities, geological problems and similar matters. The long period of
observations of river flows at the dam site (para. 4.18), the thorough and
competent preparatory work undertaken by PLN and consultants and the
precautions taken in establishing the BOC from the start of feasibility
stage investigations (para. 4.25) have reduced these risks. The appointment
of an expert in construction of dams and underground power stations by PLN
(para. 4.44) further reduces the possibility of delays in execution of a
tight construction program. A further risk is delay to the project as a
result of scarcity of counterpart local currency funding resulting from the
present recession. Tariff action by PLN to increase its self-financing
ratio (para. 5.19) will reduce its dependence on GOI budgetary funding.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Specific agreements reached during negotiations for the proposed
loan are:
(a)  from PLN that it will:
(i)  continue to retain consultants, including the Board of
Consultants, for the entire construction period of the
project under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 4.25);
(ii) continue to retain an expert in construction of hydro-
electric works on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 4.44);
(iii) continue, for the duration of the Cirata project, to use
the services of a civil works contract specialist on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.45);
(iv) ensure that the project manager at Cirata is adequately
trained and assisted; and is responsible for the implementation
plan of the project, the cost estimating, and all expenditures
control, forecasting and monitoring all disbursements on loans
for the project, and making rupiah payments to contractors with
respect to the project (para. 4.46);
(v)  before completion of the project, prepare a program of
periodic inspection and maintenance of the project works
which is satisfactory to the Bank, and implement it
throughout the operational period of the project (para.
4.56);
(vi) complete a study of the structure of LRMC by December 31,
1983, and design a new tariff structure after consultation
with GOI and the Bank by March 31, 1984, to better reflect
the LRMC of supplies, including peak hour characteristics
(para. 5.13); and
(vii) thereafter implement the appropriate recommendations and
routinely update its analysis of LRMC each year and review the
results with GOI and the Bank (para. 5.13).
(b) from GOI that it will continue to carry out an environmental/
resettlement Plan of Action satisfactory to the Bank; to monitor
closely resettlement and environmental activities; and to furnish
to the Bank quarterly reports on the progress and implementation



- 55 -
of the Plan of Action and other aspects related to the
resettlement and environmental activities (para. 4.30).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness for the proposed loan would be:
(a)  fulfillment by GOI of all conditions of effectiveness for the
CDC loan; and
(b)  Signature by GOI and PLN of a subsidiary loan agreement on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
7.03      Subject to satisfactory agreement being reached on the above
matters, the project is suitable for a loan of $279.0 million (including
capitalized front-end fee) for a period of 20 years including 5 years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate.

Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
General
1.        Inflation has been taken into account at the following rates (%):
1983  1984  1985   1986 and after
offshore costs               8     7.5   7         6
Local costs (exc. fuel)   20    15    11           7
Income Statements
2.        Revenues assume a tariff increase of 30% at the beginning of FY85
and about 45% at the beginning of FY86 so as to attain the current price
equivalent of LRMC in the latter year. Thereafter, the tariff is assumed
to be adjusted to absorb the impact on costs due to local inflation, with
the aim to meet the self-financing targets while maintaining a rate of return
of not less than 12% during the project period.
3.        Fuel/Bulk Power is derived directly from the planting schedule.
Steam produced at geothermal fields is assumed to be bought by PLN from the
agency responsible for generating it. The price of all fuel oil to PLN is
assumed raised to international levels by FY86.
4.        Operating Expenses have been forecast in detail taking into
account the facilities expected to be in use each year, and subject to local
cost inflation indices as at 1 above.
5.        Depreciation is based on the apaplication of PLN-s normal rates to
assets revalued annually as described at para. 8.
Funds Flow
6.        Financing.  Borrowing has been assumed for approximately 50% of
capital expenditures, including interest during construction.

- 89 -                     Page 5
7.        Capital Expenditures exclude costs of geothermal steam field
development which are assumed to be incurred by another agency.
Balance Sheet
8.        Fixed Assets are revalued annually according to the following
percentages:
FY84 ..... 11.5%
85 ..... 8.5%
86 on .....   6.5%
9.        Current Liabilities are assumed to increase by about 15% per annum.
