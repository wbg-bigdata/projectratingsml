1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Situated on the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula, the Republic of Yemen has a population of
some 20 million, of which about 75 percent live in rural areas, and a continuing high rate of
population growth. In 1999, Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the world with a GDP per
capita of only $320. The poverty rate was as high as 42 percent and 87 percent of the poor
population was illiterate or did not complete basic education levels (PRSP). Yemen ranked 133rd
among 162 countries in the Human Development Index in 1999.

Overall educational development was lagging behind other countries in the region. Access to
basic education was still low (primary gross enrollment rate: 64 percent), and equity of education
was suffering from large gender disparities in primary enrollment (GPI 0.4). While overall
expenditures on education in Yemen (7.7 percent of GDP) were relatively high in the MENA
region, the rapid growth of higher education was perceived as potential risk to basic education
since a significant proportion of the education budget was being allocated to higher education.
Thus, a balanced growth of all education levels, underpinned by stable financing, was a
development priority.

The key issues in higher education were related to rapid growth and its impact on quality,
institutional development, governance, finance and instruction. Between 1990 and 1998, public
enrollments more than quadrupled, from 35,000 to 155,000, with girls' participation increasing
from 5,700 to 31,000. Enrollment growth was distinctly unbalanced, mainly in education and
other nonscientific subjects, and bore little relation to Yemen's skill needs, qualitatively or
quantitatively, or to the sub-regional labor market in which Yemen was a traditional labor
exporter. Given the rapid growth of higher education, institutional capacity in the areas of
strategic planning, programming and budgeting, administration and management was weak.

Against this background, the Government requested the Bank's support in coping with the
challenges the higher education sector was facing. This Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) was
intended to respond to the capacity needs in the newly created Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research (MHESR) to implement major reforms aimed at strengthening post-secondary
education. It was intended to closely support the 1999 CAS by directly addressing two of the four
principal objectives: (a) creation of a modern public administration that provides public services
honestly and efficiently while encouraging private enterprise; and (b) development of an early
stream of social benefits in education, health and other services which directly address poverty.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original PDO was stated differently in the Credit Agreement and PAD:

PDO stated in the Credit Agreement:
The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in: (i) preparing, and carrying out, a
higher education reform strategy; and (ii) developing the capacity of the Ministry of Higher




                                                                                                 1

Education and Scientific Research (MHESR) to carry out major reforms aimed at the
strengthening of post-secondary education.

PDO in PAD: The development objective of HEP was to assist the MHSER in preparing a higher
education reform strategy and to pilot initial phases of its implementation.

Although the Credit Agreement would normally take precedence, for this ICR we are using the
definition from the PAD for two reasons: first the PAD definition is the only one that was
referred to in discussions and project documentation including ISRs throughout implementation;
and second, it is somewhat more closely aligned with the core PDO indicators.

         the measures piloted
     2: Strategic development plans linked with faculty budgets for Sana'a and Aden
         universities
     3: Budget execution with greater transparency and accountability between the university
         and faculties for resources.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO and Key Indicators were not formally revised. However, through the significant
expansion and realignment of the project during 2004-2006 which included eight new TA
contracts, objectives and indicators evolved substantially from what was initially planned under
the project and some indicators became irrelevant to assess the outcomes. In accordance with the
ICR guideline, we use the original indicators to evaluate the final outcomes although they do not
fully capture the intended outputs under the newly aligned TA activities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

At the initial stage, the target beneficiaries were the core staff at MHESR and the two universities
(Sana'a and Aden) chosen for the pilot. The project aimed at developing skills of key staff at the
Ministry and building capacity of faculty members in the area of strategic planning; policy
formulation, and leadership/technical skills required for autonomous management of universities.
Operational and administrative staff members in the universities were also considered as
beneficiaries to receive training for effective resource management. The project was also
expected to benefit the students and professors in selected faculties (medicine, education, and
commerce in Sana'a and Aden Universities) by improving the learning environment (through the
provision of ICT equipment and training, distance learning programs, and new curriculum and
pedagogy).

As the project significantly expanded its scope during 2004-2006 based on the Government's
decision to move from a narrow project-specific focus to a broad sector-wide approach, five other
public universities became beneficiaries. As a result, core staff at MHESR and faculty members
at all 7 public universities became beneficiaries under this project.




                                                                                                  2

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component I. Governance - US$1.8 million
This component was designed to support the Government in developing a financially sustainable
reform strategy and medium-term development plan for the sector, and a legislative and
institutional framework promoting improved governance and management. Specific activities
include: (a) the participative development of a national strategy for the reform of higher education
(HE) and the preparation of a medium-term investment program; (b) capacity building in the
MHESR; and (c) leadership and technical training to prepare the two universities for the
assumption of delegated managerial responsibility and accountability.

Expected Outputs
    (i)      Enhanced capacity in the MHSER for planning, policy formulation and finance
    (ii)     Key administrators and faculty at Sana'a and Aden universities trained in the
             leadership and technical skills necessary for the autonomous management of these
             institutions

Planned Activities at Entry

     Technical assistance focusing on the facilitation of the policy development process, the
         mentoring of core planning groups in the MHESR and the development of a broad policy
         dialogue, culminating in a national conference to validate the national higher education
         strategy, policies and financing.
     On-site professional development of key MHESR staff, with an emphasis on strategic
         planning and policy-making and the Ministry's technical advisory role with regard to the
         Higher Council of Higher Education. Contracting of local consultants to assist the
         Ministry in specific tasks, notably the drafting of legislation and regulations pertaining to
         the sector, with particular reference to the delegation of powers to the universities.
     Prepare Sana'a and Aden universities for enhanced governance and management
         responsibilities. This would include the development of the leadership skills of the rectors
         and their senior management teams, combining an exposure to international practice with
         a broader program of training for academic and non-academic staff in the two universities.
         Technical assistance would focus on preparing case studies and training materials
         reflecting best practices. Additionally, technical assistance would help identify and adapt
         an appropriate Management Information System (MIS) to serve the needs of the MHESR
         and higher education institutions. The MIS would encompass, inter alia, student
         admission and school records, student performance, faculty evaluations and career data,
         and unit costs and their financial data, so as to provide timely information for academic
         planning, budget preparation, financial control and quality assurance.

Component B. Finance - US$0.4 million
This component was to support the process of financial delegation to the two universities through:
the redesign of budget structures and procedures to facilitate flexible allocation of resources and
efficient expenditure, and through program budgets with contractual obligations in terms of
objectives and performance indicators. It would also assist in the development of an equitable
funding mechanism for universities, promoting competition and the achievement of priority
objectives such as the participation of girls and greater diversification of income through tailored,
on-demand courses and services. Finally, it would assist in the acquisition and adaptation of an
integrated MIS, including related training, permitting the timely tracking of financial transactions
as well as providing other key institutional management information serving the MHESR and the
two universities.


                                                                                                    3

Expected Outputs
    (i)      Adaptation of financial regulations, budget organization, systems and procedures,
             permitting delegation of authority to the universities.
    (ii)     Staff at Sana'a and Aden universities trained in program budgeting.
    (iii)    Development of equitable higher education funding formula with special incentives
             for meeting key program objectives.
    (iv)     Acquisition, installation and training relative to an MIS adapted to the needs of the
             MHESR and the pilot universities.

Planned Activities at Entry

     A review of current budget regulations and practices, and the formulation and testing of
         budget structures, categories and procedures which would facilitate the delegation of
         budget management to the institutional level and promote accountability.
     The design, preparation and testing, in close collaboration with the MOF and MHESR, of
         program budgets with clear benchmarks with regard to funding, program objectives and
         performance objectives.
     The development of a transparent formula for the allocation of public sector funding.
     The acquisition and adaptation of a financial management system, facilitation of the
         application of the allocation formula and the transfer and tracking of delegated funds.
     Training of financial planning and management staff in the pilot universities to prepare
         them for the delegation of financial responsibility by the MHESR.



Component C. Quality - US$3.15 million
This component would help improve learning and upgrade opportunities for students and
professors in selected faculties (medicine, education, commerce) by piloting strategic initiatives
with regard to the modernization of programs, related staff upgrading, independent study/research
via the Internet, and self-evaluation and accreditation.

Expected Outputs
    (i)      Programs (medicine, education and commerce) which reflect best practice and make
             effective use of ICT including distance learning.
    (ii)     Effective approaches to faculty upgrading piloted.
    (iii)    ICT infrastructure and software installed, operational and effectively utilized by key
             users.
    (iv)     Accreditation standards established for the private sector and measure for self-
             evaluation and external assessment piloted.

Planned Activities at Entry
     The evaluation, modernization and piloting of programs, building on renewal efforts
         already under way, together with the upgrading of the knowledge and teaching skills of
         the faculty and support staff.
     The support of program renewal, the design, development, and piloting of an ICT
         network linking the central libraries and faculty libraries, facilitating faculty and student
         exchanges via an intranet and providing access to the resources of the Internet.




                                                                                                    4

     Assistance to the two universities in initiating a process of self-evaluation and
         improvement, and the development of agreed standards which could be applied by other
         public sector universities as a basis for future accreditation.
     Internal assessment of a selected private institution and the design and piloting of a trial
         accreditation, to prepare for the early extension of accreditation to Yemen's private
         universities, based on rigorous and transparent quality standards.
     The credit would finance technical support by recognized specialists in the relevant
         disciplines, seconded by a university with the capacity to substitute or supplement staff as
         required, as well as to offer the perspective of longer term support through "twinning"
         arrangements.


1.6 Revised Components
The components were not formally revised during the project.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

Expansion of the Project Scope and Realignment of Activities

Starting in early 2004 through 2006, the emphasis in project activities gradually shifted away
from the original concept of piloting (in three faculties of two universities) to making a broader
impact across all seven universities. This was prompted by political pressure to expand the
benefits to more universities and by an increase in support from other donors following
development of the national strategy. In January 2004, the Government launched the Netherlands
Programme for Institutional Strengthening of Post-secondary Education and Training Capacity
(NPT), which entailed significantly expanded TA coverage similar to HEP's activities on
Governance. Thus, MHESR decided to move to a more integrated sector-wide approach to
implement the National Strategy, realigning activities and funds and giving the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU)1 responsibility for handling and coordinating both the HEP and Dutch
projects. The most significant agreed changes were as follows:

    o Under HEP's Governance Component, the planned subcomponent for strengthening
         capacity of the MHESR was moved to two Dutch-funded initiatives (NUFFIC NPT and
         NFP programs) beginning in May 2006. IDA funding was reallocated to the Quality
         component to cover new activities in strengthening core academic skills in universities.

    o Development of the MIS, under the HEP Governance Component, became one element
         within a much broader and more ambitious ICT Master Plan for Higher Education
         development, supported by the Dutch.

    o Under the Quality Component, plans for study tours, originally envisaged as essential
         preparation for piloting new procedures in the universities, were cancelled in favor of
         expanding in-country training to as many beneficiaries as possible.



1Project Coordination Unit was formerly called Credit Management Unit (CMU). After the mid-term-review, CMU
was renamed to PCU.




                                                                                                           5

     o The ambitions of the Finance Component were substantially reduced, through agreement
         on a revised RFP for the relevant TA. This was in response to the Ministry's assessment
         that the original TORs were highly unrealistic in terms of both the allocated budget and
         the time allowed. Several key activities, including development of the FMIS, were
         dropped completely. The development of a funding formula remained but without the
         focus on promoting participation of girls and other disadvantaged groups.

     o The preparation of university development plans, and the training and capacity building
         activities under all the components, would be extended on a national basis, instead of
         being confined to pilots in two universities.

Accordingly, over the course of two years from the initial discussion (2004), eight new TA
contracts were approved which deviated in some cases from the original HEP plans. Annex 3
provides a comparison of the HEP original outcome indicators and expected outputs of TA
contracts that were approved during 2005-2006.

The project was not formally restructured and the outcome indicators were not revised to reflect
these changes. Implementing capacity was not enhanced to match the increased scope.

Although the project underwent these changes which substantially affected the scope of project
activities and the intended outcomes, no formal restructuring was proposed and no revisions were
made to the PDO or intermediate outcome indicators. As a result, it is difficult to measure fairly
the project outcomes using the original indicators which are not fully comparable with the revised
activities and implied objectives. Moreover, the scaling up of the project entailed an increased
workload at the PCU where insufficient staffing and weak capacity in managing contracts were
long-standing issues. Although frequent discussions and consultations were undertaken between
the PCU and the Bank team before supporting this expansion, the capacity of the PCU was not
actually strengthened enough to manage and coordinate technically complex large-scale contracts
or to effectively integrate the IDA and Dutch-funded activities in one project unit.


Extension of Project Closing Date and Reallocation of the Credit

The first two years of project implementation were negatively impacted by various internal and
external factors: the looming war in Iraq prevented international consultants from entering the
country; leadership change at the MEHSR entailed a considerable time to reassure the
Government ownership of the project; resignation of the PCU director and difficulties in
appointing a replacement. In 2004-2005, progress was made in preparing the National Strategy
but more time was needed to implement the other planned activities. Therefore, the Government
requested an extension of the project by 18 months and, in July 2006, the Closing Date of the
project was amended from December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2008. The extension was intended to
serve two purposes: (i) to build on the momentum created after midterm review [December 2005]
to ensure that the project activities and outcomes would be achieved; and (ii) to ensure that there
would be no gap between the Higher Education Project and the proposed follow-up operation,
thus retaining capacity and continuity.

More specifically, the extension aimed at completing a five-year investment plan to carry out the
initial phases of the Higher Education Strategy and conduct new training activities among the
extended beneficiaries: core MHESR staff and faculty members in all 7 universities, in
collaboration with the Dutch donor program.


                                                                                                 6

In accordance with the Closing Date extension, the amendment of the Development Credit
Agreement, the reallocation of credit proceeds, and agreement on new activities were completed
in July 2006. The Government's request to increase the percentage of Operational Expenditures
to be financed by the Credit from 25 percent to 100 percent was also approved due to counterpart
funding constraints which stemmed from a low level of fund allocation by the MOF during the
early stages of the project.

Second Project Extension Declined

The challenges involved in procuring, managing and coordinating the multiple proposed activities
led to further delays in implementation and disbursement, prompting the Government's second
request to extend the Closing Date by 6 months to December 31, 2008. The request was not
approved for the following reasons:
   - continuing pattern of delays did not support confidence that important outcomes would be
      realized over the extension period
   - the agreed actions from the March 2008 supervision mission were not met
   - the first two milestone dates in the revised project procurement plan were not met
   - further information needed by the IDA Financial Management Specialist before clearing the
      project 2007 audit report had not been provided


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Despite some important strengths, project design and quality at entry are considered
unsatisfactory overall. The project design was based on the development context of Yemen's HE
institutions which was captured by frequent consultation meetings between the Bank and the
Ministry; thus, each component was planned to support the reform ideas of the Government and
the needs of HE institutions. According to staff interviews, at the time of project preparation, no


                                                                                                     7

other donor was willing to assist the Government on the development of a national strategy for
the higher education sector in Yemen. Many of the stakeholders were still unfamiliar with the
concepts behind the proposed reforms. Thus, the Bank appropriately chose a LIL as the funding
instrument since it aimed at "piloting" the initial reform plans. A participatory approach was
adopted in the design phase of the project by involving various stakeholders in the consultation
process.

However, the weak capacity of the newly established MHESR (established in 2001, a year prior
to this project's effectiveness) and the PCU, especially in Bank procurement procedures and
contract management skills, was not identified as a risk, although it became a major reason for
delays in implementation and disbursement. The original project goals and activities were overly
ambitious considering the very weak capacity of the Ministry and PCU as well as the low level of
human and physical capital in most higher education institutions. Some of the activities were
highly ambiguous with no clear description. For example, in the Finance Component, the PAD
states that the project would assist a number of highly challenging activities such as "the
development of an equitable funding mechanism for universities, promoting competition and the
achievement of priority objectives such as the participation of girls and greater diversification of
income through tailored, on-demand courses and services", and "financial delegation to the two
universities through the redesign of budget structure and procedures to facilitate flexible
allocation of resources and efficient expenditure, and through program budgets with contractual
obligations in terms of objectives and performance indicators". However, no detailed definitions,
description of the proposed process, or feasibility assessment were provided for the competitive
funding mechanism, diversification of income, enhanced participation of girls and disadvantaged
populations. Technical design was well founded in current international good practice but not
well matched to the country institutional context.

Since there was no major HE project immediately before HEP, lessons from earlier operations
were not available. There was one relevant ESW produced before the HEP design: "The
rationalization study in higher education sector in Yemen" which presents a holistic analysis of
the HE sector and provides potential coping strategies to deal with the challenges. Yet this study
was not directly cited in the PAD.

Readiness for implementation was not sufficient. Monitoring & Evaluation mechanisms should
have been provided in more concrete forms. The need or an M&E officer was not anticipated.
There were no concrete action plans at the project design stage. Similarly, measures to provide
strong support to familiarize the counterparts on Bank procedures and procurement rules should
have been planned at entry.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Significant Delays During the First Two Years

Due to external and internal factors, project implementation suffered in the first two years for the
following reasons:
        Travel to the country was restricted in 2003 (Iraq war) and, as a result, international TA
        was very limited
        The change of Ministry leadership during the first year of the project negatively affected
        government ownership of the project


                                                                                                   8

         There was no project coordinator between October 2003 and April 2004. The new project
         coordinator left less than a year later, without terminating the contract so the appointment
         of new coordinator was delayed until August 2005
         Lack of familiarity with Bank procurement rules and procedures resulted in the delay in
         contracting TA. The Government's new policy on consultancy selection (e.g. ceilings set
         by a Higher Tender Board) added steps to the process.

Improved Performance after Mid-Term Review

After the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in December 2005, project implementation came back to the
right track as both the external and internal issues occurring in the first two years were settled.
Thanks to the persistent concerted efforts made by the PCU and the Bank, the disbursement
accelerated (from 8 percent to 45 percent). The first PDO was achieved with the completion of
the National Strategy for Higher Education (approved and endorsed in March 2006), and the first
draft of the five-year investment plan was prepared and discussed. Furthermore, government
ownership appears to have deepened through the numerous workshops and consultations.

Expansion of the Scope and Realignment of the Activities after MTR

Starting in early 2004 and continued onto 2005-2006, the MHESR gradually moved towards an
integrated sector approach based on the National Development Strategy. Project activities were
strengthened and realigned mostly based on the National Strategy Implementation Plan rather
than original HEP design. Consequently, some HEP activities and outcome indicators became
less relevant for the project. Annex 3 provides an overview of the changes along with the
evolution of the project during 2004-2006. Originally, in accordance with the intended goals of
the LIL instrument, it was emphasized at entry that this project was to develop and test strategic
measures, which could be scaled up after successful piloting. Only two universities were selected
for the piloting; however, the scale was subsequently expanded to cover all seven universities. In
substance, the project shifted to large-scale reform actions rather than a quick, well-focused
targeted piloting. In addition to the overly ambitious goals set at entry, this enlarged scope and
realignment of the activities resulted in substantial challenge for the inexperienced and
understaffed PCU in drafting TORs, and handling the supervision and coordination of complex
TA and training contracts. This had a negative impact on overall project implementation. While
the initial design underestimated the time and the technical and political challenges of piloting
major reform of governance and financing in two universities, the realignment of activities
underestimated the management and coordination capacity needed to implement capacity
building interventions on a national level.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design at Entry is considered insufficient

At the appraisal stage, weak capacity in M&E was identified and the PAD clearly states that "the
concept of M&E is not well established in the newly created MHESR, nor in Yemen's public
administration. The support institution or consortium will be asked to give special attention to
transferring the concept and methodology of M&E to the PCU and to the leaders of the pilot
activity teams." However, the PAD does not mention in detail the specific monitoring methods
and steps to be taken, except in the area of financial management. The PAD states that the PCU
would be in charge of submitting semi-annual financial management monitoring reports
accompanied with other progress reports, and that the Bank Country Office would support and


                                                                                                   9

supervise the set up and functioning of an accounting system at PCU. Other types of support in
promoting M&E are not mentioned. Using a project launch conference as an initial intervention
to promote the concept of M&E was recommended but the evaluation report of the launch
workshop does not mention M&E aspects at all. There was no session dedicated for M&E on the
workshop agenda so it is unclear if it was discussed or if any training was provided during the
workshop.

M&E Implementation and Utilization are considered highly insufficient

Until a very late stage of the project, there was no M&E officer at the PCU, and thus there was no
systematic monitoring and evaluation conducted to track the progress of the project. The serious
need for constant project monitoring with clear indicators, and the urgent need to recruit an M&E
officer, were repeatedly addressed by supervision missions since 2006. Nevertheless, it took
almost 2 years to fill the M&E Officer position in February 2008, 4 months from the closing of
the project.

In the absence of an M&E officer, project progress and evaluation reports were not systematically
produced regularly as legally required. Those that were prepared did not include clear indicators
or adequate objective measures to monitor and evaluate the progress and outcomes of the project.
Throughout the project, only two progress reports and seven financial monitoring reports were
officially produced and recorded. Lack of M&E is part of the reason that the project failed to
promptly detect and prevent unnecessary delays and diversions in various aspects of the project.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Issues in Financial Management: Internal Controls were at Risk

During 2005-2006, after a Financial Management officer left the PCU to pursue another position,
the FM position was vacant for nine months. The accountant at the PCU became a FM officer and
there was no replacement for the accountant position. Supervision missions identified that the
project's internal controls were at risk; as only one person (FM manager) was solely in charge of
all aspects of accounting processes, e.g. entries, petty cash, bank reconciliation, payments, FMRs,
record keeping, preparation and follow-up of WAs, with no segregation of responsibilities. This is
inconsistent with basic accounting principles and standard practices. Thus, the Bank strongly
advised that the project recruit an Accountant to support the FM manager, especially during the
FY 2007 onwards where intensive financial transactions on the TA contracts were required.
However, as with the delayed appointment of the M&E officer, the appointment of a Project
Accountant was made only at a very late stage of the project. In 2007, missions repeatedly noted
that Internal Control was at risk; however, the agreed remedial action was not implemented until
the last few months of the project.

Procurement Issues: Effectiveness of the Procurement Workshop, Quality of Follow-up Support,
and the Capacity at the PCU

Lack of familiarity in Bank procurement posed serious delays in project implementation
especially in the beginning. This was not clearly identified as a risk at entry thus no clear
mitigation was prepared. When the problem was detected, the Bank responded by holding a
training workshop in procurement. However, participants in their evaluation of the project launch



                                                                                                10

workshop scored the session on procurement lowest (2.5 in 0-4 scale) among other items, which
generally received above 3.0 rating. Participants' evaluation on the financial management session
was also relatively unsatisfactory (2.67). There is no indication that any follow-up measures were
taken to enhance knowledge and understanding of the stakeholders on procurement issues. As the
project progressed, the PCU gained experience and improved performance in handling
procurement, but timely processing of the procurement and contract management remained a
challenge. In order to strengthen this capacity, the task team recommended strongly to the
Ministry in 2007 that an international consultant (contract management specialist) be hired
urgently, on a short term basis, but this was not implemented. Throughout much of the project,
there was insufficient delegation to the Procurement Officer at the PCU and his role remained
limited.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Under the HEP, a sound strategy has been agreed for the development of higher education and
substantial momentum has been created through broadening understanding of the problems and
the needed reforms and generating the demand for the reform. The project successfully enhanced
awareness within the sector concerning the kinds of changes that are needed. The project has also
helped to indicate some of the constraints to effective implementation of the strategy. The
Ministry prioritized the areas where continuing assistance from the Bank was considered most
important, within the context of overall donor support to the sector. As a result, the development
objective of the proposed Second Higher Education Project is to improve the quality and
relevance of selected programs in Yemen's universities and to maintain the momentum on longer
term reform of university finance and governance. This project is under preparation with
assistance of a Japanese PHRD grant and proposed Project Preparation Advance. The Ministry is
recruiting a new team for grant administration and project management. Project design will
benefit from the experience of the HEP. In particular, close attention is being given to ensuring (i)
that the project's scope and ambitions are matched to implementing capacity, (ii) that reforms are
realistically prioritized and sequenced, and (iii) that institutional capacity is built in the
universities. The agreed activities in the course of preparation and under the project itself include
strong efforts to strengthen the project management and coordination capacity of the Ministry.
While the HEP succeeded as a catalyst for increasing support to higher education from other
donors, the second project will aim to establish a sustainable framework for coordinating and
channeling development assistance from all sources.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The overall relevance of project objectives was high, both at the time of preparation and at
completion. The LIL was intended to support the 1999 CAS by directly addressing two of the
four principal objectives. MHESR was just established and in great need of support in developing
the core strategy to better guide the reform; the Bank's involvement through this LIL was timely
and relevant to the country's increased demand for an improved higher education system.
However, the project design was overly ambitious at entry (see section 2.1) and continued to
expand instead of exploring more realistic and feasible options. Although the "relevance" of the



                                                                                                  11

PDO itself remained high throughout the project life, actual design and changes during the
implementation were beyond the scale of LIL, far exceeding the capacity of PCU and HE
institutions.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

PDO: The development objective of HEP was to assist the MHSER in preparing a higher
education reform strategy and to pilot initial phases of its implementation.

The project fully achieved its first objective of preparing a higher education reform strategy but
largely failed to implement the proposed piloting of reforms in two universities. Instead of
piloting the introduction of new financing mechanisms and procedures related to performance, it
focused on broader initiatives to build capacity across the sector and increase understanding of
and readiness for the proposed reforms.

Through the gradual evolution of the project, which resulted in significant realignment in project
activities and implied objectives, the project broadened its scope to expand the beneficiaries. The
realignment was geared to coordinating donor assistance to implement the national strategy as a
whole rather than the original piloting functions of the LIL. TA activities were added mostly
based on a 5-year implementation plan for the HE national strategy, thus some parts deviated
from what was initially planned (see Annex 3). Annex 2 presents a detailed summary of
achievements (outputs) by component. In accordance with the ICR guideline, the original
outcome indicators are used here to assess the achievement of project objectives. Unfortunately,
these indicators, which were not revised, are not fully consistent with the aims of the realigned
project activities.

The outcomes in relation to the three PDO outcome indicators were as follows:

    1.   A strategic plan and multi-year development program, with donor support, building on
         the measures piloted

Under the project, a sound National Strategy for Higher Education was developed through a
consultative process including university and government stakeholders. Reaching consensus
among stakeholders on this document was a significant achievement of the project. The strategy
was approved by Cabinet and endorsed at a national conference in 2006 and five-year
implementation plans were prepared. The first sector-wide investment program for HE was
included in the government's five-year plan. The strategy and implementation plans were
published and disseminated widely, including at a national conference in March 2008. Adoption
of the strategy contributed to a substantial increase in donor interest in supporting the sector
(totaling some $40 million by the end of the project). The Ministry is using the strategy as a
framework for coordinating donor assistance to the sector. There remain considerable challenges
for effective coordination, including the need for formal mechanisms and for accepted individual
university development plans but an important basis has been established.


    2.   Strategic development plans linked with faculty budgets for Sana'a and Aden
         universities


                                                                                                12

The work on strategic development planning was extended from two to all seven of Yemen's
universities. The project provided technical assistance, development workshops, and other
assistance to the universities. However, only two universities completed the exercise and only one
of the plans is considered satisfactory. The project demonstrated the scale of the challenge in
building the capacity of the universities in planning and budgeting, a lesson which is incorporated
in preparation of the follow-on project. With regard to linking plans to faculty budgets, this was
not achieved. As explained below, plans have been developed for new mechanisms and
procedures for HE financing and budgeting have not yet been piloted.


    3.   Budget execution with greater transparency and accountability between the university
         and faculties for resources

Through the project, a Budget and Financial System Plan with formula funding has been
developed and approved but has not yet been implemented even on a pilot basis. Development of
the FMIS was dropped from the project. Actual budget execution practices at the central and
university levels have not yet significantly changed and there is no evidence that the project
achieved "greater transparency and accountability" between the university and faculty resources.
The project did carry out training of Ministry and university members in university management
and finance, as well as workshops on the funding formula, to help prepare for introduction of the
new budget and financial system. The effectiveness of this training was not rigorously assessed.
The agreed funding formula, which is intended to replace the existing inequitable and inefficient
system, has the potential to introduce special incentives for meeting key objectives, such as
increasing access of women and the poor. However, since it has not yet been implemented, the
relevant intermediate outcome indicators  related to transparency of income and expenditures,
and annual reporting on implementation results  could not be met:

The project also aimed to strengthen capacity in the new MHESR through TA, professional
development, and establishment of an MIS to serve the needs of the Ministry and the HE
institutions. This component was integrated with on-going Dutch projects for ministry
strengthening and an HE ICT Master Plan. These projects absorbed the Ministry strengthening
component of HEP and established an ICT center for higher education. Within the ICR Master
Plan, the HEP financed software development, hardware, and training for one module of the MIS
 for student registration  which is functioning on a pilot level. Other modules have yet to be
implemented. These activities have not yet had a major impact on the capacity of the Ministry
which still lacks access to an adequate current information base for policy and planning.

Outcomes of the project activities geared to quality improvement were mixed. The goal of
piloting renewal of medicine, education and commerce programs was not successfully achieved
but a beneficiary survey conducted for the ICR found that training in professional skills (English,
computer and pedagogical skills) was highly appreciated and found to be useful by recipients.
Some progress was made in quality assurance and accreditation, although the target indicators
were not fully achieved. Self-evaluation was conducted at selected faculties and relevant training
was provided, but a specific guideline was not produced as planned. For the accreditation, the
contractor delivered draft standards for accreditation of private HE institutions, but these were not
formally endorsed or adopted. A proposal for a National Accreditation Council (NAC) and
Quality Assurance System was prepared. The MHESR's proposal for a semi-autonomous NAC
was recently approved by Cabinet and sent to the universities for their comments.




                                                                                                  13

Although the overall learning outcomes of the project are considered substantial, through the
broad inclusion of stakeholders in dialogue on the national strategy and through workshops and
training related to the proposed reforms, the intended learning from the experience of the project
activities was more limited than expected from a LIL. A number of the project's intermediate
outcome indicators were not met due to the lack of M&E. For example, indicator 1 required the
project to officially assess the effectiveness of TA at least twice (mid-term-review and project
closing) by employing external reviewers' evaluation. However, such evaluation was never
conducted throughout the project. Similarly, indicator 4 mandates the project to collect "student
and faculty feedback" on the faculty upgrading pilot but these were not systematically conducted,
thus only a limited amount of faculty feedback (no student feedback) was available. Indicator 5 is
also about examining the cost-effectiveness of the training modules for faculty upgrading.
Numerous training and workshops were provided for the faculty knowledge and skills upgrading,
yet no rigorous assessment was conducted focusing on the cost-effectiveness or other
perspectives.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Examination of actual spending against project outcomes indicates limited efficiency. The project
spent only 45% (1.8 SDR million/2.73 US$ million) of the total credit (4.1 SDR million/5.0
US$ million). When the accounts have been closed, the final disbursement figure is expected to
be somewhat higher, due to payments made during the four months after project closing.
Disbursement was initially slow due to the early phase implementation delays. Also, the
fluctuation in exchange rate between the US dollar and SDR increased the dollar value of the
credit from US$5.0 million to almost US$6.5 million. Although the disbursement rate increased
from 5 percent to 16 percent by mid 2006 and commitments increased after November 2007
(from 51.5 percent to 65 percent), disbursements remained low due, in particular, to the time
spent on procurement and coordination of contracts on major TA activities. Given that a large
number of planned activities remained incomplete even with an extension of the project closing,
it is considered that the credit resources were neither fully utilized nor effectively spent to
efficiently achieve the project objectives.



3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project was highly relevant to the demand of MHESR and HE institutions and produced
certain critical outputs. It successfully raised awareness and demand for HE reform among
various stakeholders and contributed to strengthen the capacity of core members of MHESR and
university faculty especially in the area of academic and ICT skills. Some capacity building
activities surpassed original goals in terms of the number of training beneficiaries thus the project
succeeded to create momentum for HE reform and contributed to overall capacity development in
HE institutions and the Ministry, improving the preparedness on a national level for
implementing difficult reforms.

Reaching consensus on a sound national strategy for development of the higher education sector
was a major achievement of the project. However, the main objectives of each component were



                                                                                                  14

not fully achieved, as described in detail in Annex 2 (Outputs by Component) and included in the
Borrowers' ICR. For example, the National Strategy was approved but the related legislative and
institutional framework to support new governance, management and financing arrangements, has
not yet been fully accomplished. Although training coverage was widened from what was
originally envisaged as "piloting" to cover all universities, the benefits of the training was not
fully proven due to lack of systematic evaluation. A beneficiary survey showed mixed outcomes
in participants' rating on the level of satisfaction, perceived relevance and effectiveness of
training. Although the project achieved the first PDO and produced some positive impact to the
HE sector as a whole, it widely missed various targets to be measured by outcome indicators.
Overall, the project succeeded in widely providing awareness-raising and training in all relevant
fields to HE officials, but was not fully effective in bringing a profound impact to change the
practice at institutional or sector levels. Considering all these facts, overall outcome is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Although enhancing gender equity was part of the Finance Component, the objective of
improving access to HE among disadvantaged population (e.g., girls in rural areas) by employing
an equitable funding formula was not achieved as the developed formula was not piloted. Most of
the activities were dropped based on the Government's judgment that it was overly ambitious to
work within the given the timeframe and the difficulty in obtaining political will to overhaul the
financing system involving numerous inter-ministerial reform actions.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The project succeeded in generating broad awareness and a level of consensus in the HE sector on
the problems and the reform needs through the training and the participatory approach in
preparing and disseminating the national strategy. It created a clear momentum and demand for
reform. Considering that understanding of the reform principles was extremely limited within the
sector at the start of the project, this was a considerable achievement and provides an important
basis for the major institutional changes that are envisaged under the strategy. A draft law has
been prepared to support these institutional reforms, although it needs further work and has not
yet been adopted. Actual implementation of the governance and financing reforms was not
piloted under the project, as originally intended. Strong government commitment to successful
reform led to extra efforts in donor coordination in the HE sector. This progress encouraged other
donors to actively engage in HE development projects, and to provide additional funding for the
sector.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The expansion of the scope of the project, from two pilot universities to the sector as a whole,
may have diluted the benefits but greatly increased the number of beneficiaries. As demonstrated
in a national conference held by the Ministry in 2008, training and workshop activities under the
project contributed to a greatly increased level of understanding of the issues facing the sector,
and breadth of stakeholder engagement in the dialogue on reform.




                                                                                                 15

A number of policy developments during the course of project implementation were not explicit
goals of the project but were outcomes in large part of the project-supported dialogue on national
strategy for the sector. Some of the problems identified at the time of preparation, such as
unbalanced growth/spending among education sub-sectors, were addressed through policy
changes during project implementation. The public accepted a major decision by the Government
to reduce the pressures imposed by uncontrolled growth of higher education and facilitate internal
reform. New admissions were cut by 50 percent with regard to the previous year. This policy is
ongoing and resulted in setting an admission ceiling by the Higher Council of Universities of
80,000 students: 55,000 to be admitted in public universities and 25,000 in private universities in
the academic year 2008-2009. Similarly, the strategic dialogue initiated through HEP contributed
indirectly to development of a rationalization plan (approved by the Cabinet in fall 2008),
defining primary and secondary fields of specialization among Yemen's universities. This plan
provides a strong basis for the development of individual universities' development plans and
priority programs, to be supported under the proposed Second Higher Education Project.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

A Beneficiary Survey was conducted from August to October 2008 to obtain the latest feedback
from participants in training and workshop activities financed by the project. Data was collected
through questionnaires and interviews. One hundred questionnaires were distributed and 43
people responded. Due to the lack of an M&E system at the PCU, record keeping on the total
number of workshops/participants was poor, thus lack of robust data and inadequate information
made it difficult to examine outcomes of most of the training sessions. Therefore, this survey
focuses only on recent training activities.

The Questionnaire explores the participants' perceptions of the effectiveness and relevance of
training as well as the impact on their actual work practice. In terms of the "motivation to attend
the training", most people attended the training "to network and share information" and evaluated
the training as highly effective mostly in "enhancing relations with officials and colleagues" and
indicated that the workshop "enhanced feeling of belonging to HE sector and helped enhance
accountability and commitment to work." Thus, training succeeded in providing the forum to
network and share knowledge and information among HE institutions, and helped enhance
awareness and a sense of belonging to the HE sector.

Furthermore, the majority of respondents agreed that training on professional development
(teaching/research skills and ICT skills) achieved its objectives; contents were clear and easy to
understand; and the quality was high. When asked if the training actually improved their
performance, 77 percent agreed that it had a positive impact and that they were willing to apply
the knowledge on the job, especially in the area of pedagogy (e.g., implementing more critical
and creative teaching; effective use of ICT).

On a critical note, the majority of respondents found that the allocated time for training was not
sufficient and the contents were overly theoretical rather than practical. Similarly, as many as 80
percent of respondents said that the training was below their expectations in terms of its
usefulness. Moreover, interviews revealed that some training failed to reach its targeted audience.
Thus, intended objectives to train high level university staff (e.g., Deans, Vice Deans) were not
fully accomplished in the finance component. Many responded that convenient timing and
location of the training was essential to ensure full participation. Some faculty members were not



                                                                                                16

able to attend the whole session due to difficulties in allocating the required time and in
commuting to the venue during the semester.

Although the overall content of training was considered clear and easy to understand, many
people complained in the interview that it contained too much information and data in a number
of short presentations which were hard to digest or even remember. About 27 percent of
participants do not even remember the title and topic of the workshop they attended, and some
attributed that to the overwhelming amount of information put in a tight training schedule. Often
times the presentation was said to be about showcasing successful "international experience"
which does not always apply to the Yemeni context. The majority of respondents expressed their
dissatisfaction and anger that the PCU failed to provide the promised training attendance
certificate. They were also dissatisfied that in their workplace environment, higher level authority
nominates staff to attend trainings without regard to individual need and nominees felt they had to
attend the trainings for which they were nominated.

Thirty-five percent of respondents say they have not implemented any changes in or acquired
skills relevant to their daily work. When asked what type of support they would need to apply the
newly acquired knowledge/skills, the majority pointed out that gaining financial support and
establishing an incentive scheme and administrative autonomy to reward actions is crucial. It was
also identified that political will (altering existing laws and regulations) is necessary to facilitate
and implement changes.

In summary, the survey shows that training on academic skills was highly successful but the
effectiveness of other training, aimed at preparing staff for enhancing governance, accountability
and financial autonomy, was weaker. Training was also effective in providing networking
opportunity for the participants, which contributed to their strengthened sense of belonging to HE
institutions. The survey revealed various views of the beneficiaries on training and their interests
and expectations towards continuous training for their professional development. Momentum and
demand for continuous assistance is high. It suggests that HE institutions and staff can greatly
benefit from such training activities but that adequate modifications and further improvement on
several aspects --- including timing, locations, practical contents/options, as well as matching the
training with individual needs and actual on-going reform initiatives ---
is necessary to maximize the effectiveness of the training.



4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

The project was highly successful in raising awareness towards HE reform among various HE
stakeholders, generated policy discussions to shape the demands for further reform actions
underpinning the National Strategy. The momentum was created and sustained through project
implementation. Some significant policy and regulatory steps have been taken and there is strong
Government commitment to moving ahead on the reform agenda. Still, the political and
institutional constraints to the actual implementation of the proposed reforms are considerable
and sustainability of the progress made under HEP will depend both on continuity in political will
and on continuing support from external development partners. The government has requested
continuing support from the Bank through a Second Higher Education Project which is under
preparation. In close coordination with activities of other donors, this project is intended to take a
more sequenced and realistic approach to implementing reforms of university governance and




                                                                                                    17

finance, while supporting the capacity of universities themselves to assess and meet their
development needs through subprojects to improve the quality and relevance of their programs.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Unsatisfactory

A participatory approach was taken to solicit feedback from various stakeholders, and their
feedback was well reflected in the initial project design. This project was perceived relevant and
necessary, meeting the demands of the government as well as HE institutions at the time of
preparation, for a holistic framework to encompass governance, finance, and quality reforms.
However, the requirements for the proposed full piloting of entirely new and coordinated
procedures for university finance, governance and performance assessment were underestimated.
The design was overly ambitious considering the country's readiness, level of experience, and
capacity. This was the first project of its kind; there was no similar project prior to HEP from
which to draw lessons; thus the development of a national strategy itself was quite challenging,
making it necessary to have a rigorous assessment of feasibility of some of the key activities. In
the PAD, some of the proposed activities were ambiguously described; and corresponding PDO
outcome indicators were poorly defined (e.g., development of competitive fund; student aid;
FMIS; cost-effective training module) and weakly related to the project description. Detailed
implementation plans and measures for procurement support, technical supervision and M&E
mechanism should have been solidly established from the outset to better assist the government.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Although the PAD states that close supervision would be provided by the World Bank Yemen
country office, especially for accounting and financial management; it was difficult to ensure
consistent, quality fiduciary support throughout the project due to capacity constraints at the
country office. For some portions of the implementation period, there was strong support to the
Ministry and the PCU from the country office on Bank operational procedures, procurement
guidelines, questions on managing contract revisions, and financial management issues, but for
much of the time this was not the case. Given the very weak capacity at the PCU, on-going
supervision in the field was critical in moving things forward. Although the Bank team made
considerable efforts in keeping close communications with the project counterparts via phone and
e-mail, these virtual communications often did not have the same impact on productivity at PCU
compared to their engagement during missions when the task team was actually in the field..

The TTL and other team members changed four times during the life span of the project. This
frequent turnover of the staff resulted in discontinuity and inconsistency in the quality of
technical supervision. Although the project was small, the technical and policy content was high
and the needs  in reviewing and advising on TORs and consultant reports, supporting
management and coordination of large TA contracts, maintaining policy dialogue with the



                                                                                               18

government and collaboration with other donors  were underestimated. For much of the project
period, the assigned TTLs were seriously overloaded and sector management was slow to correct
this. Over a period of more than a year, only one brief field visit was made and no aide memoire
was recorded. The ISR for the mid-term review was recorded 11 months after the review took
place. Three out of eleven ISRs were recorded 2-3 months after the mission. Overall, the
reporting and record keeping at the Bank was not fully satisfactory.

In the period leading up to mid-term review in 2005, the project explicitly expanded its scope by
merging with other donors' programs and extended its beneficiaries. Discussion and consultation
concerning the project expansion started in 2004 and the Bank consistently supported the
Government's request to move towards a sector-wide perspective. However, despite the
expansion of project scope and the dropping of some of the original objectives/activities, a formal
revision of the project was never proposed. The Bank issued non-objection to modifications of
contracts  such as dropping the FMIS  without commenting on the possible implications for
meeting project objectives and indicators. It was also pointed out in TA contractors' interviews
that the Bank did not effectively provide the forum to discuss and enforce the linkage between
HEP objectives and respective TA activities. Although the capacity of the PCU was known to be
very weak, the increase in capacity requirements  for procurement, technical coordination and
management of 8 large-scale international TA contracts covering multiple universities, and
related M&E  were not explicitly addressed.

Ratings in ISRs were unrealistic, with PDO progress rated "satisfactory" even though the
disbursement and overall implementation was very slow, with missed deadlines repeatedly for
planned activities, and the (legally required) six-monthly reports were not available to
substantiate the progress. These problems were not raised forcefully in management review. Until
the last year of the project, ISRs failed to highlight the disconnect between planned activities and
the agreed indicators. If the team had focused fully on the implications of the changes proposed
by the Ministry and considered a formal restructuring, the trade offs and the capacity
requirements could have been better taken into account and the indicators revised to match agreed
revised objectives. As it was, the Ministry was not fully aware until a late stage that the project
would be judged in terms of the original indicators.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Performance is rated unsatisfactory for both quality at entry and supervision. Project design and
implementation arrangements did not account sufficiently for the specific country institutional
context. Despite periods of intensive effort, supervision was inconsistent in both fiduciary and
technical aspects and did not rise to the challenges of a complex project in a new sector with a
newly established Ministry. ISR ratings were sometimes more optimistic than candid. Most
significant, the Bank failed to provide essential guidance to the Ministry concerning the
implications of expanding the project scope and changing the implied project objectives.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory



                                                                                                 19

Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MHESR):
MHESR had the overall responsibility for implementing the HEP, through its PCU. The Ministry
played a strong role in many respects: facilitating the development of the National Higher
Education Strategy and gaining Cabinet approval; following up to ensure the needed counterpart
funding and requested further funds from MOF; establishing and strengthening institutional
relationships with sector donors, government partners, and the universities. MHESR strived to
build capacity quickly despite various obstacles. However, the commitment of the Government
was not consistently high throughout the project; especially in the first two years, the project
suffered from fluctuating ownership and government leadership. Cumbersome approval
procedures were considered responsible for some delays and interruptions to smooth project
implementation. Efforts to recruit and maintain the full complement of staff for the PCU were
unsuccessful.

Steering Committee (SC):
The project's SC was expected to meet at least twice a year to discuss semi-annual and annual
progress reports, WB supervision mission reports, and to identify issues and undertake necessary
actions. The SC was to play an important role in quality control in project management. However,
the SC held only one meeting annually, on average. The PCU has reported that this could be due
at least in part to lack of sufficient communication between PCU and SC and inadequate
reporting and M&E arrangements to disseminate data and information to the SC and other
concerned institutions, resulting in a deterioration of SC involvement.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Project Coordination Unit (Formerly Credit Management Unit):
The PCU, in charge of day-to-day management of the project, has been highly committed and
contributed significantly to producing positive results and achieving project objectives. It
experienced a period of absence in leadership due to the resignation of the project director. It also
suffered from serious staff shortage stemming from the difficulty in recruiting staff in a timely
fashion. The Ministry and the PCU were insufficiently proactive in recruitment. Roles and
responsibilities among PCU staff were not adequately shared or delegated; thus, the director's
role was often over-stretched, making it difficult to maintain project implementation. Proper and
timely adjustment did not take place when the decision was made to expand the project scope.
The PCU was faced with managing 8 large tenders despite its weak capacity. The PCU had only
one procurement officer and one financial management officer. Proposed staffing readjustments,
including revision of TORs and modifying the division of labor, were not made quickly and were
not adequately documented. Similarly, measures to solve fiduciary issues, such as strengthening
financial management with the addition of an accountant, were neglected for a protracted period.
Project monitoring, documentation and reporting were seriously deficient.

HE Institutions:
There were seven participating universities ultimately involved in the project at the institutional
level. The universities demonstrated strong commitment and cooperation in project
implementation. The senior staff, faculty members and administrators took part in project
consultations prior to and during implementation and were involved in coordinating activities and
resolving implementation issues. Thus, the partnership between the MHESR/PCU and the HE
institutions was strengthened. However, at the individual level, some faculty members were not
fully engaged. The PCU reports that this has to do with insufficient transparency in decision
making processes and a weaker level of ownership and autonomy below the senior level.


                                                                                                  20

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

As stated above, both MHESR and PCU were deeply committed and played crucial roles in
coordinating other partners and relevant HE institutions. The Borrower showed excellent
performance in raising and maintaining the reform momentum among various stakeholders.
However, actions to ensure quality staffing were scarce and slow in coming. The understaffed
PCU could not perform its best both in TA contract management and financial management.
Action plans prepared and agreed during each supervision mission were rarely carried out as
agreed and delays became "default" practice. As stated in the Borrowers'ICR, there was a time in
the early years of the project when conflict between MHESR and PCU created serious obstacles
in project implementation. Active coordination, information sharing and respect for the stated
roles of the PCU and MHESR in project implementation would have helped to avoid certain
delays and would have resulted in better outcomes in overall project management . As the PCU is
part of MHESR and their office is located in the Ministry, the Ministry often counted on the PCU
for tasks unrelated to HEP, according to the borrowers' ICR. If PCU roles had been clearly
defined and respected, this could have minimized issues arising from leadership changes in either
the PCU or the Ministry. Although not all implementation delays stemmed from MHESR and
PCU, the Borrower performance was often weak in maintaining consistent leadership,
productivity and responsiveness to adequately deal with significant issues. The Borrower failed to
meet its legal commitment with respect to progress reports. Considering these factors, overall
Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Importance of Participatory Approach:

Although the project did not achieve all its objectives  especially in actual piloting of
innovations  it did have an important impact on learning, dialogue and consensus building
within the sector with respect to the national strategy for higher education and the proposed
reforms. These achievements can be attributed to the strong government ownership of the project
(after the initial two years) and to the emphasis placed throughout implementation on broadening
the participation of university stakeholders, through dialogue, workshops, consultative
mechanisms and extensive training activities.

Adequate Staffing and Well-defined, Well-balanced Workload at PCU:

It is crucial to ensure adequate staffing and management at the PCU prior to project start-up. This
requires that TORs for each staff member be clearly defined in advance with sufficient salary to
attract qualified candidates. Insufficient staffing and inadequate allocation of responsibilities
among team members was one of the major factors that contributed to the project implementation
delays. It is important to establish a realistic PCU staffing and hiring plan, including back-up
plans for the in the event of team members' resignation. Although the recruitment of qualified
staff is difficult and takes a long time, serious delays result during the absence of critical staff
(e.g., Project Coordinator and Financial Management Officer positions were vacant for over a
year).




                                                                                                 21

Central Role of M&E in Keeping the Project on Track:

It is crucial to have a rigorous monitoring and evaluation plan for all project activities to detect
obstacles at early stages and act quickly to prevent worsening of the problem and delay in
implementation. Furthermore, it is important to regularly evaluate the quality of TA activities.
Throughout the implementation of this project, there was no solid and systematic evaluation of
the effectiveness and relevance of TA activities except for contractors' final reports which
contained general self-assessment on their TA activities. Most of the activities were not assessed
against HEP original objectives or output indicators. Keeping decision makers informed of
project progress is critical for appropriate readjustment of project scope and activities. M&E
plays a key role in this as it enables the effective collection and dissemination of data and
information to a wider group, including beneficiaries. As seen with the diminished role of the
Steering Committee, the absence of M&E resulted in missed opportunities to effectively guide the
project as the implementation environment evolved.

Consistent Focus on Prompt "Piloting" Purposes to Make the Most of LIL Instrument:

"Pilot" activities should not be significantly scaled up during the implementation of a LIL unless
this is based on systematic assessment and clear justification of the change in approach in
response to changed circumstances.       A LIL is an instrument that pilots small-scale, innovative
approaches to be scaled up in the future upon reviewing the success of initial piloting. In this
project, the expanded project scope reduced the focus on piloting, learning and innovation and
added complexity and cumbersome processes of project activities such as TOR revisions and
contract management, which were beyond the technical and administrative capacity of the PCU.
It is more realistic to maintain simple, well- targeted activities. Proposals to expand project scope
should be carefully assessed in terms of expected benefits, trade offs, and feasibility of
implementation.

Timely Restructuring of the Project to Better Reflect Numerous Substantial Changes:

Project re-structuring should be considered at any time during project implementation if
substantial changes are being proposed by the Borrower or additional donor resources become
available in an evolving environment. This project should have been considered for restructuring
to reflect a changing government approach to reform and to re-align new objectives with revised
outcome indicators. The design was already overly ambitious at entry and continued to expand
instead of focusing on "piloting" of well-selected activities. Although the project had evolved
away from the purposes of a LIL, no formal restructuring was sought. It is difficult to measure the
progress against previously set indicators when activities and targeted beneficiaries have been
substantially changed. To clarify the new objectives/activities and ways to measure the progress,
timely restructuring of the project is essential. It was also stated in interviews with the major TA
contractors that the linkage between HEP project objectives and new TA activities needed to be
reinforced more often. Some TA contractors did not even know which "HEP Component" their
activities were supporting, and were not fully aware of the overarching goals of HEP. This
apparent disconnect could have been avoided by a formal revision to establish a synergy between
the HEP design and the new TA activities.

Comments on the draft ICR from the implementing agency make clear that, from their
perspective, the project was more successful than indicated in the ICR ratings. They felt that
broadening the scope of the project had important benefits that were not adequately reflected in
the assessment. It was addressed that the agency was not thoroughly informed of the ICR
evaluation methods (i.e., using the original PDO indicators) until late in the project.

It was emphasized that the shift from a project-oriented narrow approach to a wider sector-wide
approach was necessary and timely, responding to the demand from HE institutions arising from
work on the strategy and to the involvement of additional donors. It was also stressed that the
project succeeded in enhancing donor coordination and raising public awareness towards HE
reform based on the national strategy. Significantly, the expansion of project activities to all
universities had an important impact in building the new MHESR's relationships with the
universities and establishing its role in the sector.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The main achievements and unfulfilled goals are highlighted below to clarify to what extent
originally intended outputs have been produced per Component.

Under the Governance component, progress was partially satisfactory in achieving:
             (a) the participative development of a national strategy for the reform of HE and the
                 preparation of a medium term investment program
             (b) capacity building of university faculty and staff in the area of core academic
                 skills and other professional development

However, objectives not accomplished include:
             (c) capacity building of the MHSER to enhance planning, and policy formulation
             (d) leadership and technical training to prepare the two universities for the
                 assumption of delegated managerial responsibility and accountability.

Overall, the main purpose of the "Governance" initiative was to enhance leadership and skills to
transform institutions to become more "autonomous" and "accountable". However, staff
interviews and evaluations by the TA contractors show that this was not sufficiently achieved as
this area of capacity in HE institutions remain very weak. Moreover, under some TA activities,
the original focus on providing training to strengthen governance structure became quite blurred.
Capacity building of Ministry in the area of policy formulation and strategic planning was
transferred to Dutch program in 2005 along with the realignment of activities, and limited TA
was provided by HEP. Despite the efforts by IDA and Dutch TA programs, the Ministry capacity
in leadership and policy formulation were not significantly improved. On the contrary, the
beneficiary survey shows that TA on strengthening academic and technical skills among
university and Ministry staff was relevant and effective in supporting their professional
development. Development of a holistic Management Information System (YHEMIS) was
reduced in scale and resulted in the development of a Student Registration System (SRS) only as
opposed to the initially intended four areas: Students Academic Records (SAR), Academic and
Management Affairs (AMA), Higher Education Research (HER) and General Services (GS).

Under the Finance component, progress was moderately satisfactory in:
             (a) the development of an equitable funding mechanism for universities

Progress was unsatisfactory in most of the originally stated goals:
             (b) the redesign of budget structures and procedures to facilitate flexible allocation
                 of resources and efficient expenditure, and through program budgets with
                 contractual obligations in terms of objectives and performance indicators
             (c) the development of an equitable funding mechanism for universities, promoting
                 competition and the achievement of priority objectives such as the participation
                 of girls and greater diversification of income through tailored, on-demand
                 courses and services
             (d) development of FMIS and related training

An assessment of current policies and practices in financial management at the two universities
were conducted, and funding formulas were developed. Relevant training was conducted to
familiarize university staff how to use the formula. However, these were not implemented or
pilot-tested. The originally stated objective of the acquisition and adaptation, permitting the



                                                                                                25

timely tracking of financial transactions as well as providing other key institutional management
information, serving the MHESR and the two universities has not been achieved as the
development of FMIS was dropped. The objective to achieve gender equity in HE enrollment
through the establishment of an equitable funding mechanism was not examined as the developed
formula was not piloted. Some of the key activities were totally dropped (e.g. development of
FMIS; student aid) and thus this component was the least successful.


Under the Quality component, progress was satisfactory only in the initial phases of all TA
activities and it would still require considerable follow-up in order to accomplish the targeted
value:

            (a) the evaluation, modernization and piloting of professional programs, building on
                 renewal efforts already under way, together with the upgrading of the knowledge
                 and teaching skills of the faculty and support staff
            (b) program renewal, the design, development, and piloting of an ICT network
                 linking the central libraries and faculty libraries, facilitating faculty and student
                 exchanges via an intranet and providing access to the resources of the Internet;
            (c) assistance to the two universities in initiating a process of self-evaluation and
                 improvement and the development of agreed Quality Assurance standards which
                 could be applied by other public sector universities, as a basis for future
                 accreditation
            (d) internal assessment of a selected private institution and the design and piloting of
                 a trial accreditation, to prepare for the early extension of accreditation to Yemen's
                 private universities, based on rigorous and transparent quality standards.

Training to strengthen academic and ICT skills among university faculty members was widely
provided and exceeded the originally intended number of beneficiaries. The training was
concentrated on the upgrading of teaching/research skills, English language, and computer skills.
The total number of trainers trained was about six times larger than the initial target and the
participants' feedback shows that the training was highly effective in enhancing their work
performance. Thus, under the Quality component, satisfactory progress was made on professional
skills development activities.

However, in most of other major activities, only the initial stage (assessment of current situation;
needs assessment for facility and training; and design of implementation plan) was complete but
actual accomplishment was very limited. For instance, under the "twinning arrangement", current
programs in three faculties in Sana'a and Aden universities were assessed but guidelines for the
specific program redesign were not prepared as planned. Similarly, for the e-library system, the
current situation and needs of library systems at central and selected faculties in Sana'a, Aden,
and Ibb universities were assessed but actual training was not conducted. Technical specifications
of e-library hardware were prepared and submitted to MHSER but not formally approved. A
modernization plan of the libraries and computer centers were not produced. With regard to the
self-evaluation, guidelines for administrators of three colleges (education, commerce, medicine)
were prepared to help them write reports on background information about their colleges.
Training to conduct self-evaluation was provided but a specific guideline was not yet developed.

With regard to the Quality Assurance (QA) system development, the current licensure by-laws of
QA were reviewed. A proposal for the National Accreditation Council (NAC) and Quality
Assurance System that identified areas for improvement and recommendations has been prepared
and submitted to the MHESR but not yet approved as it needs major modifications. The plans on


                                                                                                   26

how to involve the proposed NAC in the development of a National Accreditation System was
not prepared. The planned QA system that includes general and professional standards as well as
external evaluation procedures for non-professional programs was not completely developed.

Component A. Governance

         YHEMIS system -- 240 PCs and the supporting software have been supplied, installed
         and are operational at the Student Affairs Department in 7 public universities. All 7
         universities were provided with a training laboratory equipped with 15-30 PCs and an
         internal network. All laboratories are currently operational. An administrative database
         was established for each university containing 13 categories of administrative data, in
         preparation for developing a reform plan for rationalization of specializations and
         universities by the MHESR. All seven universities were provided with a multi-purpose
         template for the MIS subcomponent. A Student Registration System (SRS) was designed
         as part of an EMIS in Sana'a and Aden universities. The SRS was tested using primary
         data from newly enrolled students (2007-2008) at faculties of engineering and commerce
         in Sana'a University. Secondary data was used for testing the SRS in Aden University.
         The EMIS system was originally planned to cover four areas: Students Academic
         Records (SAR), Academic and Management Affairs (AMA), Higher Education Research
         (HER) and General Services (GS) but ended up establishing a Student Registration
         System (SRS) alone. The new SRS introduced in two faculties, was neither adjusted nor
         optimized to be used in other faculties and universities. There are deficiencies in the
         initial building of the system and further capacity development of staff should be
         addressed in order to fully utilize the system.

     Action Plan for University Reform: Two universities (Sana'a and Aden) developed in
     three targeted faculties (medicine, education and commerce). 172 faculty members were
     trained in developing skills for planning and implementing program reform.

     International Study Tour was omitted to enable implementation of training for all
     seven universities. An international learning experience was part of the initial plan but
     there was neither direct first-hand opportunity to see other countries' practices on HE
     forms nor the opportunity to present faculty's work at international conferences.

Component B: Finance

     Development of Financial Management Information System (FMIS) was dropped as
     the contractor and MHESR judged it was not implementable within the project timeframe
     and allocated budget.

Component C: Quality

     Development of Quality Assurance System: The current licensure by-laws of Quality
     Assurance (QA) were reviewed. A proposal for National Accreditation Council (NAC)
     and Quality     Assurance System that identified areas for improvement and
     recommendations has been prepared and submitted to the MHESR. However, the
     proposed system of licensure was not approved by MHESR as it needs major
     modifications. The plan on how to involve the proposed NAC in the development of a
     National Accreditation System was not prepared. The planned QA system that includes
     general and professional standards as well as external evaluation procedures for non-
     professional programs was not completely developed.

     Training on QA: 10 administrators and 10 faculty members from Sana'a University
     attended introductory training.

     Training on self-evaluation: 45 new QA officers from all faculties of Sana'a University
     and specialists from a number of public and private universities were trained. Guidelines
     for preparing self-study as a mechanism for QA for each targeted institution and
     professional program were not developed as related activities were not carried out.

     Development and installation of E-library system: the current situation and needs of
     library systems at central and selected faculties in Sana'a, Aden, and Ibb universities
     were assessed. Assessment was conducted to grasp the training needs of library staff.
     Training programs were developed but not yet implemented due to delay in the revision
     of scope of work from the original plan and related procurement work. Technical
     specifications of e-library hardware were prepared and submitted to MHSER. A
     specialized local team was formed by the MHESR to fix the problems in the submitted
     technical specifications. A modernized plan of the libraries and computer centers was not
     prepared as planned.

     Strengthening core academic skills and ICT skills: 450 academic and selected
     management university trainers and trainees were trained in teaching/research skills,
     English language, and Computer skills. 91 trainers were trained in IT, 178 trainers were
     trained in teaching and research and 171 trainers were trained in Teaching English as a
     Second Language. The total number of trainers trained is about six times the target.


                                                                                           29

Workshop for professional skills development: 507 faculty members participated in
teaching/research skills workshops, 478 faculty members participated in Teaching
English as a Second Language workshops, and 269 faculty members participated in basic
IT skills workshops. Participants from Amran, Ibb, and Hodeidah Universities as well as
those from Rada'a college were included in Dhamar workshops.

Website and mailing list to support continuing learning: A website (Core Skills
Development website) has been set up and made open to the public. 17 different ready-
to-use workshops on Basic Core Skills for university staff in IT and teaching/pedagogy
and research, including PowerPoint slide shows, trainer notes, and trainee handouts were
created and used to train participants. All of the material is available on the website. A
long-term, sustainable interaction among participants has been secured by setting up a
project mailing list as well as a Yahoo Group. By June 15, 2008, the mailing list has 234
members and the Yahoo Group has 23 members.

Establishment of learning facilities: Need assessment was conducted for the
establishment of English Language Centers (ELC), Education Development Centers
(EDC), and Information Technology Centers (ITC) at four public universities in
consultation with university rectors, faculty, and administrators. A model business plan
template for the ELCs and EDCs that can be adapted to the specific needs of the centers
in the four universities was suggested but not developed. Language barriers and time
limitations prevented getting a clear picture of current business and accounting practices
at the four universities.

Provision of hard/software to support training: 450 Flash drives with copies of all of
the workshop material were provided for all of the trainers who completed at least four
workshops and for 50 participants. A digital video camera and a small MP3 audio
recorder have been provided to each university for faculty members to use in recording
microteaching sessions and practicing professional presentations. These resources are
available at the university EDC in Sana'a and Aden and at the library in Dhamar and Taiz
universities. 29 professional books in the fields of teaching/research and assessment
techniques were given to the participating universities (Sana'a 7, Aden 6, Dhamar 8, and
Taiz 8).

Training Evaluation: An evaluation of training of trainers was conducted using the
Kirkpatrick four-level model, which includes: (i) reaction, (ii) learning, (iii)
behavior/transfer of learning, and (iv) results. Only the first two levels were evaluated.
Evaluation forms, e-mails, personal messages and observations during mentored training
were used as means of evaluation. Overall, the evaluation shows positive impact of the
training.

Unimplemented Activities in Twinning Arrangement: Some of the planned activities
were not implemented due to pending budget approval (e.g., a 2-day workshop for
University Task Teams; Faculty professional development workshop on student-centered
teaching and learning strategies).

Cancellation of trip to attend international conference: Faculty members' visit to
Canada was cancelled and not compensated with other equivalent opportunity. This
would have served as a good learning opportunity for the faculty to produce and present
an international standard paper.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
1. Population and Sample:

        Sampled Data: The data was collected during September (the month Ramadan) in Ibb
University and Taiz University. Due to summer holidays, most of the teaching staff were on leave, and
therefore were not part of this survey. About 45 copies of the questionnaire were produced for Ibb
University and 55 copies for Taiz University. Of the total of 100 copies, 43 copies were filled in and
returned; out of those 43 questionnaires, 23 were from Taiz University and 20 from Ibb. Other than the
holiday season, there were some other factors that led to the exclusion of some of the respondents. For
instance, some of the participants in Ibb University were expatriate staff members and were not
included in the sample. Also, most of the participants in Taiz refused to respond because they were not
satisfied with the PCU performance. The questionnaire asked the trainees to refer to the workshop they
attended. Eighteen participants (48.6%) attended the workshop on Institutional Development and
Finance in HED. In contrast, 16 participants (27.1%) failed to indicate the workshop they attended.
This means that participants were not sure about the titles and topics of the workshops they attended or
that they had already forgotten the titles and topics of the workshops they attended.

2. Background information:
     43 trainees responded to the questionnaire.
     Gender: 34 (79 percent) male and 9 (21percent) female participants.
     Occupation: 3 (7.2 percent) were General Directors, 7 ((16.7) Deans, 3 (7.1%) Vice Deans, 12
        (28.6 percent) Heads of Departments, and 17 (40.5 percent) others including Directors of
        Financial Affairs.
     Years of work:       7 (17.9percent) with 1-2 years, 9 (23.1percent) with 3-5 years, and 23
        (39.4percent) with more than 5 years of experience.

3. Questionnaire:
        The total number of participants who responded to the questionnaire was 43. The questionnaire
asked respondents to indicate on a five-point scale their level of agreement with a number of statements
related to: motives for attending training, the benefits gained from training, and overall assessment of
training. The table on page 44-46 presents the responses on each statement as means and frequencies.

A) Motives for attending training:

        The main motives for attending the workshops were "to network and share information" (mean
5.38) and "to enhance performance in current job assignment" (mean 4.95). 87.5 percent agreed they
attended the training workshop to network and share information and 76.2 percent agreed that they
attended the training workshop to enhance performance in current assignment. The views expressed in
the interviews showed that "obtaining a training attendance certificate" was a major motive for
attending the workshops. The data show that 60.6 percent of the participants were assigned by the
university. Each participant received an official written assignment to attend a particular workshop in
the Ibb University. It shows that the PCU and the University were the main sources of information
regarding the form to attend - the training workshops.

B) Benefits and professional development:

        The respondents' response to the content of training as useful was "to a large extent".
Approximately 66 percent agreed that training was useful and 48.0 percent agreed that they benefited
from training "to some extent". The respondents also rated the results of training or its effect on their
job performance as "moderate." Those who benefited from training indicated that it increased their



                                                                                                43

knowledge and skills and improved their performance only "to some extent". Some of the reasons given
by the respondents as to why the training was "somewhat useful": because training activities were
"various and interesting" only to some extent and fulfilled training needs to some extent and the
knowledge and skills gained were also "somewhat" applicable to current job.
         The table shows that the respondents liked the professional aspects or returns of training. More
than 60 percent of them agreed "to a large extent" that:
     they were happy/pleased to attend the workshop
     networking and sharing information with officials and colleagues were more useful than the
         content of the training
     training enhanced relations with officials and colleagues
     the workshop enhanced feeling of belonging to Higher Education and helped improve
         accountability and commitment to work

C) The overall assessment:
         The overall assessment indicates that training was good "to some extent".
46.2 percent agreed "to a large extent" that the content of training activities was clear and easy to
understand, 41.0 percent indicated that it was easy only to some extent. About 60 percent of the trainees
agreed that training achieved its objectives to some extent, 45.2 percent agreed that its structure was
good to some extent. The overall quality of training was rated as high to a large extent by 39.0 percent
and was rated high to some extent by 43.9 percent. Close to 38 percent of the trainees agreed that the
content of training was substantial "to a large extent" and 52.5 percent agreed it was substantial "to
some extent". The majority agreed that the allocated time for training was not sufficient.
         The responses varied concerning whether the timing of training caused unnecessary disruptions
or neglect of other important activities and if "the training activities were more practice-oriented than
theory oriented". The responses indicated that most of the trainees disagreed with the statement that
training activities were practice-oriented. Finally, 26.8 percent of the trainees agreed "to a large extent"
that the training/workshop was less useful than they had expected and 41.5 percent agreed that it was so
"to some extent". Most of the people interviewed expressed dissatisfaction at not receiving the
attendance certificates promised to them by the Project Unit.

4. Interviews
         The views expressed in the interviews provided additional information and supported the
information revealed in the questionnaire. They are summarized as follows.

    1. The main audience or target groups of the "Academic and Research Management" and the
         Institutional Development and Finance in Higher Education" were deans and vice-deans. Yet,
         only a few of them participated in the workshops. The questionnaire analysis showed that of
         those who participated in training, only 23.8 percent were deans and vice-deans, the remaining
         28.6 percent were heads of departments and there were 40.5 percent managers and directors of
         Financial and Students Affairs in different faculties.

    2. The focus of the workshops was on international trends and experiences in institutional
         development and Finance in Higher Education. Two main comments or views appeared here.
         First, these international trends and experiences are excellent or successful; however they do
         not fit or suit current legal framework and economic conditions of the society in general as any
         university in particular. Education must be a public service because the majority of the people
         cannot afford to pay for quality education due to their very low incomes. Second, most of the
         participants are staff and personnel in the faculties of Education, Commerce and Medicine.
         They are basically service faculties and do not have the capacity/authority to raise funds, such
         as the Language, Training or Consultancy centers. Staff members in these faculties have no



                                                                                                   44

      authority to make budgets as budgeting is a central responsibility undertaken by university top
      officials and managers. Therefore, the knowledge and skills gained in these workshops will not
      be applied in these faculties even though they look to be applicable in fund-increasing centers.

   3. The timing and location of the training were not appropriate. One of the workshops in Taiz was
      conducted in the Faculty of Education which is far away from the faculties of Medicine, Arts
      and the Language Center. The training was carried out during the final exams. This affected the
      level of attendance and participation. Some trainees could not attend regularly (showed up one
      day, and remained absent the next). Other participants used to show up for a while and left the
      training in order to carry out their regular exam duties.

   4. The interviewees indicated that the content of the training was substantial and theoretical and
      the allocated time was not sufficient. As one of them said, "the trainer depended on data show
      (presentations) to present too much information shortened in a number of slides, he talks
      quickly as he displays slides to save time and then comes the translator, translating most of the
      talk, and consumes as much time consumed by the trainer. It was more like a brainstorming
      rather a training workshop". When asked to remember the topics discussed and the knowledge
      gained, one replied: "I barely remember, and I think that no one can gain that much from too
      much information presented in a 2 day training session".

   5. Too many promises and threats: University officials asked nominees who were selected to
      attend the workshops and threatened those who failed to attend that they would be penalized.
      At the same time, the Project Unit promised allowance and certificates to those who would
      attend and help in organizing the implementation of workshop. The organizers later went back
      on their promises, making some of the participants extremely furious. It indicates that
      "obtaining a training attendance certificate" was a major motive for the participants to attend
      the workshops.


5. Open Questions: Following are the most frequent responses:

   1. What are the knowledge / skills acquired from training will that you will now apply on
      the job? (List the most important three).

      dealing with large classes, critical and creative teaching and thinking, the use of IT (power
      point, internet) in teaching,

      provision of training equipment, to create a university environment to facilitate the
      implementation of gained information and skills, political will to change existing laws and
      regulations, provision of teaching equipment in classes.

   3. What worked best in the workshop?
      Good organization and time management, the rich and well founded knowledge of the

      international universities, the future vision and perspectives that can be achieved, quality
      education.


                                                                                              45

              4. What would you recommend to improve this training in the future?
                    Select appropriate times (off duty), commit to the dates of training, good selection of
                    participants, the provision of sufficient funds and necessary equipment, good preparation and
                    planning, keeping commitments and promises, focus more on the practical aspects of training,
                    continue such workshops, more and longer workshops, link training to actual needs and future
                    requirements, use Arabic as a medium for training.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Assessment of Borrower Performance and Lessons Learned
The risks to project development outcome with respect to the impact on operations were: the
credibility of MHESR to stakeholders, MOF's refusal to delegate budgets and management
responsibility to the universities, civil servants and unions' opposition to the reforms, notably
measures related to governance. To mitigate such risks the following measures were taken into
account:
(a) Ensuring that strategy and associated policies are sound, fiscally responsible and carefully
    discussed, with the support of the MOE and MOF
(b) Developing a shared strategy and development plan through participation, leading to
    understanding and acceptance of the reciprocal roles and responsibilities of the MOF, the
    MHESR and the universities
(c) Training university staff to assume their responsibilities
(d) Involving union representatives and staff associations in the change process
(e) Working to ensure ownership of the new systems and procedures by giving MHESR and
    university staff the lead in their design and development, particularly with regard to setting
    standards of accountability

The government (represented by the line ministries), PCU and the public universities in
collaboration with implementation partners spared no effort to make the above measures find
their way to practice. The proof is the high level of participation and interaction of all targeted
groups with project activities as well as the increasing demands of untargeted universities and
groups for inclusion in all project interventions to get their share in its ownership. Although
training has surpassed planned targets in terms of number of university staff trained, yet there is a
lot to be learned in terms of skills needed for staff to assume their responsibilities in an
autonomous HE environment. Some of the pressing skills needed are related to: income
generation, all aspects of budget management, principles and practices of accounting and
common procedures in non-cash based economies, as has been mentioned by OSU in their phase
2 report, dated June 15, 2008.

The risks to development outcome with respect to achievement of operations, were: selected TA
support is weak and lacks capacity in training and team building, the technical quality of the
measures proposed for testing and development is inadequate, the proposed national funding
formula for HE proves controversial and is challenged by institutions which fear losing funds, the
planning, operation and maintenance of the proposed faculty/library intranet and associated
Internet access proved difficult to implement on a time scale and with the desired impact. To
mitigate such risks, the following measures were taken into account:
(f) Giving special attention in the selection of consultants/consortium offering TA to:
    institutional excellence, overseas experience, commitment to involve senior faculty in the
    management and technical direction of the support effort and contractual clauses permitting
    timely substitution of specialists
(g) Implementing objective, independent assessment of the measures and the plans for their
    piloting by qualified external specialist
(h) Involving external specialists in assessing results and plans for scaling up
(i) Simulating alternative funding formulae to explore the dimensions of equity, flexibility in
    terms of targeting objectives and incentives
(j) Involving university, MHESR and MOF staff in the decision-making process, enabling them
    to simulate the outcomes of different approaches



                                                                                                  49

(k) Ensuring timely and adequate training for the staff charged with application of the selected
    funding formula
(l) Learning from the experiences of other countries which have pioneered this approach and
    from other agencies, notably USAID
(m) Negotiating sound financial terms with the selected Internet Service Provider and for the use
    of land lines (phone company)
(n) Ensuring qualified technical staff and adequate operating funds

For measure (f), it was considered by the MHESR and PCU over the life span of the project in
selecting a set of international firms that complied with its criteria at least at entry. However, later
on significant differences between contracted firms were evident in terms of performance. For
measure (g), it was taken care of directly by the WB through supervision missions that included
external experts, and indirectly by MHESR through facilitating missions' work. For measure (h),
a partial scaling up in terms of targeting more universities was carried out without a formal
involvement of external specialists to do a systematic assessment of results achieved and suggest
appropriate plans for scaling up accordingly. For measure (i), (j) and (k), they were not tried
because there was no experimental national funding formula implemented during the life of the
project in the first place. For measures (l), (m) and (n), they could not be put into practice because
the risks linked to the faculty/library intranet and associated Internet subcomponent became real
and hamper its implementation.

In conclusion, it turned out that for the HEP case the risks to development outcome with respect
to achievement of operations were more serious than the risks to project development outcome
with respect to the impact on operations. Consequently, some important development outcomes
could not be maintained.

Time Schedule: Delays in project implementation necessitated extending project closing date for
one and a half year to end in June 30, 2008. However, a second request for extending the closing
date to December 31, 2008 was denied. Reasons for this were:
   - continuing pattern of delays did not support confidence that important outcomes will be
     realized over the additional period
   - the schedule of actions agreed on the March 2008 supervision mission was not maintained
   - the first two milestone dates in the revised project procurement plan were not met
   - further information needed by the IDA Financial Management Specialist before clearing the
     project 2007 audit report was not provided

Lessons Learned

Project Design and Scope
 The critical issue was originally "how to reform effectively?", not "how to extend reform
   effectively?". In other words, the intent was to find out the value (effectiveness) of using
   certain tools (key measures) in achieving reform, rather than extending reform to all HE
   institutions as a priority. Applying the key measures to all HE institutions transformed the
   piloting strategy into a sector-wise one. The more variables accounted for by project
   interventions, the more will be the project complexity leading to more implementation
   problems. The planned project activities/tasks by themselves involved exerting intensive
   efforts and exercising a lot of coordination. It is suffice to say that broadening the targeting of
   institutions and beneficiaries, not only added more load on PCU - which was already
   understaffed -, but also increased project complexity. For a proper scaling up of initiatives
   been piloted to underpin a second broader phase of HE reform, it is essential to formally
   involve external specialists to do a systematic assessment of the results achieved under HEP-1,


                                                                                                    50

   assess cost-effectiveness of training programs and suggest appropriate plans for scaling up
   accordingly.

 Implementing modified interventions without getting IDA's approval according to Bank
   regulations and procedures, not only prevents smooth implementation, but could also cause
   unnecessary complications and delays in making payments to contractors. Therefore, for
   proper adjustments, modifications and changes to take place regarding the original hierarchy
   of project objectives (goals, specific objectives, outcomes, outputs, activities and inputs), the
   PCU always needs to comply with IDA's requirements in requesting and obtaining Bank
   approval for major changes on a timely fashion.


Organizational and Management Issues at PCU
 Trying to organize many national and international consultancies without having adequate
   management capacity utilized through teamwork, will add to project complications and reduce
   chances of success. Too many changes and/or cancellations of parts of interrelated
   consultancy contracts without careful assessment of drawbacks would negatively affect their
   implementation, produced outputs and overall outcomes In fact, all TORs of HEP contracts
   were prepared by individuals not by specialized firms, which could well support this doubt.
   Therefore, development of contract's TOR should be assigned to a firm or a group of
   international and local experts. Regular in-country and abroad specialized training to update
   knowledge and upgrade skills of PCU team members is an important factor in their
   satisfactory functioning.

 With no doubts, sufficient incentives and reasonable salaries for project staff are essential in
   attracting qualified personnel for establishing a PCU with an adequate management capacity
   to grantee successful project implementation. Thus, IDA need to work out ways of getting rid
   of related real obstacles (MOPIC and MOF restrictions on salaries and tax requirements) to
   achieving successful project implementation.

 Stability of leadership/management of the implementing/supervising agency and knowledge of
   Bank procurement and reporting procedures are prerequisites for an enabling work
   environment.

 Lack of adequate M&E arrangements within MHESR and PCU adversely affected
   flow/circulation of project related information and project's operational status, which in turn
   affected SC performance. Lack of timely field follow up on implementation progress and
   regular monitoring of outputs produced and services provided by contractors could result in
   serious problems pass undetected and unjustified installments paid. Examples of this are:
   - Current problems faced by university staff and administrators in operating and adjusting
     their SRS to accept students' data for the new academic year 2008-2009.

Issues by Project Component
 Several subcomponents which are fundamental to the establishment of the National
   Accreditation Council and Quality Assurance System were not developed, namely, the system
   of licensure, work plans to develop National Accreditation System, QA system and self-study
   guidelines
 The financial component was the most to suffer from incomplete tasks under different
   contracts. The roots of the problems were embedded in the TORs of the contracts associated
   with the component.



                                                                                                 51

 For contracts, it is advisable that prior to requesting a Bank NOL for either contract amount or
   disbursement of any of its installments, a careful revision should be made by a PCU
   committee including the project manager, the technical coordinator, the financial manager,
   and the procurement officer. The purpose of the revision should be matching the claimed
   amounts to activities been accomplished and outputs been produced with reference to the TOR
   in the signed contract. This would save the PCU a lot of trouble and help avoid unpleasant
   surprises regarding mismatches of claims with actual achievements (as a percentage of what
   should have been done), which could lead to payments of unjustified claims. It is advisable to
   link each of the contract installments to specific detailed outputs/services to be
   produced/delivered and be specified in the contract, not just on submission of reports as is the
   current situation.

HE Sector wide Issues
 Although HE governing structure has come a long way in moving towards adequate capability
   for undertaking the reform with the help of HEP, yet more capacity building within MHESR
   and HE institutions is required to attain adequate capability. Among the many problems
   caused by the confusion about decision making was that some university staff showed less
   interest in project activities. Therefore, there is an urgent need for introducing, developing,
   and implementing a decision making mechanism for HE sector, to enable successful autonomy
   of HE institutions for improved performance, enhanced quality of outputs and assured
   impacts.

 HE sector needs more serious steps towards gradual delegation of financial management to
   universities on the basis of obligated program objectives. This could only be achieved by
   building institutional trust and mutual interests among concerned ministries, namely, MHESR,
   MOF and MOPIC with international donor community support under the World Bank
   supervision.

 To reduce burdens on HE and improve relevance of its outcomes to labor market demands, the
   MHESR need to maintain a systematic reduction in number of those taking social subjects and
   encourage the increase in number of those taking practical and scientific subjects through
   offering more incentives, improving readiness and workability of laboratories, libraries, and
   university training centers in addition to enhancing accessibility to the World Wide Web.

 Participatory approaches followed in developing the National Strategy for Higher Education
   proved to be effective in producing a strategy that secured a solid ground for both current and
   future operations for HE reform.

 Delegate more implementation/coordination roles of reform to universities through a qualified
   staff member or a small coordination unit.

Assessment of Bank Performance

The World Bank has invested valuable resources to study the status of Yemen's education in
general and higher education in particular. As a result, HE sector weaknesses and problems have
been diagnosed precisely, priorities identified, needs assessed, potential key measures for
attaining a sustainable development suggested for piloting and enclosed in the Project Appraisal
Document (WB Report No. 24245). The LIL secured funding for testing the value of the key
measures by facilitating implementation of planned interventions through a PCU within the

The IDA visiting missions contributed a lot to detecting implementation difficulties and helping
the PCU figure out practical solutions. The regular IDA led reviews not only enlightened the PCU
team about the quality and quantity of achievements against planned targets and their relevance to
project objectives, but also pointed the way towards accelerating them as well as adjusting
implementation for improved performance. Moreover, in the course of directing efforts towards
reform of HE sector, the IDA missions promoted the tradition of practicing participatory
approaches in planning and implementation of interventions. This made the Bank supervision
more positive and more beneficial in the sense that it developed into a value-added process.
Unfortunately, the PCU did not make the most out of the visiting missions' outcomes, by not
maintaining the schedule of actions agreed on during each mission. Moreover, the assistance
received by the PCU from the resident missions, specially with regards to contract management,
can not be described as being continuous and sufficient.
