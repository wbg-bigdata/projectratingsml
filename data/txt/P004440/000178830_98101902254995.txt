REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR THE
CHICCI RIVER IRRIGATION PROJECT - STAGE I
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for an equivalent of US$50 million.
The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 6 years of grace, with
interest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH of November 7, 1974) was circu-
lated to the Executive Directors on November 11, 1974. A basic economic
mission visited the Philippines in April/May 1975 and is now finalizing
its report: the discussion below includes the findings of the mission.
Annex I of this report contains country economic data.
3.        During the 1960s, the economy grew in real terms at the rate of
5-6 percent per annun. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been exploited more effectively. Moreover, the bene-
fits of growth were not distributed widely and unemployment rose. Low levels
of taxation resulted Ln inadequate -public investment in necessary infrastruc-
ture and social services. Relatively weak export performance, combined with
a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic industry, resulted
in a steady deterioration in the balance of payments position.
4.        During 1970-*72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group, they succeeded in improving substan-
tially the maturity structure of the external public debt. Real GNP during
that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972, following severe
floods, the President began a series of social and economic reforms in the
country including an agrarian reform program, tax reforms, and an adminis-
trative reorganizatiorn. These programs are beginning to show results.
5.        In 1973 there was a sharp increase in the level of economic acti-
vity in the Philippines. This upsurge was led by the international commodity
boom, which resulted in higher export incomes in the Philippines, a strong
recovery in agricultural and industrial production for the domestic market
and an expansion in public and private investment. The growth in real GNP
doubled to 10 percent.
1/   This part, except for paragraph 8, which has been updated, are the same
as in the President's Reports on the Second Livestock Project (Report No.
P-1776-PH) and the Third Education Project (Report No P-1777-PH) both
dated March 4, 1976.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

6.        Like most countries, the Philippines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973. With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines proved quite vulner-
able to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices and the
prolonged recession in the industrialized countries. This sequence of
events has temporarily frustrated the Government's attempt to accelerate
the rate of development, and in 1974 GNP increased by only about 6 percent
in real terms. While adverse effects of the recession were cushioned some-
what in 1974 by a modest improvement in the external terms of trade, the
Philippines has been even more seriously affected in 1975 by the continued
rise in import prices and reduced demand for Philippine exports. The real
growth of GNP in 1975 is estimated to have been at about the 6 percent rate of
the previous year. Improvement in the growth performance in 1976 can be
expected only if recovery takes place in the economies of the Philippines'
main trading partners.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3.2
percent per year during the 1970s, a period which has been affected by un-
usually adverse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 percent
in 1973-74, but due to serious damage by typhoons, it grew by only 1 percent
in 1974-75, and the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half
of 1975 to ensure adequate stocks. However, initial indications are that
the outlook for rice production in 1975-76 is bright. The Government is
giving the highest priority to increasing agricultural production and has
initiated a number of programs designed to expand the use of fertilizer,
irrigation and supervised credit. It has also intensified efforts to expand
social services needed in rural areas, including rural electrification,
health and family planning services as well as small-scale road and irri-
gation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the
Government has moved ahead with its agrarian reform for the nation's one
million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By December 1, 1975, the
Government had issued Certificates of Land Transfer in respect of 208,000
of the 424,000 tenants on holdings of over 7 ha; thus, title to 366,000
ha of the total of 825,000 ha farms occupied by such tenants has been trans-
ferred. The Government has raised the cash portion of the compensation package
to landlords to reduce their resistance to land reform, but strong administra-
tive efforts will be necessary to ensure continued progress in the implement-
ation of the program.
9.        Industry accounts for almost 30 percent of net domestic product,
one-third of total fixed investment and 15 percent of total employment.
Industrial production, which grew by 12 percent in 1973, was adversely
affected in 1974 by the world-wide economic slowdown and grew by only 3.6
percent in 1975. This decline is primarily a result of depressed demand
for Philippine exports on the part of the country's main trading partners
and the concomitant slowdown in the rate of economic growth in the Philip-
pines. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects for industrial growth are
favorable because of the natural and human resource endowment of the Philip-
pines and a very active private sector.



-3-
10.       The Government has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently about 3 per-
cent compared with 1.8 percent in FY72. The Government has also imple-
mented a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax adminis-
tration. These reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom
in export incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase
in national government: tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in
FY74. As a result, the ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP
has increased from an average of 9 percent in recent years to an estimated
12.3 percent in FY74.
11.       In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines and in 1974 consumer prices rose by almost 40 percent.
The rise was caused by the large increase in liquidity that came with the
export boom in 1973-74, and by a number of cost-push factors, including the
higher rate of world inflation. 'To deal with this problem, the Government
adopted contractionary monetary and fiscal policies, and attempted to
reduce the impact of inflation on consumers by subsidizing such essential
goods as wheat, imported rice, and cooking oil. As a consequence of the
Government's measures, the annual rate of inflation decreased to less than
20 percent at the end of 1974 and less than 10 percent in 1975.
12.       The rapid inflation in 1974 exacerbated the decline in real wages
which had begun in 1970. Overall, there was a decline of about 20 percent
in real wages during 1974. In order to offset the deterioration of real
wages in urban areas, the Government increased the salaries of Government
employees and directed private firms to grant emergency cost of living ad-
justments to employees earning less than P 600 per month. Nevertheless
real urban wage incomes declined and reduced the demand for manufactured
products, which contributed to the poor performance of the manufacturing
sector in 1974. The depression in the urban areas was partly offset by the
improvement in rural incomes that stemmed from continued high prices for
agricultural commodities.
13.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments bene-
fitted considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973.
High prices for the cOtntry's chief exports, including coconut products,
sugar, copper and wood products resulted in a 70 percent boost 'in export
earnings and a balance of payments 'surplus of about $670 million. Since
mid-1974 the external trade position has deteriorated, due to the sharp
increases in the prices of oil and other imports, less favorable prices
for Philippine exports, and reduced'volume of some exports'resulting from
the recession in the economies of the Philipines' main trading partners. As
a result, the overall balance of payments surplus fell to about $100 million
in 1974, and a deficit of about '$400' million was recorded in 1975. Inter-
national reserves stood at about $1.1 billion at the end of 1975, the equiv-
alent of three months imports.
14.       The outlook for 1976 is for exports to increase by about 12 per-
cent in real terms on the assumption that there will be some international
economic recovery. Imports will need to grow by about 7 percent in real



- 4 -
terms in order to maintain the growth of the economy. Due to a modest de-
terioration of the terms of trade, the current account deficit may reach about
$1.0 billion compared to $860'million in 1974. Medium and long term capital
inflows are expected to finance most of this deficit, producing an overall
balance of payments deficit of about $200 million. Such a deficit can be
managed without serious pressure on reserves through utilization of IMF
oil facility and by short-term foreign borrowing by the Central Bank.
15.       The overall level of debt of the Philippines is expected to remain
within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service payments to exports
and non-factor services would average about 16-17 percent during the rest of
this decade. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 10 percent and its share in debt-service is about 4 percent. These
shares are expected to increase somewhat in the years ahead.
16.       Foreign assistance is expected to continue to be of major import-
ance in helping to finance the larger investment expenditures which will be
necessary for the country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement
of external assistance reaches levels'commensurate with the level of develop-
ment expenditures which will be required during the latter part of the decade,
total commitments will need to be maintained in real terms at least at the
level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The Consultative
Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on October 1, 1975, agreed
that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Government to seek aid commit-
ments of about $600 million during 1976.
Growth Prospects
17.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy which is primarily
a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains committed
to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide for a con-
tinued increase in incomes and employment. High priority must be accorded
to expanding employment opportunities - in the short-term as well as the
long-term - because unemployment and underemployment are still high, and the
labor force continues to grow at 3 percent a year.
18.       Priority must also be given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding industrial export production and to accelerating
development of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced during
the last two years in importing sufficient quantities of food at reasonable
prices, especially cereals, have increased the Government's resolve to
achieve self-sufficiency in rice and corn as soon as possible. The Govern-
ment rightly recognizes that the increased cost of petroleum and other
imports cannot'be financed indefinitely by borrowing abroad, and it is active-
ly encouraging both local and foreign investors to expand the productive
capacity of export industries and to undertake major new import-replacing
investments. Because it will take time for these investments to have an
impact on the balance of payments, the Government is seeking increased
support from the international financial community to help carry out its
development program and to ease the adjustment to higher petroleum and other
import prices. Because of the 'substantial easing of the external debt burden



- 5 -
which has taken place in the last several years, the Philippines now has the
capacity to borrow externally larger amounts of capital in support of its
development program.
19.       Given the likely availability of resources and the expected growth
in various sectors, it -s reasonable for the Government to plan for a longer
term growth in GNP of about 7 percent a year in real terms. To achieve
this objective, increased investments will be needed in a wide range of in-
dustries. Public investments also need to be increased. A new public in-
frastructure program is being prepared, and the Government is putting emphasis
on developing nuclear and indigenous power sources and on irrigation, feeder
roads and other projects to support increased food production. The Government
has made considerable progress in recent years in building up the capacity of
public sector agenzies to prepare and execute projects. However, there will
be a need for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect of administration.
The ratio of publi, investment to GNP will need to rise from the present level
of 3 percent to about 5 percent by 1980. To support the level of investment,
the Government wilL need to intensify its tax efforts so that the ratio of
national taxes to GNP rises from its present level of 11-12 percent to 14
percent by 1980.
20.       The Government's ambitious development program will continue to
require foreign resources in addition to the capital which would become
available for the I-inancing of the foreign exchange component of develop-
ment projects. Some financing of local costs is justified, especially for
projects of economijc and social importance which need only limited amounts
of foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
21.       By February 29, 1976, the Philippines had received 32 Bank loans and
three IDA credits totalling $791.2 million, net of cancellations. About 36
percent of the Bank/IDA lending, $293 million, has been for infrastructure
projects in power, transportation, and water supply and $38 million has been
for population and education. Of the remainder about $216 million has been
for agriculture and about $250 million for industry. There has been a marked
improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philippines have been
executed in the last three years, compared with experience in the 1960s,
when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration
to cause serious problems. All these projects are now going reasonably well.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of January 31, 1976 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
22.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to support
the Philippine development effort with its particular emphasis on agriculture
and infrastructure. Shortages of domestic revenues led to low investment for
these purposes in the past. The last three years have seen major changes
which have helped to overcome these constraints and both the ambitious



- 6 -
Philippine development program and the Bank's lending program have been
designed to make good past neglect and to meet future needs. Commitments in
FY74 amounted to $165.1 million, and in FY75 $208 million compared to an
average of about $30 million a year in the preceding five years.
23.       Two loans, one of $42 million for the Magat River Multipurpose
Project and one of $75 million for the Industrial Investment Credit Project,
have already been approved by the Executive Directors in FY76. Two loans,
($20.5 million for a Second Livestock Project and $25 million for a Third
Education Project) are scheduled for consideration by the Executive Directors
on March 16. In addition to the proposed project, loans for fisheries, grain
storage and urban development may be ready for Board consideration in FY76.
24.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.2 million
for investments in 13 companies in the fields of development banking, power,
telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel mining
and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments, as of
January 31, 1976, $18.9 million had been sold, $0.4 million cancelled and $3.4
million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $53.5 million. On the same date
all commitments were fully disbursed. Preliminary proposals have been received
for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper, dinnerware,
metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 1/
25.       Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy
accounting for approximately one-fourth of the gross national product, over
one-half of total employment and about three quarters of export earnings.
Over 70 percent of the total land under cultivation is used for production of
cereals, of which rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land is
primarily taken up by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pine-
apples and tobacco.
26.       The performance of the agricultural sector will be crucial in
determining whether the Philippines can increase income both rapidly and
equitably. At present, the domestic market for industrial products is limited
by relatively low rural incomes. Although in recent years there has been a
substantial change in the internal terms of trade in favor of agriculture, the
problems of poverty and income distribution continue to be particularly acute
in the rural areas; of the 15 million people in the bottom 40 percent of the
income scale, 12 million live in such areas. The Government is aware of
these problems and is dealing with them by undertaking agrarian reform,
by increasing investment and institutional support in the agricultural sector
to raise the productivity of small farmers, and by encouraging agricultural
diversification.
1/   A detailed Report entitled "Agricultural Sector Survey - Philippines"
(No. 39a-PH of May 2, 1973) was circulated to the Executive Directors
on May 21, 1973 (R73-111).



- 7 -
27.       A major Government objective is to increase rice and corn produc-
tion as a means of increasing incomes of small farmers and attaining national
self-sufficiency in foodgrains, thereby strengthening the balance of payments.
The ability to assure self-sufficiency in rice will depend to some extent
on the bringing of additional land under cultivation, but largely on improving
yields through expansion of the area under irrigation, increased cropping
intensity, the increased use of fertilizers and agro-chemicals and the provi-
sion of adequate credit and other supporting services. High yielding varieties,
which were helpful in increasing production since the late 1960s, require a
much higher degree of water control than is possible under rainfed conditions
or with the typicaL unimproved irrigation systems in the Philippines. At
present, only about 900,000 ha, or less than 30 percent of all land under
rice, is irrigated with only about a fourth of this area having an assured
water supply during the dry season. A program to upgrade and expand irrigation
to cover an additional 50,000 ha of rice land a year for the remainder of the
decade would be needed to meet domestic rice demand. Investment in irrigation
is therefore of high priority.
28.       Over half of expected Bank lending for agriculture in the Philip-
pines in the next five years is likely to be for irrigation. The proposed
project would be the fifth Bank-assisted project designed to provide improved
irrigation to increase rice production on the island of Luzon. The first four
projects, three in Central Luzon and one in Cagayan Valley in Northern Luzon,
1/ set the example for the type of irrigation rehabilitation, new construction
and operation needed for large-scale rice production in the Philippines.
These projects are providing improved irrigation facilities, better road
systems needed for efficient operation and maintenance and marketing of farm
products, stronger supporting services to assist farmers in adopting the new
techniques needed to increase production, and technical assistance to help the
National Irrigation Administration (NIA) to expand and improve its irrigation
program. These projects, together with the project now proposed, will bring
about substantial Lncreases in production on about 210,000 ha and will benefit
about 85,000 farmers, most of whom are smallholders. Implementation of the
existing projects lhas been satisfactory.
29.       The proposed project would follow the same approach to improving
and expanding national irrigation systems in the Cagayan Valley. The Valley
exports rice to other regions of the Philippines and has large land and water
resources which can be developed to increase rice production. It is also one
of the poorest reglons in the country as per capita income is only about $80
compared to the naltional average of $240. The National Irrigation Systems
Improvement Study, recently financed under the Tarlac Irrigation Systems
Improvement Projeci: (Loan 1080-PH), will help identify and prepare similar
projects in other regions for future Bank lending.

Loan 1080 and Loan 1154-PH respectively.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
30.       The proposed Chico River Irrigation Project is a logical develop-
ment in the potentially rich, but underdeveloped Cagayan Valley in Northern
Luzon. It is adjacent to and an extension of lands to be irrigated under the
Magat Project (Loan 1154-PH). The whole project is expected to be implemented
in two stages over a nine year period. Stage I, which is now proposed, would
irrigate 19,700 ha by gravity diversion from the Chico river, providing an
assured water supply during the wet season and a dry season supply adequate to
irrigate 17,000 ha. The diversion dam, intake structures and main canal would
be built with adequate capacity to serve both first and second stage irrigation
development. Stage II would expand the irrigated area to 49,000 ha and would
be dependent on flow regulation provided by a multipurpose storage dam planned
for construction on the Chico river about 20 km upstream from the diversion
dam.
31.       The Chico river irrigation project feasibility report was prepared
by NIA. The Department of Public Highways (DPH) prepared the feasibility
report for the provincial roads program, which is also included in Stage I. A
Bank mission appraised the Stage I project in October 1975 and negotiations
were held in Washington in February 1976. The leader of the Government
negotiating team was Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez. The Appraisal Report
(No. 1009a-PH) on the proposed project is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. Annex III of this report contains a loan and project
summary.
The Project Area
32.       The project is located in Cagayan, Isabela and Kalinga - Apayao
provinces in the Cagayan Valley of Northern Luzon. Most of the project
area is devoted to rainfed cultivation of rice during the wet season. Con-
sequently rice yields are low, and adoption of high-yielding varieties has
been slow. On those lands which are now irrigated, the systems are not
completely developed; water-distribution is poor and dry season water supply
is limited. There are a number of small towns with populations of less
than 10,000 people within the area. Several of the larger towns provide
banking, storage and processing facilities and supplies of inputs to the
agriucltural area. The Cagayan Valley is connected by a national highway to
Central Luzon and Manila in the south and to the port of Aparri on the Babuyan
Channel to the north, so that there will be adequate means of transporting
rice produced under the project to major consumption areas, either by truck or
by ship.
Agrarian Reform in the Project Area
33.       The Department of Agrarian Reform has identified all tenants
and farm holdings in the project area. Some 8,000 families, or a total
of 44,000 people live in the project area. Of these, there are about



-9-
4,100 tenant farmers on 8,470 ha and 3,950 owner operators cultivating
11,230 ha. The traiisfer of landlord holdings larger than 7 ha will benefit
some 2,800 tenants. When the land transfer is complete, some 6,800 owner
operators, or 85 percent of the farmers in the project area, will cultivate
17,100 ha or 87 percent of the land. Moreover, the remaining 1,300 tenant
farmers on holdings under 7 ha will no longer be sharecroppers but will be
protected by written lease agreements providing for equitable payments of
fixed rents.
Description of the Project
34.       The proposed project would:   (a) upgrade existing irrigation
systems and expand irrigation service to currently rainfed rice lands to
serve a total of 19,700 ha; and (b) improve 65 km of provincial roads in
the area adjacent to the Magat Multipurpose project. The main components
of the project are:
(a) Irrigation Development
(i)  construction of a diversion dam and intake works
on the Chico river;
(ii)  construction of a catch dam and intake works on
Talaca creek;
(iii)  rehabilitation of the existing 1,400 ha NIA distribution
system and construction of a drainage system;
(iv)  construction of an irrigation and drainage system
for small local communal systems totalling 3,200 ha
and for small pump irrigation systems totalling
a further 3,200 ha;
(v)  extension of an irrigation and drainage system to
11,900 ha of presently rainfed rice lands; and
(vi)  procurement of vehicles and equipment
(b) Provincial Road Program
(i)  improvement of the Roxas-Gamu road (35.2 km);
(ii) improviement of the Cabatuan-Cauayan road
(11.0 1cm); and
(iii) improvement of the San Mateo-Alicia road (18.9 km).
The project would also provide for preparation by NIA of a feasibility study
of Stage IT irrigation and technical assistance to help NIA undertake an
erosion control study of the Magat and Pampanga river catchments, and to



- 10 -
establish a system to monitor production inputs and the flow of project
benefits for all Bank-assisted irrigation projects.
Project Cost and Financing
35.       The project is estimated to cost a total of $84 million, of which
$33 million or 40  percent       would be in foreign exchange.   The cost
estimates include provision for physical contingencies of 20 percent for the
irrigation and road works and 10 percent for the erosion control study and the
monitoring system. These also include price contingencies, amounting to 26
percent of total project cost, which take into account the projected rate of
international and domestic inflation. The Bank loan of $50 million would
finance 60 percent of the total project cost; that is the foreign exchange
cost plus US$17 million of local cost requirements. The need for some exter-
nal financing of local costs was discussed in paragraph 20 above. The Govern-
ment would finance the balance of $34 million from budgetary resources. To
ensure a timely and continuous flow of funds, the Government would, as a
condition of effectiveness of the Loan, cause NIA to set up a special fund
for implementation of the project (Sections 3.02 and 5.01(a) of the Loan
Agreement). The Government would deposit money in the fund and replenish it
at monthly intervals to a level equivalent to the estimated total amount of
payments for goods and services required for the project during each subse-
quent two month period less the estimated payments to be made by the Bank
directly to suppliers, contractors and consultants.
Project Execution
36.       All components of the project, except the provincial road pro-
gram, would be implemented by NIA. The road program would be implemented
by DPH. NIA was established in 1964 to develop, operate and maintain all
national irrigation systems in the Philippines. It is a well managed insti-
tution which is successfully executing the other Bank-assisted irrigation
projects. However, NIA is being reorganized to meet the requirements of the
Government's accelerated irrigation development program. One of the first
results of the reorganization has been the creation of a Special Projects
Organization Office headed by an Assistant Administrator which would manage
major externally assisted projects, This office would be responsible for
carrying out the proposed project. The post of Assistant Administrator in the
newly created Special Projects Organization is presently being filled on a
temporary basis. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan, NIA
would designate an Assistant Administrator to serve on a full-time basis.
NIA would consult with the Bank before making any appointment to this position
(Sections 3.04 and 5.01 (b) of the Loan Agreement).
37.       As the proposed project is adjacent to the Bank-financed Magat
project, a division of the Magat Project Office (which has a Project Manager
who reports directly to the Special Projects Organization) would be respons-
ible for its execution. The Assistant Project Manager for the Chico Project
would report to the Magat Project Manager and have responsibility for the
irrigation facilities to be constructed under the proposed project. NIA
would provide additional support staff and facilities to enable him to carry
out his responsibilities.



38.       For operation and maintenance purposes, the Chico project would
comprise one district under the Magat project with support provided by
the three Magat divisions dealing with administration, equipment and
agricultural development. To coordinate the provision of agricutural
services to farmers, the Government is in the process of setting up an
Agricultural Development Coordinating Council (ADCC) under the Magat
Project, which would also have responsibility for the Chico project.
(Section 3.05 of the Loan Agreement).
39.       The Specinl Projects Organization of NIA would be responsible
for the Erosion Control Study and for Input-Output Monitoring (a study to
assess the adequacy of the supply of agricultural inputs and provide for a
warning system to identify bottlenecks as well as to determine the magnitude
and distribution of benefits in Bank-assisted irrigation projects); NIA
would employ consultants, satisfactory to the Bank under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, to assist in both these activities (Section 3.06
of the Loan Agreement). The Project Development Division of NIA would be
responsible for preparing the feasibility study for Stage II irrigation.
The Department of Public Highways (Region II) would be responsible for the
construction of the three provincial roads. After construction, maintenance
of the roads would become the responsibility of the Provincial Engineer,
Isabela. Both DPH Region II and Isabela Province have adequate staff and
equipment to carry out this work.
Cost and Benefit Recovery
40.       NIA is autaorized to collect from the users of irrigation systems,
fees to finance operation and maintenance of the systems and to recover
construction costs. Irrigation fees on the national irrigation systems have
recently been raised to the equivalent of two cavans (100 kilograms) of paddy
per ha in the wet season and three cavans (150 kilograms) in the dry season to
be applied uniformly to all national irrigation systems. As an exception to
the uniform rate policy, the Government has agreed to raise the rates on
the Bank-assisted Centtral Luzon projects and the Magat Project to a level
equivalent to about 3.5 cavans (175 kilograms) of paddy per ha in the wet
season and 4.4 cavans (220 kilograms) in the dry season. These rates would
be reached gradually over a period of five years from completion of construc-
tion. As the proposed project would be operated as a division of the Magat
Project and cropping intensities and farm incomes at full development would be
similar, the level of irrigation fees agreed for the Magat Project would
apply. These rates would be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance
costs and to recover (without interest) the total investment cost over a
reasonable period (Section 4.03 (b) (iii) of the Loan Agreement). Using a dis-
count rate of 10 percent and a period of 50 years, the proposed level of
charges would result in a cost recovery index (ratio of incremental payments
by project beneficiaries to the incremental costs of construction, operation
and maintenance) of 29 percent and a benefit recovery (ratio of incremental pay-
ments by a typical farm family to incremental income) of 11 percent.
41.       The collection rate of water charges has risen from 50 percent
of the total amount collectible in 1969 to 66 percent in 1974; further



- 12 -
improvement is required. NIA is aware of this need and is studying
collection rates for all national systems, which vary considerably in
different systems. The results of this study are expected early in 1977
and would provide information on the level of service received by farmers
and the reasons for differences in collection rates. On the basis of this
study and in consultation with the Bank staff, the Government expects to
make judgments about the appropriateness of the level of charges, the reasons
for the relatively low rate of collections and the best method for designing
a cost recovery system more consistent with overall fiscal policies. In
the future, the government would consult with the Bank annnually about the
adequacy of water charges and collection rates (Section 4.03 (b) (ii) of the
Loan Agreement).
Procurement
42.       The civil works contract for the Chico diversion dam and main
diversion canal ($19.1 million, or about 50 percent of the total irri-
gation civil works cost) would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Other civil
works in the project service area ($19.8 million) would be scattered over
five separate areas and include rehabilitation of a 1,400 ha canal system,
construction of new systems for 11,900 ha of rainfed rice lands and a large
number of individual communal and pump irrigation systems totalling some 6,400
ha. These have to be planned and executed to avoid as far as possible both
the growing season and bad weather. This work would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding as it consists of relatively small systems
which are spread over a wide geographical area and would be phased over the
project implementation period. In the past, NIA has experienced considerable
difficulty in attracting local bids for such works. Several steps have been
taken under Bank-assisted projects to strengthen local contractors, including
financing of reconditioned equipment and providing higher mobilization allow-
ances. Even with these steps, it is doubtful that all civil works could be
done by local contractors and some of them would therefore have to be carried
out by force account. NIA is presently carrying out a number of its other
projects by force account, and it has built up considerable construction
capability. However in the light of NIA's large work program in the years
ahead, it would not be desirable to rely too heavily on force account under
the proposed Chico project. Therefore NIA would investigate ways of expanding
the execution of civil works by contract, so that the amount of work done by
force account would not exceed 40 percent of the total cost of the civil works
not subject to international competitive bidding (para B(b) of Schedule 4 to
the Loan Agreement). The balance of this work would be carried out on the
basis of competitive bidding procedures advertised locally in accordance with
local procedures, which are acceptable.
43.       Equipment and vehicles for force account construction, operation
and maintenance, the erosion control study and the input-output monitoring
program (about $3.3 million) would be procured after international bidding
in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. For purposes of bid comparison,
a preference of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the
customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers.



- 13 -
Off-the-shelf items costing less than $10,000 each would be procured through
local shopping because any advantage of international competitive bidding
would be clearly outweighed by the administrative costs involved. The total
cost of such items would not exceed $300,000. There is adequate local com-
petition for such items and foreign firms are well represented in the Philip-
pines and would be allowed to participate. The three roads to be improved
under the provincial roads component of the project would be advertised by DPH
in one package ($4.8 million), under international competitive bidding proce-
dures following thE Bank's Guidelines, which would provide for the option to bid
on one or all of the three roads.
Disbursements
44.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of the c.i.f.
cost of directly imported equipment vehicles and materials, 100 percent of
the ex-factory cost of such items manufactured locally and 65 percent of the
cost of such items imported but procured locally. For costs of consultants
and technical assistance, the loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of
the foreign exchange cost or 60 percent of total cost. Disbursements for
both irrigation and provincial roads civil works would be for 60 percent of
certified monthly progress payments or expenditures and for 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of the contractors' mobilization expenditures.
Benefits and Justification
45.       The proposed Stage I project would contribute to the Philippine
Government's objective of attaining self-sufficiency in rice, improving
the productivity and incomes of small farmers and promoting regional balance
in development. The project would provide better water control, improved
drainage and the necessary agricultural supporting services and thus increase
rice yields and production on the 19,700 ha. It would increase dry season
irrigation from 5,000 ha at present to 17,000 ha at full project development
and in so doing wouLd provide the equivalent of an additional 4,700 full time
jobs. Total paddy production in the project area would increase from the
present level of 50,000 tons to 147,000 tons per annum. The increase would
provide enough rice to feed 600,000 persons per year and the net foreign
exchange savings would be $20 million a year at projected world market
prices. The projecl:'s irrigation component would benefit directly some 8,000
farm families and 2,,000 landless families, or a total of 55,000 people. The
great majority of these people currently have very low incomes. At full
project development in 1986, per capita farm income in the project area would
increase from $55-$260 at present to $290-$535 compared to projected national
average per capita GNP in that year of $465.
46.       The road component (costing $9.1 million) would improve access links
between the irrigation service areas of the Magat and the proposed Chico pro-
jects and existing n!ational highways and, thereby, reduce the costs of trans-
porting farm inputs and production. The erosion control study would formulate
control measures and land use patterns to correct existing damage and prevent
further damage to thbe Pampanga and Magat catchments. The monitoring program
would assess the adequacy of the supply of agricultural inputs and provide for



- 14 -
a warning system to identify bottlenecks to their timely provision to
farmers; it would also provide information on the magnitude and distribution
of benefits in Bank-assisted irrigation project ateas. This information would
be useful in formulating future policies.
47.       In the economic analysis, the full costs of the diversion weir
and the main canal, intended to serve both Stages I and II, are treated
as part of irrigation development in Stage I. Assuming the project would
have 50 years life, the full agricultural benefits would be attained in 1986,
and applying farm gate prices for rice and fertilizer based on the Bank's
commodity forecasts for 1985, a shadow exchange rate of US$1 = P8.30, and a
seasonally variable shadow wage rate for unskilled farm labor, the economic
rate of return of the irrigation component (costing $74.9 million) of the
Stage I project would be 15 percent. Sensitivity analyses indicate that even
under a number of adverse assumptions, the rate of return would not faIl below
11 percent. If part of the costs of the diversion weir and main canal are
charged to Stage II of the Chico project, the economic rate of return on the
Stage I project would be 21 percent.
48.       For the road component, assuming a 15-year project life, the econo-
mic rate of return would be 20 percent for the Roxas-Gamu road, 18 percent
for the Cabatuan - Cauayan road and 15 percent for the San Mateo-Alicia road.
The overall economic rate of return for the road component would be 17 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of the Resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. The setting up of the Special Fund referred to in
paragraph 35 and the designation of the Assistant Administrator referred to in
paragraph 36 would be conditions of effectiveness of the Loan. The draft
Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for irrigation projects.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Ln. No. 637-PH      Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: October 15,
1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area. The
project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the 1972
floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule. Most
of the work has been completed and the loan is expected to be entirely dis-
bursed by June 30, 1976, the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40%
over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects
of successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in costs is
being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close coor-
dination established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services,
the project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after comple-
tion of construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate.
Also, nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including
lands which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there
has been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice.
As a result, the rate of return estimate is now more favorable than at
appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry.   Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be
small, and, as expalined in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in
April, 1974 basically (i) to expand the scope of the project to include

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report

tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

corn in addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National
Grains Authority to borrow funds under the project, and (iii) to streamline
procurement procedures (President's memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactori-
ly and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed before the revised
Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PH      Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Date of Effectiveness: July 23, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
The projeot is financing the construction and improvement of the
Cotabato - Digos road in Mindanao (160 km.). Construction is only 55% com-
plete based on the original scope of works, the delay being mainly due to
civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing about
20% of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the contractor
being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government proposal
to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually execute
the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund will be
applied to the balanace of works which can be completed by contract. The
total cost of the reduced project is estimated to be about US$16.4 million
compared to appraisal estimate of US$15.8 million. The increase in cost is
due to a rise in construction costs which has been substantial since oil
price increases in Late 1973. The roadworks have been completed in December
1975. The other comnponents of the project including UNDP-financed feas-
ibility studies were completed in 1973. The closing date has been extended
from May 15, 1975 to June 30, 1976. Technical assistance to the Department
of Public Highways Ls continuing with Bank financing under the Second High-
way Project.

Cr. No. 296-PH      July 1, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilit:ies in Luzon. The project is proceeding satisfactorily,
and the unit is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of
1976. The erection of transmission lines has been somewhat delayed due to
unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions and is now expected to be
completed in June 1976. Further tariff increases were approved, effective
July 1, 1974 and again in July 1, 1975, although this last increase still
has not received Presidential approval. No major problems are anticipated.

The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the

Philippines. The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six
months because of late appointment of technical staff. Although sub-loan
commitments were slow as a result of this, they improved so that all funds
were fully committed by December, 1975. The project has expanded the
hgricultural credit capability of DBP into a new and important field thus
meeting a previously unsatisfied demand for small to medium scale livestock
development finance.
Cr. No. 471-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of

May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation pro-
ject in the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project will divert
water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir of the first pro-
ject, to provide year-round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central
Luzon. The project also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central
Luzon to inventory water, land, and other resources and identify priority
irrigation projects. Although there has been some delay in constructing the
two diversion dams because of the need for more extensive foundations and
abutment area grouting than originally expected, most difficulties have been
overcome and the work is progressing satisfactorily. Diversion of 75% of
Aurora water into Pantabangan Reservoir was achieved in September, 1975, one
year ahead of the appraisal schedule. In the service area, lack of competi-
tion and high bids have delayed awarding of contracts. Urgent work is being
done by Government force account, although the Credit Agreement sets a force
account limit of about 20% on civil works in the service area. Project costs
have increased about 54% over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of
rapid inflation. There would be added benefits from early diversion, however,
resulting in additional water for irrigation sooner than planned, and the
rate of return is expected to fall from 17% at appraisal to 14%.
Ln. No. 998-PH      Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million Loan of June 12. 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: September 9, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mil-
lion) is being used by DBP to make sub-loans to finance direct imports for
medium and relatively large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance
(US$2 million) to finance about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming
project. As of December 31, 1975 commitments for sub-loans totalling $37
million had been made.

Date of Effectiveness: _Dust 27, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These on-
lend the funds to iarmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment in
farm mechanization, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities and
equipment, coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development
and cottage-scale asgro-industry. The project also provides for a review
of the effectiveness of the First, Second and this project. The loan became
effective on August. 27, 1974, and is expected to be fully committed in 1976.
Collection of arrears by a sizeable number of participating banks from bene-
ficiaries under the first and second projects is not satisfactory. This is
being watched closely by Bank staff and appropriate steps are being taken
to improve such collections.
Ln. No. 1034-Ph     Sixth Power; US$61.0 million Loan of July 31. 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has been contracted
and project commissioning is expected in January 1977 - three months ahead
of original schedule. The transmission component of the project is pro-
ceeding in stages. Some lines are under construction and others are in
procurement process. The design work has been delayed due to NPC's heavy
construction programn. It is now expected that this part of the project will
be completed by the end of 1978, i.e. one year behind schedule. NPC raised
its tariffs on July 1, 1974, to meet the covenanted rate of return of 8
percent. But due to inflation NPC was not able to achieve this. NPC
therefore increased tariffs on July 1, 1975, but this increase still has
not received Presidential approval.
Cr. No. 349-PH      Second Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The Credil: is helping to finance a project for development of
technical and vocati.onal education and for improvement in curriculum devel-
opment and teacher t:raining. Construction has been about 12 months behind
schedule mainly due to delays in the finalization of design/drawing of
buildings and recruitment of specialist services. This delay is being
reduced through effective management by the project unit. Procurement of
equipment is on schedule. Both the program and schedule of technical
assistance have beeri revised to suit the current needs of project institu-
tions and to expedite implementation. Disbursements (US$4.9 million as
of 2/11/76) are ahead of the appraisal estimate. Project costs are
estimated at about l2 percent above the appraisal estimates. The Government
has agreed to finance the resulting overruns. Despite initial delays, the
project is expected to be completed on schedule.

Date of Effectiveness: December 5, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the
private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine
and inland fisheries development. The loan became effective on December 5,
1973. The demand for loans is adequate, and the organization to implement
them has been properly established. The project is progressing satisfactorily,

The project is helping the Government to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads,
by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of 1400 kms.
of roads in Luzon. Work has begun on all fourteen contracts, ten of which
were awarded to local contractors. In line with world-wide inflation, costs
have increased sharply, but price adjustments are being awarded to contractors
by the Government to offset the sharp rises in costs of basic materials,
fuels and labor. The UNDP financed Road Feasibility Studies (Phase II),
for which the Bank is executing Agency, have been completed and a possible
Third Highway project has already been indentified and pre-appraised.
Execution of other minor project items is proceeding generally on schedule.

Procurement:                    The following procedures have been agreed: 1/
(a)  Equipment and vehicles for force account
construction, operation and maintenance,
the erosion control study and the input
and output monitoring programs costing
about US$3.3 million would be procured
after international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
A preference limited to 15 percent of the
c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the
level of customs duty, whichever is the
lower, would be extended to local manufac-
turers in the evaluation of bids. Local
shopping is appropriate for off-the-shelf
items costing not more than US$10,000 each.
The total cost for such items would not
exceed US$300,000.
(b) Civil works contracts for the Chico diver-
sion dam and main diversion canal ($19.1
million) would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Guidelines.
(c) Other civil works in the project service
area total US$19.8 million. About 60
percent would be carried out by contracts
awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding in accordance with local proce-
dures which are satisfactory. Foreign
contractors would be eligible to partici-
pate in the bidding. NIA would carry out
the balance of the work, not exceeding 40
percent, by force account.
(d) The three roads would be advertised in
one package (US$4.8 million) under inter-
national competitive bidding procedures
in accordance with Bank Guidelines,
with the option to bid on one or all
three roads.
1/   All costs are before contingencies.

Consultants:                    NIA would employ consultants to assist them
with the erosion control study (65 man-
months), to assist in formulating and
implementing the input monitoring program
(20 man-months) and to advise on a survey
program to monitor project benefits and
assist in the implementation of the program
(10 man-months).
Rate of Return:                 The economic rate of return would be 15 percent
for irrigation works, including construction
cost of diversion dam and major canals attri-
butable to Stage II. The economic rate of
return for the three provincial roads would
be 17 percent.
Appraisal Report:               No. 1009a-PH dated March 9, 1976.
