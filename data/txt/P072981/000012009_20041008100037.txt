EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction

The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) has requested for the preparation of an Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for the proposed Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem
Management Project (WKIEMP). The project corresponds with the central features of Kenya's strategy for
poverty alleviation as outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of 2003. This ESMF report presents
an environmental and social management framework for the WKIEMP. The Environmental and Social
Management Framework has been prepared to fully comply with environmental legislations and procedures
in Kenya and with the World Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies.

The screening criteria provided in the ESMF includes relevant questions on natural habitats/protected areas,
involuntary resettlement and land acquisition, pesticide use, impacts to forestry resources, impacts to
cultural property and inclusion of indigenous people in the project identification process. This will ensure
that all concerns related to the Bank's safeguard policies are taken into account during the screening of
subprojects for potential impacts, and that the appropriate mitigation measures can be adopted to address
them.

Objectives

The Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project (WKIEMP) seeks to improve the
productivity and sustainability of land use systems in selected watersheds in the Nzoia, Yala and Nyando
river basins through adoption of an Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) approach. In order to achieve
this, the project will: (i) support on- and off-farm conservation strategies through interventions focused on
improving soil fertility, agroforestry, and introduction of value added cropping systems; and (ii) improve
the capacity of local communities and institutions to identify, formulate and implement integrated
ecosystem management activities (including both on-and off-farm land use planning) that capture local,
national and global environmental benefits.

The project will be implemented in three river basins of Western Kenya, namely, Nyando, Yala and Nzoia,
which together support a population of 7 million people. Approximately 75% of the area within these basins
is classified as an agro-ecosystem. The total area of the three basins is about 20,000 km2 (Nyando, 3,550
km2, Yala 3,364 km2, and Nzoia 12,984 km2). The project area will consist of 9 focal areas (FA's) each
measuring 100 km2. Of these FA's, 3 will be in Nyando basin, 3 in Yala basin and 3 in Nzoia basin. The
FA's within basins will be stratified by elevation zones to include lowlands (1334 - 1440 masl), midlands
(1440-1890 masl) and highlands (1890 masl).

Implementation

The project will be demand-driven and implemented under a decentralized arrangement. At the
village/community level, community groups will be the main bodies for planning and implementing
approved development interventions. Community groups could be formal village organizations such as
Village Development Committees (VDCs) or smaller groups of interest group members. The seconded
environmental and social specialists (SESS) from the National Environment Management Authority
(NEMA) and KARI will be responsible for ensuring that the environmental and social impacts screening
and review system set out in this Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is integrated
into the subprojects cycles. At the national level, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) will provide lead
coordination and ensure that results meet the targets set by the project. The TAG will be chaired by the
Director of KARI. The day-to-day coordination and monitoring of project activities will be handled by the
PCO located in Kisumu.

The project will be supervised by the World Bank (WB) and financed by the Government of Kenya (GOK)
and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and the
World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) will implement the project. WKIEMP is a five-year project with a
budget of about US$ 4.5 million. The estimated cost of mainstreaming the ESMF in the WKIEMP is US $
675,000.

Reporting

The Project Coordination Office (PCO) and the seconded environmental and social specialists (SESS) will
provide an annual report on environmental and social progress report to the national Technical Advisory
Group (TAG) for review. KARI will hire an independent consultant to conduct an environmental and social
performance audit of the project during the midterm review of the project. This audit report will be shared
with TAG, KARI, the World Bank and other relevant government agencies.

Alternatives

Several alternatives for the project were considered before the current proposal was prepared. The first was
linking the project with the International Development Association (IDA). The second was a stand-alone
Global Environment Facility (GEF) project. The Government of Kenya has recognized the rapid decline in
the natural environment and stagnation in agricultural production of Western Kenya as a priority. A number
of jointly funded initiatives are being implemented by the Government, international donors, NGOs and
community-based organizations. An IDA funded community based development project is also anticipated
in the next three years. Given the scale of land degradation, more interventions will be required to reach
ecosystem sustainability.

Implementing the project in fewer river basins than all the lands covering Western Kenya was considered
because the project will have an important demonstration effect and it is expected to attract further
resources. In addition, the learning opportunity provided by three river basins, which vary in agro-
ecological and socio-economic characteristics is likely to outweigh the benefits from increased coverage on
just one river basin.

Biodiversity

Existing rural activities and poor land management practices have also affected biodiversity in two ways: 1)
by fuelling the demand for more agricultural land and therefore altering natural habitats; and 2) by altering
the chemical properties and therefore reducing soil and plant diversity. Western Kenya is an area with
unique habitats and biodiversity of local, national and global significance.

Socio-economic characteristics

Western Kenya has one of the densest and poorest populations, with up to 1200 persons per km2 in some
rural areas. The region is characterized by low agricultural productivity, high population pressure and lack
of off-farm income opportunities. Over 58 percent of households live in absolute poverty.

The primary livelihood strategy for about 80 percent of the population in the three river basins is farming.
Livestock ownership forms an important part of the household asset base for both farmers and agro-
pastoralists. Traditional land management in western Kenya has relied on fallowing of unproductive fields
to restore fertility and decrease pest problems. The rapid increase of population density makes this practice
untenable and has led to wide scale abandonment of fallowing. High rural population growth coupled with
stagnating urban job growth has accelerated the search for new agricultural land, resulting in a high rate of
woodland, forest, grassland and wetland conversion for agricultural use.

Safeguard Screening Procedures

The WKIEMP is anticipated to have beneficial impacts on the environment since its overall objective is to
promote sustainable land use and environmentally sound natural resources management through community
driven development. Although the project is expected to produce net benefits in terms of natural resource
management and conservation, certain project activities related to improved land management may have
environmental or social impacts that require mitigation. Hence the proposed project has been rated
Category B under the World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), requiring a partial
Environmental Assessment (EA).

The ESMF is expected to cover the unknowns, to help in the screening, and to recommend mitigation
measures. The screening and review process will determine how and when a particular subproject will
trigger a safeguard policy, and what mitigation measures will need to be put in place. The screening and
review process will also ensure that subprojects that may have potentially significant impacts will require


Environmental and Social Management Framework    7      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

more detailed study. The need for subproject specific EIAs will also be identified by the screening and
review process.

Environmental and Social Impacts

The proposed project will involve direct interventions in the biophysical and human environments. The
potential environmental impacts can be categorized as: biophysical, and social. These impacts can occur at
various stages of project development and can be positive or negative. On balance, the potential positive
impacts of the project outweigh the negative impacts. Therefore, the WKIEMP has the potential to make a
significant contribution to Kenya's policies to protect and preserve the environment while reducing poverty
in rural areas.

At the local level the project is expected to generate many positive impacts that could lead to improvements
in alleviation of poverty, improved food security through better crop yields, diversified agricultural resource
base, and improved household income. The project will also result in a multiplier effect on the local
economy through development of entrepreneurial activities.

At the national, provincial and district levels, the project will promote rural development strategies that
integrate ecosystem concerns. The decentralization process through community management of natural
resources and Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) decision-making processes that is inbuilt in the
project will also strengthen local social organizational structures to evaluate ecosystem concerns that cover
more than one village.

At the global level, the project will contribute to the reduction of soil degradation, improvement of biomass
production and sequestration of above and below ground carbon. The project will also contribute to reduced
siltation, and nutrient runoff to rivers systems draining into Lake Victoria.

Potential negative impacts at local, national and global levels may include pollution and eutrophication of
water bodies, interference with wetland and animal ecology (particularly birds and fish), erosion and
sedimentation and social disruption through lack of adequate capacity for environmental and social
screening. Alternative livelihoods and intensification of agricultural production (including livestock) which
may result in community well-being, may also lead to an increase in areas brought under cultivation and
overall numbers of livestock units which may increase demand on natural resources or degrade the
surrounding environment. The stakeholders will be provided with an opportunity to learn how to avoid or
mitigate localized impacts from initial subprojects so that measures can be integrated in subsequent
activities.

Capacity Building and Training

In order to ensure proper implementation of environmental and social screening, and mitigation measures,
as well as effective natural resource management, the WKIEMP will undertake an intensive program of
environmental training and institutional capacity building. Environmental training and sensitisation will be
required at all levels including community workers, local government bodies, and SESS. The PCO, SESS,
CSPs and additional experts will provide a diverse range of technical training on environmental issues to
these groups.

1.       INTRODUCTION

The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) has requested for the preparation of an Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for the proposed Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem
Management Project (WKIEMP). The project corresponds with the central features of Kenya's strategy for
poverty alleviation as outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of 2003. This ESMF study report
presents an environmental and social management framework for the WKIEMP.


1.1      Objectives

The objectives of the ESMF are:

              To assess the potential environmental and social impacts of`(i) on-farm agroforestry, erosion
               control and soil re-capitalization; (ii) fertilizer use in the light of the degraded resource base,
               particularly soils in the proposed project area; and (iii) international waters and natural
               habitats;
              To propose mitigation measures which will effectively address identified negative impacts;
              To outline the institutional structure for implementing the ESMF;
              To prepare a resettlement framework (if required) within a development approach;
              To prescribe project arrangements for the preparation, review, approval and implementation
               of subprojects in order to adequately address World Bank safeguard issues;
              To conduct a social assessment that goes beyond providing a profile of social groups, and
               their issues and concerns.

The analysis includes:

              An assessment of the potential environmental and social impacts of the proposed WKIEMP,
               taking into account the World Bank's relevant safeguard policies as well as Kenya's
               environmental policies, laws and regulations;
              A review the various studies on biophysical characteristics of the target areas covered by the
               project and identification of constraints that need to be taken into account during project
               preparation;
              Ascertaining whether the project area contains any cultural heritage that needs to be taken
               into account during project preparation;
              An assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the project activities in the target
               areas including the likelihood that they may affect indigenous peoples along river banks, and
               formulation of appropriate recommendations;
              Development of an entitlement matrix that reflects different categories of user groups and
               recognizes both formal and informal rights to resources (including land);
              Development of screening procedures (including checklists) that will be used as a mechanism
               in the ESMF for screening potential environmental and social impacts due to subproject
               interventions;
              Development of appropriate methods to promote an Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
               approach that will minimize the need for chemical pesticides during project interventions;
              Presentation of an analysis of alternatives;
              Review of national environmental policies, legislation, regulatory and administrative
               frameworks in conjunction with the World Bank's safeguard policies, and formulation of
               recommendations in the context of the project as appropriate;
              Description of any gaps between WB policy and the national laws and how these will be
               addressed by the project;
              Review of the relevant conventions and protocols to which Kenya is a signatory;
              Evaluation of the existing environmental and social assessment, and management capacity as
               well as capacity to implement mitigation measures, and formulation of appropriate
               recommendations, including the institutional structure and the responsible agencies for
               implementing the framework, a grievance mechanism and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
               of potential impacts;


Environmental and Social Management Framework      9       Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

              Evaluation of capacity building and training needs and their costs;
              Presentation of an outline on institutional arrangements for environmental management,
               including environmental assessment procedures, monitoring indicators, and a monitoring plan
               (including costs) as appropriate under the project; and
              Development of an environmental and social management framework that establishes
               methodologies      for   environmental    and    social  impact      assessment    during     project
               implementation.

NEMA and KARI will deploy seconded environmental and social specialists (SESS) who will be part of the
committee for screening the subproject proposals, as outlined in the process framework of the ESMF. The
subprojects will be screened and given an environmental rating. The ESMF will also include a suggested
format for EIA, in case the need arises where a subproject is of environmental category A in nature. The
ESMF will fully comply with Kenyan environmental regulations and legislative requirements and with the
relevant World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies. The ESMF will specify explicit and
appropriate roles and responsibilities of all parties (individuals and institutions) responsible for managing
and monitoring environmental and social concerns related to the subprojects.

A safeguard specialist will visit Kenya and be part of the mission before project effectiveness, when the
Project Launch Workshop will be held. Relevant institutions (NEMA, KARI, ICRAF, Stakeholders,
Community Representatives, Farmer Groups, NGOs, etc.) will be given appropriate training during the
Project Launch Workshop. They in turn will train the groups and/or individuals responsible for screening
the subprojects for environmental and social safeguard concerns. The safeguards specialist will also brief
the identified individuals who will be part of the committee to screen subproject proposals for potential
environmental and social issues. The objective of the training will be to raise the level of environmental and
social awareness in the communities and promote adoption of the screening checklist.

The project will monitor and measure the impact of subproject interventions (both positive and negative) on
the environment. Where negative impacts from the subprojects are anticipated, the mitigation measures as
outlined in the ESMF will be implemented and monitored. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the
project will have environmental indicators included as well.

This ESMF study was carried out from 17 June to 10 July 2004. The assignment included a field visit to the
project sites selected by the project. The itinerary of the field visit is given in Annex 2. Government
organizations, NGOs, stakeholders and other persons contacted or consulted during the entire study period
are listed in Annex 3.

1.2      Principles and Methodology

The study has focussed on the development of the ESMF instead of the Environmental and Social
Assessment (ESA) because the precise details of the subprojects in terms of location, materials required,
key communities, etc. are not yet known. The ESMF is required to screen for and manage the potential
environmental and social impacts of the WKIEMP.

The ESMF Methodology involved:

           Review of previous reports, published and unpublished works on the environment of the study
            area;
           Identification of gaps existing in the available information;
           Field investigations;
           Collation of baseline data on the environmental conditions of the project area;
           Identification of positive and negative environmental and social impacts;
           Identification of environmental and social mitigation measures;
           Preparation of screening procedures to be used while screening subproject proposals; and
           Formulation of environmental and social monitoring plans.

2.        DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

2.1       Background to the Project

The Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project (WKIEMP) seeks to improve the
productivity and sustainability of land use systems in selected watersheds in the Nzoia, Yala and Nyando
river basins through adoption of an Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) approach. In order to achieve
this, the project will: (i) support on- and off-farm conservation strategies through interventions focused on
improving soil fertility, agroforestry, and introduction of value added cropping systems; and (ii) improve
the capacity of local communities and institutions to identify, formulate and implement integrated
ecosystem management activities (including both on-and off-farm land use planning) that capture local,
national and global environmental benefits.

The global environmental objective of the project is to promote a set of IEM interventions so as to achieve
local and global benefits. These benefits include reduced land degradation, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG)
accumulation in the atmosphere, improved on-and off-farm biodiversity, and decreased erosion in the
watersheds that feed into the Nyando, Yala and Nzoia rivers. The IEM approach attempts to reinforce
positive or beneficial feedback mechanisms between soil, atmospheric, biotic and socio-economic
components of ecosystems.


The project will be supervised by the World Bank (WB) and financed by the Government of Kenya (GOK)
and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and the
World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) will implement the project. The WKIEMP is a five-year project with a
budget of about US$ 4.5 million. The estimated cost of mainstreaming this ESMF in the WKIEMP is US$
675,000.


2.2       Project Components

The project will address the agricultural and natural resources management by:

(a) Promoting an integrated approach to natural resource management

     The project will pursue interventions that target the physical, social and economic aspects of ecosystem
     degradation. The integrated ecosystem management framework is based on the premise that there are
     social, economic, and biophysical interactions between the goals for production of environmental goods
     and services that are desired by different stakeholders.

(b) Linking upstream and downstream interventions

     Project interventions will be implemented in the highland, midland and lowland areas in order to
     capture the physical diversity of the watershed and achieve greater results at the catchment level. The
     project will explore upstream-downstream linkages, particularly in relation to biodiversity conservation
     and international waters.

(c) Embedding project activities in local government processes

     The project will be implemented at the village level with support from district administration. The
     project has been placed within the structure of local government to increase sustainability and avoid
     parallel delivery systems

(d) Incorporating global environmental benefits into local development priorities

The inclusion of environmental service functions (such as erosion control provided by reforestation) into
project activities would generate a greater development impact by increasing agricultural sustainability and


Environmental and Social Management Framework      12     Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

output. Environmental services, particularly those associated with carbon sequestration, also have the
potential to generate new types of assets that benefit local communities.

(e) Choosing a CDD approach

The project's demand driven mechanism builds on the high level of social capital in Western Kenya, the
experience in other parts of the country, and the Government's renewed pledge to decentralization.
Communities would play a lead role in articulating their needs, developing and implementing plans that
address these needs.

(f) Seeking complementarities with other programs

The project seeks to build on and complement the successes of other natural resource management projects
in the area (SMP, ATIRI, LRNP, and the SIDA sponsored Lake Victoria Project). Linkages with the second
GEF-financed LVEMP II will also be further developed. While LVEMP II will focus on trans-boundary
lake management issues, this project will support the on-the-ground watershed management investments
that will improve the management of Lake Victoria.

(g) Laying the groundwork for Future IDA financed projects

In developing the World Bank's new Country Assistance Strategy, The Government of Kenya has requested
IDA financing for a community driven development (CDD) project in Western Kenya for 2007. This new
project will build on the experiences of the proposed GEF project. While the two projects will be
administered separately, they will use the same implementation mechanisms. Given the acute need for
community based development and land degradation interventions, the current project will help fill the gap
until the new project becomes effective.

2.3       Subprojects

The subproject activities include the following;

     o    Tree planting for woodlots, in boundaries or as scattered trees in farms for poles, fuel wood and
          charcoal;
     o    Planting high value trees such as fruit, timber and medicinal trees;
     o    Introduction of improved soil and water management technologies;
     o    Management of natural forest patches for poles, timber and fodder;
     o    Establishment of fenced pastures to restore the natural vegetation;
     o    Establishment of tree nurseries;
     o    Agroforestry for soil fertility replenishment and improved crop production;
     o    Introduction of improved fallows, biomass transfer and mixed cropping;
     o    Proper management of residues on the farm;
     o    Introduction of non-wood products (honey, crafts, oils and medicine);
     o    Adding value to primary products;
     o    Improved marketing and trading of forest products;
     o    Improved technologies for energy saving and production (e.g. charcoal, stoves); and
     o    Proper handling and storage of farmyard and cattle manure.

The options outlined above are expected to contribute to improved crop and animal production, soil and
water conservation, and to increase on- and off-farm biodiversity thereby improving local livelihoods and
natural resource management. In addition, the measures will increase sequestration of above and below
ground carbon. The above list of subprojects is not exhaustive as the development of subproject proposals
will be community-driven.

In the highlands (>1890 m), the major interventions will be to increase vegetation cover. The proposed
activities include reforestation and afforestation, utilization of appropriate farming technologies such as
intercropping, controlled grazing in the grasslands and wetlands, and restoration of degraded grazing areas.



Environmental and Social Management Framework      13      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

Water collection structures and spring and riverbank protection will be promoted as possible communal
activities.

In the midlands (1140-18890 m), the major interventions will be the introduction of improved fallows,
improvement of soil fertility through agroforestry and fertilizers, introduction of high value trees and
fodder, afforestation, promotion of livestock and wetland conservation.

In the lowlands (1134-1440), the major interventions will include introduction of flood control measures,
afforestation, agroforestry including high value trees, livestock improvement, water management
technologies, grazing enclosures, de-stocking and re-seeding of pasture. Many of these interventions
incorporate carbon benefits.

2.4       Project Target Areas

The project will be implemented in three river basins of Western Kenya, namely, Nyando, Yala and Nzoia,
which together support a population of 7 million people. Approximately 75% of the area within these basins
is classified as an agro-ecosystem. The total area of the three basins is about 20,000 km2 (Nyando, 3,550
km2, Yala 3,364 km2, and Nzoia 12,984 km2) The project area will consist of 9 focal areas (FA's) each
measuring 100 km2. Of these FA's, 3 will be in Nyando basin, 3 in Yala basin and 3 in Nzoia basin. The
FA's within basins will be stratified by elevation zones to include lowlands (1334 - 1440 masl), midlands
(1440-1890 masl) and highlands (1890 masl).

Focal areas will represent 8.5% of the land area in Nyando basin, 8.9% of Yala and 4.6% of Nzoia.
Population and land use vary within each strata and there are strong associations between this zonation and
variables related to population density, land use, soil condition and production ecology. Exclusions will
include large-scale commercial agricultural areas (i.e. rice irrigation schemes, tea estates and sugarcane
plantations), government lands such as national parks and national reserves, as well as lacustrine wetlands
and urban areas.

2.5.1    Project Coordination and Implementation Arrangements

KARI will implement the project with backstopping from ICRAF. The implementation arrangements will
be such that the proposals/activities originate from and are implemented by communities in the target areas
with scientific back up from KARI, KEFRI, World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), MoA extension agents,
NGOs and other partners. All these institutions are members of the Consortium for Scaling up Options for
Increased Farm Productivity (COSOFAP) in Western Kenya. Applicable World Bank safeguards policies,
and consequent project preparation requirements will be adhered to.

The nature of this project calls for an ESMF that will include a screening process to assess the potential
impacts associated with subprojects. The seconded environmental and social specialists (SESS) from
NEMA and KARI will work closely with the PCO and will be based in Kisumu, as and when required, to
carry out the screening of the subproject proposals using the screening procedures and checklists. The
subprojects will be given an environmental rating. The ESMF will also include a suggested format for EIA,
in case the need arises where a subproject is of environmental category A in nature.

The project will be demand-driven and implemented under a decentralized arrangement. At the
village/community level, village development committees (VCDs) will be the main bodies for planning and
implementing approved development interventions. Implementation of selected proposals will be carried
out through close supervision of the project coordination office (PCO) and District Steering Committees
(DSCs). The SESS will be responsible for ensuring that the environmental and social impacts screening and
review system set out in this Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is integrated into
the subprojects cycles. At the national level, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) will provide lead
coordination and ensure that results meet the targets set by the project. The Director of KARI will chair the
TAG. The day-to-day coordination and monitoring of project activities will be handled by the PCO located
in Kisumu.

2.6 Annual Reporting and Performance Review Requirements

The project Coordination Office (PCO) and the SESS will provide an annual environmental and social
progress report to the national Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for review. KARI will hire an independent
consultant to conduct an environmental and social performance audit around the mid-term review of the
project. This audit report will be shared with TAG, KARI, the World Bank and other relevant government
agencies.

3.        SAFEGUARD SCREENING PROCEDURES

This Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared to fully comply with
environmental legislations and procedures in Kenya and with the World Bank's environmental and social
safeguard policies.

In this chapter, the key safeguard policies that provide the policy context to the ESMF including World
Bank policies and Kenya's legal requirements on environmental assessment have been outlined.

3.1       World Bank Safeguard Policies

As part of the ESMF process, proposed subprojects under WKIEMP will be designed at the local level to
ensure that they are screened for potential impacts and that they comply with the requirements set out under
World Bank safeguard policies

The WKIEMP is anticipated to have beneficial impacts on the environment since its overall objective is to
promote sustainable land use and environmentally sound natural resources management through community
driven development. Although the project is expected to produce net benefits in terms of natural resource
management and conservation, certain project activities related to improved land management may have
environmental or social impacts that require mitigation. Hence the proposed project has been rated
Category B under the World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), requiring a partial
Environmental Assessment (EA).

This project calls for an ESMF, that will include a screening process to assess the potential impacts
associated with subprojects. In addition to the OP 4.01, the WKIEMP has triggered OP 7.50 Projects in
International Waters, as indicated in Table 1. Using the screening and review process for subproject
identification will, therefore, help determine which of the safeguard policies are triggered and what
measures will need to be taken to address the potential impacts. The screening and review process will
determine how and when a particular subproject will trigger a safeguard policy, and what mitigation
measures will need to be put in place. The screening and review process will also ensure that subprojects
that may have potentially significant impacts will require more detailed study. The need for subproject
specific EIAs will also be identified by the screening and review process.

POLICY                                                               APPLICABILITY
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01)                 Yes
Natural habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04)                         No
Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36)                                          No
Pest Management (OP 4.09)                                            No
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03)                                        No
Indigenous peoples (OD 4.20)                                         No
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)                                No
Safety of Dams (OP 4.37, BP 4.37)                                    No
Projects in International Waters (OP 7.50, BP 7.50, GP 7.50)         Yes
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60)               No


Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)
This OP 4.01 has been triggered because there is potential that the implementation of the WKIEMP may
lead to some negative environmental impacts. There are no potential large-scale, significant or irreversible
environmental impacts associated with the project. Project interventions will focus on implementation of
specific activities that improve the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. Although some land
management activities may require assessment and mitigation, it is anticipated that few of the expected
activities will have a negative environmental impacts. The potential impacts identified are localized impacts
associated with activities that are likely to be financed under local investment funds such as road upgrading,
wetlands and ecosystem management, and small-scale dams which can be effectively mitigated and are
addressed in the ESMF. Those activities that are not addressed by the ESMF will be identified using the
screening and review procedures in Chapter 6. The ESMF identifies the major potential environmental
impacts and proposes measures to mitigate these effects, including proposed training and monitoring
measures.

Natural Habitats (OP 4.04)


Environmental and Social Management Framework        16     Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

There are a number of critical habitats in western Kenya, however, none will be adversely affected by the
project. The project will not be implemented in any protected area, but will target a number of critical
natural habitats for biodiversity conservation. Critical natural habitats in the project area include swamps,
wetlands and forest and grassland fragments. Since the project will focus on conservation strategies, thee
will be no degradation or conversion of habitats. Other project activities are also not expected to negatively
impact critical habitats directly. Those activities that are not addressed by the ESMF and may have impacts
on natural habitats will be identified using the screening and review procedures as outlined in Chapter 6.

Cultural Property (OPN 11.03)

The project will not include areas of significant cultural value. However, the project may impact small
communal cultural property such as funeral or burial sites. The project's participatory approach will ensure
appropriate management of such property. The ESMF has identified some potential impacts that may arise
and has proposed mitigation measures that include mapping of the unmarked sites with the assistance of
competent authorities. The Government of Kenya through the Department of Monuments and Sites of the
National Museums of Kenya is committed to the preservation of cultural properties and seeks means to
avoid their elimination. The activities that are not addressed by the ESMF will be identified using the
screening and review procedures as outlined in Chapter 6.

Projects in International Waters (OP 7.50)

The project will be implemented in the Nyando, Yala and Nzoia River Basins, which are part of the Lake
Victoria watershed. These three rivers are part of the Lake Victoria Basin that is shared by Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania, and as such constitute an international waterway under OP/BP 7.50. The OP requires, as a
general rule, notification of all the riparian owners of the international waterway of certain types of projects
specified in the OP, but also includes some exceptions to the notification requirement. The project will not
finance irrigation and other water use or pollution activities or any major works. It will only finance small
works as part of the community-driven IEM subprojects, which will involve scaling up current land
rehabilitation interventions such as protection of river banks and construction of water pans, improvement
of soil fertility, agro forestry, and introduction of value-added cropping systems. Any rehabilitation works
for spring protection will be small in size and will not adversely affect the quality or quantity of water flows
into Lake Victoria. Based on the above, the project qualifies for an exception to the notification requirement
under OP 7.50.

Pest Management (OP 4.09)
The project will finance activities aimed at increasing agricultural productivities, with the main thrust of
activities on improving the sustainability of agricultural production through improved land management and
adoption of agroforestry and soil fertility management practices. The project is expected to have a positive
impact on pest management in the project areas. The ESMF includes methods to promote integrated pest
management in subproject activities and identifies mitigation measures. Those activities that are not
addressed by the ESMF and may use pest products that are likely to have impacts on the environment will
be identified using the screening and review procedures as outlined in Chapter 6.

Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
The project will be implemented with farmers in lowland, midland and highland areas and will not impact
any indigenous peoples. The ESMF has included measures such as participation in decision-making process
throughout the project planning, in the event of occurrence of any indigenous peoples.

3.2       Mainstreaming Safeguard Compliance into Subproject Screening
The screening criteria provided in the ESMF includes relevant questions which will help determine if any
other safeguard policies are triggered and the measures need to be taken to mitigate impacts. The screening
and review process will identify any subprojects that may have potentially significant impacts which require
more detailed study and the need for a subproject specific EIA. This will ensure that all concerns related to
the Bank's safeguard policies are taken into account during the screening of subprojects for potential
impacts, and that the appropriate mitigation measures can be adopted to address them.

3.3       Kenya's Environmental Legislation
The preparation of this ESMF has taken into account the requirements for environmental assessment under
Kenyan law, mainly under Section 58 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act, 1999. The
section also requires project proponents to obtain an EIA License from NEMA before the implementation
of a project. The Act as well as the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations 2003,


Environmental and Social Management Framework       17      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

Kenya Gazette Supplement No. 56 of 13th June 2003, requires that the project proponent submit a project
report to the National Environment Management Authority.
The Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of an
appropriate legal and institutional framework for the management of the environment in Kenya. Part VI
(S.58) of the act makes it mandatory for environmental impact assessments (EIAs) to be conducted before
the commencement of projects involving urban development, water bodies, transportation, mining,
agriculture and forestry related activities.

3.4      Subproject Screening under Kenyan Law
With the above requirements in mind, for those subprojects which require an EIA, as determined under the
screening and review process, a copy of the EIA report will be submitted to the National Environment
Management Authority (NEMA) for approval. NEMA will review and comment on the EIA before the
subproject can be appraised. This will ensure that subprojects that may have potentially significant impacts
and require more detailed study receive national level approval as well as district level approval. With the
approval of the ESMF by NEMA, not all subprojects will require EIAs to be undertaken.

3.5      International conventions and treaties

Convention on Wetlands or the Ramsar Convention

The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is primarily concerned with the conservation and management of
wetlands. Parties to the Convention are also required to promote the wise use of wetlands in their territories
and to take measures for their conservation by establishing nature reserves in wetlands, whether they are
included in the Ramsar list or not. Kenya ratified the Ramsar Convention in June 1990. The proposed
project is expected to adhere to the Ramsar Convention's principles of wise use of wetlands in the project
area.

Convention on Biological Diversity

The Convention on Biological Diversity adopts a broad approach to conservation. It requires Parties to the
Convention to adopt national strategies, plans and programmes for the conservation of biological diversity,
and to integrate the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into relevant sectoral and cross-
sectoral plans, programmes and policies. The proposed project is expected to conserve biodiversity,
especially the rare and endangered species in the project area and its environs.
Convention on the Conservation of Migratory species

The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) was adopted to conserve migratory species of wild animals
given that migratory species are seen as an international resource. Such species may be terrestrial or marine.
The State Members of the Convention endeavour to conclude agreements for the protection and
management of migratory species whose conservation status is unfavourable and of those whose
conservation status would substantially benefit from international cooperation deriving from an agreement.
The Convention's Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Water birds is specific on
the need to protect the migratory water birds' feeding, breeding and wintering habitats, the main ones being
wetlands and open water bodies.

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) seeks to regulate levels of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentration in the atmosphere, so as to avoid the occurrence of climate change
at levels that would harm economic development, or that would impede food production activities. The
Convention is founded on the principle that contracting parties would should take courses of action, in
respect of their economic and social activities, and with regard to the Convention's specific requirements,
that will protect the climate system for present and future generations. The proposed project will assist in
the implementation of the specific requirements of the Convention.

United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification

The objective of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is to combat
desertification and to mitigate the effects of drought in seriously affected countries, especially those in
Africa. It seeks to achieve this objective through integrated approaches to development, supported by
international cooperation and partnership arrangements, in the affected areas. It lays emphasis on long-term


Environmental and Social Management Framework    18      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

strategies that focus on improved productivity of land and the rehabilitation, conservation and sustainable
management of land and water resources, leading to improved living conditions, in particular at the
community level. The proposed project is designed to implement the requirements of the UNCCD.

Important bird areas

Lake Victoria basin has five of sixty sites that have been identified as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) of
Kenya. The Important Bird Areas Programme is a worldwide initiative working for the conservation of
biological diversity and the sustainability of human use of natural resources. The project is expected to
recognize these IBAs and to protect them where they occur in the project area or in the environs.

The Nile treaties

There are about eleven treaties dealing with the consumptive use of the waters of River Nile and Lake
Victoria. The riparian countries are under limited obligations under general international law to permit the
lower riparian States an equitable share of the water, but then the exact modalities would be subject to fresh
negotiations. The Nile Basin Initiative is currently addressing the issue of equitable utilisation of the
common Nile Basin water resources.

The Nile Basin Initiative seeks to harness the tremendous potential of the Nile for the benefit of the people
of the Basin, both for now and for generations to come. This becomes a major challenge because as
economic development accelerates, population increases and demand for water grows. NBI's Shared Vision
puts economic development at its centre. The Shared Vision is: "To achieve sustainable socio-economic
development through the equitable utilisation of, and benefits from, the common Nile Basin water
resources" or in short "Sustainable development of the River Nile for the benefit of all".

4.       BASELINE INFORMATION

4.1      Biophysical

4.1.1      Location

The project area is part of the Lake Victoria basin. The whole lake basin covers an area of 184,000 km2 of
Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi, and is home to an estimated population of 25 million
people with an average density of 135 persons per km2. The lake basin has 11 major river catchments,
namely, Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Gucha, Mara, Gurumeti, Mbalageti, Duma, Simiyu, Magoga,
Isonga and Kagera, and a large lake edge area that drains directly into the lake. The surface area of the lake
is 68,000 km2 making it the largest tropical lake, and the second largest freshwater lake in the world. It is
shared by Kenya (6%), Uganda (45%) and Tanzania (49%). The lake is bisected by the equator and lies at
an altitude of 1,134 metres above sea level. The lake and its catchment cover an area of 252,400 km2.
The Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria basin covers about 42,000km2 and is home to about 7.9 million
people. The average density is about 190 persons per km2. Seven major rivers, namely, Nzoia, Yala,
Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Gucha and Mara drain this area. The WKIEMP will cover the basins of Nyando
(3,600 km2), Yala (3,400km2) and Nzoia (13,000km2) rivers.

4.1.2      Geology and soils

Various soil types are found in the river basins. The soils of the mountains, hills, plateaus and foot slopes
are excessively to well drained, very shallow to shallow, dark reddish brown, stony and rocky, sandy clay
loam to clay, and in places with an acid humic topsoil, and are moderately deep to deep. Most protected
natural forests are found in these areas and serve to stabilize the soil and protect the water catchments.

The soils of the uplands are well drained, deep to very deep, and in some places shallow to moderately
deep, dark reddish brown to dark brown, friable to firm clay, with thick acid humic topsoil. Protected
plantation forests are found in these areas. Most of the tree species in the plantation forests are exotic and
require well-drained deep soils.

The Kavirondian Rift System determines the topography of the lowland areas. Tectonic earth movements
and erosion of different rock types over long periods have created varied morphology of lowlands bounded
by upland areas. Pre-Cambrian volcanic and intrusive rocks, tertiary volcanic rocks and quaternary
sedimentary deposits characterize the geology of the lowland area. In general most soils are susceptible to
erosion as the silt content is very high in relation to the clay content.

4.1.3      Climate

Rainfall is mainly convective in origin and is largely influenced by the movement of the inter-tropical
convergence zone (ITCZ). Nonetheless, rainfall amounts are partly influenced by the expansive Lake
Victoria. Due to the convective origins of rainfall, there is high seasonal variability exhibiting high intra-
and inter-seasonal variation in onset, duration and amount of precipitation. There are two fairly distinct
rainy seasons: The long rains peaking between April and May and the short rains peaking between
November and December.

4.1.4      Water quality

The Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria is important for the riparian states, providing food, freshwater supply,
transport, recreation, tourism, and biodiversity conservation. The lake is under extreme pressure and
evidence of nutrient build-up is increasing. The "Winam Gulf Baseline Study" conducted in 1984 and 1985
provides the most comprehensive water quality data for the Gulf. Secchi depth measurements of water
transparency were low (1.6-2.4 m at the centre of the Gulf, 0.8 m at the eastern lakeshore area, and 0.3 to
0.4 in Nyakach Bay. This indicates relatively low transparency of the bay due to high levels of suspended
solids from the Nyando River, and blue-green algae blooms are a common occurrence.

Winam Gulf is considered eutrophic on the basis of conventional trophic state indices, that is, Secchi depth,
TP and Chlorophyll-a. The bloom-causing algae (Cyanophyta) predominate in the Gulf region. Sporadic
cyanophyte blooms occur within the Gulf resulting in fish kills. Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena
circinalis are the dominant bloom-causing algal species.




Environmental and Social Management Framework      20       Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

4.1.5 Biodiversity

Western Kenya's rich stock of biodiversity has suffered as a result of land degradation. By the mid 1980's,
some 400 endemic species of cichlid fish were approaching extinction due to introduced fish species, the
Nile Perch (Lates niloticus), encroachment from water hyacinth and increasing eutrophication of Lake
Victoria. Deforestation and loss of vegetative cover has also resulted in a shortage of plant and tree
resources. Over the last 150 years the most important land cover conversion pathways in the Nyando basin
have been characterized by substitutions of vegetation dominated by trees (characterized by a C3
photosynthetic pathway) to vegetation dominated by grasses (characterized by a C4 photosynthetic
pathway). Evidence from stable carbon isotope (i.e.; d13C) studies suggest that historically, grass and cereal
crop based land use types are strongly associated with elevated soil erosion risk in this environment.

Vegetation
The original vegetation in the lowland area was Acacia-Balanites-Combretum woodland. This has been
degraded over time due to human settlement and agriculture. Tree stands are usually found in relatively
scattered patches in wooded grassland. Planted Eucalyptus and Euphorbia species are commonly seen on
borders of farms and homesteads. The vegetation of the lowland area is rather poor from a naturalist point
of view. What remains of the natural vegetation is restricted to some few hilly areas that are rich in
biodiversity. These hilly areas are not easily accessible.

A direct effect of eutrophication in Lake Victoria is the rapid spread of the water hyacinth, Eichhornia
crassipes, in the lake and other water bodies in its catchment. The climatic factors and the nutrient status of
the lake are ideal for its growth. Several other aquatic weeds are found in the Lake Victoria and its satellite
water bodies including wetlands. Of these, the most problematic weeds are the water hyacinth, Eichhornia
crassipes, and the Nile Cabbage, Pistia stratiotes. The water fern (Salvinia molesta) is also found in the
littoral areas of Lake Victoria. Indigenous aquatic plants growing naturally in water, such as the hippo
grass, Vossia cuspidata, can achieve weed status when the water body undergoes eutrophication.

Fauna
Wetlands are critical biodiversity areas often hosting a large variety of bird life. Of the 1089 bird species
found in Kenya, 255 species from 44 families are associated with water and aquatic systems, implying
wetlands support approximately 25% of Kenya's avifauna. Of the 255 species, freshwater bodies support
235 species or slightly over 92%. In total, 170 species are supported by the Lake Victoria wetlands, and out
of this number, 82 are dependent on aquatic vegetation and water edge habitats. Wetlands in the project
area are fairly well stocked with fishing birds like the Gulls, Terns, Pelicans, Kingfishers and Cormorants.

Lake Victoria is world famous for its many endemic species, especially the cichlid endemism of 99% with
300 species. Since the introduction of the Nile Perch, Lates niloticus and Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis
nilotica) in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there has been a large change in the ichthyofauna of the lake.
The Nile perch is a voracious predator preying on the cichlids particularly Haplochromis spp. The total
annual fish catch in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria range from 180,000 to 250,000 metric tonnes,
landed at over 200 beaches. Most fish caught are for domestic consumption and any surplus is sold in local
markets. Farmers living near wetlands are also fishermen.

A wide variety of vertebrates and invertebrates are supported by the numerous wetlands and rivers found in
the project area. However, outside these ecosystems, the diversity and population of wildlife is quite low
since their habitats have largely been destroyed by human activities. Animals that are dependent on the
wetlands include the Sitatunga that feed and breed in wetlands and are, thus, restricted to the papyrus and
swampy areas. Other major fauna include the Otters, which are not entirely wetland mammals but are
known to live in wetland areas where there is plenty of fish, which they feed on, as well as crabs, molluscs
and amphibians. The Nile crocodile and hippopotamus are also found in the area. Monkeys, monitor lizards
and several snakes including python, cobra, and mamba are also found within these wetlands. There are
also several animals that are not associated with wetlands and water bodies like hyenas, porcupines and
antelopes. These are less well represented in the area due to human disturbance and extensive cultivation.

Human-wildlife conflicts occur in the project area. Crop destruction and damage by raiding monkeys,
hippopotami, waterbuck and porcupines is one form of conflict. The other form consists of injuries and
sometimes death by dangerous wildlife species such as crocodiles, hippopotami and snakes.

4.2       Socio-economic Characteristics

4.2.1      Population and Social Characteristics

Population Characteristics

Western Kenya has one of the densest and poorest populations, with up to 1200 persons per km2 in some
rural areas. The region is characterized by low agricultural productivity, high population pressure and lack
of off-farm income opportunities. Over 58 percent of households live in absolute poverty.

Traditional land management in Western Kenya has in the past relied on fallowing of unproductive fields to
restore fertility and decrease pest problems. High rural population growth has made this practice untenable,
and has led to wide scale abandonment of fallowing and the search for new agricultural land. There has
been little restriction on encroachment onto steep slopes, wetlands, or forests, despite the existence of laws
and regulations against such practices.

The project area includes a diversity of livelihood strategies and local cultural norms and groupings. Such
differences, in combination with the agro-ecological circumstances identified above, affect access to
resources, the agriculture mix, petty business and other non-farm activities. People from three major ethnic
groups (Luo, Luhya and the Kipsigis) inhabit the districts falling within the project area.

Population by sex, number of households, area and density in the project area is shown in table 4.1 below.

4.2.2      Current Land Use Systems

An overall situation of rapidly declining land-holding sizes remains. The main reason for this decreasing
average land size is the fragmentation of land through heritage, which in turn is not only due to the
traditional hereditary system, but is also partly due to the lack of economic alternatives outside farming, and
related to land being a secure asset and a place to retire. Population increase is also a factor in land
fragmentation.

Conversion of woodlands, forests, and wetlands into agricultural production has accelerated in recent years
with significant negative impact on the natural resource base. Studies conducted in the context of the Lake
Victoria Integrated Land Management Project (LVILMP) uniformly indicate the occurrence of severely
accelerated land degradation in the Lake Victoria watershed. Measurements performed on sediment cores
collected in the Nyando estuary show that sedimentation rates of the basin have increased fourfold over the



Environmental and Social Management Framework      22      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

last 100 years resulting in large gullies that advance at rates up to 200 meters per year and large quantities
of sediment deposit in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria.

Intensification of land use is necessary to achieve farming systems that are more sustainable than what is
available today. Farmer management of land is greatly affected by the potential rewards of different
agricultural choices. Increased profitability of agriculture increases the incentives for landowners to invest
in their land, with likely implications that less degradation will occur on their land and they will have less
incentive to leave smallholdings in search of larger ones. Experiences from Central Kenya, where there is
evidence of high productivity, high profits, and good land management, are supportive of this relationship.

Profitable agricultural opportunities are not a sufficient condition for good land management on farms. The
prevention of degradation, in the absence of traditional techniques of fallowing, requires new innovations
and the sharing of information. On the technical side, soil fertility replenishment, mitigation of land
degradation, and enhancing soil organic matter must be accompanied by appropriate conservation practices,
crop diversification and increased planting of trees on farms, in short, good land husbandry.                 More
sustainable agriculture will in turn provide environmental benefits that accrue at the local, national, and
global levels since current poor management practices are threatening biodiversity, increasing sediment
loads in key waterways and reducing GHG storage in above and below ground biomass.

4.2.3      Economic Characteristics

The Lake Victoria basin supports one of the densest and poorest rural populations in the world. Western
Kenya as a whole is characterized by comparatively lower household incomes from the farm. In addition
high levels of disease and destitution characterize the proposed project area. Studies conducted in the area
reveal linkages between:

              Poverty and land investments. Poor households invest very little in agricultural inputs;

              Agriculture, ill-health and poverty;

              Wetland drainage for irrigation agriculture and land degradation; and

              Low soil fertility and lack of technical advice.

Poverty in Kenya remains a challenge requiring urgent attention. It is a multi-dimensional phenomenon,
which includes inadequacy of income and deprivation of basic needs and rights, and access to productive
assets as well as to social infrastructure and markets (PRSP, 2003). The quantitative approach of measuring
poverty defines the poor as those who cannot afford basic food and non-food items. The 1997 Welfare
Monitoring Survey estimated the absolute poverty line at KShs.1,239 per person per month and KShs.2,648
respectively for rural and urban areas. This poverty line is determined and based on the expenditure
required to purchase a food basket that allows minimum nutritional requirements to be met. The minimum
nutritional requirements are set at 2,250 calories per adult equivalent per day. Based on Welfare Monitoring
Survey (WMS III) of 1997, the proportion of the population that cannot purchase the basic basket of goods
was estimated to be 53 per cent of the rural and 50 per cent of the urban population.

Using the qualitative approach of Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs), people define, view and
experience poverty in different ways. In the 2001 PPA reports, people mainly defined poverty as the
inability to meet their basic needs. Poverty was associated with features such as lack of land,
unemployment, inability to feed oneself and one's family, lack of proper housing, poor health and inability
to educate children and pay medical bills.

In Kenya the poor tend to be clustered into certain social categories such as:

         the landless;

         people with disabilities;

         female headed households;

         households headed by people without formal education;

         pastoralists in drought prone ASAL districts;

         unskilled and semi-skilled casual labourers;

         AIDS orphans;


Environmental and Social Management Framework     23       Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

         street children and beggars;

         subsistence farmers;

         urban slum dwellers; and

         unemployed youth.

In urban areas, the poor live in peri-urban and slum settlements, which are characterised by inadequate/low
quality basic services, like inadequate water, limited access to quality schools and health services and
unhygienic living conditions. Poverty levels in the rural and urban areas of the study area of the WKIEMP
which spreads over Busia, Vihiga, Nandi, Kericho, Nyando and Trans-Nzoia districts, according to the CBS
(2003), are as outlined in Table 4.3 and 4.4 below.

In order to overcome the obvious weaknesses of income poverty measures and to include important
livelihood parameters, the concept of human poverty includes lack of capabilities, freedom and personal
security, access to education, health and safe drinking water. Rather than measure poverty by income, the
human poverty index (HPI) uses basic indicators of deprivation: illiteracy, malnutrition, early death,
inadequate health care and limited access to safe water. Results for several districts in the target region are
as shown below.

Human Development Index (HDI) within Study Sites

Opportunity, security and empowerment are three essential ingredients of poverty reduction and human
development. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure of human development derived from a
composite of three indices: life expectancy, education attainment and standard of living as measured by
income. Kenya's HDI value in the Global Human Development Report 2002 was 0.513.

Education is especially critical as it plays an important role in human development by empowering people
to improve their well being and participate actively in nation building. The PRSP for the period 2001 
2004 outlines the steps the government intends to take to ensure affordable and equitable access to
education (including Special Education).

The table below shows the desegregated HDI results for various districts in the Western Kenya watershed.
There exist significant differences in human capabilities and welfare within the basins. This could be useful
in determining priorities for development interventions.

Gender-related Development Index (GDI)

The role of gender in sustainable development is now indisputable, as there is a common understanding
between economists, sociologists, policy makers and development planners, that development in any
society cannot be sustainable without the participation of all its population.

Gender refers to the socio-cultural construction of the differences between men and women. Proper human
development is about the well being of all people, without any discrimination. The gender-related
development index (GDI) captures the differences between the achievements of men and women. The GDI
measures achievements adjusted for gender inequality. It focuses on capabilities.

4.2.4      Health

Waterborne and Water-related Diseases

Lake Victoria lowlands are classified as a holoendemic malarial zone. Part of the project area falls in this
zone and the most diagnosed outpatient case in all health facilities in the project area is malaria. It is also
the most important cause of high infant mortality in the area. Second to malaria is upper respiratory tract
infection, although this generally results in very low mortality. Two species of parasites that cause bilhazia
or Schistosomiasis occur in the region, Schistosomiasis haematobium and Schistosomiasis mansoni.
Nonetheless, of the few reported cases over the years, S. mansoni is the most common among fishermen
while S. haematobium is proportionately more common among the farmers.

HIV/AIDS

HIV/AIDS is discussed here because the rates of infection in Western Kenya are among the highest in the
country and have left a growing number of rural households widowed or orphaned. The high mortality
affects the productive members of the local communities mostly. This has a direct effect on the local
economy. The possible positive impacts of the WKIEMP on HIV/AIDS include enhanced access to
treatment facilities to a larger proportion of the affected population and increased cash income to pay for
treatment. The negative impacts include slow implementation of the project due to absenteeism as workers
grow weak, attend funerals or tend to their ailing relatives.

5.       GUIDANCE ON POTENTIAL IMPACTS

5.1      Overall Environmental and Social Impact

The proposed project will involve direct interventions in the biophysical and human environments. The
potential environmental impacts can be categorized as biophysical, and social. These impacts can occur at
various stages of project development and can be positive or negative. Mitigation measures for the negative
impacts can be applied at each stage of project development.

Lessons learned from African and elsewhere demonstrate that community involvement in decision-making
and management process may bring lasting improvement in the livelihoods of people, and can lead to better
use and protection of the natural resource base. Consequently, environmental and social sustainability are
fundamental to the success of the WKIEMP. There is, however, a critical balance between two contrasting
scenarios:

              Firstly, under a scenario of a successful WKIEMP which works in accordance with the
               strategies and objectives set out in the project documents, a significant and positive
               contribution would be made to environmental and social sustainability by providing the tools
               and support to community driven development while ensuring rehabilitation and protection of
               the local and global environment;

              Secondly, under a scenario of a failing WKIEMP, activities supported and funded would
               contribute to further decline in environmental and social sustainability in these same areas, by
               not providing adequate support and guidance for community development, and perhaps to
               accelerate degradation of the local and global environment.


5.2      Potential Positive Impacts
Potential positive impacts will be realized at local, national and global levels. These include:

         At the local level the project is expected to generate many positive impacts on the socio-economic
         front, that could lead to improvements in alleviation of poverty, improved food security through
         better crop yields, diversified agricultural resource base, and improved household income. The
         project will also result in a multiplier effect on the local economy through development of
         entrepreneurial activities;

         The effective management and reversal of degradation of natural habitats through soil and water
         conservation techniques will lead to conservation of natural habitats and biodiversity. This will
         result in increased quantities and diversity of goods and services provided by the ecosystems to the
         local communities;

         Threats and barriers to integrated ecosystem management will be removed and in particular to
         conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in natural habitats such as gallery forests,
         sacred forests, and reserves of medicinal plans, various types of woods, grass vegetation,
         microorganisms, birds and small mammals;

         At the national, provincial and district levels, the project will promote rural development strategies
         that integrate ecosystem concerns. The project will contribute to the decentralization process
         through community management of natural resources and Integrated Ecosystem Management
         (IEM) decision-making processes. The project will also strengthen local social organizational
         structures to evaluate ecosystem concerns that cover more than one village will also be realized
         through the project;

         At the global level, the project will contribute to the reduction of soil degradation, improvement of
         biomass production and sequestration of above and below ground carbon, and reduced siltation,
         and nutrient runoff to rivers systems draining into Lake Victoria;


Environmental and Social Management Framework     27       Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

         International waters of Lake Victoria and its tributaries will be protected through restoration of
         river banks from erosion and field encroachment, which is expected to significantly reduce
         pollution of international waters by sedimentation and agro-chemicals;




         The project will also contribute to the commitments made under several global conventions and
         treaties, in particular, Convention on Biological Diversity, Convention on Wetlands, UN
         Framework on Climate Change, and Convention to Combat Desertification;

         Pressure on natural habitats (remnant forests, riparian areas, wetlands, etc.) will be decreased
         through improved on-farm and off-farm biodiversity and agro-biodiversity;

         Capacity for local communities, farmer associations, national, and international institutions to
         identify opportunities, and formulate and implement policies in support of integrated ecosystem
         management (IEM) approaches, combining local and global benefits will be enhanced. However,
         communities are more likely to express demands for social and income-generating activities rather
         than for local and global and environment protection activities;

         Synergy between sustainable agricultural development and global environmental benefits such as
         mitigation of green house gases (GHG) accumulation in the atmosphere, forestry, biodiversity loss,
         and degradation of international waters will be examined;

         Soil microbial activity and micro-biodiversity will be improved through proper soil-water
         management, drainage, soil de-compaction, and utilization of organic manures to fertilize the soil;

         Contribution will be made to the decentralization process through community management of
         natural resources and Integrated Environmental Management (IEM) decision-making processes;
         and

         Partnerships with international, public and private development communities to acquire
         sustainable IEM financing capacity through various financial schemes will be established.

Therefore, the WKIEMP has the potential to make a significant contribution to Kenya's policies to protect
and preserve the environment while reducing poverty in rural areas.

5.3      Potential Negative Impacts

On the whole, the project interventions will focus on implementation of specific activities that improve the
long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. It is anticipated that few of the expected activities will have
negative environmental impacts. Some land management activities may require assessment and mitigation.

The potential negative environmental and social impacts identified in the ESMF are likely to be localized
impacts. These impacts may result from activities that are financed under local investment funds such as
road upgrading, wetlands and ecosystem management, and small-scale dams that can be effectively
mitigated. Those activities that are not addressed by the ESMF will be identified using the screening and
review procedures outlined in the next chapter.

With regard to the critical habitats that include swamps, wetlands and forest and grassland fragments in
western Kenya, none will be adversely affected by the project. The project will not be implemented in any
protected area, but will target a number of critical natural habitats for biodiversity conservation. The project
will focus on conservation strategies; hence there will be no degradation or conversion of habitats.

The anticipated potential negative impacts at local, national and global levels may include:

         Localized pollution and eutrophication of water bodies, and interference with wetland and animal
         ecology (particularly birds and fish).

         Alternative livelihoods and intensification of agricultural production (including livestock) which
         may result in community well-being, may also lead to an increase in areas brought under

Environmental and Social Management Framework     28      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

         cultivation and overall numbers of livestock units which may increase demand on natural
         resources or degrade the surrounding environment.

         Introduced systems of governance versus traditional systems may create conflict, or contradictions
         that may result in unsustainable agricultural or natural resource practices.

         Rising population pressures, desertification and drought due to climate change and intensification
         of agricultural systems may lead to an increase in land-related conflicts..

         Soil erosion can occur after removing vegetation cover for land clearing, exposing the soil to water
         and wind erosion.

         Localized agro-chemical pollution and reduction of water quality from agro-chemical use are
         likely to occur. Handling of pesticides and disposal of empty chemical containers requires serious
         attention.

         Improved cereal cultivation is likely to cause an increase in the population of such crop pests such
         as Quelea quelea.

          Rural livelihoods and environments are often complex, unpredictable and fragile (e.g. rural
         communities in Western Kenya are highly subdivided along clan and ethnic lines), and achieving
         effective participation by the marginalized, including women, youth and the poorest of the poor
         may not be easy;

         The initial involvement of persons that own land in contractual arrangements may change the
         employment equity of minority groups including the landless, younger persons and women and
         create negative feelings, beliefs or positions by residents of the impacted area regarding the
         proposed project;

         Differential impacts of WKIEMP capacity building efforts and investments (according to gender,
         wealth status, or livelihood strategy) may result in some groups relying to a greater extent than
         others on unsustainable use of natural resources;

         The successful establishment of trees on degraded lands will require that the current free grazing
         livestock systems on such lands will have to be restricted. This will lead to disruption in daily
         living and movement patterns as well as social network systems in some communities such as the
         Luo. In this community, restricting grazing land or fencing off land is considered to be a sign of
         being mean;

         Rapid institutional change in the formal community systems for governance and the implemention
         of new NRM initiatives may create competing institutions and decrease overall effectiveness,
         especially in budget allocation and management; and

         There are a significant number of NGO and development agency-financed projects throughout
         Western Kenya, with considerable rural development experience, that may be undermined by the
         financial weight of the WKIEMP if they are not effectively involved in the project.

The implementing agents of WKIEMP, particularly KARI and ICRAF, have considered these risks
carefully in the preparation and design of the project. Table 5.1 below sets out the factors contributing to
these risks and the features of the project design that will mitigate the risks.

                                                                                                 archaeological sites as
                                                                                                 national monuments.

5.1      Localized Impacts

Most of the developments or subprojects planned under the WKIEMP will be small in scale. Consequently
the significance of the direct negative environmental and social impacts is likely to be small. All the
activities planned under the project will have significant positive environmental impacts especially when
considering the integrated ecosystem management of the river basins linking upstream and downstream
activities. Intensification of agricultural activities through development and introduction of agrobiodivesity
can result in loss of existing biodiversity and increased human-wildlife conflicts.

5.2      Cumulative Impacts

Many of the subprojects may result in cumulative impacts on natural resources. Cumulative impacts are
those that may result from individually small-scale activities with minimal impacts but which over time can
combine to have a significant impact. Cumulative impacts can also be defined as impacts that potentially
develop from the combined impacts of more than one subproject. Examples include:

               Deforestation due to exploitation of forest resources for such use as firewood, charcoal and
                construction materials;


Environmental and Social Management Framework        36     Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

              Upstream development which may have downstream impacts such as increase in erosion and
               eutrophication of Lake Victoria;

              Illegal poaching of wildlife due to expansion of land under cultivation or increased proximity
               to protected areas; and

              Attraction of immigrant populations to communities that have improved production systems
               and social infrastructure.

The stakeholders will be provided with an opportunity to learn how to avoid or mitigate localized impacts
from initial subprojects so that measures can be integrated in subsequent activities. Chapter 6 provides a list
of triggers, which can be used to determine whether subprojects may result in cumulative impacts, and if so,
what tools to use for mitigation.

5.3       Strategic Impacts

The stated objective of the WKIEMP is to achieve significant local, national and global environmental
objectives. The project also intends to concentrate on interventions to promote sustainable land use. These
two directions are not mutually exclusive. If the WKIEMP succeeds in effectively promoting integrated
ecosystem management, then the environmental objectives and the goal to promote sustainable
development and reduce poverty will be achieved.

Other strategic issues that need to be addressed under the project are the issues of land degradation,
pollution, pest management and sensitivity to vulnerable groups. These are discussed further here below.

5.3.1       Ecological Impacts and Land Degradation

A number of the proposed activities in the subprojects can lead to both localized and cumulative impacts on
biodiversity, forests, wetlands, soils and water quality. Land degradation may arise due to subprojects that
involve infrastructure development, intensification of agriculture, and concentration of livestock in
particular areas. The environmental and social screening tools in Chapter 6 will be used to identify and
mitigate the potential impacts as they relate to certain types of community investments.

5.3.2       Potential Sources of Pollution

The use of agro-chemicals such as inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, and organic manure can lead to
pollution, especially due to surface runoff into adjacent watercourses, including infiltration into
groundwater. This will be carefully monitored through annual reporting tools described in Chapter 6.
Training will be provided to communities in proper handling and application of these materials as part of
local capacity building component.

5.3.3       Pest Management

Successful Integrated Pest Management/Integrated Crop Management (IPM/ICM) is based on sound farmer
knowledge of the on-going agro-ecological processes of the farming environment. Such farmers are,
therefore, technically empowered to make informed decisions on the most appropriate management
strategies to apply a specific period of crop development and production cycle. Furthermore, integrated
crop/pest management is a farmer-centred management approach that addresses issues beyond pest
management. It offers the entry point to improvement of the entire agricultural production system. It can be
successfully adopted in the presence of a national Integrated Pest Management (IPM) policy framework and
institutional support.

In all instances where high input-dependent crop/pest practices are adopted, pesticide misuse is known to be
common and results in the following impacts:

           Destruction of crop pollinators leading to poor crop yields;

           Elimination of the natural enemies of crop pests and consequent loss of natural pest control
               that keeps the populations of crop pests very low;

           Development of pest resistance to pesticides, encouraging further increases in the use of
               chemical pesticides;

           Contamination of the soil and water bodies;

           Toxicity to fish and birds;


Environmental and Social Management Framework     37       Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

          Proliferation of aquatic weeds;

          Pesticide poisoning of farmers and deleterious effects on human health

          Unacceptable levels of pesticide residues in harvested produce and in the food chain; and

          Loss of biodiversity in the environment, particularly of the aquatic non-target species.

Considerable attention must, therefore, be paid to the environmental consequences of current pest
management practices in Kenya. Project activities have some major environmental and other implications
for crop/pest management. Key mitigation measures are, therefore, required to address these concerns as
outlined in Tables 5.3 and 5.4 below.

Project Objective/Output                            Crop and Pest Management Implications
1.   Increase in agricultural/forest productivity   Increased use and reliance on inputs (fertilizers
    while conserving the natural resource base.     and pesticides).
2.   Increase in incomes from agricultural/forestry Change in current pest on/off farm production

5.   Promoting agricultural exports.                Reliance on chemical pesticides jeopardizes
                                                    product quality (MRLs and EURO-GAP
                                                    requirements).
6.   Seed and plant nurseries.                      Increased use of fertilizers and pesticides to
                                                    protect seedlings.
7.   Training in improved agricultural              Training curriculum may be strongly biased

                                        agricultural production systems and in harvested produce; and
                                    (c) Carry out monitoring of pesticide poisoning in the farming and
                                        rural communities.
6. Increase in disease vectors      (a) Establish strong collaboration between the project and national
                                        vector-borne disease control programs such as malaria control
                                        program; and
                                    (b) Conduct regular vector surveillance.

chemical control                        from reaching damaging levels.
                                    (b) Promote proper disposal of unused agricultural chemicals and
                                        packaging materials.

5.4      Analysis of Alternatives
Several alternatives for the project were considered before the current proposal was prepared. The first was
linking with IDA. The second was a stand-alone GEF project. The Government of Kenya has recognized
the rapid decline in the natural environment and stagnation in agricultural production of Western Kenya as a
priority. The Government, international donors, NGOs and community-based organizations, are
implementing a number of jointly funded initiatives. An IDA funded community based development project
is also anticipated in the next three years. Given the scale of land degradation, more interventions will be
required to reach ecosystem sustainability.

The proposed GEF alternative seeks to capture the additional off-farm benefits generated by integrated
ecosystem management activities. By integrating improved land use and environmental service functions,
the GEF alternative generates global benefits and contributes to more sustainable agricultural productivity,
and income.

Implementing the project in fewer river basins than all the lands covering Western Kenya was considered
because the project will have an important demonstration effect and it is expected to attract further
resources. In addition the learning opportunity provided by three river basins, which vary in agro-ecological
and socio-economic characteristics, is likely to outweigh the benefits from increased coverage on just one
river basin.

               PCO, SESS and Contract Service Providers (CSPs) will work with communities to provide guidance
                and advice on potential environmental and social subprojects, potential negative environmental
                impacts and appropriate mitigation measures;
               In turn PCO and CSPs will receive technical advice and support from SESS and TAG;
               SESS will provide an annual environmental and social progress report and advice to both PCO and
                TAG;
               An independent consultant will conduct a midterm environmental and social performance
                audit. The audit report will be shared with TAG, NEMA, KARI, WB and Other relevant
                government agencies.



6.3      Screening for Subprojects

This ESMF that includes a screening process to assess the potential impacts associated with subprojects.
The WKIEMP is expected to produce net benefits in terms of natural resource management and
conservation but certain project activities related to improved land management may have environmental or
social impacts that require mitigation. Hence the proposed project has been rated Category B under the
World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), requiring a partial Environmental Assessment
(EA). The main purpose of the ESMF is to cover the unknowns. Using the screening and review process for
subproject identification presented here will, therefore, help determine which of the safeguard policies are
triggered and what measures will need to be taken to address the potential impacts.

In addition to the World Bank's OP 4.01 Environmental assessment, the WKIEMP has triggered OP 7.50
Projects in International Waters. This screening and review process will determine how and when a
particular subproject will trigger a safeguard policy, and what mitigation measures will need to be put in
place. It will also ensure that subprojects that may have potentially significant impacts will be studied in
greater detail. The need for subproject specific EIAs will also be identified by this screening and review
process.

The seconded environmental and social specialists (SESS) based in Kisumu will provide assistance in the
screening of the subproject proposals using the screening procedures and checklists outlined in this chapter.
The subprojects will be given an environmental rating. This ESMF has included a suggested format for
EIA, in case the need arises where a subproject is of environmental category A in nature. The SESS will be
responsible for ensuring that the environmental and social impacts screening and review system set out in
this Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is integrated into the subprojects cycles.

In order to ensure proper implementation of environmental and social screening, and mitigation measures,
as well as effective natural resource management, the WKIEMP will undertake an intensive program of
environmental training and institutional capacity building. Environmental training and sensitisation will be
required at all levels including community workers, local government bodies, and SESS. The PCO, SESS,
CSPs and additional experts will provide a diverse range of technical training on environmental issues to
these groups.

Kenya lacks adequately qualified staff and mechanisms for the screening and mitigation of impacts
generated by activities such as small-scale infrastructure and agricultural development. A safeguard
specialist will give appropriate training to relevant institutions, organizations and individuals (NEMA,
KARI, ICRAF, PCO, SESS Stakeholders, Community Representatives, Farmer Groups, NGOs, etc.) during
the Project Launch Workshop. They in turn will train the groups and/or individuals responsible for
screening the subprojects for environmental and social safeguard concerns. The safeguards specialist will

also brief the identified individuals who will be part of the committee to screen subproject proposals for
potential environmental and social issues. The objective of the training will be to raise the level of
environmental and social awareness in the communities and promote adoption of the screening checklist.

The screening criteria outlined in this ESMF includes relevant questions which will help determine if any
other safeguard policies are triggered and the measures need to be taken to mitigate impacts. The National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) will review and comment on the EIA before the sub-project
can be appraised. This will ensure that subprojects that may have potentially significant impacts and require
more detailed study receive national level approval as well as district level approval. With the approval of
the ESMF by NEMA, not all subprojects will require EIAs to be undertaken. Where an EIA has to be
carried out, this will be done by a NEMA registered EIA expert.

Figure 6.2 depicts the process that the PCO, SESS and CSPs will apply in working with the communities to
avoid or mitigate negative environmental impacts for community subprojects.

Communities will identify subprojects with the assistance of the PCO, SESS and CSPs. The proposed
subprojects will subsequently be checked against the screening checklist (Format 6.1). PCO, SESS and
CSPs will encourage communities to carry out this task themselves possibly by the teachers, extension
agents, health workers or other literate members of the community. The checklist is a simple yes/no form
culminating in whether specific advice to the community on environmental mitigation is required. CSPs



Environmental and Social Management Framework      43      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

will give this advice, or in cases, will call upon the SESS for specific technical advice. The Screening forms
will be reviewed quarterly at DSC meetings.




          Box 6.3 Rationale for the Design of Screening Checklist

              There will be many subprojects supported by WKIEMP. Therefore, a system that is streamlined is
               required, and as far as possible, communities must be responsible for completion of screening;
              In most cases, communities will have very little knowledge of environmental and social screening,
               hence the need for CSPs and SESS assistance in using the screening forms;
              The screening prompts a list of yes/no answers in relation to questions on the location of the subproject
               and the anticipated impacts; if there are 'yes' answers to any of these questions, then the SESS, CSPs and
               communities are obliged to recommend a course of action;
              This action can be for the community itself to manage or avoid impacts; SESS, PCO and CSPs to
               provide specific advice; or if necessary, technical advice can be sought from elsewhere;
              Subproject specific EIAs, if recommended, can only be carried out by a NEMA registered EIA Expert;
              The forms will be reviewed by the PCO and SESS at the quarterly DSCs meetings before operations
               begin.

6.6      Description of Roles

The roles proposed under this ESMF are summarized as follows:

              TAG will provide lead coordination at the national level and ensure that the results meet the targets set
               by the project;

              PCO will handle day-to-day coordination of project activities;

          SESS will be responsible for ensuring that the environmental and social screening and review
               system set out in this chapter is integrated into the subprojects cycle and that it is
               implemented;

          Sensitisation of community groups, local government bodies,and CSPs to environmental and
               social issues will be a significant part of ensuring this integration, as will partnerships with
               governmental and non-governmental officers associated with the project;




Environmental and Social Management Framework      47       Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

          SESS will draw on the technical advice of government officers in other departments, or upon
               traditional technical knowledge particularly of natural resource management, land tenure
               practices, livestock management and the use of indigenous plant and animal resources;

          SESS will provide backstopping technical advice in environmental and social screening of
               subprojects;

              SESS will prepare annual environmental and social progress reports for submission to PCO, and TAG;

          PCO will provide guidance to CBOs, VDCs, local government bodiesCSPs, and SESS and
               provide the key link between the regional subprojects and TAG; and

          An independent consultant will undertake a midterm environmental and social performance
               audit. The audit report will be submitted to PCO and TAG and be shared with KARI, NEMA,
               the World Bank and other relevant government officials/agencies.


6.7      Monitoring and Evaluation

Two strategies are used to build a simple system for monitoring of environmental and social impacts:

              The PCO and SESS will consider the environmental and social criteria that require
               measurement (e.g. sediment levels). A list of initial proposals is given below; and

              Using this list of criteria, a set of indicators will be integrated into recording forms to be used
               in a participatory approach to environmental monitoring and evaluation.

6.7.1 Initial Proposals

The key issues to be considered in the WKIEMP include monitoring of water quality, biodiversity, carbon
sequestration, soil fertility, agricultural production, income generation and population dynamics. The goals
of monitoring will be to measure the success rate of the project, determine whether interventions have
resulted in dealing with negative impacts, and whether further interventions are needed or monitoring is to
be extended in some areas. Monitoring indicators will very much be dependent on specific project contexts.

Monitoring and surveillance of the WKIEMP subprojects will take place on a "sample" basis as it would be
impossible to monitor all the subprojects. It is not recommended to collect large amounts of data, but rather
to base monitoring on observations by project officers and stakeholders to determine trends of the
indicators.

Monitoring of Participation Process

The following are selected indicators for monitoring the participation process involved in the WKIEMP
activities:

              Number and percentage of affected households consulted during the planning stage;

              Levels of decision-making of affected people;

              Levels of understanding of subprojects impacts and mitigation;

              Effectiveness of local authorities to make decisions;

              Frequency and quality of meetings; and

              Degree of involvement of women or disadvantaged groups in discussions.


6.7.2 Monitoring indicators
Monitoring the Implementation of Mitigation Measures
Tables 6.2 and 6.3 list the recommended indicators for monitoring the implementation of mitigation
measures.

7.       CAPACITY BUILDING AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
In order to ensure proper implementation of environmental and social screening, and mitigation measures,
as well as effective natural resource management, the WKIEMP will undertake an intensive program of
environmental training and institutional capacity building.

7.1      Environmental Training and Sensitisation

Environmental training and sensitisation will be required at all levels including community workers, VDCs,
local government bodies, and PCO. The SESS, CSPs and additional experts will provide a diverse range of
technical training on environmental issues to these groups. Table 7.1 outlines the specific training
requirements of these levels. The objective of this training is to build the capacity of these groups for
implementation of the ESMF to be supported under the project. For each group, training will be provided to
bring them to a different level of expertise in various areas. Capacity building will include:

              In-depth training to a level that allows the trainees to go on and train others, including the
               technical procedures where necessary;
              Sensitisation in which the trainees become familiar with then issues to a sufficient extent that
               allows them to demand their precise requirements for further technical assistance; and
              Awareness raising in which the participants acknowledge the significance or relevance of the
               issues, but are not required to have technical or in-depth knowledge of the issues.

7.2      Recommendations for Capacity Building
Capacity to implement the recommendations outlined above is low. Where staff exists, training in the
application of the environmental and social screening is needed. In addition it will be necessary to have the
SESS and PCO build awareness and knowledge in environmental and social screening amongst the local
authorities.

The WKIEMP will address these deficiencies in accordance with the investment for capacity building
across regional, district and inter-village administrations. Where gaps exist in terms of staff availability or
qualified staff at each level of project implementation (national, district and community), measures will be
taken throughout the project cycle to hire skilled personnel and train staff.

8.        ESTIMATED COSTS
The breakdown of estimated costs for implementing the ESMF is provided in Table 8.1. This includes costs
for undertaking capacity building as outlined in Chapter 7.


8.1       Costs for Environmental and Social Inputs
The WKIEMP has a five-year budget of US$ 4.5 million (GEF financing US$ 900,000). The cost of
mainstreaming the ESMF in the WKIEMP is estimated at US $ 675,000. The budget lines contribute to
capacity building and impact assessments to ensure that the ESMF has significant influence within the
operations of the project, and is not sidelined.

8.2       Mainstreaming Costs
Some costs of environmental management and impact mitigation are directly integrated into the main
project budget. Specifically these are:

               Costs related to mitigation measures for subprojects, which will be assessed and internalised
                as part of the overall project's cost;

               Costs related to mitigation measures for inter-village subprojects, which will be assessed and
                internalised as part of the overall project's cost; and

               Cost of studies related to strategic issues of natural resource management, which are
                internalised.

Annex 4.            Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework

Statutes and institutions
There are about 77 statutes in Kenya that deal with environmental issues. Some of the legislative
instruments have been in place for many years and are duplicated in other legislation. The most pertinent
legislative instruments are the Water Act, 2002; the Public Health Act, Cap. 242; the Chief's Authority Act,
Cap 128; the Local Authorities Act, Cap. 265; the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, Cap.376;
the Forests Act, Cap. 385; the Physical Planning Act, Cap.306, the Registered Land Act, Cap.300; the
Agricultural Act, Cap. 318; the Trust Land Act, Cap. 288; and, the Environmental Management and
Coordination Act, 1999; and the Lake Basin Development Authority Act, Cap. 442.

The Water Act, 2002 prohibits obstruction or pollution of watercourse or water resource and gives
conditions in the water use permits. The Act prohibits among other things the unlawful interference with
watercourses or bodies of water and prohibits the release of polluted water without treatment; and specifies
penalties for polluting water used for human consumption. According to the Water Act, 2002, water
belongs to the nation and water use requires permission from the Government of Kenya. The Act addresses
conservation, control and apportionment and use of water resources in Kenya. The water resources
management is decentralized into three levels, namely national, basin, and catchment area levels. The roles
of these levels include the identification of vital water catchment areas, including wetlands, and the
initiation of action for protection purposes.

The Agriculture Act, Cap. 318 defines the watercourses and catchment areas in relation to crop production
and related activities. The Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999, provides for the
establishment of an appropriate legal and institutional framework for the management of the environment in
Kenya. Part VI (S.58) of the bill makes it mandatory for environmental impact assessments (EIAs) to be
conducted before the commencement of projects involving urban development, water bodies,
transportation, mining, agriculture and forestry related activities. The specific water related activities
requiring EIAs include construction of dams, irrigated agriculture, flood control schemes and water transfer
schemes.

The Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) Act, Cap. 442 stipulates, inter alia, that the Authority
shall coordinate the abstraction and use of natural resources and set up an effective monitoring system;
effect the protection and utilization of water and soils; ensure water and soil conservation measures are
undertaken; identify and collect all data related to water uses and other resources for efficient forward
planning; examine the hydrogeological and ecological effects of development; consider all aspects of
development of the area and their effects on lake inflows and outflows; and monitor the operations and
provide technical reports on any agreements or other arrangements between Kenya and other states on the
use of the waters of the Nile and Lake Victoria.

There are over twenty institutions, which deal with environmental issues in Kenya. Some of the key
institutions include the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA); the Department of
Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing (DRSRS), the Water Department; the Forest Department (FD); the
Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS); the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI); the National Museums of
Kenya (NMK); and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI). The Ministry of Environment,
Natural Resources and Wildlife, through NEMA, is responsible for environmental management.

National environmental action plan

The purpose of the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) is to promote and facilitate the coordination
of strategies and measures to protect and manage the environment into plans and programmes for the social
and economic development of Kenya. The Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999,
establishes the NEAP to address the protection and management of the environment at district, provincial
and national levels. The NEAP will be reviewed every five years and will be subject to the consideration
and approval of the National Assembly. The NEAP will, among other things, identify and recommend
policy and legislative approaches for preventing, controlling or mitigating specific as well as general
adverse impacts on the environment. The District Environment Committees and the Provincial Environment
Committees are required to prepare action plans every five years. All development activities are supposed
to be conducted in accordance with the Provincial and District Environmental Action Plans.

Sessional Paper No. 1 of 2000 on National Population Policy for Sustainable Development is an update of
Sessional Paper No. 4 of 1984 on Population Policy Guidelines. The paper addresses issues on
environment, gender, poverty and problems faced by segments of the population including the youth, the
elderly and persons with disabilities. Outline in the paper are population and development goals and
objectives including improvement on standards of living and quality of life of the people; full integration of
population concerns into the development process; motivating and encouraging Kenyans to adhere to
responsible parenthood; and empowerment of women. The problem of HIV/AIDS is also addressed.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) outlines the priorities and measures necessary for poverty
reduction and economic growth. The twin objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction are borne
out of the realization that economic growth is not a sufficient condition to ensure poverty reduction. In this
regard, measures geared towards improved economic performance and priority actions that must be
implemented to reduce the incidence of poverty among Kenyans have been identified.

Annex 5.            Baseline Data
1.         Biophysical
The scale of population increase in Western Kenya in the past half century has had significant effect on land
and eater quality. High rural population growth coupled with stagnating urban job growth has accelerated
the search for new agricultural land, resulting in a high rate of conversion of woodlands, forests, and
wetlands into agricultural production. Furthermore, at the local level, there has been little restriction on
encroachment practices on to steep slopes, wetlands and forests, despite the existence of laws and
regulations against such practices. As such, evidence from studies indicate that the scale and rate of land
and water degradation, and biodiversity loss in Western Kenya is extremely high.

Land Degradation

Studies conducted in the context of the Lake Victoria Integrated Land Management Project uniformly
indicate occurrence of severely accelerated land degradation in the Nyando, Yala and Nzoia river basins.
Large quantities of sediment, discernible from satellite images, are deposited at the outlets of the river
basins in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria.

Measurements performed on sediment cores collected in the Nyando estuary show that sedimentation rates
of the basin have increased to fourfold over the last 100 years (Walsh, pers.comm.). In addition, data show
the lower portion (<1400 masl) of the basin, and a large area located between the northern boundary of the
Mau and the southern boundary of Tinderet forests, may now be particularly vulnerable to erosion
following significant rainfall (e.g. El Nino).

Using Cesium-137 measurements, a preliminary sediment budget (Table 5a.1) indicates that sediment
source areas currently occupy >60% of the Nyando River basin, and that the rates of soil loss have not been
offset by rates of sediment accretion in sink areas of the basin. This has led to an export of high sediment
loads (e.g. 3.2 x 10 Mg yr-1 of sediment to Nyando River), and has severely compromised water quality in
                      6

the four main rivers (Nyando, Yala and Nzoia) in the project area.

Water Quality Degradation

Land degradation of the above-described magnitude has significant negative impacts on soil fertility and
water quality in the surrounding area. For example, eutrophication of Lake Victoria has led to rapid
colonization of the lake by the water hyacinth and decreased fish and aquatic plant diversity. The economic
impact of this has been great, for example, operations to keep hydroelectric generating turbines clean is
costing Uganda US$ 600,000 per year. The fishing industry, which employs 500,000 people in the riparian
countries, has also been affected. In addition, erosion and sedimentation have induced flooding (which now
occurs annually in the Nyando basin) resulting in increased waterborne and water related diseases.

Biodiversity Loss

Existing rural activities and poor land management practices have also affected biodiversity in two ways: 1)
by fuelling the demand for more agricultural land and therefore altering natural habitats; and 2) by altering
the chemical properties and therefore reducing soil and plant diversity. Western Kenya is an area with
unique habitats and biodiversity of local, national and global significance.



Environmental and Social Management Framework     62      Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

In the areas most affected by erosion and sedimentation, soils are universally depleted of major soil
nutrients (N, P, K) and exchangeable cations, rendering them unsuitable for conventional agricultural land
uses. Similarly, erosion affects soil physical properties such as texture and bulk density, which significantly
decrease topsoil infiltration capacities and suitability for plant production. Increasing heterogeneity in the
landscape will be necessary to create more niches for different types species and increase above ground and
below ground biodiversity.

2.         Socio-economic conditions
The primary livelihood strategy for about 80 percent of the population in the three river basins is farming.
Livestock ownership forms an important part of the household asset base for both farmers and agro-
pastoralists.

Busia District
Agriculture is the single most important sector in the district. The sector employs approximately 78 per cent
of the district's labour force and generates annual income of approximately KShs. 1.42 billion. The fisheries
and forestry sub-sectors are other important production sectors in the district. Cooking energy needs are
mainly in the form of firewood and charcoal.

Vihiga District

Agriculture and livestock are the two major resources currently being exploited in the district. Due to high
population growth and subsequent land subdivision, the average farm holdings are small. Households
produce maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes, beans, cassava, assorted vegetables, tea, coffee, sugarcane, French
beans, pawpaws, bananas and avocadoes. The district generally has good soils and rainfall for the
production of tea and coffee as cash crops. A significant number of households are engaged in the
production of high value horticultural crops.

Nandi District

Agriculture and rural development sector is the backbone of the district economy. Over 90 per cent of the
population is engaged in this sector. The main food crops cultivated are maize, beans, Irish potatoes,

Kericho District
Kericho District has agricultural potential. It has a climate conducive for food and cash crops production as
well as rearing livestock. Agriculture plays an important role in the socio-economic welfare of the
population. Major commodities marketed include tea, coffee, wheat, maize, horticultural produce and milk.
The performance of the sector is relatively good owing to the high potential nature of the area in terms of
soils and climatic factors.

In the livestock sub-sector, milk production is the biggest enterprise followed by beef production. Other
enterprises include poultry production and rearing of sheep and goats.

Annex 6.            Brief Matrix on Integrated Pest Management

Implementation of Integrated Pest Management

Introduction
Integrated pest management is a decision-making process for the selection, implementation, and evaluation
of pest management practices. It utilizes all available methods to achieve the most economically and
environmentally sound management program. IPM is the integration of available techniques to reduce pest
populations and maintain them below the levels causing economic injury in a way that avoids harmful side
effects.

Specific pest management needs vary with the crop, cropping system, pest problems, pesticide use history,
socio-economic conditions, and other factors. There are, however, well-defined principles that guide the
implementation of integrated pest management (IPM). Based on these principles, some guidelines can be
offered for the development of and execution of IPM activities for community subprojects. The
implementers of the subprojects should adopt these guidelines to the conditions found in their subprojects.

IPM can decrease pest losses, lower pesticide use, and reduce overall operation costs, while increasing crop
yield and stability. Successful IPM programs have been developed for pests on various crops.

Steps to Implement IPM

Step 1. Assess IPM needs and establish priorities

              Consider the relative importance of agriculture in the overall project;
              Consider the relative importance of target crops as a source of community livelihood;
              Review pesticide use history, trends and availability of IPM technology;
              Identify training needs for farmers and extension agents; and
              Respect and use local knowledge.

Step 2. Identify key pests for each target crop

              Become familiar with key pests of target crops and the damage they cause; and
              Correctly identify the common pest.

Step 3. Monitor the fields regularly

              Inspect crops regularly to determine the level of pests and natural enemies;
              Solicit assistance of agricultural extension staff if necessary; and
              Determine when crop protection measures, perhaps including pesticides are necessary.

Step 4. Select appropriate blend of IPM tools

              Maximize the effectiveness of traditional and introduced non-chemical control techniques;
              Use pesticides only if no practical, effective and economic non-chemical control methods are
               available;
              Examples of Non-chemical Pest Management Techniques include;
                         -    Maintaining good soil fertility and a diverse agroecosystem;
                         -    Plant resistant crop varieties;
                         -    Selecting proper plant varieties for location and season;
                         -    Rotating crops;
                         -    Planting clean seed;
                         -    Correct planting and harvest periods;
                         -    Proper irrigation methods;
                         -    Correct fertilizer and rates;
                         -    Good crop sanitation;
                         -    Hand picking of larger pests;
                         -    Use of natural control agents (biological control); and
                         -    Using attractants and repellents on selected pests.



Environmental and Social Management Framework       66       Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project

Step 5. Develop education, training, and demonstration programs for extension workers

          Conduct hands-on training of farmers in farmers' fields (as opposed to a classroom);
          Use the participatory "Farmers' Field School" approach; and
          Conduct special training for extension workers, government officials and the public.
