HMEIRANDU AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
O0 THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RWCONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSZD LOAN TO BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS PUBLICOS
S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UITED MEXICAN STATES
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos, S.N.C. (BANOBRAS) for
US$300.0 million equivalent, with the guarantee of the United Mexican
States, is submitted for approval.  The proposed loan would be on
standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturity, including 5 years of grace,
and would help to finance a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.
1.        Background.  In general, health conditions are improving in
Mexico, as measured by increases in life expectancy (from 62 years in
1970 to 69 in 1989). However, diarrhea is still a major cause of death
among children, because of poor environmental conditions (these include
inadequate operation of water and seweragelsanitation systems and poor
sanitation habits). Water supply and sewerage coverage increased
notably among the urban population during 1970-1980 to reach 82? and
49?, respectively. In rural areas coverage is lower, standing at 45S
for water and 282 for sewerage. Due to Mexico's economic difficulties
and the implementation of stabilization measures that curbed public
sector expenditures, since the early 1980s there has been little, if
any, progress in improving service coverage. People not served
generally belong to the poorer segment of the population. Much remains
to be done to expand service coverage and to improve both water quality
and service reliability, since many systems are in need of repairs or
obsolete. The main cause of the poor operation of the systems has been
the lack of appropriate sector policies which was mirrored in weak
sector institutions at all levels (municipal, state, and federal).
Especially, the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE),
the sector technical lead agency until January 1990, had not been able
to provide consistent and efficient guidance to sector development.
2.        In February, 1990 the National Water Commission (CNA) was
formed as an autarchic agency under the Secretariat of Agriculture
(SARH).  Seasoned staff, who had previously worked in SARH, were
transferred to CNA. CNA is now the primary technical support agency
both in water supply and irrigation.  The formation of CNA is a major
advance in unifying and coordinating federal assistance to the sector.
However, within the state and municipal agencies, serious organizational
issues remain to be addressed. The Government, through CNA and with
Bank assistance, designed a Sector Reorganization Program to correct the
shortcomings which have hampered sector development. This Program is
aiming to: (a) rationalize sector investments by adopting and
implementing a medium-term (1990-1994) sector investment plan; (b)
provide guidelines to reduce reliarnce on central government
contributions for sector investments by increasing the resource
mobilization required of Water and Sanitation Operating Agencies (OAs)
through greater internal cash generation, and encouraging private sector
participation; (c) establish a new sector lending policy which links the



provision of credit to a commitment by the OAs to strengthen their
management, administration, operations and finance; (d) reduce the per-
capita costs of investments through the formulation and implementation
of more cost-efficient design standards; (e) upgrade the skills of
sector personnel through the creation of a sector training center and
execution of appropriate training programs; and (f) halt the
environmental degradation brought about by the discharge of untreated
sewerage.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  With the assistance of the
Bank, the Government has embarked on a reform program of sector policies
and institutions to accelerate sector development. Continued Bank
support, both through the provision of financial resources and advice,
would help to guide and carry out efficiently the reform process. In
addition, the objectives of the project fully coincide with the Bank's
country and sector strategies, which aim to provide water and sanitation
services to low-income population, rationalize public expenditures and
investments, stimulate domestic resource mobilization and cost-
recovery, promote more efficient public sector management, promote
private sector participation, and improve environmental conditions in
Mexico. The Bank's institution building goals are shared and supported
by the Interamerican Development Bank that is also processing a sector
loan which will carry similar conditionality.
4.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed
project are to sutiport the implementation of the Sector Reorganization
Program, which is designed to improve the quality and quantity of water
supply and sanitation services, promote sound pricing policies,
progressively reduce the need for Government funding, and improve
environmental conditions in Mexico. Specific objectives are to assist
Mexico to: (a) reduce the amount of subsidies to the sector; (b)
strengthen the institutional framework at national level; (c) promote at
state, regional and/or municipal levels the development of companies of
sufficient scale to operate economically and maintain their water and
sanitation systems efficiently and with financial autonomy; (d) provide,
by the end of 1994, water supply and sanitation services in Mexico to
about 24 million additional people, most of whom belong to the poorer
segment of the population: and te) improve the environment by
implementing a pilot water-pollution control program and requiring a
comprehensive environmental assessment of each subproject financed.
Works financed under the proposed project would directly benefit about
3.2 million people.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project would include two
major components: (a) National component (9? of total project cost).
This component would seek to asslst in: (i) the strengthening of sector
institutions (CNA. BANOBRAS and the Mexican Institute of Water
Technology, IMTA); (ii) supporting the implementation of the new sector
policies; (iiI) financing technical assistance to undertake a study to
encourage private sector participation in the provision of water supply
and sanitation services; and (iv) financing the preparation of studies
for a follow-up pollution-control project; (b) State and Local component
(912 of total project cost). This component would help finance sector



investments through BANOBRAS and involve rehabilitation and expansion of
water and satitation systems, engineering, and institutional
strengthening of the operating companies. Investments would focus on
the poorer areas of the subproject cities, and would have to meet
technical, institutional, environmental and economic criteria, and will
need to be approved by CNA.
6.        Of the total estimated project cost of US$650.9 million
equivalent, the foreign exchange component would amount to US$300
million (462). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amount.s and methods of procurement and of disbursement and
the disbursement schedules are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive
financing of US$30 million would be granted for expenditures incurred
after May 1, 1990. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8973-ME dated November 8,
1990, is also attached.
7.         Implementation Arrangements.  The borrower and implementing
agency would be BANOBRAS, which would be responsible for the overall
project coordination. CNA would be the technical agency, and OAs would
be responsible for the implementation of construction and technical
assistance. To ensure the efficient execution of the project, while
taking into account the major sector reforms needed, the following
programs have been agreed upon with the Mexican authorities: (a)
Monitoring of OAs; (b) Monitoring the executions of the National
Training Program: (c) Plan of Action to improve performance of OAs; (d)
Subproject Preparation and Pipeline; and (e) Annual review of the Sector
Plan of Action.
8.         Actions Agreed.  During negotiations assurances were obtained
on the followings (a) implementation of the rules to allocate the mix
of grant and loan funds to the OAs as well as establishing consistent
criteria for all federal assistance; (b) terms of reference for
technical assistance to CNA, description of its staff requirements and a
plan to fill relevant positions; (c) the Government, through SHCP, SPP,
CNA, IMTA and BANOBRAS shall participate in the Annual Review of the
Sector Plan of Actions and implement its recommendations; (d) the
Government to cause the consolidated net sector contribution to total
investment to be at a level that would be satisfac tory to the Bank, as
determined during the Annual Sector reviews, and which should be in the
following ranges no lower than 1S for 1991, 202 for 1992 and 1993 and
25% for 1994 and thereafter; (e) the Government to confirm the proposed
investment and financing plans and to update them and to present to the
Bank for review and comments the proposed annual sector investment plans
by November of the preceding year; (f) the Government to allocate funds
for CNA and IMTA to implement the national component of the proposed
project and to budget and disburse, in a timely fashion, its
contributions required for project execution; (g) the Government to
cause CNA to complete a Private Sector Participation Study by September
30, 1991 and exchange views with the Bank regarding the study's
recommendations by January 31, 1992; (h) the Government to cause CNA to
engage consultants under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank for
its technical assistance program by March 31, 1991; (i) CNA. IMTA and
BANOBRAS to carry out their institutional development programs in a



manner satisfactory to the Bank; (j) CNA to establish a sector-
monitoring system and publish its results annually; (k) the Government
to carry out jointly with the Bank an annual review of project
execution; and (1) BANOBRAS tot (i) only finance subprojects that
cuit'ply with the agreed upon sector policies, including a satisfactory
fe.ibility study and environmental assessment; (ii) maintain present
and, if necessary, add additional staff having the necessary skills and
experience to carry out its obligations under the project execution;
(iii) not change subloan conditionalities without previous approval from
the Bank; (iv) sulmit all subloans to private companies to Bank for
prior approval: (v) submit all subloans proposals before December 31,
1993; (vi) cause the OAs to execute their subprojects in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, support the National Training Program,
maintain a tariff level that will allow them to cover at least their
operating and maintenance costs plus debt service and to generate net
internal funds to contribute to fund their investment programs in
accordance with the results of the Annual Review of the Sector Plan of
Action to be conducted jointly with the Bank, carry out an institutional
development program in a timely manner, implement a commercial
accounting and internal auditing system, annually revalue their assets
and report to CNA their monitoring indicators; vii) suspend
disbursements to sub-borrowers not complying with provisions of a
subloan agreement.  A condition of Effectiveness would be that the
Government furnish to the Bank an executed contract, satisfactory to the
Bank, describing the GuarantorIBANOBRAS transfer and relending
procedures.
9.        Project Benefits.  The proposed project would directly benefit
some 3.2 million (of the 24 million benefiting from the investment plan)
people who will receive water and/or sewerage connections. The majority
of these beneficiaries would belong to the poorer segment of the
country's population and, in the case of rural communities, improvements
would have an important impact on the welfare of women as local customs
often call for women to walk long distances to bring water hume in
buckets. In addition, the rehabilitation and operational improvements
to existing facilities would provide better and safer services to an
unknown but appreciable number of people. The project investments would
also contribute significantly to improve both public health and the
standard of living among the population receiving services under the
project. The implementation of the Sector Reorganization Program
supported under the proposed loan would bring significant benefits to
the country's economy through savings brought about by: rationalization
of sector investments; execution of more cost-efficienit projects with
lower per-capita investment costs; improvements in the operational and
administrative efficiency of operating agencies; application of more
adequate cost-recovery policies; and increased human-resources
development.
10.       Project Risks and Safeguards.  The reforms of sectoral
institutions and policies being undertaken by the Government is an
ambitious and complex task, and its successful implementation will
require a sustained effort by the Government in the years ahead.



Although major steps are already being implemented (i.e. the creation of
CNA, the approval of sound sector policies, agreement on training among
CNA, IMTA and ANOAPA), the follTwing risks remaint (a) inadequate
levels of counterpart funds caused by Government delays in distributing
its contributions or inability of CNA/BANOBRAS/OAs to raise sufficient
funds from domestic resources; (b) lack of coordination between federal
programs (i.e. the proposed project and SOLIDARIDAD), thus creating the
possibility of softer funding for sector investments that would delay
the achievement of efficiency improvement goals; (c) delays in
subproject preparatiPn, evaluation, and execution because of
insufficient operating capability of the OAs; and (d) BANOBRAS being
forced to relax on subproject conditionalities, particularly in the
tariff area, because of political pressure from central or local
governments. Although the conditionality contains remedies and plans of
action to address these risks (annual review of investment and of
overall program performance, agreement on financing and lending
policies, technical assistance to strengthen CNA, IMTA and BANOBRAS),
the Government's firm determination to provide sector services in a more
efficient manner is the most important safeguard in this area.
Nevertheless. intensive Bank supervision of the project and decisive
actions by the Bank In case of unsatisfactory performance are essential.
The Annual Review of the Sector Plan of Action would play a key role in
detecting shortcomings and making adjustments leading to performance
improvements. To strengthen the importance attached to it, a condition
of default under the proposed project would be the failure to implement
the Agreed Annual Sector Plan of Action or any part thereof.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
