     The objectives of the Project are: (a) to improve
the quantity and quality of water supply and sanitation
services throughout the territory of the Guarantor
(except for the metropolitan areas of Mexico City,

tutional strengthening of CNA, IMTA, Operating Agencies
and the Borrower with regard to their activities in the
water supply and sanitation sector; (c) to ameliorate the

policies and the reduction of subsidization for the water

     The Project consists of the following Parts, subject
to such modifications thereof as the Bank and the
Borrower may agree upon from time to time to achieve such
objectives:
Part A:

Part B:
1.   Provision of technical assistance and training for
CNA with regard to: (a) improving and assisting in Sub-
project evaluation and preparation; (b) reviewing and
updating technical norms and parameters for the design,

sanitation systems; (c) designing and implementing a
monitoring system for the water supply and sanitation
sector; (d) assisting in the strengthening of
institutional and environmental assessment capabilities
of Operating Agencies; (e) carrying out a pilot water
pollution control effort in the Lerma-Chapala Basin; and

procurement, and of monitoring and evaluation with regard
to the water supply and sanitation sector.
4.   Construction of facilities (including water sampling
and analysis laboratories) and provision of materials and
equipment for the operation of the National Water Quality
and Information Program.
5.   Undertaking of studies to: (a) provide or update
