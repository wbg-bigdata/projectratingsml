APPRAISAL OF THE CHINA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
Summary
i.        The China Development Corporation (CDC) was established in 1959 to
assist in the modernization and expanison of the private industrial sector
in Taiwan, in conformity with the national economic policy and development
programs of the Republic of China. With this object, it is required to finance
projects that are financially and economically sound as well as technically
well con eived; special attention being given to the quality of management.
In 1962, CDC received the benefit of an IDA credit of US$ 5 million to the
Government, and in 1964 and 1967, CDC was granted two Bank loans each of
US$ 15 million.
ii.       The economy of Taiwan has shown strong growth.  CNP, in real terms,
increased at an average rate of 10% during 1961-1968. The rate of growth of
industrial production during the 1960's has been 16% per annum rising to over
20% in 1968 and 1969. In industry, the textile sector is the most important
having grown 50% between 1966 and 1968. Although textiles and food processing
are still the predominant industries, gradual diversification is evident from
the increasing importance of new industries such as electronics and chemical
products.
iii.      CDC has played a significant role in industrial finance;  its
contribution to the private sector for capital expenditure has been approximately
46% of total outstanding loans by financial institutions during the last few
years.  In 1969, CDC approvals totalled NT$ 495 million and in 1970 and 1971
are expected to amount to NT$ 513 million and VTI  557 million respectively.
These targets are within CDC's capability. Its portfolio amounted to NT$
1,331 million at August 31, 1969 of which nearly 40% was in natural textile
industry; however, CDC is now being more selective in its consideration of
new natural textile projects.
iv.       CDC's management is experienced and competent and has a close
relationship with tlle Governrent and its own clients. However, its lending
policies are sornemhat conse:vative and it should adopt a more dynamic policy.
CDC's appraisal procedures are sound and its profitability is good; profits
before tax arounted to 24% of' average equity in 1969.  Because of the inclusion
of stock dividends in income, following a directive by the Ministry of Finance,
there is some distortion in the profit picture. CDC expects to discuss with
the autaortties the possibility of obtaining exemption from the operation of
this regulation but, while the present situation prevails, CDC will create a
special provision to offset the effect of this regulation upon its accounts.
CDC's present debt-equity ratio of 4.8:1 is adequate. However, in order to
conform to the Bank's current method for calculating this ratio, it will be
increased to 6 times equity. This will not increase the existing borrowing
limit in absolute terms. CDC's financial position is sound and its projections
show that it is expected to remain so.



ii
v.        CDC's local currency funds are being depleted, since its cash and
temporary investments are being used to supplement borrowers' repayments to
finance operations. CDC is alive to this situation and will continue to
investigate means to raise local currency funds. It has undertaken to inform
the Bank by December 31, 1970, how and when it plans to obtain additional
resources.
vi.       CDC's only source of foreign currency is the Bank and as it has
exhausted the last Bank loan, CDC wishes to replenish its foreign currency
resources by a further loan from the Bank. A loan of up to US$ 18 million
which should meet CDC's foreign currency requirements to December 31, 1971
is recommended.  The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to
lending to development finance companies, including a flexible amortization
schedule and the normal commitment charges. The free limit should be increased
from $500,000 to $750,000 with a limit of one-third of the loan on the
aggregate amount to be used for projects below the free limit.



APPRAISAL OF THE CHINA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The China Development Corporation (CDC) was established in 1959.
In 1962 it received, via the Government, an IDA credit of $5 million and in
1964 and 1967 it was granted two Bank loans, each of $15 million; these have
been used to finance industrial projects in the private sector in Taiwan.
The IDA credit and the first Bank loan have been fully disbursed and the
second Bank loan had been fully committed on February 28, 1970. CDC has now
applied to the Bank for a third loan.
II.  CDC's ENVIRONMENT
Industrial Growth
2.01      The Economic Report on the Republic of China (No. AS-142a of
September 11, 1968) describes Taiwan as an example of successful economic
development. A predominantly agricultural underdeveloped economy has been
transformed into a diversified fast-growing economy. The GNP, in real terms,
has increased at an average annual rate of 10% during 1961-1968 representing
a per capita GNP growth rate of almost 7%. The industrial sector's contribu-
tion to net domestic product has increased from 25% in 1961 to 29% in 1968.
Whilst the rate of growth of industrial production during the 1960's has been
16%, rising to over 20% in 1968 and 1969, industries manufacturing intermediate
products and durable goods have shown even higher rates of growth. Although
food and textiles are still the predominant industries, the process of gradual
diversification is evident from the increasing importance of new industries
such as electronics and chemical products.
2.02      The expansion and improvement of the textile industry in Taiwan has
been particularly noteworthy. Its growth has been marked in the man-made
fibres and knitting sectors. The production of these two sectors increased
more than two and a half times during the two years 1967 and 1968. In the same
period, the production of the entire textile industry increased over 50%.
The greatest advance has been made in the export of such labor-intensive items
as knitwear, garments and crocheted articles.
2.03      There is a preponderance of small size firms in the manufacturing
sector. According to the Industry Census of 1966, more than 72% of the total
number of firms are of very small size, having less than 10 employees each.
Although the number of corporate enterprises accounted for only 15% of private
manufacturing industry in 1966, their contribution to total employment and
total assets was 68% and 90% respectively in that year.



-2-
Government Policies
2.04      In 1957 government enterprises accounted for more than half of the
total manufacturing output in Taiwan. Since then, the private sector has
grown at a much faster rate due to deliberate government policy. In 1968, the
share of the Government sector in total manufacturing output was only 23%.
The Government still has under its direct management the sugar, tobacco, wine,
petroleum and fertilizer industries.
2.05      The emphasis of government policy is on export promotion; raw
materials for processing into industrial goods are exempt from duty. The
proportion of industrial products in total exports increased from barely
4.8% in 1952 to 66.4% in 1968. Exports of industrial products increased by
27% in 1968 alone. The most significant exports were textiles metal products
and transportation equipment. In the case of many of these products the main
reason for their competitive position in world markets, is the labor intensive
nature of the production process and the advantage of Taiwan in terms of
relatively cheap but industrious labor. Monthly earnings in 1967 of factory
workers in Taiwan were around $43 compared to al27 in Japan. However, there
is now increased competition in the export market from other developing countries
with even lower wage rates (e.g. Korea in textiles).
2.06      The present tariff duties range from 10% for certain categories of
capital goods to over 100% for certain luxury consumer goods. In addition,
there are quantitive restrictions on certain categories. These restrictions
are determined on an ad-hoc basis and are subject to adjustment during the
year so as to assure that domestic prices do not exceed landed cost by more
than 10.  This differential has been progressively reduced from 25% in 1949
to 15% in 1964 and 10% in December 1967.
2.07      Business income tax rates are also favorable to the growth of
industries. The exemption limit is NT$ 20,000 and taxation is progressive
with a maximum rate of 25% which is somewhat low compared to rates in other
less developed countries. In addition, there are a number of incentives in
the form of tax holidays and exemptions. Under Article 3 of the Statute of
Encouragement of Investment, the business income tax on certain industries
which the Government is particularly interested in encouraging, is restricted
to 18% of their total annual income. This favorable investment climate has
attracted an increasing amount of foreign capital every year. Total foreign
investment that was approved, increased from US$ 63.3 million in 1967 to
US$ 103.8 million in 1968. A Commission on Taxation Reform was established
on March 30, 1968 to review all the existing regulations and laws concerning
taxation in Taiwan and to recommend, inter alia, more effective measures to
increase tax revenues for economic development.
Financial Institutions and Capital Markets
2.08      Taiwan has relied heavily in the past on foreign financial assistance
for its economic growth. Up to the mid-1960's the deficits in its balance
of payments were made up by transfer payments from abroad, predominantly
U.S. government grants. After the cessation of U.S. economic aid in 1965, the
picture changed considerably. In addition to the continuous rise in exports,
a substantial increase in the net inflow of long term loan capital has taken
place. The net inflow of capital in 1968 amounted to US$ 91 million. The



shift which has occured is both from grants to loans and from government to
private enterprises. Suppliers' credits have also increased from US$ 59
million in 1966 to US$ 108 million in i968 1/, of which US$ 41.5 million and
US$ 90.5 million respectively went to the private sector. The attraction of
this type of credit to borrowers is mainly because of its low nominal rates of
interest, which are between 6 and 7.5 percent p.a., and its ready availability.
2.09      Detailed information on the sources of funds for private business
enterprises is not available. However, a recent survey conducted by the
Economic Research Department of the Central Bank of China analyzed the financial
statements of a sample of 8,000 private enterprises (see Annex 1). Although
the final results are still awaited it appears that the proportion of net
worth to total assets has slightly decreased over the period, thereby indicating
an increasing reliance on borrowed funds. An examination of the source of
borrowed funds shows that the contribution of financial institutions and foreign
funds has slightly increased at theexpense of the contribution of private
individuals. As at December 31, 1967, the preliminary indications suggest that
the largest contribution to borrowings came from financial institutions,
(35.6 percent of the total liabilities) followed by private individuals, which
amounted to 25.7% of the total liabilities. That borrowing from private
individuals still contributes a significant proportion of the total financing
of private business enterprises, reflects the fact that many of them are
family-owned and family-controlled firms, which prefer to borrow privately.
These borrowings are mainly from families and friends as well as from employees,
who are offered rates of interest at around 15 to 18 percent per annum, which
are higher than the rates of interest on savings deposits in local banks.
2.10      In Taiwan there is on the one hand a rising level of private savings,
accompanied by a willingness on the part of savers to hold an increasing
proportion of their savings in financial assets (e.g. demand and time deposits),
and on the other hand a general shortage of longer-term funds for industry.
This seems to have led enterprises to take recourse to borrowing from private
individuals at rates of interest higher than those prevailing in the organized
financial market. Since the commercial banks typically restrict themselves
to meeting short-term working capital requirements, a gap has developed in the
supply of longer-term capital.
2.11      In spite of the rapid industrialization and high rate of economic
growth in real terms, the financial structure of Taiwan has remained undeveloped,
Banking institutions are the only important financial interuediaries and are
mainly owned and controlled by the government. Their lending policies are not
flexible, since loans are negotiated solely on the basis of the collateral that
is available. Insurance companies, investment trusts, pension funds and mutual
funds have an insignificant role, whilst the Taiwan Stock Exchange has not yet
recovered from its crisis in 1964 (see para 2.15) and is still in a depressed
condition.
2.12      There are only three important institutions making long-term loans
to industries -- CDC, the Bank of Communications and the Bank of Taiwan. These
are predominantly dependent upon foreign and government funds for financing
their long-term loans to industry. The Bank of Communications specializes in
extending medium and long-term loans, primarily to public utilities. As at
the end of Iecember 1968, it had granted loans amounting to over NT$ 9,249
million, of which about three-fourths were for more than five years. Most of
these long-term loans are made with counterpart funds for the use of which it

acts as agent. It also handles the re-lending of US Export-Import Bank loans.
Since 1968, the Bank of Taiwan has been making long-term loans and has shifted
its emphasis from the public to the private sector. CDC is the cnly long-term
lending institution that lends exclusively to the private sector.
2.13      The quantitative role of CDC in the lending by financial institutions
to industry for capital expenditure is shown in the following table:

It indicates that CDC provided on an average about 38% of the total financing
of fixed assets for industry. However, the banking institutions lend to
public as well as private enterprises. No separate data for loans to private
enterprises for capital expenditures are available. On the rough assumption
that loans to these two sectors are in the same proportion as total production
in these sectors, CDC's contribution to the private sector could be estimated
at an average of about 46%.
2.14      The loan and deposit rates of all the banking institutions are
determined by the Banker's Association and are subject to the consent of the
Central Bank. While these rates are meant to be maximum rates, they are also
the prevailing rates. Since 1952 the monetary authorities in Taiwan have
followed a pragmatic and realistic interest rate policy.  They have successfully
utilized interest rates as an instrument to curb inflation. The current rate
of interest places a premium on savings. The prevailing rates of interest,
which were approved on May 10, 1969, are shown in Annex 2. The recent changes
made in the structure of interest rates, indicate a trend of increasing the
rates on longer-term deposits while keeping the lending rates constant,
thereby reducing the spread between the two rates.
2.15      The fifth 4-Year Economic Development Plan stresses the need for the
establishment of a sound capital market and rationalization of the present
system of financial institutions, which includes revision of the Banking and
Negotiable Investments Law, and improvement in the efficiency of financial
institutions.  The Finance Ministry has approached the Bank Group for advice
on how to obtain assistance in regard to the development of the capital market
and this is under consideration.

2.16      Taiwan Stock Exchange   The Taiwan Stock Exchange was established
in February 1752 as a corporation with a capital of NT$ 10 million, subscribed
by 43 banks and other enterprises. High sugar prices in the world market led
to wild speculations in the stock of Taiwan Sugar Corporation. In late 1964,
the Taiwan Stock Exchange could not withstand the fall in sugar prices and the
Government was compelled temporarily to stop trading. At present 40 companies
have their stocks listed on the Exchange, but of these only 12 are actively
traded. In addition, there are 15 issues of government bonds, which account
for NT$ 8,)h40 million out of total bond issues amounting to NT$ 8,880 million.
Government bonds have a ten percent tax free return and are liquid. Because
of this they are in great demand and it is difficult for private bonds to
compete with them.
2.17      The Government together with the CDC established the China Securities
Investment Corporation (CSIC) in March 1966 to rejuvenate the Stock Exchange
by increasing the number and volume of stocks traded. Forty-two companies
from financial, industrial and commercial fields invested in CSIC's capital
of NT$ 60 million, with the Bankers International Corporation, New York
holding the largest single block of shares. Its management is representative
of these stockholders with the Managing Director being provided by the Bankers
International Corporation. However, CSIC has not played an aggressive and
dynamic role, either in underwriting or in stimulating the trading of securities.
This is because businessmen in Taiwan are anxious not to lose control of their
companies or to disclose information about their operations. Moreover, there
are no incentives for companies tb go public. As a result, they prefer to
borrow the funds they require from commercial banks or private individuals,
rather than raise money by an issue of shares.
CDC's Role
2.18      In 1968, CDC financed around 6% of gross fixed capital formation in
private industry. The catalytic effect of CDC lending is substantial; for
every dollar that CDC invests, a further two dollars are raised to make the
project go on stream. About one of these dollars is for working capital and
the other supplements CDC's investment in fixed assets. CDC is thus associated
with a real contribution to fixed capital formation that is fairly significant,
perhaps 12%.
2.19      CDC's careful review of projects ensures that viable projects are
financed and deficient ones are discouraged. This screening process is valuable
to Taiwan to guard against wastage of resources. CDC has always placed great
emphasis, in its consideration of projects, upon their potential export
performance, which CDC has adopted as its first priority, and on their ability
to generate employment. The larger part of CDC's portfolio is in export
industries -- primarily textiles but also food and electronics -- and this is
a reflection of the competitiveness of the projects financed by CDC. CDC
estimates that in 1968 its clients exported goods worth US$ 151 million which
is equal to 18% of Taiwan's total exports. Through import substitution, CDC
estimates that its projects saved another US$ 11 million. Since 1966, CDC
estimates that its projects have created an additional 9,000 jobs.



- 6 -
2.20      CDC's direct contribution to the capital market has not been
significant. Its local currency req;uirements, supported by Counterpart
Fund loan of NT$ 500 million, have been sufficient for CDC's operations
and consequently CDC has never attempted to raise resources from the
market. Virtually, all its loans have been made to companies which are
not listed on the stock exchange. CDC is aware of the need to encourage
its clients, certainly those receiving substantial loans, to become
public companies but feels its efforts would be thwarted by a number of
factors: the poor condition of the stock market, absence of incentives to
go public, and in the final analysis the fact that its sounder projects
could obtain alternative finance if listing on the stock exchange were
made a precondition to CDC lending. CDC has over the years acquired an
equity portfolio which stood at NT$ 193 million on August 31, 1969, but
sales out of this portfolio have been small and no sales have been made
through the stock market. The market for shares is narrow and CDC is
reluctant to enlarge its share portfolio substantially. Similarly, CDC
has not undertaken any underwriting, which is another reflection of
companies' reluctance to go public. CDC could usefully focus its atten-
tion on issues relating to the capital market and work out ways in which
it could play an active role in this important area. One step of basic
importance would be for CDC to encourage its borrowers, particularly large
borrowers, to agree to their accounts being audited by auditors approved
by CDC. This is a difficult first step but nevertheless CDC proposes to
make efforts to see whether its large borrowiers would be prepared to
agree to such a procedure.
III. THE CORPORATION
Purposes and Powers
3.01      In May 1959, CDC was established as a private development finance
company to assist in the creation, modernization and expansion of the pri-
vate industrial sector in Taiwan. Its objectives also include the
mobilization of local sources of capital and the development of the capital
market. CDC's assistance to private companies may take the form of medium-
and long-term loans, equity investments, guarantees and the underwriting
of share issues.
Ownership
3.02      The original authorized and paid-up share capital of CDC was
NT$ 80 million in 80,000 shares of UT$ 1,000 each. Approximately 70% of
these shares were subscribed for by private companies and individuals and
the remaining 30% by three Government-owned commercial banks. In 1962 its
share capital was increased to NT$ 120 million, and Morgan Guaranty Inter-
national Banking Corporation (CDC's only foreign shareholder to date)
acquired a 10.2% interest in the Corporation. Since then, stock dividends
of NT$ 30 million each were declared in April 1968 and April 1969; also,
at the time of the 1968 stock dividend declaration, CDC undertook a share
split with the result that the paid-in share capital of CDC is now NT$ 180
million consisting of 1,800,000 shares of NT$ 100 each. The distribution



- 7 -
of shareholdings as at August 31, 1969 is detailed in Annex 3. Private
domestic shareholders continue to hold 70.2% of the total number of shares;
Government Banks, 19.6% and M-1organ Guaranty, 10.2%.  CDC has been discussing
with banks in Germany, Japan, and the U. S. A. the possibility of their
becoming CDC shareholders.
Resources
3.03      On December 31, 1969, CDC's resources totalled NT$ 2,637 million
(US$ 65.9 million equivalent) as follows:
(in million NT$)
Local Currency
Share Capital                                 180
Reserves and undistributed profits            131

TOTAL        2,624
3.o4      Counterpart funds are drying up, and CDC is not likely to receive
further CIECD counterpart fund loans. To date CDC has been granted five
such loans of NT$ 100 million each. These have a term of 30 years, which
includes a 15-year grace period. The first three were made during the period
1959 to 1961 and carried an interest rate of 6%. They are subordinated to
CDC's other debt, but not to its share capital. The second two loans were
made in 1963 and 1966. They are not subordinated at all and carry an interest
rate of 7.32%. These loans have now been fully disbursed. CDC's liquid
resources amounted, on December 31, 1969 to NT$ 166 million of which approxi-
mately NT$ 110 million was invested in government bonds.
3.05      The AID loan of US$ 9.3 million, which carried an interest rate
of 5.75% and was for a period of 10 years, has been largely repaid by CDC;
the outstanding loan at December 31, 1969 amounted to less than US$ 0.4
million. CDC has had the benefit of an IDA credit for US$ 5 million and
two Bank loans (397-CHA and 508-CHA) for US$ 15 million each. Both the IDA
credit, which carried an interest rate of 9.12% to CDC, and the first Bank
loan which carried a fixed rate of 5.5%, have been fully disbursed. The



- 8 -
second Bank loan, made in August 1967, carries a variable interest rate,
being at present 7%, and its amortization schedule, as with the previous
Bank loan, is flexible and based on sub-borrower's repayment schedules.
Organization and Procedures
3.06      Board of Directors   CDC has now 15 directors.  These include
the President and Executive Vice-President of CDC. From among themselves,
these directors elect seven managing directors who form an executive com-
mittee. The Board of Directors meets five or six times a year, but the
managing directors meet every two weeks and have authority to take decisions
on all financial transactions. Each director is elected for a period of
three years and is eligible for re-election. The Government is not re-
presented on the Board of Directors, although it has the right to be re-
presented at all Board Meetings by a non-voting observer as long as a
Bank loan is outstanding. However, the three Government-owned commercial
banks which are shareholders in CDC, have at present two managing directors
on the executive committee and one other director. An appointment as a
director of CDC is valued very highly, and CDC's directors are all prominent
men in the financial and industrial world. The names, age and major business
interests of CDC's present Board of Directors are given in Annex 4.
3.07      The Chairman of CMC is 75 years old and in poor health.  He is kept
informed of all major issues affecting CDC, but he does not concern himself
with its day-to-day affairs. The question of his retirement, possibly during
the next two years, has arisen. The other directors pay close attention to
the company's affairs and both expect and get regular reports on the com-
pany's operations. There is a cordial relationship between the Management
and the Board.
3.08      The managing directors take an active interest in projects pre-
sented to them by the management for approval.   It is only on occasion  that
projects are returned to management for restructuring. CDC's management has
also referred projects to the managing directors for guidance on particular
problems. All policy decisions are taken by the full Board and issues appear
to have been carefully examined before being resolved.
3.09      Chinese company law provides that, in addition to a Board of
Directors, the shareholders of a company must elect five supervisors to
protect their interests. They have no control over the management of the
company, but have access to its books, and either jointly or individually,
can ask for an explanation if it is felt that the shareholders' interests
are being prejudiced. These supervisors receive a monthly report from the
Management, and one of them is elected as a Resident Supervisor, and attends
the managing directors' meetings as an observer.
3.10      Management and Staff   Since 1962 the President of CDC has been
Mr. Felix S. Y. Chang, who joined the company as Vice President in 1959 after
holding important positions in the Bank of China and the Bank of Taiwan.
Mr. Chang is capable and respected, and has the confidence of his Board.
The Executive Vice President is Mr. T. C. Pan, who joined CDC in 1962, after
serving as a senior official of CIECD. In 1967, Dr. Yen Shen was appointed
Vice-President. Prior to this, he had been the Director of CDC's Technical
Department. CDC has five departments, each of which is headed by an
experienced man. With the exception of the Director who took over the
Technical Department from Dr. Yen Shen, the heads of the other departments
have been with CDC since it was appraised in 1967. The organizational
structure is shown in Annex 5.



- 9 -
3.11      The management team works in close harmony.  The fact that it is
a sound, efficient institution with considerable know-how in project
appraisal techniques, is a reflection of management's ability; its
conservative attitude is also a reflection of management's outlook.
3.12      As at September 30, 1969 CDC had a total staff of 51 (excluding
messengers and drivers), of whom 37 were professionals. The professional
staff concerned with project appraisal work numbered 13 and the others,
apart from the management of 3, consisted of professionals engaged on
project follow-up work and CDC's accounting and secretarial functions.
The staff are of good quality, intelligent and conscientious. Since 1967,
the number of professionals has come down from 41 to 37. Looking ahead
to the next few years of expanding business, CDC is proposing to enlarge
its staff by 6 - 10 persons and has started to look for suitable candidates.
3.13      Appraisals   Procedures for appraising loan applications are well
organized. There is a meeting between the senior Management and department
heads every week, at which all important issues and projects are discussed.
Before an appraisal of a project is presented to the Board, it is considered
by the Operations Committee. The Committee also decides on the action to
be taken in cases of loan arrears. As a training device, CDC brings a large
number of its staff into project discussions.
3.14      CDC's projects are carefully appraised and the standard is
satisfactory. However, some inflexibility in appraisal methods appears to
have developed, for example, CDC insists on a long-term debt to equity
ratio of 1:1. A broader concern with the project's viability rather than
absolute observance of particular ratios is desirable. The financial pro-
jections relating to sub-projects calling only for local currency lending
are inclined to be thin and CDC could usefully strengthen this area. Most
CDC projects are export-oriented and CDC establishes that the level of
foreign exchange earning is satisfactory. Features such as employment
and use of domestic raw materials are also taken into account by CDC. About
three-quarters of CDC's projects take less than six months to process, from
the initial contact to the stage of commitments, half of these taking
between three and six months. One-fourth of the projects take a longer
time, between 6 months and a year, largely because of difficulties in obtain-
ing data in sufficient detail. The internal processing of project appraisal
work is rapid.
3.15      Follow-up   CDC's follow-up work is divided between two Depart-
ments. Routine processing of quarterly reports from project companies
and visits to projects is undertaken by the Controller's Department. If
a problem is exposed, a report is made to the management and the project
is moved to the Operations Department. It is the function of this depart-
ment to look into difficulties faced by projects and to effect recoveries
from clients in arrears. CDC has been able to rescue a number of problem
projects and its management appears to have played an active role in
doing this. This concentrated attention on projects in trouble is an
important factor in keeping CDC's arrears down. The weakness in CDC's
follow-up work lies in the Controller's Department. Although the quarterly



- 10 -
reports submitted by pro:Jects are carefully processed within the
Departrient, and this has been frequently helpful in flagging potential
problems, field visits have been insufficient. Only about a quarter of
CDC's projects were visited in 1968 although the rate of visits during
the first 8 months of 1969 had improved somewhat. The principal obstacle
to making more visits is the lack of staff in the Controller's Department,
and this CDC is proposing to rectify by adding to staff in this depart-
ment.
Disbursement and Audit
3.16      The disbursement of CDC funds is well organized, invoices being
carefully examined before payment. The Controller's Department is res-
ponsible for the preparation of accounts which, since 1964I, have been
audited by Mr. T. N. Soong, an associate of Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Co.,
an international and reputable firm of accountants. CDC's accounts in
1967 and 1968 were approved by this firm without qualifications.
Relations with the Government
3.17      The relationship between Government and CDC is very close; CDC's
management is in regular and close contact with senior members of the
Government. The Government has taken and continues to take a strong
interest in CDC's operations and acknowledges that CDC has made a signi-
ficant contribution to the development of industry in Taiwan. However,
there is a feeling growing within Government that CDC needs to be more
vital and that its posture needs to change so that it can guide industry
on a wider front; promotions, special attention to new industrialists and
the development of the stock exchange. CDC is aware of these views and
its management is trying to assess in what way it can make a greater con-
tribution to industrial growth.
Relations with Commercial Banks and Business Community
3.18      CDC's relations with the commercial banking community in Taiwan
have been smooth. However, there has not been much liaison on industrial
development. Since the Bank of Communications and the Bank of Taiwan, both
of them CDC shareholders, are active in term lending to industry, CDC
could initiate discussions to see how both these, and possibly other,
institutitutions could cooperate with CDC in helping to strengthen Taiwan's
industrial base and the capital market.
3.19      CDC's image among the business community is that of a "wholesale
bank", a large lender to large projects. CDC has not stressed its develop-
mental functions and until CDC plays a more active role in the field of
assisting new industrialists and in the formulation of new projects, this



-11 -
image is not likely to alter. With its own clients, mainly established
industrialists, CDC maintains close contact and they turn to CDC to finance
their expansion schemes and new ventures.
IV. POLICIES AND OPERATIONS
Policies
4.01      CDC's Statement of Operational Policies is set forth in Annex 6.
With the approval of the Bank, Article 19, which deals with the aggregate
amount that CDC is permitted to invest in equity, was amended on November
26, 1969 to permit such investmlents up to the total of its paid-up share
capital and reserves, rather than 75% as previously. The change would
penrit CDC to participate more actively in equity investments. Since 1967,
the limit on CDC's financial assistance in any form to a single enterprise
has been reduced from 50% to a more prudent 20% of CDC's net worth. This
allowed CDC a lending and investment capacity to a single enterprise of
NT$ 62 million (US$ 1.6 million) at December 31, 1969.
4.02      On the whole CDC has followed its Statement of Operational
Policies. It could be averred that it has favored the textile sector which
would be contrary to Article 8 of its Policy Statement. However, the
textile industry in Taiwan has shown the most rapid growth in the indus-
trial sector and CDC in assisting this growth has, as a result, approved
more loans to textiles than to other sectors. Article 16 requires that
CDC will study the trend of the development of all industry and initiate
new industries or expand existing ones. While CDC does keep in close
touch with industrial trends it has not yet initiated projects on its own,
but it has helped entrepreneurs put together projects.   Under Article 20,
CDC is obliged to encourage the marketing of industrial securities and
thus broadens the ownership of the enterprises it assists, but for the
reasons given in paragraph 2.20 CDC has not been able to do this as yet.
Loan Operations
4.03      On December 31, 1969, CDC has approved loans to 415 projects
amounting to NT$ 3 billion. Approvals, commitments and disbursements
from 1965 through 1969 are set out in Annex 7. CDC approvals 1/ for 1967,
1968 and 1969 are shown below:
1/ Since CDC commitments follow approvals within a few days, it is
appropriate to focus on approvals alone.



- 12 -
(in NT$ million)
1967         1968          1969
Local Currency            72.05       155.50        115.10
Foreign Currency         246.66       255.24       359.68
Total      318.71        410.74       474.78
4.04      The 29% increase in approvals in 1968 over 1967 was due mainly
to a doubling of local currency lending. Local currency lending did not
reach the 1968 level in 1969 as there were two unusually large loans
amounting to NT$ 54 million in 1968. Total approvals were 15% higher in
1969 compared with 1968. The high proportion of foreign currency lending
(71% of total lending) during the three years 1967 - 1969, is understand-
able, since CDC's lending is for the purchase of machinery, the bulk of
which is imported.  An anlysis of projects approved by CDC during the first
10 months of 1969 reveals an import component of 40%. Towards these pro-
jects, CDC contributed 22% in foreign currency and 10% in local currency.
Characteristics of Loans
4.05      Interest Rate   CDC charges 13.32% for local currency loans and
9% for foreign currency loans. These rates are the same as those charged
by commercial banks for both their medium (1-5 years) and short term
(0-1 year) operations. CDC is at present considering an increase in its
foreign currency lending rate to between 9.5% and 9.75%. This increase
should help CDC to counterbalance the rising cost of its loans from the
Bank.
4.06      Foreign Exchange Risk   CDC does not carry the foreign exchange
risk on its foreign currency loans. The risk is normally assumed by the
client. CDC does, however, have an agreement with the Government, whereby
the foreign exchange risk may be passed to it at an agreed fee which at
present is 4.32% per annum. In such cases, and there have only been two,
the client is charged interest at 13.32% p.a., the local currency lending
rate, and of this 4.32% is paid to the Government with CDC retaining 9%.
An increase in CDC's foreign currency lending rate, as contemplated in
the previous paragraph, would probably involve a reduction in the 4.32%
fee payable to Government. Alternatively, the local currency lending
rate would have to be raised approximately.
4.07      Working Capital Loans   CDC's Statement of Operational Policies
prohibits it from making working capital loans "for the time being" CDC
has not yet done so, fearing an adverse reaction from the commercial banks,
although since commercial banks are now active, some more than others, in



- 13 -
long-term lending, CDC in turn should be able to lend for permanent working
capital without objection from the banking community. Difficulty over work-
ing capital requirements is not uncommon in Taiwan due to the somewhat
narrow procedures for the local banks. CDC can fulfill a useful function
by making permanent working capital loans on a long-term basis and will
consider the possibility of making such loans.
4.08      Term and Size of Loans   As shown in Annex 8, the average maturity
of loans, by number, has risen from 7.6 years for approved loans made in 1967,
to 8.5 years for loans made between January 1, 1968 and August 31, 1969. The
longer term loans that CDC can make -- commercial banks are permitted to make
loans only up to 5 years -- is a-competitive factor in CDC's favor. The aver-
age size of CDC loan approvals, as shown in Arnex 8, has risen from NT4` 10.6
million in 1967 to NT$12.4 million between January 1, 1968 and August 31, 1969.
4.09      Geographical Distribution   The distribution of CDC's loans shown
in Annex 9 follows generally the national distribution of industry based on
the number of factories by regions.  About 79%, by number, of CDC's loans
relate to the North and North-West where 72% of Taiwan's factories are located
Industrialization in the South was greatly helped by the establishment of
the Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone which has over 150 factories. CDC's
lending to projects within the Processing Zone is low; only two loans having
been granted. The reason is that these projects are owned by, or a large
interest is held by foreign firms, mainly Japanese, who have brought in
their own capital for purchase of fixed assets. Two other similar Zones
are being planned and CDC proposes to examine what assistance it can give
to projects in these zones.
4.10      Loans to Existing Clients   A considerable proportion of CDC's
business is with large industrial groups; about half its loans from 1967
through August 31, 1969 consists of repeat loans, as shown by Annex 10. Of
the remaining 50%, only 10% went to new industrialists and the balance of
40% were granted to established businessmen and business groups, mainly
Taiwanese but also to businessmen from Hong Kong wishing to establish faci-
lities in Taiwan. It is clear that CDC's lending is aimed at established
industrialists -- the ten largest business houses in Taiwan are CDC clients.
CDC could broaden its lending activity, and it is recommended that CDC should
make special efforts to assist new industrialists, possibly by establishing
a special section within CDC whose sole function would be to encourage new
industrialists, and initiate and process CDC promotions (as mentioned in
para 3.17). CDC is examining such a proposal.
4.11      Security   The security for loans made by CDC is a first mortgage
over new plant and buildings.  To ensure an adequate margin, these assets
are valued at 70% of the purchase price or construction cost. In addition,
CDC obtains a personal guarantee from the promoters or principal shareholders
of the company.



Promotions
4.12      CDC has taken some tentative steps into the promotional field.
This has taken the form of helping to establish contact between certain
U.S. industrialists and local groups, and endeavoring to see that suitable
arrangements are worked out. This is a promising start, but CDC could take
a bolder position by initiating projects.   CDC has indicated its intention
to play a more active promotional role particularly in the non-traditional
sectors, such as in the electronics and engineering industries.
Loan Portfolio
4.13      On August 31, 1969 CDC's portfolio amounted to NT$ 1,360.6 million.
Arrears are modest, affecting loans whose outstanding amounts are NT$ 61.6
million or 4.5% of the loan portfolio, which is normal for CDC. Of this,
NT$ 28 million relates to loans where arrears have been outstanding for over
24 months and in virtually all such cases legal steps have been taken by CDC
to effect recovery. A number of the hard-core cases are expected to lead
to losses and, while difficult to quantify with any real precision, it is
estimated that CDC may have to write off eventually as bad debts, around
VT$ 16 million. In one case alone, where the chairman of the company con-
cerned has been jailed for malpractice involving another business interest,
the loss is estimated at NT$ 10 million.   These potential bad debts of
NT$ 16 million should be viewed against CDC's aggregate reserves of NT$ 139
million at August 31, 1969.
4.14      Of the enterprises in commercial production which made up CDC's
portfolio at the end of 1968, about 86% are profitable; 58% are earning
profits, before tax, of up to 7.5% of total assets; 20% are earning profits
of between 7.5% and 15%; and the remaining 7% are highly profitable with a
profit rate of over 15% of total assets. From the viewpoint of loan servicing,
93% of CDC's portfolio by volume, in the servicing stage are making repayments
in time and have no known problems. About 8% of them show signs of problems,
with 3% servicing very irregularly, being subject to serious problems.
4.15      The modest level of arrears, the satisfactory loan servicing
record and the underlying profitability of the projects show that overall
CDC's portfolio is sound.
4.16      Exposure in Single Projects   An aspect of CDC's total portfolio
including both loan and equity portfolio has been its excessive exposure in
certain enterprises. When CDC was appraised in 1967, concern was expressed
that in several instances loan and equity commitments to a single client
exceeded the level permitted by the Statement of Operational Policies, which
at that time was 50% of its net worth. This limit has now been reduced to
20%. Since then the increase in CDC's net worth, capital repayments by the
clients concerned and CDC's refusal to approve further loans or investments
to these clients had by August 31, 1969, reduced the number of projects
exceeding the exposure limit to four. Annex 11 gives details of the projects
in which there is still an over-exposure, but it is apparent that there has
been a marked improvement since 1966, and this aspect of CDC7s operation
is no longer a cause for concern.

4.17      CDC's Exposure in Textiles   A significant portion, NT$ 517 million
or 39% of CDC's loan portfolio at August 31, 1969, was in natural textiles and
another 16%, INT$ 215 million, in synthetics. Chemicals, which includes paper,
take up 14% of CDC's portfolio, the remaining 31% being in ceramics (7%),
machinery (7%) and mining, food and other industries.
4.18      The growth of the textile industry has been remarkable (see para
2.02). The industry is dependent upon exports and Taiwan, with its industrious
labor force and relatively low wage level, has built up a highly competitive
industry. The fifth 4-year Economic Development Plan states that for certain
industries, particularly those with high export potential (which includes
textiles), emphasis will be placed on the modernization and expansion of
production facilities and on the improvement of management practices, with a
view to stepping up production and increasing exports. CDC accordingly feels
it has an important role to play in the textile sector. However, Taiwan can
expect increasing competition from Korea which is actively building up its
textile industry, and also restrictions on textile exports to the USA,
Taiwan's most important customer, are a possibility.
4.19      The share of natural textiles in CDC's loan portfolio has shown a
steady growth from 25%o in 1967 to 35% in 1968 and stood at 39% at August 31,
1969. This continued growth rate follows the general trend of the textile
industry as a whole, which has expanded and modernized resulting in a 50%
increase of production during 1968 - 1969. Synthetics comprised 16% of CDC's
portfolio at August 31, 1969, but recent trends show that while the share of
cotton textiles is likely to come down, synthetics will probably increase.
CDC is aware of the growing imbalance in its portfolio, and is becoming
increasingly selective in the cotton textile projects which it accepts for
financing. Apart from possible temporary fluctuations, CDC foresees that
its textile portfolio will decline in relation to total portfolio from 1970
onwards.
Equity Portfolio
4.20     Aibout half of the nineteen investments in CDC's portfolio are
currently paying dividends. Cash dividends received by CDC range from around
6% to 9%, compared to an average of 12% by companies listed on the stock
exchange. If stock dividends are treated as income, the return on CDC's
portfolio in 1969 was 8.9% compared to 6.5% in 1968.  CDC's portfolio
consists largely (66%) of investments in companies which have recently
commenced operations or have recently undergone substantial expans4on and
modernization programs, and are consequently unable to declare more substan-
tial dividends at the moment. Of CDC's portfolio of NT$ 193 million at August
31, 1969, NT$ 121 million or 63% was invested in companies whose profitability
prospects were very satisfactory. Another 33% relate to investments in public
utility-type companies or companies which have been in difficulty, but whose
dividend paying prospects have now improved. However, the investments are
safe and their profitability is reasonable. In two investments of NT$ 8
million, (4% of CDC's equity portfolio) the prospects are uncertain. Overall,
the quality of CDC's portfolio is good.



- 16 -
4.21      CDC's equity approvals have been somewhat uneven:  approvals in
1963 came down to NT$ 13 from NT$ 24 million in 1967 but were higher in 1969 --
at the end of that year approvals amounted to NT$ 15 million. Equity invest-
ments have always been accompanied by loans. All equity investments in CDC's
portfolio are in the form of common shares except two preferred share
investments which were made in companies experiencing difficulties and where
CDC already held common shares. Of the nineteen investments, two are listed
on the stock exchange. The other investments are in private family-owned
companies. Sales out of portfolio have been negligible.
4.22      Under a directive issued by the Ministry of Finance dated
November 21, 1967, companies are required to treat stock dividend receipts
as income.   Until December 31, 1969 CDC had received stock dividends amount-
ing to NT$ 30 million and its equity portfolio has accordingly been increased
by this amount. Due to this increase, a question arises as to the value of
CDC's investments. The auditors after checking the various companies'
financial statements, only two of the nineteen companies' accounts are audited,
stated that in their opinion the underlying value of CDC's investments is
slightly above the value at which it carries these investments in its books,
i.e. at purchase price plus the par value of stock dividend receipts. It is
impossible to Judge the market value since only two fairly small investments
amounting to 5% of CDC's equity portfolio are quoted on the Stock Exchange.
The shares of the remaining 17 companies are not listed in the Stock Exchange
and consequently their market value remains in doubt, more so with the
inclusion of stock dividends in the value of the investments. It is desirable
that CDC should try to maintain the value of its investments in its balance
sheet on the basis of the purchase price or market value, whichever is lower.
This means that CDC should omit the value of stock dividend receipts from its
equity portfolio as reflected in the balance sheet (see para 5.04).
4.23      Industrially, CDC's share portfolio is fairly well distributed.
At August 31, 1969, about 35% of CDC's portfolio excluding stock dividends
(41% including stock dividends) relates to the textile sector. Chemicals
take up 18% and less than 10% each relate to food, electrical equipment and
other industries (see Annex 12).
Underwriting and Guarantees
4.24      Although it is stated to be one of its objectives, CDC has never
underwritten a share issue. The reason is the same as in the case of CSIC,
namely that businessmen in Taiwan do not wish to open their companies to the
public. As a service to its clients CDC will guarantee a loan made by a
commercial bank at a fee of l-2j p.a.  These guarantees are adequately
secured. On December 31, 1969 CDC's contingent liability in respect of
guarantees was NT$ 150 million.

V. FINANCIAL RESULTS
Income Statements
5.01      These are attached as Annex 13, for the years from 1965 through
December 31, 1969.   The relationship between the principal components of
the income statement and average total assets are shown in Annex 14 for the
years 1965 to 1969.
5.02      Gross income in 1969 amounted to NT$ 190 million, over 11% higher
than in 1968, which is about equal to the 1968 growth rate. Interest earnings
come to 8% of average total assets during 1968 and 1969. Interest from
temporary investments in 1967 amounted to NT$ 20 million, down from NT$ 32
million in 1966, following a substantial repayment of NT$ 231 million to AID
by CDC. In 1969, the amount received was NT$ 19 million.
5.03      Since 1967, stock dividends received by companies must be treated
as income. This resulted in an apparent increase in CDC's dividend income.
For example dividend receipts increased in 1967 to NT$ 12.8 million from
NT$ 1.5 million in 1966, stock and cash dividends contributing equally to this
sudden rise in receipts. In 1968, dividends amounted to NT$ 10.3 million of
which about 85% were in the form of stock dividends. In 1969, this proportion
was 73%. These substantial amounts of stock dividends have had an impact on
CDC's profits, as income is inflated with the addition of stock dividends and
this in turn inflates profits. In 1969, stock dividends constituted about
20% of CDC's profits before tax. Whlile this method of treating stock
dividends does produce additional tax revenue for Government, its
appropriateness is questionable for a financial institution such as CDC.
It has now been agreed that CDC would discuss with the authorities concerned
the possibility of obtaining exemption from having to treat stock dividends
as incomel/, and while the present situation prevails, create a special
provision equivalent to stock dividend receipts (net of tax adjustment)
which would offset the effect of such stock dividends upon the profits.
This would also have the effect of ensuring, to a large extent, that the
value of the equity portfolio is not overstated.
5.04      Following the NT$ 231 million repayment to AID in 1967, CDC's
financial charges have been reduced to about 5% of its average total assets
(5.2, in 1969). Administrative expenses are modest, being in recent years
0.7% of average total assets.
5.05      CDC's net earnings before interest, provisions and tax when measured
against average total assets amounted to 8.9%, 9.5% and 9.5% for the years
1967, 1968 and 1969 respectively; and if stock dividends are excluded, the
equivalent ratios are 8.4%, 9.0% and 8.8%.  When compared with other develop-
ment finance companies associated with the Bank, CDC ranks among the companies
which have good profit performance. Two other ratios of profitability are
shown below:
1/ The Tax Reform Commission is proposing to review the appropriateness
of this regulation.

Profit after tax as a % of year end
share capital                                 35.7       32.21/      31.5
CDC's profitability is evidently at a high level.
5.o6      CDC has paid a 12%, cash dividend on the par value of its shares
since 1961, representing a pay-out rate of close to 50% of net income in
1965 and. 1966. In 1967 and 1968 CDC decided to issue stock dividends amounting
to NT$ 30 million in each year; a cash dividend of 1% was also declared during
these years. Assuming a par value for the one-for-four stock dividend, and
including the 1% cash dividend, CDC's 1967 dividend amounted tio 26%. Similarly,
the 1968 one-for-five stock dividend plus the 1% cash dividend, produces a
21% dividend to shareholders. In 1969, CDC expects to declare a 12% cash
dividend which, considering the 50% increase in share capital, through stock
dividends, produces a real return to shareholders of 18% and gives CDC a
pay-out ratio of about 50%.
Balance Sheets
5.07      Annex 15 sets ouf CDC's balance sheets for the years 1965 through
1969. Sunmmarized balance sheets for the calendar years 1967 through 1969
are given below:
(in NT$ million)

Debt and Equity

increase undertaken in two equal tranches during these years.

to move into this new building in April 1970.



- 19 -
5.08      About 40% of CDC's current assets are retained in the form of
5-year Government bonds which give CDC a 10% tax free return.  The normal
practice is for these Government bonds to be redeemed in four annual install-
ments after the first year. Cash balances are kept mainly in the form of
time deposits on which CDC earns interest at 9-10%. CDC handles its liquid
resources to good advantage.
5.09      Long-term debt is 82% of liabilities and equity is 16%.  This
relationship remains virtually static during the 1967-1969 period and there
is no growth of leverage, wnich remains at around 5 times CDC's equity.
While there was an unusual growth in equity in 1967 and 1968 as a result of
arrangements for CDC's share capital increase, nevertheless, CDC's unchanging
leverage reflects the slow pace of business development. Under the formula
agreed with the Bank, CDC's debt is limited to three times its share capital,
reserves and the subordinated loans. On this basis, at the end of 1969,
CDC's debt/equity ratio stood at 2.
5.10      Banking law requires CDC to place 20% of its net earnings before
taxes in a legal reserve and under CDC's statement of Operational Policies
further allocations (which are not specified) are to be placed in a special
reserve to build up its equity. CDC maintains its possible loss provisions
at 2% of its outstanding portfolio, which is dictated by tax considerations.
In 1967 these reserves and provisions amounted to 8.7% of its loan and
investment portfolio, in 1968 to 8.4% and in 1969 the ratio increased to
9.7%. This is satisfactory in relation to the quality of CDC's portfolio.
5.11      CDC's financial position is strong, backed as it is by a sound
portfolio. From its financial picture, CDC emerges as a company which is
solid but slow moving.
VI. PROSPECTS
6.o0      Under its fifth 4-year Plan (1969-1972) the Government envisages
the annual GDP growth at an average 7% rate and industrial growth at 9%,
which is lower than tne actual achievement in the past, 10% during 1961-1968.
This partly reflects the usual conservative targets of Government's Plan and
is partly due to the emphasis on investments in the infrastructure in the
fifth Plan. Industries' share in GDP is expected to rise from 32.5% in 1968
to 35.1% in 1972.  The major aspects of future industrial development are the
expansion of electronics, textile and food processing industries, the build-up
of the petrochemicals complex and the possible establishment of an integrated
iron and steel plant. After the completion of the two petrochemical complexes
by 1972, Taiwan will be independent of imports of all major synthetic fibres
and other petrochemical intermediaries needed by its textile and plastics
;ndustries. The prospects for future industrial development in Taiwan are
bright.

Future Operations
6.02      Annex 16 gives CDC's projections for the 1970-1974 period in terms
of approvals and disbursements. The figures below show estimated approvals
for 1970 and 1971 and for comparison, CDC's actual performance during 1968
and 1969:

447       495        513       557
6.03      Of CDC's approvals, 71% were in foreign currency during the period
1967 through 1969 and the rest axe in local currency. CDC's projections
have been prepared on this assumption, which is acceptable.
6.o4      As regards the volume of lending, CDC's projections are conservative.
It will also continue to make moderate equity investments in the future.
Approvals in 1969 were expected to be 8% higher than in 1968 but CDC was
successful in processing additional loans which raised 1969 approvals to 15%
above 1968. The pipeline at October 31, 1969 contained 18 projects for
NT$ 335 million. One or two of these projects may be withdrawn but others
appeared reasonably firm and should lead to CDC's approval. CDC expects its
1970 operations to be around the same level and has provided for an increase
of 4% over 1969. The projected rate of increase in 1971 is 10%. The rate
of increase in approvals is well within CDC's capability.
Resources
6.05      CDC is expecting to be short of capital in early 1970.  It has
accordingly approached the Bank for a loan. Its capital requirements in
respect of foreign and local currency are dealt with below.
6.o6      Foreign Currency   At December 31, 1970, CDC had no foreign
currency resources available for approval, having exhausted IBRD Loan 508-CHA.
Forecast approvals of US$ 8.6 million in 1970 and USt 9.5 million in 1971,
which together amount to US$ 18 million, will consequently have to be met
from fresh resources. CDC has requested the Bank for a loan for this amount.
1/ This includes two exceptionally large loans totalling NT$ 54 million.



- 21 -
Local Currency
6.07      The following table gives the availability of CDC's local currency
resources from November 1, 1969 to December 31, 1971:
(in NT$ million)
Approvals                               Resources
Approvals awaiting disbursement    182    Net current assets as at         166
at January 1, 1970                         January 1, 1970
Ap7rovals from january 1, 1970              Cash generation from
to December 31, 1971                       January 1, 1970 to
Loans                          290      December 31, 1971             102
Equity                          55    Repayments from Jan. 1, 1970
Net current assets at                         to December 31, 1971         187
December 31, 1971                 127    Approvals awaiting disburse-
ment at Dec. 31, 1971        199
67                                    654
6.08      In the course of actual operations, outstanding approvals awaiting
disbursements are largely covered by net current assets. At January 1, 1970
undisbursed commitments amounted to NT$ 182 million and net current assets
were NT$ 166 million but by the end of 1971 the gap will have widened to
NT$ 199 of undisbursed approvals versus INT  127 million of current assets.
Repayments are not sufficient to finance operations and consequently current
assets, utilized for lending, will decline to NT$ 59 million by 1974. CDC
will also have to start repayments under the Counterpart Fund loans in
gradually increasing amounts from 1975. Accordingly CDC should begin to give
thought to ways whereby it can supplement its local currency resources. It
appears doubtful that CIECD would be willing to assist CDC. CDC may have to
turn to the market for resources, but with the high interest rates CDC would
have to pay, the effect on its profitability would be substantial unless CDC
can find ways of increasing its earnings. Possibly, CDC may be able to obtain
permission from Government to issue tax-exempt bonds which would enable CDC to
raise money on cheaper terms. Another possibility would be an increase of
CDC's share capital; CDC's good profitability may make this a feasible
proposition.   CDC proposes to inform the Bank by the end of 1970 of the steps
it plans to take to obtain additional local currency resources including an
estimate of the amount.
Financial Forecast
6.09      Annexes 17, 18 and 19 contain CDC's projected income statements,
balance sheets and cash flow statements from 1970 to 1974.
6.1o      Profits before tax are expected to remain at a satisfactory level
although declining slightly, when related to net worth, from 23% to 21%.
However, when related to share capital, profits are very favorable, about
30% in 1970 rising to 39% in 1971. Gross earnings before interest, provisions
and tax are 8.5%, of average total assets during these periods. Administrative
expenses continue to remain constant at 0.7% of average total assets, but
financial expenses are estimated to increase from 5.3% in 1970 to 5.6% in 1974.
Between these years, CDC expects its total assets to increase by NT$ 1,391



- 22 -
million or 72% whereas its loan and investment portfolio will increase by
14T$ 1,421 million or 88%, which is a pointer to a tightening current assets
position. Reserves and provisions as a percentage of portfolio increase
from 9.4% in 1970 to 11.6% in 1974.  Future debt service cover is satisfactory.
6.11      CDC expects its real debt - equity ratio to increase from 4.8 at
the beginning of 1970 to 5.3 at the end of 1974, which is a reasonable level.
Under the existing formula agreed between the Bank and CDC, a debt ceiling of
three times equity has been imposed, with equity defined as unimpaired share
capital, free reserves and CDC's subordinated debt. CDC will reach this
limit at the end of 1973.   While no relaxation of the limit in substance
is called for at the present time, it is necessary to bring the definition
of debt and equity into line with what is now the Bank's normal practice.
This calls for arn increase in the ratio to 6 : 1.
VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND BECOvMENDATIONS
Conclusions
7.01      CDC is a well run and sound development finance company.   Its
management and staff are both experienced and competent, although management
is conservative and does not give sufficient emphasis to the developmental
side of CDC's operations. The standard of CDC's appraisals is generally
satisfactory, but its procedures should be more flexible and the ones
dealing with local currency loans more analytical.   CDC plans to strengthen
its follow-up work, which suffers from inadequate project visits, by adding
to staff involved in this work.
7.02      It is now over ten years since CDC was established.  During this
period, CDC has played a significant role in industrial finance; it has
provided, during the past five years, approximately 46% of total outstanding
loans by financial institutions to the private sector for capital investment.
In line with the overall expansion of the textile industry in Taiwan, CDC's
loans, both to natural and man-made textile projects, have been increasing
during the last three years and at Augulst 31, 1969 the share of natural
textiles in CDC's loan portfolio was 39% while that of synthetic textiles
was 16%. CDC is aware of the imbalance in its portfolio and is becoming
increasingly selective in the natural textile projects which it approves.
It expects that from 1970 its textile portfolio in relation to total
portfolio will register a steady decline.   CDC has tended to support
established industrialists. In future it should give greater support to
projects sponsored by small or new businessmen, in order to broaden the
entrepreneurial base in Taiwan. In addition, CDC should be more active in
the identification and promotion of new projects.
7.03      Of CDC's total loan portfolio of NT$ 1,360.6 million on August 31,
1969, only u-T$ 61.6 million or 4.5% was affected by arrears. Against potential
bad debts of NT$ 16 million, CDC had reserves of NT$ 130 million on August 31,
1969. It is difficult to determine the market value of CDC's equity portfolio,
since only two of its shares are quoted on the Taiwan stock exchange. However,
the quality of the equity portfolio is sound.



- 23 -
7.04      The financial position and prospects of CDC are satisfactory,
although a shortage of local currency resources is developing.   CDC is
giving thought now to the methods by which the additional local currency
resources that it will need in 1972 or 1973 can be obtained. One way would
be for CDC to increase its share capital. Another would be for CDC to make
a debenture issue.
7.05      The Bank is CDC's only present source of foreign currency and the
second Bank loan which was made in 1967 has been exhausted.   Additional
capital will be needed by CDC to finance the approvals that are expected
during the next two years.
Recommendations
7.o6      In recognition of CDC's good standard of project appraisal work,
it is proposed to increase CDC's free limit from $500,000 to $750,000 with
an aggregate of one-third of the loan for projects below the free limit.
7.07      No material change in CDC's present borrowing limit is at present
called for.   However, while the limit will remain unchanged in substance, it
should be calculated in accordance with the Bank's current practice, whereby
the amount of subordinated loans scheduled to be repaid before the final
amortization of the proposed Bank loan, is deducted from equity.   On this
basis, the borrowing limit will stand at six times equity.
7.08      In view of its good performance, CDC continues to qualify for Bank
support. It is recommended that the Bank should grant CDC a loan of $18
million, to cover its projected foreign currency requirements until December
1971. The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to lending to
development finance companies, including the standard commitment charge.

and anondod -n Juno 21, 1967 and liovcnbor 26, 1969)
Scope and Nature of Operations
1.  The China Development Corporation (CDC) was incorporated as a private
financing institution for the purpose of contributing a share towards
the growth of domestic econony in general and development of private
enterprise in particular.
2.  CDC will finance only private industrial enterprises that are properly
incorporated and managed.  The existence of government or other public
interests in an enterprise does not necessarily preclude financing by
the Corporation, providing the Government holdings as measured by
voting power or control of the management of such enterprise is not
predominant.
3. Financing will be provided for the establishment of new as well as
existing industrial enterprises for expansion and/or improvement.
4.  CDC will assist private enterprise in the form of:
a. medium and long-term loans;
b. equity participation;
c. guarantee or underwriting corporate securities;
d. other trust business; and
e.  techmical or administrative advice or assistance.
Operation Policy
'. Applicants requesting for loan, equity participation and/or other
assistance from CDC shall be required to submit project in writing.
6.  CDC wil1 accept requests for assistance that are in conformity with
the national economic policy and development programs. CDC will
finance projects which appear upon careful investigation to be
financially and economically sound and technically well conceived.
Special attention will be given to the quality of the management as
well as the profitability of the enterprises.
7.  CDC, in principle, will not finance any project which requires finance
in form of loan or in form of equity investment for less than NT$ 500,000.
8. CDC, while giving assistance to private industrial enterprises, will
pay attention to the overall and well-balanced development without
prejudice in favor of a few selected industries.
9.  CDC's financing in the form of loans will be limited to capital expend-
itures. Request for accommodation for working capital will not be
entertained for the time being.



ANNEX 6
Page   2
10.  CDC will decide the amount of the loan to be extended according to the
size of the project and whether the project is initiated by a new
enterprise or sponsored by a going concern for expansion and/or improve-
ment, but in any case, the applicant shall be required to provide
adequate matching fund.
11.  CDC will, in principle, give clients a grace period of six months after
the completion of loan project to start the repayment of the loans.
Financial Prudence
12.  CDC will charge interest on loans at a rate with due consideration to
the level set by the Central Bank of China as well as the cost to
manage the loans.
13.  CDC will require its borrower to provide adequate collaterals and to
keep books and accounts in accordance with sound accounting procedures.
CDC will exercise the right to inspect the operation and audit the
accounts of the enterprise it finances.
14.  In undertaking large size project, CDC may seek cooperation with other
financial institutions both domestic and foreign.
15.  CDC will not carry foreign exchange risk on loans repayable in foreign
currency. Such risk will be assumed by the ultimate borrower or to
be covered by the government.
16.  CDC will study from time to time the trend of development of all
industries and the opportunity for investment in cooperation with private
sector either for initiation of new enterprises or expansion of the
existing ones.
17. CDC, in principle, will not seek a controlling interest in any enter-
prise, nor participate in the management of the enterprise in which it
has invested. CDC may send, however, representative as a member of the
Board of Directors and/or Supervisors of the enterprise if so elected.
18.  CDC's equity investment will mainly serve as a catalytic agent for the
creation of new enterprises. CDC will dispose its share holdings in
these enterprises when they are able to stand on their own feet without
being affected by such transfer and that a fair price could be obtained
thereof. In the disposal of investment, due consideration will be
given not only to CDC's own interest but also to those of other
participants in such investment.
19.  The total equity investment of CDC at any time should not exceed the
aggregate amount of its paid-up share capital and reserves.
20.  CDC., with a view to accelerate economic growth and promote capital
market, will try through all possible means to help facilitate the
marketing of industrial securities and to broaden the ownership of the
enterprises it assists, and will cooperate with other financial
institutions if circumstances require.

projects meriting exceptional consideration.
22.  In view of the inherent risk involved in long-term industrial financing,
CDC will exercise prudence in incurring debt so as to maintain at aIl
times a well-balanced financial structure.
Accounting and Auditing
23. CDC will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its business
operations and affairs in accordance with the generally accepted
accounting principle and standards. CDC will engage chartered public
accountant to audit its books and accounts.

income before tax and an appropriate amount of additional reserves,
designed to strengthen the Corporation's equity.
