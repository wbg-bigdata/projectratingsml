MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recomendation on a proposed loan of
US$100.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 20 years
maturity including a grace period of five years, and would help finance a
Small and Medium Industrial Enterprise Project. The project's technical
assistance component would be funded by a Japanese government grant and a
ccombination of a grant and loan from the Netherlands government.
2.       Background.  The Gov6rnment of Indonesia's industrial strategy of the
1970s and early 1980s was characterized byt (a) a strong inward orientation;
(b) a high degree of Government regulation and intervention; (c) massive
investment by the government in large enterprises; and (d) a strong bias
towards large-scale enterprises. Recognizing the need to adjust this strategy
in the fa-e of a sharply altered external environment, starting in the
mid-1980s, the Government embarked on a major program of trade and industrial
policy reform. The aim is to create a more dynamic and competitive non-oil
economy, with the private sector taking a lead in industrial investment and in
exports. As experience has shown in the more successful industrializing
countries, small and medium industrial enterprises (SMIEs)1 will play a major
role in securing those objectives. In Indonesia, SMIEs comprise about 11,000
privately-owned enterprises concentrated in urban areas, generally in
labor-intensive activities and working under highly competitive conditions in
industrial subsectors receiving negative or low effective protection. The
continuing policy reforms under way in import licensing and deregulation of
raw material prices and quotas have created a climate conducive to the
efficient development of SMIEs, if their financing needs are met and if they
can enhance their competitiveness through access to technology. The proposed
project would help meet these needs using credit and technical assistance
arrangements designed in the light of the Bank's experience in Implementing
three previous Small Enterprise Development Projects and a rural credit
project. Three of the Bank Group's 15 operations in Indonesia's industrial
sector consisted of the Small Enterprise Development Projects (SEDP I, II and
III), which targeted the risky, very small (3 employees per enterprise) family
enterprises with no credit experience. Although the projects helped the
Government generate employment at lower costs, the SEDP credit operations did
not achieve their policy and institutional development objectives due to:
below market interest rates; insufficient spreads to intermediaries; and an
overly generous credit insurance scheme. The technical assistance (TA) system
used for SEDP was costly, ineffective and based on foreign consultants
developing project profiles and demonstration projects for family enterprises.
In contrast, the rural credit project, Kredit Umum Pedesan (KUPEDES) has shown
that access to term financing at market rates is valued by small scale
1/ Industrial enterprises with operating assets of less than $500,000 and
employees ranging from 20 to 150.



- 2 -
borrowers. The proposed project design reflects the lessons learned from the
SEDP and KUPEDES experience by offering market rate credit to the medium scale
SHIEs with all credit risk taken by the participating financial
intermediaries.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed pro4ect would enable
the Bank to support further the Government's initiatives in promoting
increased manufacturing output, employment generation and non-oil export
income. The Bank's strategy in supporting efficient industrial growth in
Indonesia has had two major and complementary components. The first component
-- general, sector-neutral, financial support for efficiency-enhancing policy
reforms -- has been supported through two Trade Policy Adjustment Loans. The
second component targeted financial and technical assistance to enhance
sectoral and subsectoral supply responses to the reform measures. The two
Export Development Projects (EDP and EDP II), an upcoming series of Industrial
Restructuring Projects (IRPs), and the proposed project, are designed to be
complementary. The EDP operations were designed to elicit a supply response
mainly from comparatively large export-oriented enterprises by increasing the
supply of both term finance and services from export-supporting
infrastructure. The planned IRPs will assist primarily larger enterprises in
subsectors adapting to the changed incentives stemming from fundamental policy
change. The delivery of industrial finance and technical assistance to SMIEs
cannot be organized at the subsectoral level, because such firms are dispersed
across manufacturing industries. They are also too numerous and too small to
be subject to individual, firm-level, attention. Yet, by being mostly in
private sector, lean and flexible, the SMIEs should have a greater propensity
tc respond both to policy reform measures and to the expanded availability of
industrial finance and technical services. The proposed project is therefore
designed to augment such a broadly-based supply response through increased
efficiency in the delivery of industrial finance and technical services.
4.       Prolect Obiectives.  By providing high quality, cost-effective
technical assistance and term credit at market rates, the project would help
develop the SMIE sector, demonstrating its potential (as responsive
entrepreneurs and creditworthy bank clients) to respond to new opportunities,
to plan and implement their investment and operational strategies, and to
modernize, expand and diversify, thereby increasing manufacturing output and
jobs. The secondary objectives would be: to develop the capacity of the local
consulting industry to offer cost-effective, quality technical services to
local manufacturing enterprises; and to enhance the financial system's
capacity for analyzing and managing investment flnancing.
5.       Proiect Description.  The project comprises two components: an
investment credit component and a technical assistance (TA) component. Term
credit at market rates channeled through 13 participating banks (PBs),
comprising four state-owned coumercial banks, four private banks, two national
development banks and three regional development banks, would support
approximately 700 subprojects requiring an estimated total investment of
US$179 million. A central TA Unit located in the Indonesian Banking
Development Institute (LPPI) would screen, pre-qualify and monitor the work of
mostly local consultants, who would assist enterprises in working up
investment proposals, providing access to technology and solving operational
problems. A network of TA regional representatives in the provinces would
assist SMIEs in defining their investment and operational needs, locating



- 3 -
local consultants and reviewing their work. The TA component would also share
in the cost of enterprise-level consulting services. Investments financed by
PBs would have the shared TA ,osts financed and returned to a revolving TA
Fund. The project's investment credit and technical assistance would support
SMIE activities in the manufacturing secto, including agro-based industries,
related services and transportation.
6.       The financing plan for each component would be as followss
-   For the US$179 million investment credit component, SMIE owners
would contribute about US$54 million of their own funds to
provide equity averaging approximately 302 of total subproject
costs. The balance of the funding would be provided from the
proceeds of the Bank loan and from PB funds, on an 802 Bank
(US$100 million), 202 PB (US$25 million) basis. The Bank loan
would cover the overall estimated 542 foreign exchange cost.
-   For the technical assistance component, SMIEs applying for
assistance would contribute US$5.1 million, equivalent to about
372 of the overall costs of the component. The project's share
in the financing of individual, enterprise-level consultant
assignments would be limited to the lesser of US$10,000 or 602 of
the cost of each assignment. The Japan Grant Facility (JGF),
with the Bank as Administrator, would establish a TA Fund (US$1.6
million) that would provide the project's share of funding for
enterprise-level consulting assistance on a revolving basis. In
addition, the JGF would also fund the project's training (US$0.4
million) and studies (US$0.2 million) requirements, as well as an
Appraisal Advisor and staff in LPPI (US$0.9 million). Financing
from the Government of the Netherlands (a combination of grant
and loan funds totalling US$6.1 million) would fund: LPPI's
incremental operating costs for hosting the TA function; regional
representative's expenses; and all costs of the expatriate
consultants and necessary vehicles and equipment.
7.       The spread (currently about 6X) between the Bank's rate and the
relending rate from the Government to the PBs would compensate the Government
for bearing the foreign exchange risk. This resultant spread is comparable to
the current 7.82 swap rate (LIBOR - Rupiah deposit indexed) offered by Bank
Indonesia for up to three-year foreign exchange (US dollar) contracts.
Subproject appraisals would follow a methodology agreed with the Bank, which
would also include a review of the environmental impact, and proposed
environmental safeguards, where appropriate, of all above-free-limit
subprojects. Procurement would be based on existing procedures of the PBs,
which require sponsors to justify procurement decisions on the basis of
competitive quotations. The estimated project costs and the financing plan
are given in Schedule A. The disbursement schedule is provided in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations
in the Republic of Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7595-IND is being distributed separately.



- 4-
8.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government on (a) criteria for the PBs' initial and continued eligibility
for project funds; (b) the terms and conditions for the on-lending of funds to
the PBs and to qualified sub-borrowere, including the requirement of
environmental impact analyses for all above free-limit subloans; and (c) She
role and activities to be performed by LPPI in the project. Financing
arrangements for the technical assistance component were also agreed at
negotiations. Conditions of loan effectiveness include (a) the signing of
Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Government and BI and between the
Government and at least two of the four state-owned commercial banks
participati g in the project; and (b) the signing of all financing
arrangements related to the technical assistance component. Disbursement of
funds from the Bank loan would be contingent on the following actions: for
the private banks and UPPTNDO, the signing of On-lending Agreements with BI;
for the state commercial banks, regional development banks and BAPIND0, the
signing of Subsidiary Loan Agreements with the Ministry of Finance; and for
all participating banks, the maintenance of agreed minimum financial
performance criteria.
9.       Benefits and Risks.  The project would demonstrate the ability of
SMIEs, as an expanding segment of the industrial sector, to respond to
changing incentives and contribute to the growth of manufacturing output and
employment. The experience in other East Asian countries has shown that this
segment provides essential linkages with the larger industries and forms the
underpinnings for sustained industrial growth. The principal risk is that the
demand for credit and TA may not materialize as forecast. However, this is a
small risk because the projected credit demand reflects each PB's assessment
of its own SKIZ lending and is based on identified subprojects. The risk of
the demand for TA services falling below expectations is offset by the PBs'
requirements for high quality project proposals and the attractive
cost-sharing available to enterprises for consulting. Another potential risk
is that investment capital would be misallocated to highly protected and
uneconomic activities. Analysis indicates that this risk is small; the vast
majority of SMIEs are found in highly competitive subsectors with below
average or even negative effective protection.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
