KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           The Kyrgyz Republic
Beneficiary:        Kyrgyz Telecom
Amount:             SDR 12.8 Million, (US$ 18 million equivalent)
Terms:              35 years, including ten (10) years grace, at standard IDA terms
On-lending:         US$ 17.6 million will be on-lent to Kyrgyz Telecom  with an
amortization period of 20 years including a 5-year grace period with
capitalization of interest. Funds will be on-lent at IBRD's standard
variable interest rate. Kyrgyz Telecom will bear the foreign exchange
risk. The balance of the credit (US$ 400,000) would be passed to the
Ministry of Communications (MOC) for implementation of the Sector
Reform Program.
Project Objectives:    The Project objectives are to assist the Government in:  1) making
priority replacement/expansion investments in telecommunications to
improve the country's prospects economic growth and improve quality
of service;   2) building  institutional capacity  of the  main
telecommunications operator, particularly management and financial
analysis skills, and commercializing and corporatizing communication
activities; and 3) establishing a regulatory and policy framework for the
restructuring of the sector aimed at liberalizing and attracting private
sector investment to the sector.
Project             The project consists of three components. The first component,
Description:        Rehabilitation/Expansion  of the Telecommunications Network,
includes the implementation of a digital overlay network in high priority
demand areas for business subscribers and other economic agents. This
component will improve international access and service quality for the
overall network. The second component, Institutional Development,
includes assistance to the telecommunications operator (Kyrgyz Telecom)
to carry out institutional reforms.  The third component, Sector
Restructuring, provides assistance to the Ministry of Communications
to carry out the reform program and to train Ministry staff in regulation
and policy formulation.

Benefits:             All sectors of the Kyrgyz economy stand to benefit from  improved
communications. Telecommunications are a highly cost-effective and a
preferred substitute for physical transportation, particularly for long
distance and international links. Liberalization of key services along
with better access to a higher quality and variety of telecommunication
services will increase business productivity and competitiveness and
public sector efficiency, and will facilitate the provision of emergency
and social services.   Structural reform  will benefit the GOK  by
improving  the  sector's:    (a)  financial  performance;  (b)  user
responsiveness; (c) overall productivity; and (d) investment cost
effectiveness.
Risks:                MOC has initiated a telecommunications reform program. A major risk
of the project is that the MOC could unintentionally institute reforms or
issue licenses that are inconsistent with the long run interests of the
sector. To reduce this risk, assistance under an on-going PPF and the
planned project will assist the MOC to: (a) complete the design of and
implement the reform program; and (b) secure advice on potential
licenses or arrangements which could materially impact sector
development.    A  second  risk  is  continued  loss  of qualified
telecommunication managers and technical staff due to uncompetitive
compensation, which could jeopardize the operational and financial
performance of the telecommunications operator. To reduce this risk,
agreements to give the operator commercial autonomy, authority to set
competitive salaries, and reform tariffs were reached with the GOK
during appraisal. High inflation presents a third potential risk. Tariff
reforms for international and FSU call charges will include indexation to
the US dollar effectively to hedge against inflation and ensure financial
viability.
Environment:          More efficient use of telecommunications will substitute for personal and
business transport - thus reducing environmental pollution and promoting
energy conservation. Given the existing infrastructure, only internal
construction will be required in this project. This project has been rated
as a "C' project category, with no environmental risks.

1. THE MACROECONOMIC SETTING
A. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
1.1      The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, remote, land-locked, and mountainous country, is one of the
poorest members of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Until 1992, its population of 4.5 million people
was highly dependent on FSU trade, with 95 % of its exports and 85 % of its total imports with the FSU.
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the elimination of subsidies from Moscow, the Kyrgyz
economy has undergone significant decline, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) falling by 19% in 1992
and by 18% in 1993. To combat the economic decline, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (GOK)
has undertaken a broad-based economic reform program aimed at: (a) stabilizing of the economy; (b)
encouraging export oriented economic growth; (c) privatizing state enterprises; and (d) creating an
enabling environment for private sector development and promotion of direct investments.  In its
economic reform program, the GOK recognizes that economic development, particularly in sectors such
as agriculture, industry, and trade (35%, 30%, and 10% of GDP, respectively), are key to the Republic's
economic growth.
B. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
1.2      The IBRD/IDA Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Kyrgyz Republic was presented to
the Board in the context of the Rehabilitation Credit in May 1993. Based on a strong reform scenario,
the CAS set forth a program of policy advice, technical assistance, economic and sector work, and
lending to support the following key objectives: (i) macroeconomic stabilization through balance of
payments support; (ii) structural reforms covering privatization, enterprise and financial sector reforms,
and private sector development; (iii) an effective social safety net; (iv) sectoral reforms through
operations in agriculture, infrastructure, mining, and environment; and (v) institution building and
reinforcement of the Govermnent's implementation capacity. While priority has been placed on helping
stabilize the economy and deepening the structural reform effort, the Bank is increasingly exploring
possibilities for simple investment projects that can help induce a supply response in the productive
sectors. The telecommunications project will be the first such operation in the Kyrgyz Republic and is
fully consistent with the strategy laid out in the CAS. Two additional operations for the Kyrgyz Republic
have already been negotiated.  A proposed Privatization and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit
(PESAC) which supports privatization, enterprise restructuring and private sector development will be
presented for Board consideration in late June 1994. A proposed Social Safety Net Project, which helps
ensure the provision of an effective and adequate social safety net, will be presented to the Board in early
FY95.

II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
2.1       The state of the telecommunications sector in the Kyrgyz Republic and a proposed plan for its
improvement are presented in this and the following chapters. Chapter II summarizes the sector's
performance as of the date of appraisal in meeting customer demand, its technical capacity, and the
quality of service provided. It also provides an outline and discussion of issues related to the sector
organization and its ability to provide telecommunication services effectively in the future. The structures
and processes within the existing telecommunications operations are also discussed and issues that need
to be addressed to carry out the reformns proposed are reviewed. Chapter III describes the World
Bank/IDA's role and strategy for assisting in telecommnunications sector reform. Chapter IV outlines the
Government's strategy for reforming the sector along market oriented lines. Chapter V details a proposed
Project to support the GOK's telecommunication reform efforts, followed by an analysis of the Project's
financial and economic viability in Chapter VI. Chapter VII specifies issues and agreements to be
reached during the processing of the Project.
A. SECTOR PERFORMANCE - MEETING CUSTOMER DEMAND
2.2      Prior to the break-up of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) telecommunications development was
planned and managed in Moscow. Consistent with the Soviet centrally planned historical development
objectives, the telecommunication infrastructure in terms of total telephone lines and base
telecommunications infrastructure (buildings, access roads, towers, etc.) is reasonably impressive given
the population size and GDP per capita.  With regard to guality of service, international access, and
network dimensioning, however, the performance is extremely poor. As a country seeking to establish
an economy that: (a) is independent; and (b) relies on export oriented growth, the quality of service
(particularly for business subscribers) and international access are critical constraints that must be
overcome as quickly as possible. Redimensioning of the entire network, however, even under the best
of circumstances, will take many years. Details of the sector's performance in terms of demand, existing
facilities, and quality of service are outlined below.
Demand for Services
2.3      The total estimated demand at the end of 1992 was roughly 430,400 main telephone lines for
a population of 4.48 million. This represents the sum of lines connected (333,600 in 1994, 326,718 in
1992), the estimated waiting list (80,000)1/, and a rough estimation of suppressed demand, defined
as demand not expressed by customers because they are in areas not yet served or without immediate
expansion possibility (20,000). The waiting list is composed primarily of residential subscribers.
Demand is expected to be stable in the 1994 and 1995 period as the economy shifts from public to private
sector activities, and then to grow by approximately 3-5% per annum in 1996 and 1997 (see Graph 2-1
and Annex 2-1 for details).
1/       The official waiting list of 100,000 residential subscribers is expected to fall by at least 20% in the
short term as tariffs are rationalized and raised in real terms in the next 2-3 years.

Existing Facilities
2.4      Subscriber Capacity. As of January 1, 1994, telephones are available to 333,600 subscribers
or about 7.4 of every 100 people.2/ Seventy-two percent of these lines are installed in 100 urban
exchanges and 28% are in 473 rural exchanges. Under 25% of the installed lines are in business and
government agencies. The exchange fill of 85% is high and leaves little room for expansion without
additional capital investment. Annex 2-2 provides details by region on installed and connected subscriber
capacity for business and residential subscribers.
2.5      Intemational and Long Distance Network. The most severe disadvantage of the existing
facilities is their limited international (and FSU) access. Automatic international access is available for
only a small number of subscribers (less than 100) who are connected through a satellite link to the
Turkish PTT's Ankara international exchange. This gateway (System 12, manufactured in Turkey) has
240 trunk circuits and 2000 subscriber lines. Due to technical incompatibilities with the Kyrgyz analogue
network, this gateway, as currently configured, is inadequate to meet customer demand. Consequently,
the majority of outgoing international traffic is handled through operator assisted calls via Moscow or
Ankara, which typically take 3 to 10 hours to place. This wait is unacceptable for business subscribers.
2/       This compares with 15 in Russia, 11 in Kazakhstan, 0.7 in China, and an OECD average
of 45.



5
2.6      Incoming calls can also be routed through Ankara or Moscow. Limited operational access
points through these two gateways substantially reduce the call completion rate (see paras. 2.13 and 2.14).
Depending on the decision of Moscow operating staff, as few as 20 international circuits can be allocated
for Kyrgyz traffic through the Russian international gateway. Thirty out of 120 satellite channels are
operational through Ankara. The Kyrgyz traffic appears to be treated by these foreign counterparts in
a way that rarely takes into account the needs of the Kyrgyz Republic operator. An international
exchange that is compatible with the local network and has a minimum of 500 trunk channels is urgently
required as well as a new satellite earth station with approximate capacity of 300 circuits.
2.7      The national infrastructure of microwave links is comparatively well designed (63 stations with
existing buildings, power supply, towers, and masts) due to previous investments in the network. See
Annex 2-3 for details on transmission capacity and type. Much of this infrastructure can be utilized when
implementing a new digital overlay network, thus substantially reducing the capital investment required.
2.8      Additional disadvantages that complicate the future modernization and extension of
telecommunications in the Republic are the poor network design3/ and the use of technical standards
that do not comply with existing international standards (signalling interfaces, terminal equipment,
hardware design, etc.).
2.9      Local Network. More than half of the local network equipment has reached the end of its
economic life of 20 years or more, with constant disruptions and parts badly in need of replacement. In
particular, "step by step" and "cross-bar" switches that were manufactured in the FSU and COMECON
countries are obsolete and unreliable. This has resulted from a constant shortage of cables and other
spare parts to maintain the network. The local network cables need urgent replacement. The shortage
of spare parts will be partially remedied through the Rehabilitation Credit (CR 2491-KYR) provisions.
2.10     Public Call Offices (Pay Phones). The lack of reliable pay phones (4,570 installed and more
than half permanently out of order) creates a particular disadvantage to the revenue generating capacity
of the network. Coin pay phones are currently utilizing tokens (in Bishkek) or are free of charge in other
cities. High inflation leading to operating cost increases makes it uneconomic to maintain this equipment.
Refitting of the pay phones to accept higher coinage is also considered uneconomic. Possible alternatives,
which may be cheaper for technical reasons, such as tokens or magnetic cards, need to be investigated.
2.11     Data Transmission. There is no reliable means for data transfer in the existing public network
(i.e., no X.25 packet switched or circuit switched networks, partly because these technologies were not
used in the FSU for civil needs, and partly because of COCOM restrictions on imports of such
equipment. A comprehensive demand survey for such services will be carried out as part of the Master
Plan4/ development in order to provide reliable information for decision making. The provision of
data services could be expanded through liberalization of the sector to allow for private providers.
3/       The network was originally developed as a low-level regional network without proper regard for
local needs and priorities. In addition, numerous technology resource constraints prevented the
achievement of higher quality design.
4/       This Master Plan (MP) comprises the long term development strategy of the telecommunications
network in the Kyrgyz Republic for the next 15 or 20 years. The MP will be prepared as a result of
TA provided by the Kuwait Fund.



6
2.12     Telex.  The existing telex network has a modest capacity (only 70 subscribers), a
comparatively stable performance, and a service quality generally better than that of the telephone
network. There is no international telex switch, however, and currently all international traffic is handled
through the Moscow international telex gateway (AXB 20 - ERICSSON) through which 183 countries
are accessible via 4 circuits to the Kyrgyz Republic. The local gentex network is run together with the
subscriber capacity on a small telex switch PTSK (Russian manufacturer). The majority of the telex
terminals used are very old and were manufactured in the former Czechoslovakia, FSU, and East
Germany. This network can be expected to continue operation during the modernization of the network.
Ouality of Service
2.13     The poor quality of service available to business subscribers is one of the main network
constraints to meeting customer demand.  All indicators of service quality are below international
standards 5/.  Local, long distance, and international telephone service is congested, with call
completion rates of less than 30% versus 65% in well functioning networks. Businesses commonly
complain that telephone calls and faxes are garbled by noisy line conditions. There are approximately
50 faults per 100 subscribers/year, as compared with 20/100 in properly functioning networks. This rate
is indicative of the poor quality of outside plant facilities, particularly the large amount of open air wires
in both local and trunk networks. Poor quality is due not only to technical constraints, however, but also
to overall inefTcient operations management and lack of incentives to motivate maintenance personnel.
2.14     The lack of traffic measurement equipment makes precise measurement of service quality
difficult. Measurement equipment will be purchased under the proposed Project. Specific performance
targets which are being developed during the detailed engineering design will be introduced in the near
term to monitor and substantially improve service quality. The introduction of digital exchanges will
make it possible to monitor the performance quality of not only the new digital network but will provide
reliable data for the analog transmission and switching equipment performance. Based on the above,
new, efficient maintenance practices will be implemented.
B. SECTOR ORGANIZATION
Sector Management
2.15     Currently, the Ministry of Communications (MOC) is the principal government agency
responsible for establishing policies and regulations, and for carrying out telecommunications operations
in the Kyrgyz Republic.  The Ministry of Communications is administered by a Minister of
Communications, a First Deputy Minister (Posts), a Deputy Minister (Teleconmnunications) and six
regional Oblast Directors. The Minister, as part of the Government Cabinet, is appointed by the Prime
Minister with confirmation from Parliament. The Minister selects the Deputy Ministers subject to the
approval of the Prime Minister and Parliament. The Minister is authorized to appoint and terminate the
Oblast Directors.
51 International standards have been established by the International Telecommunications Union which are
cormnonly used throughout the world.



7
2.16     The Minister has authority to develop programs and procure major items. Investment and
financing decisions taken by the MOC that include a Government guarantee require approval from the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Committee on Foreign Investment (GOSKOMINVEST). The
MOC has authority to determine conditions of employment of Ministry staff.
Sector Functions
2.17     Historically, policies governing the telecommunications sector were made in Moscow and were
carried out locally by the MOC. The MOC has begun to establish a policy making capability that is
market oriented and independent from telecom operations. The existing telecommunications laws,
however, were enacted to support a centrally planned economy and thus have impeded the reform
process. Regulatory functions, also carried out by the MOC, are limited in scope. Current functions
include tariff setting and basic frequency management. As of November 1, 1993, the MOC was given
authority to set all business and most tariffs for state budget enterprises. Approval from the State
Committee on Prices (SCOP) is required for reserved state budget enterprises and domestic long distance
residential call charges and residential installation and monthly rental. Enhanced capabilities to regulate
in a market economy are required.
2.18     The Ministry of Communications has the right to provide all public international and domestic
telecommunication services in the Republic. The MOC is also responsible for radio, broadcasting, postal,
postal banking, and money transfers. Until very recently, no private users had been licensed to operate
telecommunication or radio facilities. A license was provided in 1992 to a cellular company to operate
domestic mobile communications. Subscriber terminal equipment (e.g., telephones, faxes, PABX's) has
recently begun to be provided by private suppliers. A private firm is providing data and electronic
communication facilities. No telecommunication manufacturing capabilities exist in the Republic. The
current sector structure where policy, regulation, and operations for all communication functions are
carried out by a common pool of individuals and where decision making is highly centralized inhibits the
efficiency and profitability of the sector. This structure is inconsistent with market oriented sector
operations and consequently requires substantial reform.
Post
2.19     The MOC is the monopoly provider of postal services in the Kyrgyz Republic. Six regional
Directors and the Bishkek postmaster oversee postal offices in 40 districts and approximately 900 local
post offices. Day-to-day management is generally decentralized with key decisions made by the Ministry
headquarters. Post and telecommunications staff, physical facilities, and other resources are shared.
2.20     There is no long term development plan for the postal sector. Postal services are currently
loss-making operations, primarily due to tariff changes that have not kept pace with inflation. Postal
activities will seek to be self-financing after the recent split of posts and telecommunication functions in
March, 1994. It was agreed at negotiations that during the course of this project, KT will not make any
transfers to the Postal Department or the MOC for the benefit of the Postal Department.

C. TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATIONS
Organization and Management
2.21     The MOC headquarters staff and six regional Oblast Directors are responsible for day-to-day
management of telecommunications operations.  The current management team  is well versed in
management under a system of central planning where decision making was, and is, highly centralized.
Monthly management meetings are held by the Minister to coordinate activities. All key decisions,
however, have traditionally been taken by the Minister. Management has begun to be exposed to market
oriented management practices only very recently. Reforms to increase the autonomy of the operator are
required, particularly the corporatization of the telecommnunications functions and the provision of a
license.
2.22     A review of the operating activities within the Ministry highlights four major institutional
constraints to effective operations in a market economy:
(a)  vertical integration of comnmunications operations;
(b)  organizational problems;
(c)  lack of management and staff skilled in operating in a market economy; and
(d)  lack of a commercial orientation, including problems with billing and collections,
management systems and computerization, accounting and auditing.
Vertical Integration
2.23     The telecommunications operations are vertically integrated; policy, regulatory and operations
functions are all done in-house and are linked together (see paras 2.17, 2.18 above). Key decisions for
all activities are taken by a few  individuals in the Ministry.  Political rather than commercial
considerations are frequently the basis for decision making, thus inhibiting the efficiency and profitability
of operations. Under the telecommunications reform program, the Ministry intends to split policy and
regulatory functions from operations and to establish a separate telecommunications corporation, thus
encouraging a commercial rather than political decision making process.
Organizational Problems
2.24     The MOC currently carries out a number of communication activities.  The First Deputy
Minister oversees operations for postal, money transfers, and other communications functions, and the
Second Deputy Minister oversees public telecommunications activities. Nine associations and twelve
enterprises, each of which is accountable to the MOC, carry out day to day communications activities.
Key telecommunications enterprises include the National Center of Trunk & International
Communications, National Production of TV & Radio Relay Trunk Lines, and six Regional Post Offices
(Oblasts). Fifty-nine divisions (fifty-seven of which are district post offices) report to the six Oblasts.
See the Organization Chart in Annex 2-4 for details.



9
2.25     Within the Ministry headquarters and the Regional Oblasts, administrative and operations
departments support all communications functions - whether telecommunications, postal, money transfer,
or broadcasting - from a common pool of staff. This structure substantially limits management's ability
to improve the efficiency and profitability of each communications function (i.e., telecommunications)
and product service (i.e., long distance telephony).
2.26     As a first step towards the split of posts and telecommunications, separate financial accounts
are being prepared as of January 1, 1994. A new, streamlined, consumer oriented organization structure
needs to be introduced when the entities are established. New systems and processes also need to be
introduced to support the new  structures.  The MOC  will encourage the newly established
telecommnunications and postal entities to concentrate on their core functions of operating
telecommunications and postal activities, respectively, and to transfer functions such as construction,
printing, and employee guest houses to the private sector. This change will facilitate, in phase three (see
para 4.3), the introduction of private sector investment into the new telecommunications corporation.
Staffinm
2.27     MOC staff numbered 14,300 as of January 1, 1992 (see Annex 2-5). Though employees
frequently support more than one functional activity, rough estimates indicate that 7,925 staff worked in
postal activities, 5,605 in telecommunications, and 770 in radio and television broadcasting and other
activities. Managers and supervisors numbered 213, professional and technical staff 3,259, and
employees 10,827. By June, 1993, the number of staff had fallen to 13,200. An estimated 3,500 staff
supported telecommunications activities on January 1, 1994. The density of 11 telecommunications staff
per 1000 telephone lines is not unreasonable when compared to other countries with similar networks.
The proposed Project would add only a marginal number of working lines and thus would not result in
a major change in the telephone density index. The main causes for the fall in staffing are: (i) a
requirement by the Kyrgyz Government that the telecommunications sector be self-financing; and (ii)
a dramatic outflow of technical and professional staff who are leaving the country or moving to the
private sector due to uncompetitive telecommunications salaries. The sustained loss of skilled staff
jeopardizes the efficient operation of the telecommunications network. Prior to Appraisal, the MOC
raised technical and professional salaries to competitive levels (on average, between October 93 and
February 94, salaries were more than doubled). The new telecommunications operator will have
authority to maintain and adjust these salaries as required.
Training
2.28     MOC managerial and professional staff have been trained in universities in the former Soviet
Union to operate telecommunication facilities under a system of central planning. Technical staff have
primarily been educated in technical universities to operate telecommunications networks according to
Soviet standards. There are no managers skilled in planning, managing, and operating in a market
oriented environment or operating a digital network conforming with international standards. In addition,
there is an increasing shortage of managers and planners skilled in operating the existing analogue
network. The main causes for this shortage include: (i) the dissolution of the Soviet Union (skilled
planners and managers stationed in Moscow are no longer responsible for telecommunications in the
Kyrgyz Republic), and (ii) the large-scale exodus of ethnic Russians and Germans. Training is urgently
required in management, planning, finance and accounting, marketing and customer service, engineering,
and human resource development for telecommunications and postal staff.  At negotiations, the
components of a training program were agreed [para 7.1 (b) (i)].



10
Billin2 & Collections
2.29      Telephone monthly rental charges are fixed, and include an unlimited number of local calls of
any length. Detailed billing is done only for domestic long distance, FSU-international, and international
calls. Billing information for international services is produced monthly at the National Center of Trunk
& International Comrnmunications via a recently developed computerized system 6/ and sent by mail
to the Regional Oblasts. The computer based system has few audit controls and is vulnerable to manual
modifications of data. International and long distance billing data are manually consolidated as computer
printouts in binders and sent to the District offices for subscriber review at the postal banks The billing
system is only partially computerized, is inflexible and cannot easily accommodate price changes, and
can produce cumulative bills only by individual telephone number (not subscribers). As a priority, a new
computerized, commercial billing system should be introduced. It was confirmed at negotiations that a
billing system will be installed [para 7.1 (b) (iii)].
2.30      Subscribers pay monthly rental fees one month in advance and then have 15 days to pay call
charges. Historically, collection rates had exceeded 99%. By the third quarter of 1993, due to high
inflation, collection rates had fallen to approximately 90%. In September, 1993, the MOC introduced
stringent collection policies where subscriber access to international and long distance calling is
immediately frozen for non-payment, and subscribers are disconnected according to a strict time schedule
depending on the amount owed by the subscriber. Disconnections carried out in September included
business, state budget, and residential subscribers.  However, the generally deteriorated economic
situation has led to a sharp increase in overdue bills, which is difficult for the telecommunications
operator to handle.
Accountinu
2.31      The MOC produces consolidated profit and loss accounts and a balance sheet for all activities
under the Ministry based primarily on practices established under the former Soviet system. Selected
changes have been introduced in each of the past four years, making comparison of accounts across years
difficult. In addition, the system is quite different from international standards and involves a
combination of "cash" and "accrual" methods that do not necessarily portray the true financial position
of the Ministry. The current accounting practices make it difficult to assess the operating performance
and the overall financial position of the Ministry's activities. Further, accounts for telecommunications
and postal operations are prepared by region and district and later consolidated at the central level, rather
than by function; consequently, consolidated detailed accounts for telecommunications are not available.
Staff often perform tasks for more than one function and therefore splitting out administrative and
overhead costs are difficult. It was agreed that internationally accepted financial and accounting systems
and practices would be introduced as an essential feature to attract private investment [para 7.1 (b) (v)].
6/        This system was developed on the MOC's initiative as a temporary measure until a new billing
system could be implemented. The system is not adequate to handle the billing and collections
functions for all telecommunication activities.

Management Systems and Computerization
2.32     There is a lack of computerized or manual systems that can provide meaningful management
information appropriate for operating in a commercial environment. Detailed statistics are, however, kept
for a variety of technical and operational information. A review of the priority management and
operational information and computerization requirements will be carried out under the proposed project
(para. 5.3).
Auditing
2.33     There are no statutory audits performed in the MOC. Tax inspections (compliance audits) are
done annually to ensure that accurate tax payments are made to the Government. Limited internal audit
mechanisms currently exist in the MOC. At negotiations, the MOC agreed to appoint external financial
auditors acceptable to IDA [para 7.1 (f)].

III. BANK/IDA STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE
Bank Strategy in Telecommunications
3.1      The telecommunications sector has undergone dramatic changes in technology, markets, and
structure in developed and developing countries alike over the last decade. At the same time, the sector's
critical role in economic development in terms of productivity gains, social returns, and positive fiscal
impact has become universally acknowledged. Telecommunications is a strategic investment that is
necessary to maintain and develop competitive advantage at the national, regional, and firm level. In
addition to supporting key sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and financial services,
telecommunications plays a crucial role in the delivery of social services including human resource
development, health, government administration, agricultural extension, resource management, and
disaster relief.
3.2      The Bank's experience in this sector spans 125 loans totalling about US$5.6 billion in 56
countries. Experiences worldwide indicate that telecommunications operating entities perform best when
run as commercial businesses. Thus, the Bank/IDA's overall telecommunications strategy, calls for
shifting the role of Government from ownership and management to policy making and regulation.
Promoting telecommunications efficiency and quality is achieved through corporatization and
commercialization of telecommunication operations along with competitive provision of services, where
appropriate, and a greater role for the private sector.
3.3      To bring about this transformation requires increased emphasis on sectoral reform in addition
to traditional agency-based institution-building and investments in capital infrastructure - a demanding and
lengthy process. The sequence of reform varies among countries. The extent and pace of reform depend
on practical limits within the country, including the country legal framework, the political system and
institutions, the degree to which markets are developed, and existence of a regulatory capability. A
different mix of interventions are appropriate depending on the stage of sector development. As indicated
in the Bank's telecommunications strategy, in a category one country, such as the Kyrgyz Republic, with
low quality telecommunication facilities and a rigid sector policy, there is typically virtually no access
to private capital and markets are closed to new entrants. Thus major reforms are needed to begin to
open the sector to new entrants and to create an appropriate regulatory environment. Typically, private
entrants can most readily be introduced in the provision of cellular communications services and non-basic
telecommunication services (customer premise equipment, value-added services, etc.).
3.4      In a category two country, the telecommunications sector is in transition, with some but not
sufficient private investment, a policy framework exists but is not yet adequate, and there are substantial
barriers to entry. Thus, while sector reform has begun, it has a long way to go. In a category three
country, there is a liberal telecommunications sector policy and competition exists, thus allowing for a
substantial private capital flow to the sector.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.5      This will be the first Bank/IDA telecommunications operation in the Kyrgyz Republic and the
FSU. The Bank/IDA's role is to help the sector in its reform efforts, to promote competition, where
appropriate, and to reduce direct Government involvement in the provision of telecommunication services.



14
IDA involvement in this operation would help ensure success in: (a) implementing the sector reform
program (thus creating an environment that over time will permit private entry); (b) building institutional
capacity; and (c) determining a financially justified investment plan and a sound strategy for overall
financial viability. IDA involvement would also catalyze other donor financing and lead to increased
private sector participation in the longer term.
3.6      Depending on the pace of reform within the sector as well as the country overall, future
Bank/IDA operations could include assistance to reduce the Government's involvement in the delivery
of telecommunications services further (possibly through private investment in the main
telecommunications operator) and enhancing the development of a regulatory and policy framework (see
para. 4.3 - Phase Three). In the event that sufficient commercial investment resources are not available
to develop the telecommunications infrastructure, additional investment lending may be required in
priority areas.
Lessons from Experience
3.7      Bank/IDA's telecommunications experience world-wide indicates four key lessons:
(a)  as the Kyrgyz Republic moves to a market economy, the telecommunications sector
development objectives must shift from subsidized coverage of households to meeting
economic demand at prices that fully recover costs;
(b)  substantial improvement in sector performance will not be achieved without a clear policy
and sound regulatory framework to change the business environment within the sector
and country and incentives for improved performance (fundamentally).
(c)  restructuring government departments is complex and requires adequate time to introduce
change and expert management of the reform process; and
(d)  key decisions that materially affect implementation should be agreed during Project
preparation.
3.8      Experiences from the past two years of involvement in the Kyrgyz Republic and elsewhere in
the FSU indicate the following guiding principles:
(a)  Realistic Expectations: the pace of reform must be realistically set and must take into
account the macroeconomic and political realities within the Republic and the absorptive
capacity of the country and sector;
(b)  Government Ownership of Projects: Successful Project implementation requires clear
commitment and understanding by the implementing officials to the goals of the Project
and the method of implementation. This is particularly important in Technical Assistance
projects that do not offer immediate, investment benefits; and
(c)  Portfolio Management: In large part, successful projects require adequate commitment
of resources from the Government and IDA to plan and oversee implementation of the
project.

IV. SECTOR RESTRUCTURING STRATEGY
4.1  The MOC, in consultation with IDA, has developed a strategy for the telecommunications sector
to address the constraints outlined in Chapter II. The MOC's strategy has been confirmed in a letter of
Sector Policy (see Annex 4-1).
A. POLICY OBJECTIVES
4.2  The MOC has identified near, medium, and long term policy objectives. In the near term (one to
two years), the policy objective is to stabilize operations of the existing network and prevent further
deterioration of the quality of service. In the medium term (three to four years) the policy objectives are
to ensure that:
(a) demand from business and other priority subscribers for international, interregional, and
domestic telecommunication services is met;
(b) telecommunication services are provided to subscribers efficiently and on a timely basis;
(c) competitively priced telecommunication services are provided to customers while allowing for
a reasonable rate of return for operators/investors; and
(d) customer choice in the provision of key telecommunication services is extended.
In the long term (five years and beyond), the MOC long term objectives are to ensure that competitively
priced, reasonable quality telecommunications services are provided to meet customer demand fully.
B. SECTOR REFORM STRATEGY
4.3  The Government's reform strategy has three phases.
Phase One, which is already underway, is to begin to improve the sector finances and stabilize
existing network operations with the support of an IDA Rehabilitation Credit (approved on May
13, 1993), which included a US$ 5.5 million component to purchase critical spare parts. This
component was subsequently reduced to US$ 2 million because of other urgent Government
funding requirements.
Phase Two, which has begun and will continue to be implemented over the next three to four
years, mandates: (a) meeting customer demand for priority subscribers who will promote economic
growth in other sectors; (b) introducing further market oriented sector reform particularly with
respect to cost recovery; and (c) promoting institutional reform of the main telecommunications
operator to ensure it is operated commercially. Details of the reform strategy are outlined in
Section C, "Sector and Institutional Reform: Implementation of Phase II" below.



16
Phase Three, which will be carried out in the longer term and thus is not part of the proposed IDA
Project, would be to continue liberalization of non-basic services, continue sector reform, and to
privatize and/or introduce competition in basic services.
C. SECTOR AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM: IMPLEMENTATION OF PHASE II
MeetinL Customer Demand
4.4  The MOC has identified a capital investment program (see Chapter V) to provide the Kyrgyz
Republic's key businesses and economic agents with quality telecommunications services to meet their
priority needs. These subscribers will pay world price equivalents for these services. The proposed
Project (see para 6.4 - 6.6) would be carried out by the recently created corporation (March, 1994)
Kyrgyz Telecom, and would provide for an overlay network of some 40,000 new telephone lines, which
would be of digital technology and whose cost per line would be the current international cost per line
for a marginal expansion (around US$800 per line). The existing 333,000 lines are of analog technology,
and are completely depreciated. At current tariffs, Telecom is only receives around US$17 per line per
year, compared with US$300 to US$500 per line required to maintain a network. Additionally, under
the existing depressed economic situation, most customers cannot afford to pay international tariff levels.
Therefore, the Project approach is to provide the new overlay network only to those subscribers (mainly
business) who can afford and need access to a modern telecommunications network. Paragraphs 6.4 to
6.6 discuss the proposed new tariffs system where customers of the existing analog network will continue
paying very small rates for local and domestic long distance calls, while customers of the new digital
network will pay rates similar to international levels, which are related to the investment and maintenance
costs of the new digital network.
Reform at the Sectoral Level
4.5   The sector restructuring strategy consists of the following elements:
(a) establishing an appropriate framework for policy and regulation of the sector including
(i)  separation of regulatory and policy functions from telecommunication and other
communication operating functions;
(ii)  establishment of a regulatory body, separate from policy making functions, to regulate
the telecommunications sector;
(iii) strengthening of the commercial autonomy and accountability of telecommunications
operator responsible for providing basic telephony services. This would include:
-  split of the telecommunication and postal operations into separate entities with
autonomy (March, 1994);
-  corporatization of the new telecommunications entity;



17
- provision of a license to the newly established telecomnmunications operator to
provide local, long-distance, and international telecommunication services and
establishment of interconnection agreements necessary to carry out their functions.
The timing for provision of the license, which will utilize the legal framework
established under a new telecommunications law, will be done in parallel to
preparation of the new law;
-  commercialization of the telecommunications operators' activities;
-  commercialization of posts as a separate public department; and
(b) promoting private sector participation and competition in the telecommunications sector,
including, as appropriate, partial or full liberalization of non-basic telecomrnunication market
segments.
These reforms will require the drafting of a new Telecommunications law and new regulations. The new
telecommunications structure that will be created as a result of these reforms is highlighted in Graph 4-1.

The scope and timing of the reform program will be agreed during negotiations.
4.6        Within the reform  program, the MOC will continue to be responsible for telecommunications
policy, subject to approval by the Government and the Parliament. Its other responsibilities will include:
(a) advising on the appointments of the members of the regulatory body; (b) liaising with the regulator;
(c) representing the Kyrgyz Government on the international level; (d) managing legislative matters when
changes are required; and (e) issuing licenses that will have a material impact on the sector. Technical
Assistance would be provided in Phase Two to establish this function and to train staff.
4.7        A  regulatory function will also be established (see para. 4.5 (a) (i)).  Given the lack of
indigenous expertise in regulation and the fledgling movement to a market economy, initial regulatory



19
functions will need to be quite focused. Functions will include: (a) tariff setting; (b) drafting licenses on
behalf of the Ministry; (c) monitoring operator performance and adherence to licenses; (d) advising and
arbitrating on interconnection arrangements between different operators; (e) ensuring all
telecommunications equipment conform to appropriate international technical standards; and (f) managing
radio frequency allocation and assignment.
4.8       The MOC commitment to the reform program is demonstrated by key reforms that have
already been undertaken. International call charges have been raised to world price equivalents and in
February, 1994, regulatory and policy functions were split from operations. A separate, state owned
corporation, Kyrgyz Telecom, was established in March, 1994 to provide telecommunications services
within the Kyrgyz Republic. A Director General for Kyrgyz Telecom has been identified and the key
elements of a new organization structure have been proposed (see Annex 4.3). As per decrees signed
by the President and the Prime Minister in February, 1994, all state owned corporations will be converted
into joint-stock companies. Kyrgyz Telecom is included in the list of corporations to be converted.
Reform at the Institutional Level - for Kvrayz Telecom
4.9      An important element of the reform program is to introduce commercial practices within
Kyrgyz Telecom  corporation and build management and planning capabilities.   An institutional
development program is being established to focus management and staff efforts on: (a) improving
customer satisfaction through the quality, cost, timeliness and variety of services offered; (b) increasing
the profitability of the products/services offered to customers; and (c) improving the efficiency of
products/services offered, eliminating non-value added activities. Specific steps include the following:
(a) implementing actions specified in the sector reform program including:
(i)  splitting post and telecommunication activities and assets;
(ii)  converting the telecommunication activities into a corporation (see para. 2.23);
(iii) establishing a license for the new company that will include conditions relating to
its service obligations, approval of its tariffs and interconnection agreements with
other entities, and its network development program;
(b) estanlishing a new corporate structure and business processes for telecommunication
activities (see para 2.24 and 2.25). Experts funded under PPF 847 - KG are/will be
providing advice on what type and how a commercial structure can be introduced;
(c)  establishing market oriented management practices. Technical assistance will be provided
under the Project to recruit advisors with international expertise to work with the
Director General and Financial Controller. In addition, a management information
system would be established to provide reliable, timely, and pertinent management
information;
(d)  providing the operator's Board and management with autonomy in staffing and salary
levels, thus enabling them to introduce a performance based incentive scheme and
increase salaries of key staff (para. 2.27). Management will be able to hire and release



20
staff without Government approval (according to rules established by the Corporation).
To ensure that management and staff efforts are properly focussed, Kyrgyz Telecom
management will be evaluated on key performance indicators and deliverables. The
incentive program will be directly related to achieving these deliverables and performance
targets by region.  Technical assistance will need to be provided to assist in the
development of a commercially oriented incentive scheme. In addition, the operator's
management will be authorized to propose tariff changes to the regulator;
(e)  building the company's financial viability through: (i) tariff and international account
settlement reform; (ii) better financial planning, management, and controls (particularly
audits) (paras. 2.25, 2.26, and 2.33); (iii) introducing a commercial accounting system
that would permit accounts to be prepared according to international standards and
provide a solid basis for a new framework of financial accountability (2.31); and (iv)
introducing a new billing system. Technical assistance will be required to assist the
corporation in introducing financial and audit controls and implementing new computer
systems;
(f)  establishing a customer service group that would be responsible for marketing, sales, and
customer support functions. Technical assistance and training will be required to help
introduce a customer service orientation into the corporation. Once a customer service
group has been established, an analysis of customer types and preferences should be
undertaken to include: (i) an analysis of the top 20% of revenue generating customers
and their level of receivables by region; and (ii) a survey of customers. This analysis
would be a first step toward better understanding and more effectively meeting customer
requirements;
(g)  enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the operators' operations by subcontracting
and/or divesting a range of activities to the private sector. These activities will include:
divestiture/privatization of installation of customer premise equipment and building
construction (para. 2.26);
(h) implementing a comprehensive training program (para. 2.28).
An implementation schedule of key institutional development activities is outlined in Table 4-3 below.

Technical Assistance
4.10      To support the MOC's reforn efforts effectively, an IDA Project Preparation Facility of US$
450,000 was provided to assist the MOC in: (a) finalizing the sector strategy and restructuring plan; (b)
carrying out detailed engineering and preparing procurement documents; and (c) evaluating specific
investment proposals as requested by the MOC. In addition, technical assistance is included in the Project
to help the MOC establish policy and regulatory capabilities and to corporatize the telecommunication
functions (see para. 4.5). Technical Assistance will also be required to transform the teleconmmunications
operations into a commercially viable company that is sustainable beyond the Project.



22
Tariff Regulation
4.11     The MOC has met the GOK's mandate to ensure that the communications sector is financially
viable, resulting in MOC being treated a self-financing unit inside the Kyrgyz Government and gaining
financial independence (outside the Fiscal Budget). Tariff levels, virtually constant from the early 1950's
to 1989, required substantial adjustment to reach international levels. Massive devaluation in 1992 and
1993, high rates of inflation, and the collapse of the State Budget have made tariff reform urgent. To
address this, the MOC has established a tariff policy based on commercial rather than political
considerations. Despite a very difficult macroeconomic environment, the MOC has made substantial
progress in reforming tariffs. In November 1993, the MOC was given authority to set all business and
selected state budget and residential tariffs. In coordination with IDA and as a Condition of Appraisal,
the MOC has raised international call charges to world price levels and denominated the charges in US
dollars to hedge against inflation. Kyrgyz Telecom will be required to maintain these levels in US$
during the implementation of the project. Thus, call charges to the United States are, since November
1993, US$ 3.00 peak and US$ 1.50 non-peak per minute (see Annex 4-2 for details) which is consistent
with charges in developed countries. These increases have helped MOC to maintain a positive net
income. Agreement was reached during appraisal to increase FSU tariffs in real terms and to index them
to the US$ (see para. 6.4 - 6.6).

V. THE PROJECT
A. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
5.1      The main objectives of the proposed Telecommunications Project are to assist the Govern-
ment to:
(a) make priority investments to modernize and develop the telecommunications network (on
the basis proposed in the Master Plan) in such a way as to best facilitate the country's
economic growth;
(b) improve management skills to function in a market oriented economy, particularly
business and financial analysis skills, create a state-owned joint-stock corporation for
telecommunications, and commercialize telecommunication activities;
(c) establish a regulatory 7/ and policy framework for the restructuring of the sector aimed
at enhancing the competitiveness of the main operator, liberalizing and opening to
competition key market segments, and attracting over time private sector investment to
the sector.
Description and Cost
5.2       The Project is defined as the 1995-98 investment program. Thus, the total Project cost is
estimated at US$ 31.0 million equivalent (foreign component at US$ 26.0 million). The Project has three
components:
(a)   Upgrading/Expansion of the Telecommunications Network in High Priority Areas.
The capital investment program support priority investments targeted at relieving the
worst bottlenecks within the system for business and other economic agents, and
improving overall service quality. The estimated cost for this component is US$ 25.0
million equivalent (US$ 21.1 foreign cost). The project would include a digital
overlay network aimed at modernizing the nationwide trunk and the international
network to provide high quality telecommunications access for priority subscribers.
Equipment purchased under the rehabilitation loan would be a complement to this
project. Items in the component are: (see Annex 5.2 for details):
(i)  implementation of a new international exchange in Bishkek, with a total capacity
of 1,000 trunks;
7V       Regulatory functions are those required to ensure that operator(s) comply with the agreed
telecommunications policies, including tariffs, quality of service, interconnection of terminal
equipment to the network, etc.



24
(ii)  upgrading and expansion of the long distance transmission facilities through the
installation of digital microwave links between Bishkek and the cities of Osh,
Jalal-Abad, Karakol, Narin and Talas;
(iii) upgrading/expansion of the inter-exchange circuit capacity in the cities of
Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad, Narin and Talas, through the installation of fiber-
optic cables;
(iv)  upgrading/expansion of the multiplex equipment to interconnect the transmission
links to the exchanges, in about 5,000 channels.
(v)  upgrading of local exchanges in Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad, Cholpon-Ata,
Karakol, Narin and Talas, amounting to about 43,000 telephone lines;
(vi)  upgrading/expansion of the cable network in the cities where the new exchanges
will be installed for 60% of the capacity of the new exchanges, or about 26,000
lines;
(b)   Institutional Development Component - Kyrgyz Telecom.  This component is
estimated at US$ 2.45 million equivalent (US$ 2.20 million in foreign costs) including
technical assistance and training.
Technical Assistance. Approximately US$ 1 ,00,000 equivalent foreign cost would
be for consulting advisory assistance. This would be to finance: (i) 54 man-months
of three experts as advisors to the Director General, the Financial Controller, and a
Project Manager for the Project Implementation Unit; (ii) TA to introduce new
accounting, finance, and audit controls and practices and to prepare computer
specifications; (iii) TA to develop a staff and management incentive program; and
(iv) TA to establish a customer service activity. New computer systems will be
introduced at a cost of US$ 400,000 equivalent foreign cost. The first function to be
automated will be billing and collections processing. Over time, other systems to be
implemented will be an accounting and financial system, a management information
system, and a network planning system. Approximately US$ 250,000 of technical
assistance was provided under the PPF 847-0 KG to finance preparation of detailed
engineering documents and bidding specifications.
Training. A Training Program will be established in the Ministry of Communications
to help improve the efficiency, profitability, and variety of seivices offered in the
telecommunications sector through training and promotion of small communication
related businesses, at a foreign cost of US$ 700,000. Kyrgyz Telecom will ensure
that management and  staff  receive  training  in  commercial  practices  in
telecommunications, including management, finance, accounting, customer service,
marketing and human resource development.
(c)   Sector Restructuring. The sector restructuring component is estimated at US$ 470,000
equivalent (US$ 450,000 in foreign costs) in technical assistance and training. Under
PPF 847-0 KG, US$ 200,000 is being provided to assist the Government in
developing a sector reform program and implementation plan; revising a draft
telecommunications law; preparing a license and interconnection agreement(s) for the
new telecommunications operator(s); and advising on a new organization structure.

5.4    Physical contingencies are 5% of both local and foreign costs of equipment, 10% of the local and
foreign costs of services, and 10% of civil works. Price contingencies are based on annual foreign cost
increases as predicted by the MUV index of 5.6% average in the period 1995-98. Price contingencies
are based on annual local costs increases of 5% for the same period. The impact of inflation will be
taken care of through the forecasted values for the exchange rate.

The proposed IDA credit of US$ 18.0 million equivalent will be made available to the GOK on standard
IDA terns with 35 years repayment. On-lending terms to Kyrgyz Telecom include: (a) on-lending of
US$ 17.6 million to Kyrgyz Telecom; (b) on-lending at IBRD's standard variable interest rate; (c)
repayment over 20 years including a grace period of 5 years with capitalization of interest; (d) Kyrgyz
Telecom to be responsible for the foreign exchange risk; and (e) Kyrgyz Telecom to pay the equivalent
of credit commitment and service charges during the grace period. The balance of the Credit (US$
400,000) would be provided to the MOC to carry out the sector reform program. The IDA Credit will
finance the exchanges and local cable distribution network and all preparation technical assistance and
some of the implementation technical assistance and training as outlined in Table 5-1. EBRD would
finance the earth station, transmission systems, and some of the technical assistance and training 8/.
Finally, the MOC will finance all local costs, including the construction of the local cable network.
8/ The development of a Master Plan is currently underway and is being financed by the Kuwait Fund.



27
Project Implementation
5.6    The detailed engineering and bidding specifications for the exchanges, cables, and transmission
systems will be prepared by the MOC with the assistance of expatriate experts financed by the PPF.
Preparation of the restructuring program will be done in the same way. The MOC has created a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) in the Ministry dedicated to these tasks. At present, this PIU consists of two
engineers who are competent in switching and transmission problems in the existing network and in
managing telecommunication activities. A financial expert and an institutional development specialist will
possibly be added. The same unit will monitor the implementation of the Rehabilitation Loan so as to
achieve coherence in the upgrading of the network. Later on, the PIU will support the procurement
process during project execution and will coordinate the implementation phase.  The Project
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 5-4.  Once the corporate structure of the operating
telecommunications entity is created, the members of the PIU may eventually work in the respective
network planning department and procurement unit since they would have gained experience during the
Project implementation. The Project is expected to be physically completed by December 31, 2000.
Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
5.7    On January 14, 1994, IDA approved a Project Preparation Facility (PPF 847-0 KG) in the amount
of US$ 450,000 in response to a request from the Kyrgyz Government for funding to obtain assistance
in drafting a detailed implementation plan for sector and institutional restructuring, obtaining advice on
preparation of commercial and financial aspects of commercial documents and preparing detailed
engineering and technical specifications for the equipment under the Project. Repayment of the PPF has
been included in the Project cost tables.
Procurement
5.8   Procurement arrangements are shown in Table 5-3. Exchanges, and cables for the rehabilitation
and expansion of the network will be procured through International Competitive Bidding. Technical
assistance and consultancy contracts will be procured using IDA guidelines for the selection of
consultants. Training services provided by training institutions will be directly contracted. Procurement
implementation will be done by the recently created Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which is staffed
by local experts as well as an expatriate expert in telecommunications for a period of 18 months (included
in the overall project cost for TA - summary Table 5-1). The expatriate advisor for the PIU will be
responsible for coordination of all technical assistance. He will be an proven expert in Bank ICB
practices so as to provide on-the-job training for the local staff of the PIU who have only initial
knowledge of IDA procurement. All specific procurement activities including the preparation of TOR
for consultancy assignments and specifications for the supply of equipment, bidding arrangements,
evaluation of offers, and implementation of consultancy studies will be managed initially by this expert.
The goal of the advisory period is to create commensurate skills in the local staff of the PIU (see para.
5.6).
5.9   It is envisioned that for the IDA financed components there will be eight procurement packages
including: rehabilitation/expansion of the network; technical assistance; training; and computer systems.
A detailed breakdown of the institutional development, sector restructuring technical assistance and
training is given in Annex 5-4B for institutional development, training, and sector restructuring.
Procurement for all included packages will be done using Bank Standard Bidding Documents.



28
Procurement monitoring and reporting arrangements (para. 5.15) will be satisfactory to IDA. All ICB
procurement will be subject to Bank prior review. The consultancy contracts will be implemented in the
first two years of the project. All consultancy tasks will be done based on contracts with firms (selection
from a short list of up to 6 firms) or individual contracts (selection from at least three CV's).

TOTAL                            18,000,000
A special foreign currency account of US$ 250,000 will be established by Kyrgyz Telecommunications
in a foreign commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. This amount represents three
months of estimated payments to contractors and consultants directly by Kyrgyz Telecom during the peak
implementation period of 1996 - 1998 from the IDA credit. The special account would be used for
payment of small amounts only and it would be replenished by IDA on application from Kyrgyz Telecom.
All disbursements will be fully documented.
5.11   Table 5.5 below shows the Credit disbursements schedule including disbursements under the PPF.
The disbursement profile is based, conservatively, on the Telecom Sector project average profile. Steps
are being taken, however, to speed up the disbursement process. In particular a Project Implementation
Unit has been established with Kyrgyz Telecom staff including an expatriate consultant dedicated to
ensuring smooth implementation of the project. In addition all equipment contracts will be executed on
a turnkey basis. The completion date will be December 31, 2000.

Environmental and Health Aspetds
5.12   No negative environmental or health aspects are expected as a consequence of the Project.
Construction activities under the Project will involve only installation of equipment in existing buildings,
replacement of cables in existing underground ducts, and use of existing towers for the microwave links.
Telecommunications services are a substitute for physical transport, and therefore reduce environmental
pollution due to fuel-based transportation. Better provision of health services to remote and isolated
communities is made possible and/or enhanced through the use of telecommunications. Early warning of
disease conditions and requests for emergency ambulance services through the telephone is essential to
reduce losses due to accidents, epidemics, and catastrophes. Therefore the Project is classified as a
positive contributor to the environment and to health services.
Performance Monitoring
5.13   A table of performance indicators, shown in Annex 5-5, was agreed during negotiations. These
indicators include policy, operational, technical, and financial indicators, and have been designed to
simplify Borrower's and IDA's supervision of the project. They represent the key indicators for
measuring performance in the sector. The Borrower, through the Project Implementation Unit, will
periodically monitor those indicators, report them to management, and devise measures to improve
performance. A review of the present year's performance and the projected next year's performance will
be carried out at the end of the third quarter of each year.
Project Supervision
5.14   A Supervision Plan is included in Annex 5-6. Two to three missions will be needed for project
supervision each year. Over the project implementation period this amounts to missions requiring
approximately 110 staff-weeks, including headquarters review time. For the most part, the missions need
to be staffed by a telecom engineer, a financial analyst, and a policy/institutional analyst.



31
Reporting;
5.15   In addition to supervision missions, the project will be monitored through quarterly progress
reports to be submitted by MOC and Kyrgyz Telecom to IDA within 30 days after the end of each
quarter during the implementation period. The progress reports will review progress based on the
contractors' implementation plans and the work programs of the consultants for the technical assistance
work. The content of the reports were discussed and agreed at negotiations. These reports will focus
on both the cumulative and the incremental progress achieved during the reporting period in: (a) the
physical progress compared to the contractors' work plans; (b) the technical assistance work progress;
(c) the bidding process for all items to be procured under the Project; (d) the performance indicators; (e)
IDA disbursements and projected disbursement over the next 6 months; (f) fulfillment of the covenants
and audits of accounts, and audit reporting; and (g) actions taken for the resolution of issues raised by
past supervision missions. A brief summary shall be added to the report explaining the reasons for any
delays or shortcomings in any of the above items and actions taken to improve progress.

VI. FINANCIAL & ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Goals & Strategv
6.1    Kyrgyz Telecom operation's Five-Year goals are: (a) financial viability; (b) improved efficiency;
(c) developing a 100% self financing ability of local expenditures; (d) building debt service capacity; and
(e) attracting foreign investments. To achieve these goals will require: (a) a substantial change in tariffs
structure and levels, with differentiated tariffs for subscribers of the existing and new overlay network
for local and domestic long distance services, and step by step increases and indexation in FSU tariffs;
(b) negotiation of new FSU accounting rates; (c) holding staff to approximately current levels; and (d)
introduction of international accounting practices and systems.
Historical Performance
6.2    Telecommunications services have been provided  by  a division of the Ministry  of
Communication, sharing staff, facilities, profits and accounting with the Postal, TV & Broadcasting and
Transmission Division and other units of the MOC. Prior to 1989, the MOC operated in a stable
environment and was reasonably profitable 9/. The MOC has been a closed self-financed entity inside
Kyrgyz Government. Therefore, this Ministry has been considered outside the fiscal budget. Under this
system, part of the revenues from Telecommunications operations were transferred to Posts as required
to cover expenses, keeping as a target to have only a small profit enough to fund necessary social
expenses. The lack of well established accounting standards, and the overriding target of reaching a pre-
determined level of profit, led to additional major distortions in the accounting practices: part of the
investment was presented as an expense to reduce profit, and the recent increase in receivables due to the
deteriorating general economic situation resulted in pressures to switch from accrual accounting to cash
accounting of revenues.
6.3    Political and legal constraints prevented MOC's financial and accounting systems from responding
adequately to high inflation from 1990-1993. The main cause of difficulties was a severe drop in real
revenues, resulting from low nominal tariff increases in the face of high inflation. The collapse of the
state budget during this period led to a reduction in funds available to Kyrgyz Government Ministries and
services, and also severe financial difficulties to business subscribers, which resulted in increasing arrears
to MOC from all subscribers. MOC responded with subsequent cutbacks achieved by reducing staff,
maintenance and investment. This led to difficulties in delivering services and accelerated deterioration
of the telecommunications network, but helped improve staffing efficiencies and left MOC's

centrally planned economy, in which other prices were also artificially low.

Proposed Project ADproach and Tariffs System
6.4    In 1993, in consultation with IDA, the Kyrgyz Government and the MOC took a first step to
respond to these problems making international tariffs to non-FSU countries indexed to the US dollar and
giving rate setting authority to MOC for international and most state and private business charges.
During Appraisal an agreement was reached which reflects this project approach (see para 4.4) into the
tariff structure.  The proposed Project would provide for an over-lay network of some 40,000 new
telephone lines, which would be of digital technology and whose cost per line would be the current
international cost per line for a marginal expansion (around US$800 per line). The existing 333,000 lines
are of analog technology, and are completely depreciated. At current tariffs, Kyrgyz Telecom is getting
only around US$17 per line per year, compared with US$300 to US$500 required to maintain a network.
Additionally, under the existing depressed economic situation, most customers can not afford to pay
international tariff levels. Therefore, the Project approach is to provide the new overlay network only
to those subscribers (basically business) who can afford and need access to a modern telecommunications
network. It was agreed at negotiations that the Kyrgyz Telecommunications will (a) establish and
thereafter maintain, unless otherwise agreed by IDA, tariff levels for calls made by any subscriber to the
republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at a level at least equal to 150% of the
outgoing Settlement Rate paid by Kyrgyz Telecommunications on such calls, provided that, if one or
more of the current republics of the CIS withdraw from the CIS, the provisions of paragraph (b) below
will apply to telephone calls made to such republic or republics; and (b) Kyrgyz Telecommunications will
maintain, unless otherwise agreed by IDA, tariffs for international telephone calls other than those
referred to in paragraph (a) above at a level at least equal to (i) 150% of the applicable outgoing
Settlement Rate paid by the operator on such calls; or (ii) the som equivalent of US$1.00 per minute at
the prevailing market exchange rate, whichever is greater.
6.5    Under the proposed new tariffs system subscribers of the existing analog network would continue
paying very low (by international standards) rates for monthly local subscription and domestic long
distance calls; however, in order to protect Telecom from further decreases in the real value of these
already extremely low rate services, it was agreed to index the existing values for local subscriber
categories to the US dollar, and to slowly increase the domestic long distance rates in their US$
equivalent values from an average of around US$ 0.5 cent per minute to around US$ 1 cent per minute
in year 2000. The rationale for this domestic long distance increase is that, depending on the engineering
costs, it would be possible to also improve the quality for domestic long distance service to subscribers
of the existing analog network with only a marginal extra investment.
6.6    However, international tariffs to non-FSU and to FSU countries are proposed to be the same for
all analog and digital network subscribers. The reasons for this are: (1) Kyrgyz Telecom should enter
in revenue settlement agreements for international calls whereby, part of the revenue collected in Kyrgyz
Republic is due to other administrations and payable in hard currency (irrespective whether the call is
originated from the analog or the digital network); and (2) the collection rates 10/ in the Kyrgyz
Republic should be in the same order of magnitude, when expressed in international currency, as those
1 0/ In international telecommunications use, Collection Rates are the charges applicable at the originating country;
Accounting Rates, are the charges declared in front of the other countries for settlement purposes.

charged by other country's administrations. Low collection rates in Kyrgyz would result in heavy traffic
unbalances (many more outgoing than incoming calls) which would result in unbearable payments in hard
currency from Kyrgyz Telecommunications to other country's administrations, and this also applies to
calls outgoing from both the analog and the digital network. International rates to non-FSU countries
were indexed to the US$ in June 1993. At a meeting in Moscow in February 1994, all FSU countries
reached agreements in principle leading to a revenue settlement system linked to the US$ through newly
defined FSU Gold Frank and FSU SDR. This new system forces Kyrgyz Telecom to raise its FSU rates
and to index them to the US$.
Financial and Accounting Reform
6.7    MOF has requested extension of the European Communities Technical Assistance program
already ongoing in other Central Asian Republics to the Kyrgyz Republic to implement international
accounting systems and practices. Additionally, Kyrgyz Telecom has agreed to include in the proposed
Project the necessary TA funds to support introduction of international accounting practices and systems
in its operations. A technical assistance plan and the Request for Proposals (RFP) [Annex 4-41 for the
financial and accounting areas (para 7.2 (b) (iv)] were agreed at negotiations.
Projected Performance
6.8    Based on reconmmended actions and policies, Kyrgyz Telecom is expected to achieve an
acceptable financial performance in 1994 and a strong financial performance thereafter. Projected
earnings, cash flow, and return on assets quickly reach solid levels. Net operating revenue is estimated
to reach US$ 2.11 million by 1995 and US$ 10.3 million by year 2000, with revenues per Working Line
growing from US$12 per year in 1993 to US$ 18 per year in year 2000 for analog subscribers, and from
US$ 422 per year in 1995 to US$ 547 per year in year 2000 for new digital subscribers. Selected key
indicators are presented in Table 6.1. Projected financial statements are contained in Annex 6-3.

6.9    The most important assumption of the projections is that Kyrgyz Telecom adheres to the schedule
of agreed tariff increases in real terms. Tariffs were set to rationalize use of the system and move toward
international norms. Traffic estimates are the second critical assumption, and are conservative. They
are based on the combined impact of demand responses to tariff increases, income changes, and new
services, plus engineering-determined capacity growth resulting from technical improvements.
Risks
6.10   Over time, the primary sources of financial risk are: (a) the demand for the new digital network;
(b) the FSU international settlement balance; (c) maintaining/increasing tariffs; and (d) billing and
collection procedures. These risks can result in tight cash flow conditions in the next two years, reduced
overall profitability and contribute to foreign exchange shortages.



37
6.11    Demand. Most of the telecommunications projects are supply driven; there is a large unsatisfied
demand expressed in waiting lists and even more in customers requesting services as soon as they are
available. Given the distorted economic situation in the Kyrgyz Republic it is very difficult to estimate
the real demand, those new customers who can really afford international prices for access to a modem
telecommunications system. Due to this fact, the projections were made using a conservative estimate:
that of every 100 digital lines installed in a year, 20 would be put into operation the first year, another
30 the second year, 25 the third year, and 10 the fourth year, giving a fill ratio of 85 %.
6.12   Settlement Balance. In 1992 and 1993, the Kyrgyz Republic began to establish international
settlement arrangements with foreign, non FSU, administrations. To date, no revenue settlement
payments have taken place, and the available information foresees a basically balanced traffic. With FSU
administrations the Kyrgyz Republic has had a "sender keeps all" type of settlement arrangement which
has been advantageous to the Kyrgyz during a period of extremely low collection rates and high
unbalances.   Under the proposed FSU  revenue settlement Kyrgyz should pay to some other
administrations even in the case of balanced traffic; this is due to longer terrestrial links through other
countries than through Kyrgyz. To solve this situation, it is in Kyrgyz advantage to switch from
terrestrial links to satellite transmissions which have a 50%/50% revenue settlement; however,
implementation of this new arrangement requires installation of the new satellite earth station, which is
included in the proposed Project, and installation of similar stations in other FSU countries 11/.
6.13   Billing and Collections. Historically, MOC has had virtually no accounts receivable (A/R), since
subscribers risked losing their line and having to re-enter the 100,000 subscriber long waiting list. With
the sharp tariff increases, A/R began to accumulate, though the MOC has instituted tough collections and
disconnection guidelines. A streamlined, automated billing process is essential to shorten the payment
cycle and to track accounts properly. In implementing a new billing system there should be a review of
physical connections to ensure that each active line is being charged.
6.14   Billing and collections for the key revenue segment of international traffic are conducted on a
separate system from general calls and customers. The system lacks oversight and security, and no
independent mechanism exists to ensure that all traffic has been properly billed and payments received.
With a high percentage of revenues generated by a small number of subscribers, errors in this system
could be especially costly. A TA program for the introduction of a new computerized billing and
accounting system [see 7.2 (b) (iv)] was agreed at negotiations.
Internal Rate of Return
6.15   The Project's financial rate of return was measured using an incremental cash flow approach,
since Telecom has on-going operations and the Project combines rehabilitation and expansion elements.
Returns on the Project are satisfactory, with a ten year financial IRR of 23 % (see Annex 6-4). Even
in a combined scenario of lower revenues, higher costs and higher investment requirements, Project
retums exceed the cost of capital, reaching a rate of 10.7%.
6.16   Benefits stem primarily from increased traffic generated by the 40,000 overlay network new
business subscribers, plus the increase in traffic from other subscribers made possible by the
improvements to network performance and capacity. Improved intemational traffic balances and
settlement options are also an important financial benefit of the Project. Returns are most sensitive to
1 1/ INTELSAT system antennas are already in operation or are being installed in many FSU countries.



38
changes in cash revenue streams, which can be affected by tariff, traffic or A/R variations. The IRR is
less sensitive to cost changes due to the size of projected profit margins.
Financial Covenant
6.17   Kyrgyz Telecommunications will have the following ratio larger or equal to 1.5:
After Tax Profit + Depreciation
---------------------------------------- > or= 1.5
Debt Amortization
Every item in this formula will be calculated following international accounting and financial principles;
in particular, revenues refers to all operating and non-operating revenues. Expenses include all payments
to staff and does not include any capital investment, and debt amortization includes repayment of all loans
and credits of Kyrgyz Telecom. Depreciation is based on revalued assets. The After Tax Profit is the
value after payment of all taxes.
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
6.18   The proposed investment program is the least-cost solution for providing the planned service
levels within the constraints imposed by the existing configuration and technology of the
telecommunications network. The timing and dimensioning of the various elements of investment in the
system, as well as the design and composition of alternative network configurations, are the result of
careful analyses made by IDA, consultants, and the MOC. These techno-economic analyses were
performed according to internationally recognized engineering practices.
6.19   Digital equipment is produced at relatively lower cost and with much greater price/performance
ratios than the previous analog technology. Moreover, digital technology permits the provision of cost-
effective data transmission and other value-added services (existing and yet-to-be-developed), which are
essential for building efficient businesses information networks. To ensure the lowest possible cost for
the equipment components funded by IDA, the contracts for material and equipment will be tendered
using international competitive bidding.
Benefits
6.20   The Project is consistent with and supportive of IDA's country strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic.
It would develop the government's capability for arm's-length sector supervision. The project will reduce
a major infrastructural constraint to economic development and adjustment in the Kyrgyz Republic by
upgrading telecommunications services. It will maximize resources available to the sector by enabling



39
private sector investment and will improve quality and access to services by improving the flow of
information and enhancing communication. Institution building and commercialization of Kyrgyz
Telecom will result in full cost recovery, improved financial viability, more efficient operations,
improved quality and selection of services plus a net flow of funds to the government.
6.21   The Project will foster the development of a market-oriented economy by:
(a) establishing a regulatory and policy framework that ensures the possibility of future private
sector participation in telecommunications;
(b) allowing for private sector involvement in basic and non-basic services, such as cellular
telephones, data transmission, etc.;
(c) improving access to international markets and suppliers' as well as customers' information;
and by
(d) improving the working of market mechanisms.
Economic Return
6.22   The economic rate of return is derived by adding the incremental taxes paid under the Project
scenario to the incremental cash flows used for the financial rate of return. Even without applying a
wage correction factor or accounting for consumer surplus, the project's ERR is above 37%.

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS
STATEMENT OF INTENTION ON SECTOR POLICY FOR TELECOMIUNICATIONS
In line with the transition to a market economy in the Kyrgyz Republic. the policv of the Ministrv of
Communications is to restructure the telecommunications sector. In the medium term, the main policy
objectives of the restructuring will be to ensure that:
(a)   the demand from business and other priority subscribers tor international. interregional, and
domestic telecommunication services is met:
(b)    reasonable quality telecommunication services are provided to all subscribers efficiently and
on a timely basis:
(c)    competitively priced telecommunication services are provided to consumers while allowing for
a reasonable rate of return for operators/investors: and
(d)    customer choice in the provision of non-basic telecommunication services is extended.
SECTOR STRATEGY
To achieve these objectives. the Ministry of Communications will adopt a market oriented strategy for
development of the sector. In the near and medium term. this strategy has/will include:
(a)    establishing an appropriate framework for policv and regulation of the sector:
(i)   regulation and policv tunctions were separated from telecommunication and other
communication operating tunctions in Februarv 1994:
(ii)    a regulatorv body, separate from policy making tinctions. will be established within
the Ministry of Communications to regulate the telecommunications sector:
(b)    strengthening the commercial autonomy and accountability of the newlv established
telecommunications operator responsible for providing basic telephonv services. This would
include:
(i)          split ot the telecommunication. postal. broadcasting, and other
communications operations into separate. autonomous entities in February
1994 (alreadv compieted):
(ii)         Corporatization of the new telecommunications entitv licensed to provide

(iii)   Commercialization ito increase efficiencv and proritabilitv) of the telecomrmunications
operators activities: along with
(iv)          Commercialization and corporatization of posts. broadcasting,television as
separate. autonomous. public departments or corporations.
(c)    continue a process alreadv underwav to promote private sector participation and compeEition
in the telecommunications sector. including, as appropriate. partial or tull liberalization (to allo'..._
competition of non basic market segments.
Establishin! a New Reeulatorv Framework
The establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework is a pre-requisite for the success of the
policy program. The framework must be impartial. stable. explicit with regard to the rights and obligations
of suppliers. and cost effective in its use of resources These characteristics are essential if private sector
investors are to be encouraged to plaga full part in the development of the sector, if supplier firms are to
make rational decisions about network and service deveiopment. and if customers are to make rationai choices
about their consumption patterns.
In order to achieve these objectives. a new regulatory function will be established for the sector. The
function of the regulator will be to administer all aspects of regulatory policv within the policy guidelines laid
down by the Ministry of Communications. including regulation of the radio spectrum. In the first instance.
the regulatory function is expected to be established as a separate department within the Ministry of
Communications.
Strengthening the Main Telecommunications Operator
The main telecommunications operator has been established as a legally separate state Corporation,
Kyrgyz Telecom. A number of measures will be introduced which are aimed at establishing a more
commercial relationship between the operator and the Government in its role as the shareholder. The main
themes of the new relationship will be enhanced autonomv for the operators management in return for greater
accountabilitv for performance. Specific steps will include. inter alia. the following:
(a)    A performance agreement will be Lirawn up which specifies the operators overall financial and
operational objectives over the next 3 - 5 years. The agreement will be published and the
operator's Board of Directors will be held directlv responsible for achievement of the
specified objectives.
(b)    ensuring that a Board of Directors is appointed which has appropriate representation from the
main consumer groups. kev private sector industrial activities, as well as the Ministry of
Communications.
(c)    appoint a Board of Directors which will ensure that the telecommunications entity is operated
efficientlv. profitablv, with sound investments. as well as ensure that appropriate tariffs are
proposed to the regulator for approval.
(d)    While Kvrgyz Telecom is a state Corporation. the birector General of Kvrgyz Telecom will
be appointed bv the Ministrv of Communications. In the event that Kvrgyz Telecom is
converted to a joint stock company, the Director General would be appointed bv the Board of
Directors. Kvrgyz Telecom's Board and management will be given autonomv in staffing and

salarv levels ana statf incentive programs. In addition. thev will have the right to propose
tariff changes to the regulator. Management will be able to hire and release statf without the
Ministry of Communication's approval. The Government approval will continue to be
required for ioans which are guaranteed by the Government.
(e)    A new commercial accountine svstem will te introduced in the telecommunications operator
which will permit accounts to be prepared according to international accounting standards and
provide a solid basis ror the new r3ranework of financial accountabilitv. The system will be
established over the next three years.
(f)    The efficiencv and effectiveness of KYrgyz Telecom's operations haveiwill be enhanced by

equipment. building construction. and pttltl anwdublihing by June 30, 1996.
(g)    The operator will henceforth award all major contracts through a system of competitive
tendering.
Promoting Private Sector Participation and Comnetition
The development of the telecommunications infrastructure can most effectivelv be achieved through
constructive involvement of the private sector and. where appropriate. competition between operators. While
the main public operator (Kyrgyz Telecom) will continue to be the provider of basic telephonv services (local.
long distance. and international voice), private sector operators can play an increasing part in meeting the
needs of both business, government. and residential consumers for a variety of other. non-basic.
telecommunication services.
It is envisioned that the Government will allow private sector participation in non-basic and value
added services. Wherever feasible and for aU licenses having a material impact on the developmem of the
sector. Iicenses will be issued through an international competitive hidding process. This would include:
(a)    Allowing competition in the supply and installation of customer premise equipment by June
30. 1995. At such time. the main telecommunications operator will be required to permit the
connection to its network of all CPE which contorms to technical standards to he determined
by the regulatorv authoritv.
(h)    The supply of public call otfices tPCO)'s will be liberalized throughout the country. Not less
than 2 licenses will be issued through a competitive tendering process: one of which will be
issued not later than September 30. 1996.
(c)    The supply of value added and data services will be opened up to competition bv June 30.
1995. The resale capacity of the main operators (Kyrgyz Telecom) leased lines will be
permitted for the' purposes ot carrying data traffic. Voice resale. however. will not be
permitted at this time.
(d)    By June 30. 1995. the provision of domestic and international data services using satellite and
microwave transmission facilities will be opened upY to competition as long as these
transmission facilities are not connected to the public network.
(e)    Private operators will be authorized to operate private networks for their own use. The sale
of spare capacitv on authorized (by license private networks will be permitted for the

purposes or providing uata services to third parties as long as these networks are not
connected to the public network.
(t)    The supply of radiopaging services will be liberaiized at the earliest possible opportunitv.
In addition. the Government wvill allow ror eventual private sector participation in the main
telecommunications operator.
Cross Subsidies
The policv of the Ministrv ot Cormmunications is to ensure that activities in the communications
sector are operated efficiently and on a commercial basis. A PTO shall not subsidize its public telephone
services from the profits of other business activities it may have.
To ensure the transparency in operations licensed PTOs shall keep separate accounts for their public
telephone services. PTOs shall publish within three months of the end of each financial vear an analysis of
their operations and financial performance consistent with internationallv recognized standards.

6.         Policies and Procedures. Accounting policies and procedures will be documented.
The documentation will comprise clear policy statements for the various accounting functions
related to KT, as well as step-by-step procedures supplemented by flow charts.
7.         System Installation. The installation of any new hardware and software systems,
as well as the initial application of new policies and procedures and any modifications to existing
systems, will be supervised at each KT site, as needed.
8.         Training of Financial Staff. Formal training will be provided to KT's financial staff
in the operation of any new computerized systems. and in the documented accounting policies
and procedures.
9.         Operations Assistance. Direct assistance will be provided to KT's financial staff and
to KT's management, in making new systems operational, in the on-going operation of the
systems and in the use of various financial reports.
Training
10.        In addition to the systems-related training, an intensive program of formal training
will be provided to selected KT financial staff in the application and practice of market-oriented
accounting principles, international accounting standards, and of telecommunications industry
standards and practices. It is expected that such training will comprise various seminars and
workshops ranging in duration from one day to perhaps several weeks. The specific topics and
contents of the seminars and workshops will be agreed with KT management, as appropriate,
during the time the accounting systems support is being provided.
Level of Effort
11.        The accounting systems work will be undertaken in the holding company and in the
seven (7) regional operating entities with identical accounting requirements. It is expected that
no more than four foreign specialists from a major international accounting firm will be required
during a period of no more than 8 months. The foreign specialist team should represent
appropriate capabilities and experience in accounting and systems design and implementation,
training, and telecommunications industry accounting practices. It is expected that the firm will
supplement the foreign specialists with full time professional accountants from within Kyrgyz.
Proposed work and staffing plans should reflect a highly cost effective approach to executing the
stated scope of work.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Rehabilitation/Expansion Component
1.           The capital investment program has been defined to support priority investments targeted
towards relieving the worst bottlenecks within the system for business and other economic agents, and
improving overall service quality. The estimated cost is US $ 31 million equivelent. The program would
include a digital overlay network aimed at modernization of the nationwide trunk and international
network to provide high quality telecommunications access for priority subscribers.  Investment
components include digital transit and local exchanges, fiber optic cables inter-exchange connection, and
digital microwave systems.
2.           The backbone digital infrastructure will consist of digital local/transit exchanges in the
major industrial centers connected with digital microwave links between them. The project will include
the development of the cable facilities on local network level for the cities connected to the overlay
network. There will be interface between the existing analogue network and the overlay digital network
and both networks will have access to the international exchange with terrestrial and satellite international
trunks.
3 .          The main components of the digital overlay network are described in the following
paragraphs. The detailed capacities and engineering of all exchange sites and final configuration of the
microwave links and the local distribution cable networks will be completed by an engineering design
team to be financed under the proposed PPF. The detailed engineering design should take into account
the optimal integration of the digital overlay network as defined here and the future network as defined
by the Master Plan for the development of the national telecommunications infrastructure, that would be
completed under a grant from the Kuwait Fund.
Exchanges
4.           Bishkek - One local subscriber exchange (20,000 lines total capacity) will be installed
including remote subscriber units (RSU) collocated with existing exchanges (ATC 25, ATC 26 as well
other locations justified by business demands). The site of the host exchange will be determined during
the detailed engineering design but will provide for links to the crossbar tandem exchange and the existing
local Bishkek network. This combined exchange will include about 3,000 trunks for interconnection to
the new international exchange and the existing "Kuartz" long distance switch and the new digital
exchanges. The existing worn-out step by step exchanges (primarily ATC 22,24,25,26) may be either
downsized or dismounted and used for spare parts . The business subscribers of these exchanges are
to be connected to the new digital exchange through the RSU. The existing digital S 12 exchange will
be connected by PCM links to the new digital combined exchange and its' subscriber and trunk capacity
would be extended in the future.

Page 2 of 3
5.            One new digital international exchange will be installed in Bishkek with initial capacity
of 1,000 trunks in order to give the subscribers connected to the digital local switches, as well for the
rest of analogue subscribers in the main industrial centers of the country, access to international direct
dialling. This exchange will be connected to the a new earth station (standard A, under separate financing
from a different donor') and the other existing terrestrial cable and microwave links to CIS countries.
Modern operator positions will be installed to process the semi-automatic international traffic, providing
accurate traffic accounting and billing capability.
6.            Osh - One combined exchange (10,000 subscribers and 2,000 trunks) will be collocated
with the existing crossbar long distance switch with remote subscriber units at the sites of ATC 2 and
ATC 3). The worn-out step-by-step exchanges will be either disassembled or downsized with the
installation of RSU. The existing cross-bar AMTC 3 will be upgraded to interface with ANI equipment
and its free trunk capacity will be used for interface between the new digital exchange and Osh local
network.
7.          Jalal Abad - One combined exchange (7,000 subscribers and 1,000 trunks) will be installed
in the newly constructed building. This new trunk capacity will improve the long distance and
international access for the local network of Jalal Abad and the other regional industrial centers.
8.            Cholpon Ata - One combined exchange (initial capacity of 3,000 subscriber lines and 500
trunks) will replace the existing worn out ATC 54 (installed in 1971) and provide trunk capacity for the
regional network to the long distance and international network through the new digital microwave link
to Bishkek. The possibilities for implementation of PABX equipment (financed by the owners of the
resort facilities), or by private suppliers in hotels and resorts should be explored in order to minimize
investment and maintenance costs.   Some modern pay phones will be provided for the costal area
(financed by the rehabilitation loan).
9.            Kara Kol - One small digital local exchange (initial capacity of 3,000 subscribers and
500 trunks) will be installed primarily for new business subscribers.
10.           There is enough floor space in the sites for all new digital exchanges and therefore no
additional buildings will be required. Building re-conditioning needed for the new exchanges will be
constructed by the MOC using local labor. In all the exchanges, Main Distribution Frames (MDF), power
supply, air conditioning, installation and testing, initial maintenance, training and documentation will be
provided by the supplier of the switching equipment.
11.           Operation and maintenance supervisory facilities to remotely control the digital
exchanges and transmission links will be included in the contracts. These facilities will include remote
terminals for the exchanges and alarm panels for the transmission links. However, they could be upgraded
in the future to the level of an O&M Center.
I In the event that this financing is not forthcoming, funding for the earth station would be provided under the
investment program.

Microwave transmission links
12.          The existing well developed microwave supporting infrastructure is adequate for the
implementation of backbone digital links who will use the existing towers, masts, power supply and
buildings in the repeater and terminal stations sites. All the new digital switching centers (Bishkek, Jalal
Abad, Osh, Cholpon Ata and Kara Kol) will be connected by 2+1 X 34 Mbit/s links (7 hops) on the
above mentioned microwave routes between the above mentioned towns and Bishkek. Four smaller
microwave links (8 Mbit/s) will be installed between the digital exchanges and the RSUs. All of the
microwave links design engineering and procurement will be financed by a separate donor.
Local cable networks
13.          This component of the project will include cable for the distribution network (including
new subscriber loops where necessary - 60% in each of the new digital subscribers) for the sites with new
digital exchanges, digital line equipment (2 Mb/S) on fiber optic cables for the RSUs and the trunks to
the existing analogue network. The connections between the microwave stations and the digital exchange
sites are to be designed either by fiber-optic links, existing cables or microwave links where necessary.
In cases of longer subscriber loops 1 + 1 PCM systems or some wireless solutions will be used to
minimize the investment and maintenance cost of the subscriber networks.

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
TERMS OF REFERENCE
DETAILED ENGINEERING AND DESIGN OF A
DIGITAL OVERLAY NETWORK
INTRODUCTION
1.    The existing network of the Kyrgyz Republic is predominantly analogue and the
majority of existing equipment is obsolete and not in compliance with world standards. The
network does not satisfy the needs of the business community, especially because it does not
provide for international direct distance dialling. The envisaged project is aimed at initial
modernization of the existing network in order to satisfy priority demand. The Government
of the Kyrgyz Republic has requested a credit from the World Bank to rehabilitate and expand
the telecommunications network.
2.    This consulting project is for assistance to be provided to the Kyrgyz Ministry of
Communications (MoC) by a team of experienced telecommunications experts for an
estimated period of approximately 4 months starting in January, 1994.
BACKGROUND
3.    The proposed investment project should provide for the initial modernization of
telecommunications network in the country in accordance with the Government's reform
program which is aimed at creating a market economy and attracting private sector
investment to the country.
4.     As of January 1, 1993 telephones were available to 332,400 subscribers or about 8 of
every 100 people in the Kyrgyz Republic. This compares with 50 in the United States, 15 in
Russia, 11 in Kazakhstan, and .7 in China. The capacity utilization of 85% is high and leaves
little room for expansion without additional capital investments. The average yearly fault rate
for the network is estimated 200 for 100 subscribers. The average age of the network is
approximately 15 years and parts of it badly need replacement. All this results in very poor
quality of service in the existing facilities.
OBJECTIVES
5.    The purpose of this project is to develop a capital investment plan for the optimal
digitalization of the telecommunications network of the Kyrgyz Republic in the short term



67                                          Annex 5-3a
(1994 - 1997) based on the implementation of a digital overlay network in the capital Bishkek Page 2 of 6
and the towns of Osh, Jalal Abad, Cholpon Ata and Kara Kol. The capital investment
program should provide priority telecommunication services which effectively meet
economically justified customer demand. The project should provide as well a basis for
further extension of the national long-distance and international infrastructure. A preliminary
description of the project is attached as ANNEX 1.
6.     The consultant should elaborate the engineering design as an integral part of an
overall Master Plan (MP) for the development of the telecommunications in the Kyrgyz
Republic. The MP is elaborated under a separate study (financed by a Grant from the Kuwait
Fund).
7.     An output of the study will be the bidding specifications for the procurement of
telecom equipment specified as a result of the consultants detailed design work.
8.     A project implementation schedule is to be elaborated based on the output of the
engineering design .
SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES
9. Three consultants will form the team in this project with the respective competence in the
areas of: (a) exchange planning and engineering; (b) transmission engineering; (c) outside
plant engineering (cable plants for local networks). The consultant performing the exchange
planning and engineering will have the leading/coordinating responsibility for the overall
design of the project. A preliminary overall estimate of the equipment required is described in
the Annex 1 , which is to be considered as indicative only. A detailed justification
(financial/technical) must be included in the study for any increase in the proposed cost of the
project.
10.   The consultants will:
Exchne.
(a)    Analyze the existing network in depth (as example for the exchanges, inter-alia, the
number of lines, trunks in operation, the routing, switching, numbering, transmission
plan, the year of implementation, manufacturer, design, condition, etc) in order to
specify optimal interface with the new digital exchanges.
(b)    Measure and analyze the traffic of the existing network. The consultants will provide
their own traffic measurement equipment, if the equipment the MOC ordered h?Q not
yet arrived in Bishkek. The existing exchanges have built in only bulk traffic
measurement equipment. Initial representative data will be received and processed on
line during a period of about 2-3 months. Local staff is to be involved in this activity
in order to create skills for further continued process of network planning in the
operational entity.
(c)    Confirm demand. Criteria to consider include: locations with high business demand in
the respective local networks, equipment with high fault rates, and areas of the
network experiencing relatively high levels of congestion. This will provide the



65                                         Annex 5-3a
inputs to make decisions for the priorities of replacement of analogue exchanges and  Page 3 of 6
transmission systems. For the systems which will remain in service for up to 10-15
years and more, it is necessary to outline a strategy for spare parts provision and
maintenance (including sourcing). Eventual reuse of dismounted equipment should be
taken into consideration. Implementation of new modern PABX should be considered
as well, in order to satisfy potential business demand.
(d)    Assess the existing exchange billing facilities and design their modernization. The
consultant should harmonize the features of the existing network with the capabilities
of the new digital equipment foreseen to be implemented (modern pay-phones will be
considered as future optimization of billing features of the network). In addition, he
will detail the implementation of the counters or other mechanism to bill local calls on
the existing exchanges.
(e)    Analyze and specify the signalling used in the network now, and design the signalling
of the new network. In doing that, he will minimize the requirements for adaptation of
digital switches in the network. This part will provide data for elaboration of the
engineering plans for the reconstruction of existing network which needs to be done in
order to implement and interface the new digital equipment. The importance of
implementation of international CCITT standards which is to be emphasized.
Transmission systems.
(f)    Survey of the sites of implementation of transmission equipment will be performed in
order to design all necessary details (antennas, waveguides, power supply, cable
diagrams, interface charts). Design the multiplex equipment taking into account the
existing signalling interfaces and maintenance patterns as well provide possibilities
for centralized maintenance of the transmission network.
Outside Plant.
(g)    Survey of cable routes, ducts, internal cabling, and power supply facilities for the
sites included in the proiect. Measure/assess the electrical characteristics of the
existing cables in order to identify needs of replacement.
(h)    Design a comprehensive, optimal solution for the local networks (including inter-
exchange connections, distribution networks and subscriber loops) in the towns where
the new exchanges will be implemented. Detailed plans/design of distribution
shelves/boxes will be included for the local networks where digital switches are
implemented.
Network Design.
(i)    Design the network, including inter-alia, local exchanges, inter-exchange trunks and
systems, long distance exchanges, microwave transmission systems, multiplex,
international exchanges and transmission systems. The network design should be
optimized, to arrive to the least cost solution. International costs for new equipment
should be employed in the optimization, since there is no local accurate reference to
costs. The output will include traffic matrices and configuration of the trunks for the
long distance/local tandem exchanges (design of all necessary H/W and S/W), the



69                                          Annex 5-3a
power supply, Main Distribution Frames(MDF), air conditioning and operators    g  4 of 6
positions (where needed) for the digital exchanges.
Bidding Specifications.
(j)    Write bidding specifications for the equipment to be included in the World Bank
Project, under International Competitive Bidding, according to "World Bank
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit" (May 1992 edition).
Specifications will include, inter-alia: traffic, hardware, software, operator positions,
signalling, numbering, transmission plan, maintenance, main distribution frame,
power supply.
Evaluation of offers.
(k)    After offers are received, assist in the evaluation of offers and recommendation to
award.
Contract negotiations.
(I)    Assist the MOC in the contract negotiations with suppliers.
11.   The consultant(s) should introduce international experience and train local staff to
continue the future normal network planning activities as part of the overall Master Plan (MP)
elaboration process.
INPUTS
12.   All available data and local construction and operational practices will be provided by
the local technical staff. The consultant will make a detailed request for this at the beginning
of the project.
OUALIFICATION OF THE CONSULTANTS
13.   The consultants selected for the project design must comply with the following
requirements:
(a)    At least 5 years Project Manager experience (for the switching engineer/leader). At
least 10 years of engineering experience in the respective areas (exchange,

APPENDIx D
SUmmARY TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE EDP
D.1 INTRODUCrION
As Kyrgyz Telecom has only recently been established, its organisational and
management structure are ill-defined.   Furthermore, owing to its previous
agglomeration with the other activities of the Ministry of Communications ('MOC'),
it possesses few of the support functions and systems which you would nornally
associate with a telecommunications operator such as finance, accounting, planning,
strategy etc. Thus there are several significant flinclional shortcomings within the
new organisation which need to be created and/or improved.
When these shortcomings are considered in the context of a newly formed enterprise
embarking on a substantial physical investment programme whilst operating in a
rapidly evolving environment, the need to urgently prioritise and address these
shortcomings becomes clear.
In the development of the Project, a significant technical assistance effort, designed to
address the institutional deficiencies of Kyrgyz Telecom, has been specified. This
Institutional Development Programme ("IDP") contains six components of which the
Bank is to finance four. These four components are:
.   Organisational and Strategic Advice. This component is intended to assist
4                    the new Director General of Kyrgyz Telecom to prioritise and address the
urgent organisational and managerial issues facing the new Company. In
particular this component will address:
a.  the organisational structure of the new company, including the
delineation of responsibililics between the regional directorates
and the head office staff, and the establishment and staffing of
functional groups within the Company (such as planning,
financial management, marketing, training etc.);
b.  the elaboration of institutional priorities and a corporate strategy,
including a business plan;
c.  liaison with the Ministry of Communications and participation in
the sector reform process; and
d.  providing advice to the Director General on mangement issues.
ii.  Finance and Accounting. This component will assist the management of
Kyrgyz Telecom in developing and implementing new financial processes and
systems to enable the Company to operate according to commercial
principles. The component will be sub-divided into three elements:

Telecom advising him on all issues relating to the financial management of the
Company. The work will be split into three elements which will proceed Dn -

83
billing and accounting systems. This blueprint is to include a plan for
the procurement and implementation of the chosen systems (either turn-
key or supply only) and subsequent training of the staff in the concepts

hardware. The selected procurement programme must be acceptable to
and approved by IDA, in its capacity of provider of the funding, and
may include international tenders.

formal training will be provided to selected Kyrghyz Telecom financial
staff in the application and practice of market-oriented accounting
principles,   international   accounting   standards,   and    of
telecommunications industry standards and practices. It is expected that

lack of regular fillancial information within the Company. The regional
directorates operate as virtually autonomous enterprises reporting
financial information on an annual basis. There is a need for the
creation of regular management reports on costs, investments,
revenues, accounts receivable and debts. This must be carefully co-
ordinated with the implementation of new computerised accounting
systems and the implementation of an organisational structure.

Consultant will be responsible for co-ordinating and overseeing the

telecommunications project planing and implementation will be required for the
duration of the assignment. The Project Director should have, as a minimum, an
engineering degree with telecommunications specialisation.   The Project
Director may be supported by additional specialists in technical fields and
procurement, as required. The Project Director will be expected to be resident
in Bishkek for the duration of the assignment.  As far as possible, all
consultants, and especially the Project Co-ordinator, must be able to
