                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is prepared as part of the Implementation Support Mission which took place from March 18-29, 2013 and included both World Bank, representatives from AusAID, Unicef,
                         UNESCO and World Food Program. The Mission jointly reviewed the progress and outcomes after two years of implementation, and provided recommendations that would enable
                         the Program Development Objective (PDO) to be fully achieved.

                         OVERALL STATUS: The EFA-FTI program, which is jointly financed by the World Bank (through a US$30 million grant from the Global Partnership for Education – GPE, formerly
                         EFA-FTI) and AusAid (AUD 20.26 million), is contributing to the government’s overall basic education development program. The World Bank provides further assistance to the sub-

                         The level of commitment to the Program by the MoES, Program Coordination Unit (ECU) and all Implementing Units (IUs) continues to be high and efforts are made to ensure a
                         closer working relationship to avoid implementation delays. The ECU has been effective in providing general Program oversight and in coordinating the monthly Program Committee

                         meetings. The Mission encouraged the ECU and the IUs to continue to explore ways to effectively work together to solve daily issues and to closely monitor and document progress
                         during the last phase of implementation. The need to provide updated information about activities in the Progress Report is important and the timely submission of this report is
                         stipulated in the Grant Agreements between the Government of Lao PDR and donors.

                         Significant progress has been made over the past six months, with disbursement still averaging US$2 million per month. The disbursements have increased over the past three
                         months and now stand at: EFA-FTI-CF: US$14 million or 47% of the total Grant; and AusAID TF: AUD 12 million or 60% of the Grant. Future spending is estimated at US$8.5 million
                         for EFA-FTI-CF and US$6 million for AusAID TF.

                         Given the complexity of the Program and the challenging shorter-than-average implementation period of three years, the MoES is to be congratulated on its excellent achievements
                         to date. With the Community Based Contracting (CBC) activities covering 60 remote target districts, the numerous training activities undertaken, and the innovative nature of the
                         School Meal Program, the Community-Based School Readiness Program (Playgroup) and the Mobile Teacher Program, the EFA-FTI Program is making steady progress. Staff
                         training programs have been making good progress. The professionalism of the MoES staff, the interdepartmental collaboration and strong support from senior MoES officials have
                         combined to produce achievements during the early stage of Program implementation. The project is making good progress on all the quality inputs for the project. The VEDC
                         training, pre-service teacher training, teacher upgrading, in-service and principal training are all expected to be completed prior to the Program closing date. This is a substantial
                         achievement considering the original delay in quality inputs. Now that a large portion of the quality inputs are either completed or expected to be completed by the end of 2013, it was
                         recommended that the implementation team begin to think about how to monitor and measure the impact of all the training activities at the school level. The training inputs are
                         important since there is an ongoing need to fill teacher positions. However, it is equally as important to begin to understand how the program training is impacting the teaching and
                         learning in the classroom. This information can also help the MoES to begin to develop a feedback loop on the training programs as well as provide valuable information for the final
                         evaluation of the project.

                         Commendable accomplishments have been made but, challenges remain, particularly in the area of financial management, which is rated as “moderately satisfactory?. Although there
                         has been significant improvement over the past six months, there are issues relating to the current arrangements and practices that do not facilitate effective Program
                         implementation. Pending outstanding advances and weak expenditure reporting at the local level remain critical issues that need to be addressed.

                         AusAID funded Unicef to provide latrines and water supply to schools under the program. This work has been slightly delayed but both organizations confirmed that all schools under
                         the program will have latrines and water supply by the new Closing Date of Aug 31, 2014.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As a result of the initial start-up delays and progress made to date, the Mission concluded that additional one year extension would allowed the Program targets to be met and the
                         overall Program Development Objective (PDO) to be achieved. The government, AusAID and the Bank are preparing a one year Closing Date extension request to provide adequate
                         time to complete all Program activities and to achieve the PDO as planned.
