                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is prepared as part of the Implementation Support Mission which took place from September 2 - 10, 2013 and included both World Bank, representatives from AusAID,
                         Unicef, UNESCO and World Food Program. The Mission jointly reviewed the implementation progress since the March 2013 mission, and provided recommendations that would
                         enable the Program Development Objective (PDO) to be fully achieved by the August 30, 2014 Closing Date.

                         OVERALL STATUS: A one-year Closing Date extension was granted for both the AusAID and the GPE Grants. The current Closing Date is August 31, 2014. Given the complexity of
                         the Program, the MoES is to be congratulated on its excellent achievements to date. Significant progress has been made over the past six months, with disbursement averaging USD

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                            Report No: ISR11679



                         0.8 million per month. As of July 2013, the disbursements from two sources of funds stood at: EFA-FTI-CF: USD 17.2 million or 57 percent of the total Grant; and AusAID TF: AUD
                         13.5 million or 67 percent of the Grant. Planned spending over the next four months is estimated at USD 6.4 million (US$4.2 million for EFA-FTI-CF and US$2.2 million for AusAID
                         TF). MoES will need to remain attentive about sustaining these expenditure levels in order for program targets to be met.

                         The level of commitment to the Program by the MoES, ECU and all IUs remains high and efforts are continued to be made to ensure a closer working relationship to speed up
                         Program implementation. The ECU has been effective in providing general Program oversight. The Mission is also pleased to note the significant improvement in the quality of the
                         Progress Report. The report is well organized, documenting achievements, challenges, lessons learned and future planned activities for each sub-component.

                         With the CBC activities covering 56 remote target districts, the numerous training activities undertaken, and the innovative nature of the National School Meals Program, the
                         Community-Based School Readiness Program (Playgroup) and the Mobile Teacher Program, the EFA-FTI Program is making satisfactory progress toward the last phase of
                         implementation. Eighty-seven percent of the schools have been completed and the remaining construction is expected to be completed at Program Closing Date, with firm plans for
                         water and latrines to be fully provided by UNICEF’s WASH program. To date, 122 schools funded by the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund have latrines and water and 51 schools have water
                         supply. For AusAID-funded schools, 16 have latrines and water supply, and 11 schools have water supply. The Mission recommended that the provision of latrines and water supply
                         be monitored closely by concerned stakeholders.

                         The Program is making good progress on all the quality inputs. The VEDC training, pre-service teacher training, teacher upgrading, in-service and principal training are progressing
                         as expected with the exception of one activity: the 10 day in-service teacher training, which may not be completed by the project closing date. There are 700 teachers, out of the
                         4,500 teachers, scheduled for in-service training that may not be able to be funded by the Program due to limited resources for this activity. The ECU will monitor the funds so as to
                         ensure that as many teachers as possible can be trained prior to project closing in August 2014. The Mission reiterated the recommendation that the implementation team develop
                         specific qualitative evaluation activities to monitor and measure the impact of all the training activities at the school level. This is particularly the case for VEDCs and school principals
                         that are responsible for producing school improvement plans upon completion of their training. The Mission also recommended that the relevant IUs follow up with the 398 ethnic
                         teachers that received scholarships since they are back in their villages teaching for the first time. It will be important to see if the teachers remain in their positions and to draw
                         lessons learned from this program for any future investments in teacher education in ethnic villages.

                         Despite commendable accomplishments above, challenges remain, particularly in the area of financial management, which is rated as “moderately satisfactory.? Although there has
                         been significant improvement over the past six months, there are continuing issues relating to the current financial arrangements and practices that do not facilitate effective Program
                         implementation.
