SUMMARY
The proposed changes aim at supporting the project as it moves from the expansion stage
to the consolidation stage and ensuring its sustainability after closing. The proposed
modifications include: (i) changes to intermediate indicators, aimed at revising the
results framework to provide for indicators that have continued relevance and that can be
realistically measured at exit given project progress and the actual parameters of the
system established under the project; and (ii) reallocation of remaining loan proceeds to
address the financial requirements of the consolidation stage and to adjust for changes in
prices. The restructuring does not modify the PDO and prospects for achieving the PDO
under the restructured project remain positive.


PROJECT STATUS
The project has been performing satisfactorily. Outcomes have been positive during the
first two and a half years of project implementation. Most PDO and intermediate
indicators are being achieved as planned. Progress towards the achievement of the PDO
includes the expansion of the percentage of univocally identified physical and juridical
persons, which has already reached 92% and 55% respectively; the expansion to other
government agencies and programs of consistent common processes to identify entities
and assets, and the consolidation of the information exchange network, which maintains
97 percent availability. The expansion of the IT infrastructure of SINTyS is being
finalized, with the implementation of a safe room and the inauguration of a new location
with improved IT and information security, which contributes to ensure data protection
and accessibility. The project has initiated the consolidation phase, based on a greater
focus on services, the institutionalization of the program and data quality management.
In terms of implementation progress, the project has disbursed about 67% of the IBRD
loan, with project components and sub-components advancing satisfactorily as discussed
below.

Component 1 - Institutional and Legal Framework: The objective of this component is to
support the development and implementation of the legal and institutional framework
required to ensure the continued institutionalization of SINTyS in the Argentine public
sector at national, provincial and municipal levels.

Steady progress has been made in this component as SINTyS was incorporated into the
structure of the public administration as a National Directorate, with the approval of
Decree 78/07, followed by Decrees 486/10, 487/10 and 488/10 appointing the National
Director, the Director of Informational Technology Integration and the Director of
                                            5
Technology for Information Exchange. In addition, the move of SINTyS to a new
location, especially furnished to host the safe room, additional equipment and most of
SINTyS staff have further contributed to SINTyS institutionalization as well as the
increase in the budget allocation for the program (Decree 2052/10 that increases the
outstanding loans of CNCPS, to strengthen services provided by the SINTyS, financed by
IBRD Loan No. 7572). Currently 11 of the 23 provinces have SINTyS Provincial
Coordinating Units (PCU) and are interconnected to the network, processing information
exchange services to agencies of their respective jurisdictions in a decentralized way.
Progress has also been made in the definition of the legal framework that facilitates the
exchange of information conducted under SINTyS, which helps ensuring quality and
privacy.

Component 2 - Information Management and Data Quality Framework: The objective of
this component is to support SINTyS management information, with particular emphasis
on improving the data quality across the system.

SINTyS has established a successful data quality management at headquarters and in the
provinces with SINTyS nodes (11 provinces). The data quality services provided to the
provincial; nodes by central level include data standards for specific topics, templates,
personal training, validation of the results of the mapping data (cross) and integration. A
detailed data quality operational manual has been developed, with a methodology and
detailed instructions. The quality of data services provided by both the central office as
SINTyS provincial nodes to agencies include: presentation of the results of the data
mapping and individual applications for data integration.

Component 3 - Technological Framework for the Information Exchange: The objective
of this component is to support the expansion and institutionalization of information
exchange that would: (1) eliminate barriers to information exchange among participating
institutions by continuing the implementation and financing of nodes at the national and
provincial levels; and (2) assist municipalities participating in the system with technical
assistance and targeted financing for software and hardware.

Significant progress has been made in the acquisition, installation and operation of the
technological infrastructure for SINTyS. The new data center (safe room) was recently
put into operation which combined with all the other equipment ensures the SINTyS
counts with cutting edge technology to support the delivery of its services.

Component 4 – Information Security: The objective of this component is to support the
further development and implementation of a robust information security architecture and
framework to ensure that SINTyS can run operations safely and reliably.

Progress has been made in the implementation of SINTyS security controls of
information in the new location of Central SINTyS which hosts the new data center and
the Network Operations Center. In addition other physical and environmental security
controls including the uninterruptible power source, a generator for air conditioning
equipment, and monitoring system based on closed-circuit television contribute to create
a modern data center to support its activities in a safe and operationally effective way.
Once central SINTyS complete replication of their systems at the primary (new) location,
                                            6
the current location (secondary) will be used as a contingency site and will operate in a
"active-passive" mode.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Results/indicators: The restructuring proposes changes to the project’s results
framework and intermediate indicators. These changes aim at adapting the results
framework to properly reflect project progress as well as SINTyS challenges in face of
the consolidation phase. The following indicators are being changed
    • Component 1: The revision of four indicators in this component responds to the
       need to reflect the current institutional arrangement of SINTyS. The SINTyS
       Advisory Body (indicator 1,1.i) has been constituted as part of the CNPS, which
       holds monthly meetings and the Provincial Advisory Body (indicator 1,1.ii) has
       been replaced by the Annual meetings with provincial coordinators. Indicator
       1.2.i has been revised to clarify the role of the DNPDP in determining access
       rights to information. Indicator 1.2.ii has been revised, to clarify the fact that
       SINTyS cannot grant access to individual citizens as it is not the owner of the
       information.1 However, SINTyS will inform in its website to which agency the
       citizen need to go in case of errors by theme.
       The indicator associated with user’s forums (1.1.iii) has been dropped as the
       elaboration of data quality standards, M&E, infrastructure framework, etc. has
       been centralized in SINTyS.
    • Component 2: Indicators 2.1.i and 2.1.ii have been revised semantically, to
       properly reflect the implementation of information exchange standards.
       Indicators 2.2.vi and 2.2.vii associated with registries of student population have
       been dropped as the Project does not need to monitor LUA anymore to get the
       data for persons under 18 years old.
    • Component 3: Indicator 3.1.i has been dropped as it was related to a specific
       technology. Since SINTyS now interacts through different technologies, such as
       web services, there is no need for having an indicator like this. Indicator 3.2.i has
       been semantically revised.
See Annex 1 for more details on results indicators.

Financing:

     •    Project Costs. The proposed restructuring will not change the overall project cost
          and costs per component will be only slightly affected due to savings in the

  The pretended mechanism would certainly be useful for citizens, particularly for those who need to rectify errors,
even when it exceeds SINTyS's institutional mandate. However, there exist some constraints that would turn its
practical implementation unfeasible. Some of these constraints are: (i) In order to allow citizens to access their personal
data in compliance with national laws ('habeas data'), a mechanism for robust authentication has to be devised,
implemented and maintained, capacity that largely exceeds SINTyS's current possibilities. In order to develop that
capacity, SINTyS should grow considerably to allow for the required granularity country wide; (ii) By giving direct
access to citizens, SINTyS's operational model would change from G-to-G (government to government) into G-to-C
(government         to      citizen),     what      would         in        turn        increase       the       associated
information security risks by a manifold.

          acquisition of the safe room, inflation as well as depreciation of the exchange rate.
          Annex 2 summarizes the changes in the costs per component.

     •    Reallocations. Reallocations include an increase in the goods category, due to the
          need to continue with investment in IT infrastructure to support the provision of
          SINTyS services, as well as an increase in consultants’ services and non
          consultants’ services, due to inflation. Works associated with the installation of
          the safe room were not needed and consultant services provided by firms were
          less required due to the decision to protect information security and share as less
          as possible with external providers. Therefore, funds from categories (2) and (3.a)
          are reallocated to other categories. Relocations from category (5) correspond to
          the funds of the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) that were not used by project
          effectiveness and that are therefore reallocated to other categories. Due to delays
          in UNOPS procedures, there will be a change in the procurement agent, from
          UNOPS to the PIU in the use of the remaining funds of the PPF.
          All these require a reallocation of the loan proceeds as per below.

                      ARGENTINA: SOCIAL AND FISCAL NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM –SINTYS- II
Project Development Objective: The project's development objective is to identify social and/or fiscal attributes of physical and legal persons in Argentina, through a sustainable
information exchange system, aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of social services and fiscal programs at all levels of government in Argentina. The
specific objectives to be pursued under this operation are: (i) to expand and consolidate the network underlying the exchange of social and fiscal information among public agencies
at the national, provincial, and municipal levels of government, with provisions to ensure data protection, accessibility, and the quality and accuracy of information; and (ii) to
consolidate the institutionalization of SINTyS as an independent national entity responsible for coordinating and setting standards governing the exchange of information within
Argentina's public sector.

  The pretended mechanism would certainly be useful for citizens, particularly for those who need to rectify errors, even when it exceeds SINTyS's institutional mandate. However,
there exist some constraints that would turn its practical implementation unfeasible. Some of these constraints are: (i) In order to allow citizens to access their personal data in
compliance with national laws ('habeas data'), a mechanism for robust authentication has to be devised, implemented and maintained, capacity that largely exceeds SINTyS's current
possibilities. In order to develop that capacity, SINTyS should grow considerably to allow for the required granularity country wide; (ii) By giving direct access to citizens, SINTyS's

 The pretended mechanism would certainly be useful for citizens, particularly for those who need to rectify errors, even when it exceeds SINTyS's institutional mandate. However, there
exist some constraints that would turn its practical implementation unfeasible. Some of these constraints are: (i) In order to allow citizens to access their personal data in compliance
with national laws ('habeas data'), a mechanism for robust authentication has to be devised, implemented and maintained, capacity that largely exceeds SINTyS's current possibilities. In
order to develop that capacity, SINTyS should grow considerably to allow for the required granularity country wide; (ii) By giving direct access to citizens, SINTyS's operational model
would change from G-to-G (government to government) into G-to-C (government to citizen), what would in turn increase the associated
information security risks by a manifold..

Subcomponent 2: Operational Strengthening and Support of Security Aspects
Intermediate Result (Subcomponent 4.2):
The information security practice within SINTyS is performed by specialists with the appropriate level of skill sets and the greatest degree of commitment to the project.
The personnel forming the core group of the information security practice within SINTyS are well-trained in their respective areas and are required to upgrade their skill sets to meet the changing needs of
the environment.
Training programs are conducted periodically to maintain basic information security awareness among the internal user community at SINTyS Central and the provinces.
Every SINTyS personnel has to undergo the training program and endorse a Security Awareness Statement (ESAS).
A formal Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has to be established to ensure that SINTyS’ day-to-day operations are not affected in the event of natural or a constructed crisis situation.
The BCP has to be tested and rehearsed by simulating crisis scenarios and role-playing multiple times during a calendar year.
Results of the simulated tests have to be shared with Management and included into the BCP for future reference.
Security events at all five layers of system composition (application, desktop, network, server, database) have to be monitored and correlated to proactively detect any potential anomalies and raise an alert
for further attention.
Formation of a computer security incident response team (CSIRT) within SINTyS that clearly defined roles and responsibilities and a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) that have to be taken in
the wake of a computer related emergency situation.
Security framework works in an independent environment from SINTyS
