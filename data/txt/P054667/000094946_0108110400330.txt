3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The original objectives of the project were to:



*   help reduce the loss of human life and a deterioration of living standards that might result from the
floods and/or droughts caused by the 1997/98 El Nifio event;
*   help reduce the loss of, or damage to, econormic and social infrastructure that might result; and
*  help increase Peru's capacity to forecast and respond to future El Nifio phenomena.
The objectives were clearly stated. They were important for the country at the time. The previous El Niiio
event in 1982-83 had caused 100 inches of rain over six months in the coastal desert regions of Northern
Peru and severe drought conditions in the Andean highlands. There had been about US$2 billion in direct
and indirect losses to fisheries, agriculture, transportation, housing and other sectors. About 6 million
people had suffered from the effects of the earlier El Nifio event. The objectives of reducing these types of
losses and improving Peru's capacity to deal with future such disasters were clearly important.
Although the disaster mitigation and reconstruction objectives of this project were not specifically part of
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Peru at that time, they were consistent with the CAS's
emphasis of sustained growth and poverty alleviation. The southern Altiplano drought prone region and
the northern flood prone region contain many of the country's poorest communities. The northern region is
also an important center for national agricultural production.
The damage inflicted by the 1997-98 El Niiio phenomenon indicated that the objectives had been generally
well targeted. Growth in GDP in Peru fell from 6.9% in 1996 to 0.3% in 1997, due largely to the effects of
El Nifno. More than 100,000 houses in five departments were damaged. There were large losses in
infrastructure, primarily related to irrigation and transport. There was also extensive damage to education
facilities and other social infrastructure.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the project were not changed during implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
*   The prevention and emergency support consisted of the following sub-components:
Flood protection measures in northem coastal Peru, including river dredging, strengthening of
river defenses, cleaning/construction of storm drainage canals in urban and rural areas, bridge
strengthening, construction of temporary housing, and protection of archeological sites.
Drought mitigation measures in southern Peru's Altiplano, including water management
measures such as rehabilitation of wells, pumps, and small irrigation systems, production of
forage to mitigate the effects of a drought on livestock and a seed production program to
ensure the availability of seeds for the next planting season.
In the emergency phase the Bank would provide limited support, largely for the provision of
certain emergency equipment needed urgently during the flood disaster.
*   The reconstruction phase. Given that the full impact of El Nifio would only be ascertained in the
first months of 1998, it was not possible to define this phase completely at appraisal. It was
expected to consist of three sub-components:
- 2 -



Rehabilitation and reconstruction of public infrastructure such as: (a) hospitals, health posts,
and schools; (b) roads and bridges; (c) irrigation and drainage systems; (d) water supply and
electricity; and (e) river training.
Resettlement of families in flood prone areas. Permanent relocation of 6,000 families from
areas which are flood prone or where necessary for emergency preparedness.
Labor intensive rural public works. A safety net program for vulnerable groups in the Andean
highlands that would also strengthen sustainable agriculture in these drought prone areas.
* Institutional Support.
Expertise, training and equipment to assist agencies responsible for predicting, monitoring and
mitigating future El Ninlo events.
Preparation of a government strategy for disaster forecasting and management.
Technical assistance to the Office of Investments of the Ministry of Economy and Finance for
project implementation.
The Bank loan (No. 4250-PE) of US$150 million and a separate parallel loan from the Inter-American
Development Bank (No. 1058/OC-PE) for US$150 million, were signed in December 1997. The Bank
loan became effective in the same month. The government was to make a counterpart contribution of
US$130 million (of which US$65 million was counterpart funding for the Bank loan), bringing the total for
the Bank supported program to US$215 million and for the entire El Nino program in Peru to US$430
million.
The components were structured to meet the objectives. The government had declared a state of emergency
on June 19, 1997 and had begun to plan emergency prevention measures at that time. The prevention
component was designed to undertake rehabilitation and maintenance works before the El Niiio event
occurred in order to minimize damage to people and property, such as cleaning riverbeds, gullies and
drains. Drought mitigation measures would assist small farming in the drought prone highland areas. It
was recognized that it would be difficult to predict exactly where prevention works would be needed, but in
many cases the investments would be needed anyway to make up for deferred maintenance, even if
additional storm or drought damage did not occur.
The emergency component was small and limited to providing emergency equipment such as mobile bridge
structures and power plants which was an appropriate provision given the uncertainty of the impact of the
disaster. Immediate rehabilitation activities to restore basic productive capacity were to be financed by
IDB.
Components of the reconstruction phase could only be listed generically, reflecting the types of damage
experienced during previous El Ninio events. During implementation it would be necessary to reallocate
funds in accordance with the damage that actually occurred. Most of the loan proceeds, about two-thirds,
were allocated for the reconstruction phase.
At appraisal it was recognized that it was necessary to develop adequate institutional capacity to forecast
and manage future natural disasters, and technical assistance was provided for this purpose. The overall El
Nifio program (PAEFEN) was placed under a high level Committee for Reconstruction (CEREN) made up
- 3 -



by eight ministers and chaired by the Prime Minister. A Special Commission of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance was appointed to provide technical support on economic and financing matters, and a program
coordinating unit (UCP) was established to assist CEREN in coordinating the activities of the implementing
agencies and administering loan accounts. A consultant was to be recruited to support UCP. Sub-project
execution was to be done by specialized technical and administrative agencies of the government, some of
which required institutional strengthening.
3.4 Revised Components:
Most of the emergency activities were financed by the Government of Peru and other donors. This
component was deleted from the Bank loan, and the USS5 million allocated to it were reallocated to
consultant services under the reconstruction phase in an amendment to the loan agreement of December 29,
1999.
Drought conditions in the southern Altiplano region were less severe than expected. Funds originally
allocated for reconstruction works in that region were reallocated to the reconstruction of roads and bridges
and irrigation systems in the northem region. It was agreed that IDB would mainly finance major primary
roads and the Bank would finance secondary and tertiary roads. However, at that time there was no
recognition that the roads to be financed by the Bank would be more difficult and time consuming to
implement during the short remaining project period, especially given institutional constraints within the
DGC. The proposed resettlement of 6,000 families was deleted from the project because a resettlement
plan could not be agreed upon with government.
The prevention works were completed between July and November 1997, before the loan agreement was
signed on December 17, 1997. Prevention works undertaken after June 19,1997 were made eligible for
retroactive financing to be disbursed after the loan became effective.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
In the face of an imminent disaster of national proportions, the project was prepared and processed quickly
(three months from first mission to signing). The project documentation contained an appropriate balance
of detail and flexibility, given the uncertainty of the impacts of the phenomenon. However, the institutional
arrangements did not provide sufficient clarity regarding overall leadership for the program, since the Prime
Minister was appointed a chairman of the CEREN while the UCP was placed under the Minister of
Economy and Finance. From the outset this led to disagreements and lack of coordination in the definition
and execution of activities. Gradually these issues were resolved as overall responsibility for the project
was more clearly placed with the MEF.
The project was processed expeditiously and included very beneficial prevention activities and long-term
institutional development provisions. However, the structure and size of the loan were risky. With a project
implementation period of only three years, uncertainty about the length and impacts of the phenomenon and
two-thirds of the disbursements to be made during the reconstruction phase, full disbursement of the
US$150 million loan was very amnbitious. The average disbursement profile in Peru of 5 to 6 years for
infrastructure projects should have raised concem about the feasibility of completing a project of this size
and content within the allotted time period (and taking into account that works can only be implemented
for eight months per year) . On balance, therefore, quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
-4 -



There is lack of historical data to use as points of comparison in evaluating outcome, and it is not feasible
to evaluate a scenario without the project.   Therefore it is not possible to provide a quantitative
assessment of achievement of the objectives. However, qualitative information from technical audits, site
visits, and reports from other agencies suggest that significant progress was made in meeting the
development objectives of the project:
Loss of human life and deterioration of living standards were less than expected and damage to economic
and social infrastructure was reduced. In the drought prone southern highlands the effects of El Nifno were
less than expected. The main impacts were in the northem flood prone areas where a large program was
required to protect transport and irrigation infrastructure as well as urban centers.
Reconstruction works were needed especially in the northern flood prone areas and project funds were
reallocated for this purpose. Most of this effort involved the reconstruction of roads and bridges and
restoring irrigation systems. However, it was not possible to restore all the assets that were targeted within
the project period, and a large amount of the project amount had to be cancelled (see section 5.4).
Nevertheless, all of the studies in preparation for large investments (roads and bridges) were successfully
completed and remain available for future investment programs.
The project contributed significantly to increasing Peru's capacity to forecast and respond to future El Nifno
events.   The institutional capacity for climate forecasting was increased by improving coordination
between four key government agencies and establishing state-of-the-art systems for real time data collection
and atmospheric and oceanographic modeling. Thirty-two experts from four agencies were trained in
climate and temperature forecasting and contacts have been established with intemational weather
forecasting agencies (see section 4.5).
The original project design was both ambitious and risky. While the project contributed significantly to
increasing Peru's capacity to forecast and respond to future El Nino events, it only achieved partial
restoration of assets originally targeted within the project period, and about 55% of the loan amount had to
be cancelled. On balance, therefore, the project outcome is rated unsatisfactory.
4.2 Outputs bv components:
Prevention and Emergency Component
(a) Prevention. The prevention works were completed between July and November 1997, before the loan
agreement was signed on December 17, 1997. Prevention works undertaken after June 19, 1997 were
eligible for retroactive financing to be disbursed after the loan became effective. There were 116
prevention sub-projects for a total of US$41.2 million for which the Bank contributed US$28.3 million.
This component included flood protection measures in the northern and coastal areas (river dredging,
strengthening of river defenses, cleaning and construction of storm drainage canals, and bridge
strengthening). Prevention works originally planned for the southem highlands were not carried out. The
prevention works were completed on schedule, and an extemal audit firm certified that they were
satisfactorily completed with competitively priced contracts. Works carried out during the prevention phase
benefited about 550,000 people. An enviromnental audit confirmed that these works had been consistent
with sound environmental practices.
(b) Emergency. Emergency measures were undertaken during the phenomenon, but the government decided
to use mainly its own funds and financing from the IDB for this effort. The US$5 million originally
- 5 -



allocated for this purpose at appraisal was reallocated for consultant service in a loan amendment agreed
upon at the end of 1999.
Reconstruction component.
By the end of August 1998 the first assessment of reconstruction requirements was completed, amounting
to about USS I billion, of which 65% was in the transport sector and 12.5% was in agriculture. The Bank
requested the agencies in the concerned sectors to prepare lists of sub-projects for financing, including more
detailed cost estimates and criteria for sub-project selection. These proposals were received for Bank
financing consisting of about USS 110 million for secondary and tertiary road and bridge reconstruction by
the DGC and US$51 million of irrigation works by INADE. The Bank agreed to these proposals near the
end of 1998. However, the Bank recognized that it would be difficult to complete this program within the
remaining two years of implementation and recommended that additional consultants be employed to
prepare these investments and ensure the technical and economic feasibility, especially for the road and
bridge reconstruction sub-component.
(a) Roads and Bridges. The design work by private consultants progressed slowly and many of the road
sections were over designed. The consequent need to revise designs led to a protracted discussion between
the UCP and the DGC and delays. By August 1999 a supervision mission noted that it would be difficult to
fully complete this component by the closing date. This was further confirmed during a short review in
December 1999. By April 2000 one bid had come in at 40% over estimate and the Bank noted a more
serious problem. Due to fiscal constraints, counterpart funding for the year 2000 for the El Nifno project
had to be drastically reduced. The government requested an extension of the closing date, but the Bank
indicated this would not be possible because it was an "emergency" project and recommended a partial
cancellation of US$81 million. Because of this, the project was rated unsatisfactory for development
objectives and implementation progress and highly unsatisfactory for counterpart funds. A cancellation of
US$81 million was finally agreed upon in September 2000, retroactive to July 2000. Nevertheless, at the
end of the project the Bank had financed 13 key bridges out of 37 for which designs had been prepared.
Also by the end of the project, technical studies were completed for 9 packages of key secondary and
tertiary roads. Bank missions played an important role in insuring the use of appropriate and affordable
standards in the preparation of these designs. Given the technical, institutional and counterpart financing
constraints, this proved to be a more realistic outcome than the targets envisioned at the preparation stage.
(b) Irrigation. Preparation of this component also was delayed, although it progressed more rapidly than
the road and bridge component. About US$ 35 million in Bank fmancing was allocated for irrigation
sub-projects under INADE. The first phase of the works (40%) was contracted in early 1999, but the
amount of funding was substantially reduced in 2000 because of counterpart funding limitations. By
project completion the Bank had nevertheless financed USS19.2 million of these works consisting mainly of
access roads and hydrologic infrastructure for irrigation systems in nine major irrigation zones. The works
are important elements of the irrigation system and are of good quality.
(c) Rural Public Works. Because the impact of the phenomenon on drought in the highlands was less
severe than originally expected, the Government financed these works through ongoing programs and
allocated the bulk of the Bank financing to the transport and irrigation sectors.
(d) Resettlement. After the El Nifno event, the government estimated that some 30,000 families would not
be able to return to their homes and would have to be resettled, and the Bank was asked to finance part of
the resettlement cost. By late 1998 the government had not reached a consensus on resettlement policy and
requested that funds originally intended for this purpose be used for reconstruction works. The Bank
- 6-



agreed to this proposal. Only limited resettlement was carried out by the Government with its own funds.
Institutional Development.
(a) Assistance to the Project Coordination Unit. A management consulting firm was recruited early in the
project period to assist with project implementation. As a result, an Operations Manual was prepared, an
inventory of damage was undertaken, a satellite office was established in the northem part of the country
where most of the reconstruction work took place, and technical, economic and environmental studies were
carried out for all sub-projects financed under the loan. A substantial database of projects has been
established that can be used for future reference for defining technical standards and evaluating unit costs
for similar infrastructure projects.
(b) Preparation for Future Disaster Forecasting and Management
By the end of the project substantial progress had been made in developing Peru's capacity to forecast and
respond to future El Nifio events through the establishment of state-of-the-art systems for real time data
collection and modeling of the ocean and the atmosphere (see Section 4.5).
Environmental Im=act
Ex-post environmental assessments were carried out at the end of 1998 for the emergency preventive
measures implemented from July to December 1997 and showed that environmental impacts had been
minimal. Proposed reconstruction projects were screened for potential impacts and where necessary
Environmental Management Plans were submitted prior to beginning any works. UCP followed up on
these with inspections during implementation. In a few cases corrections were made. Irrigation works
were undertaken in close coordination with beneficiaries, and there were no conflicts or complaints from
inhabitants or farmers.
Output indicators are given in Annex 1.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Economic assessment was required for major reconstruction components such as major highways and
bridges and major components of irrigation systems. Investments not yielding 12% were given further
scrutiny and their design was subject to modification. This became especially critical for roads, because
by mid 1999 preparation studies were showing high unit costs for road rehabilitation and low traffic
counts. At that time it was agreed that standards would have to be reevaluated.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial rates of return were not calculated, given the nature and size of investments financed under the
project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
As a result of provision of equipment and technical assistance under the project, a network of four scientific
agencies (ENFEN), which had previously operated independently, was brought together to develop an
integrated weather and oceanographic forecasting system. These agencies were the Peruvian Institute of the
Sea (IMARPE), under the Ministry of Fisheries, which is responsible for scientific and technological
-7 -



research for sustainable use of oceanic resources; the Geophysical Institute of Peru (IGP), under the
Ministry of Education, which is responsible for research and training in geophysics; the Directorate of
Oceanography and Navigation (DNH), under the Peruvian Navy, which is responsible for oceanic research
and regulation; and the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service  (SENAHMI), under the
Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for meteorological and hydrological forecasting and monitoring.
These agencies were able to overcome a history of independent action by reaching a consensus on their
respective roles and responsibilities in forecasting and assessing El Nifio phenomena and operating in a
coordinated manner.
At project completion ENFEN had developed an integrated forecasting system which consists of the
following key elements: (i) weather observation and data collection; (ii) communications; (iii) data
management; (iv) modeling; and (v) human resource development. These sophisticated systems are
technologically comparable with and coordinated with other international systems such as NOAA in the
United States and systems in Brazil and the Pacific Rim. Establishing these systems represents a major
achievement, but their maintenance and further development are a substantial challenge. Linking these
systems with response capacity also remains a challenge for the future.
Technical assistance provided under the project was successful in developing the capacity of UCP to
manage and coordinate the implementation of a complex project and to establish a data base (e.g., works
requirements, impact assessments, data bases, contractor availablity) which would be available for
undertaking future prevention works and providing disaster response.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
It was not possible to predict precisely where and how severely the effects of El Nifo would be felt. In the
absence of the type of prediction capacity that is now being established, there was no alternative to the
assumption that the El Niuo phenomenon would be similar to previous experience.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Starting at the end of 1999, the government was unable to provide adequate counterpart funding for the
project which resulted in delayed implementation and ultimately a much reduced scope of works under the
project than previously planned. This was a contributing factor in the decision to cancel US$81 million
from the loan amount on July 17, 2000, late in the project period.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
After the El Nino phenomenon the MTC decided that the road rehabilitation should be used as an
opportunity to upgrade the technical characteristics of the roads. In most cases the new designs led to
higher costs that could not be justified economically given project traffic levels. This led to discussions and
delays in the finalization of plans and bidding documents. By the time the studies were revised, it was too
late to initiate bidding because the loan closing date was only six months away.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The original total project cost was established at US$215 million, of which the Bank was to finance
US$150 million. A PPF of USS500,000 had been established at appraisal but was not used. Most of the
components and their costs were not defined until after the end of the El Niiio event.

Because of delays in the reconstruction phase, of the original Bank fmnancing of USS150 million, US$81
rnillion were cancelled from the loan amount on July 2000 leaving only USS69. After this cancellation,
loan funds remained to finance about US$29 million for prevention works, US$27 million were for
reconstruction, mainly irrigation, US$6 million were for institutional strengthening and US$4 million were
for project management. The final total cost of the project was about US$91 million. A further
cancellation of US$2.0 million was made at the time of closing of the loan accounts. Detailed project costs
and financing are presented in Annex 2.
Under the parallel IDB financed project there was a USS 150 million loan and a US$65 million counterpart
contribution. As of September 30, 2000, about USS 113 million had been disbursed from the IDB loan and
about USS47 million in counterpart funding. As with the Bank loan, most of the shortfall in investment
was in the reconstruction phase.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Many works during the prevention phase such as dredging rivers and protecting bridges were important for
mitigating the impact of the El Nifio phenomenon, but by their nature they were temporary. Bridge and
irrigation works were designed and implemented with the express purpose of improving their durability
under El Nifio type stress. Their maintenance will be the responsibility of the permanent public agencies
with moderate capacity for this purpose, INADE (irrigation) and DGC (bridges).
The sustainability of the institutional development achievements for future disaster forecasting will depend
on continuing cooperation amnong the agencies under ENFEN, whether budgetary resources continue to be
available to these agencies, and their ability to develop and retain qualified professionals. The agencies
participating in ENFEN, although coming from different ministries and perspectives, have achieved a
unprecedented level of cooperation during the project which they are committed to sustain.  During the
project each agency was required by the government to make a commitrnent to financing these activities for
at least ten years, which they did. These are positive commitments which bode well for sustainability.
Nevertheless, future budget allocations will remain susceptible to the economic environment. In spite of
this reservation, sustainability of this project achievement is considered likely.
UCP is expected to remain in existence until the end of 2001 and is likely to be extended beyond this date
with financing from IDB. While the existence of UCP beyond this period is uncertain, the core expertise of
competent professionals created under the project could be mobilized in the future under the Ministry of
Finance for disaster prevention and response.
Overall, sustainability is rated likely.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Transition to regular operations should be a smooth process. The main implementing agencies, DGC and
INADE, are already taking responsibility for operation and maintenance. The four agencies participating
in ENFEN are also taking responsibility for maintaining data collection and forecasting systems.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
-9-



7.1 Lending:
The Bank responded quickly to this request for emergency assistance. It fielded two preparation missions in
quick succession in September and October 1997, before the phenomenon occurred, recognizing the
importance of prevention. Negotiations and Board approval took place in November 1997, and the Loan
Agreement was signed in mid November. The inclusion of the institutional development component was an
important element towards developing a long-term perspective. However, the size and structure of the loan
posed serious risks (see section 3.5). This should have been highlighted, stipulating that a detailed review
of the content of the investment program would take place after the full impact of the phenomenon was
known and indicating that a reassessment of the scale, mix and implementation period of the reconstruction
program could be required.
In spite of the expeditious project preparation under emergency circumstances, the project was large and
risky.  In addition to short-term prevention and rehabilitation works, about two-thirds of the project
consisted of long-term investments which were unlikely to be implemented within a three year time frame,
especially given the time needed to assess and define sub-projects after the phenomenon had occurred. On
balance, therefore, lending is rated unsatisfactory.
7.2 Stupervision:
There were ten supervision missions from early 1998 to completion, an average of three per year. Most
missions had at least one engineer, a water resources specialist and a roads specialist. They were, however,
usually short in duration because most mission members were also involved in supervising other El Nifio
projects. Once the size of the investment requirements was known (around the end of 1998) and it was
recognized that design of some road components would have to be modified, missions correctly identified
that it would be difficult to complete the project on schedule. A comprehensive mid-term review as
originally planned for December 1998 would have been appropriate at that time, but it did not occur.
However, the borrower was determined to finish the project within its original scope and was reluctant to
contemplate a partial cancellation.   Even if a major review had taken place, it is doubtful that a
signification reduction in the project scope could have been achieved, given the government's views that the
closing date should be extended. A decision to reduce the scope of the project was not made until late in
the project period when the Bank reiterated its position that it would not extend the loan beyond the closing
date.
Without a determined and successful supervision effort from the Bank (and close monitoring from UCP),
the institutional development component for disaster forecasting would not have been achieved. Bank
supervision teams brought the agencies participating in ENFEN together and put them in contact and
arranged training with specialized international agencies and agencies in neighboring countries.  Bank
supervision missions also played an important role in assuring appropriate and cost effective designs for
roads (see section 4.2).
Although the Bank was not able to convince the borrower to proceed within early cancellation, it played a
critical role in institutional development and successfully supervised a large program of rehabilitation and
prevention works. On balance,therefore, Bank performance during supervision is rated satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The project was large and necessarily undefined at appraisal which posed serious risks for implementation.
There were insufficient safeguards for reassessing the project and its scope after the impact of the disaster
- 1 0 -



was known. However, the Bank did respond quickly and flexibly to the emergency. During supervision it
correctly identified the need to reassess and reduce the project, particularly the roads component.  The
government only agreed to this very late in the project period. The Bank successfully supervised well the
works and designs which were undertaken and was particularly successful in supervising the institutional
development component. Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance during preparation was satisfactory. Government anticipated the disaster as far in
advance as possible, and it programmed and carried out preventive measures with its own funds. It also
mobilized a large external support effort rapidly, with high level political commitment. It included the
institutional development component and gave it high-level support.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
In spite of a number of important achievements, government performance during implementation was
marginally unsatisfactory. There were problems with the clarity of institutional responsibilities at the
beginning of implementation and the availability of counterpart funds that contributed to delays in
implementation. The borrower was responsible for delays in anticipating and reacting to changes in the
project environment and in recognizing the need to reduce the size of the project and the loan.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
There were initial difficulties in setting up the UCP and establishing coordinating arrangements with
implementing agencies. With the help of consultants, UCP became an effective coordinating agency which
has managed to develop a detailed data bank of sub-projects and establish project assessment and
implementation procedures which, if properly maintained, would be useful to respond before and during
future disasters.
The implementing agencies managed to complete successful prevention and emergency phases (the latter
financed mainly by IDB).  During the reconstruction phase and despite a deteriorating economic
environment, INADE succeeded in implementing many key elements of its investment program within a
short time frame. However, the perfornance of DGC was inadequate; many roads were overdesigned and
had inadequate economic justification. DGC was able to complete only part of the bridge reconstruction
program, but it undertook all the feasibility studies, including revisions of standards, for road
reconstruction, which are available for future investment programs.
The four institutions participating in ENFEN (IMARPE, IGP, DHN and SENAMHI) overcarne their initial
differences and managed to plan and complete their respective programs very satisfactorily.
With the exception of DGC, the performance of implementing agencies is satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Borrower performance is rated marginally satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
*   To design projects in anticipation of future disasters such as El Nino, the availability of the following
- 1 1 -



types of updated information is crucial:
(i) A database on population in areas affected, tasks and types of professionals needed, typical
works, unit costs, etc.
(ii) Historic information about occurrences and impacts of similar events.
(iii) Detailed design standards, unit costs and implementation requirements for different types of
works, including procurement arrangements, personnel and training requirements.
(iv) Capacity of consulting and contracting industry.
*   Prevention measures can have a substantial impact on the reduction of social and economic losses.
Countries with a history of El Ninio type phenomena should undertake contingency planning and
preventive measures. Many of these types of investments should be incorporated in nomnal sector
investment programs during non-emergency periods.
*   Reconstruction requires careful assessment and a long-term effort that generally extends beyond the
normal three-year implementation period of Bank-assisted emergency operations. Therefore, priority in
this type of project should be given to prevention, immediate measures to reactivate economic activity
and careful assessment of longer-term reconstruction priorities and designs. Special attention should
be paid to flexibility of project design and scope, realism of development objectives and methodology
for the measurement of impact. If major reconstruction investments are included in an emergency
project, as in the case of this project, there should be an explicit provision at the design stage for a
review of project design and scope after the actual damages are assessed. However, it may be more
practical to establish a separate loan for this purpose or to reallocate resources from existing loans.
*   When a natural disaster is of national proportions as was the case in Peru, the Bank response should
not be limited to the provision of emergency assistance but should also include an update of the CAS in
light of potential changes in the country's overall investment priorities.
More specific lessons include:
*   The institutional arrangements now in place for predicting El Nifio phenomena constitute a substantial
improvement and should be maintained.
*   A clear agreement on responsibilities for project implementation at inception is more important than the
location of lead responsibility.
*   When parallel financing is used, a clear separation of sub-sector and/or geographic financing
responsibilities could lead to more efficient implementation.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
Economnic assessment was required for major reconstruction components such as major highways and
bridges and major components of irrigation systems. Investmnents not yielding 12% were given further
scrutiny and their design was subject to modification. This became especially critical for roads, because
by mid 1999 preparation studies were showing high unit costs for road rehabilitation and low traffic
counts. At that time it was agreed that standards would have to be reevaluated.

Additional Annex 8.B orrower's Evaluation Report
INFORME DE CIERRE DEL CONVENIO DE PRESTAMO NO 4250-PE
1.ANTECEDENTES
1.1 Problematica del Fenomeno El Nino y Dainos Producidos
A. Fen6meno El Niiio
El Peru esta expuesto desde hace 4,500 aiios a la ocurrencia peri6dica del Fen6meno
hidrometeorol6gico de "El Nifio", tambien denominado "ENOS" (El Niio Oscilaci6n Sur), el ultimo
evento ocurri6 en diciembre de 1997 a abril de 1998 y el anterior en el periodo 1982-83, en ambos
casos se produjeron fuertes dafios.
El Nifio se inicia con el calentamiento del mar (Oceano Pacifico), que suministra energia de calor a la
atm6sfera y produce la actividad convectiva y turbulencia del aire, ocasionando cambios
climatol6gicos, que generan lluvias torrenciales que se precipitan en el centro de la Costa occidental
sudamericana, incrementando las descargas de los rios a niveles torrenciales, generando sus desbordes
e inundaciones sobre las areas pobladas y su infraestructura de servicios (vial, saneamiento, hidraulica,
etc.) e infraestructura de producci6n (areas agricolas, industrias, centros mineros, etc.).
B. Dafios Producidos por el Fen6meno El Niiio 1997-98
La producci6n nacional fue fuertemente afectada cayendo el Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) de 6.9% en
1997 a 0.3% en 1998. La poblaci6n afectada fue de 548,569 personas, 50.2% varones y 49.9%
mujeres. Del total 52.2% manifest6 problemas de salud por enfermedades diarreicas, de la piel y
conjuntivitis. Fueron afectadas 107,527 viviendas de las cuales el 30 % fueron destruidas.
El documento "Evaluaci6n de las Viviendas, Poblaci6n e Infraestructura Basica del Estado Afectada por
el Fen6meno de El Nino", Julio 1998, INEI, reporta danios en la infraestructura basica por US$1,262
millones, el sector mas afectado fue Transportes con USS443 rmillones (carreteras US$297 rnillones,
puentes US$68 millones, etc.), seguido de Agricultura USS245.4 rnillones (obras de riego US$71.6
millones y areas agricolas dafiadas US$173.8 mnillones).
En  Educaci6n los danos fueron por US$209 millones (2870 locales escolares). En proyectos
hidriulicos principales US$96 mnillones. En infraestructura de agua y alcantarillado US$65.6 rnillones.
En Salud los danios son por USS60.5 millones (560 centros de salud). En otros sectores (Energia y
Minas, Justicia, Pesqueria, etc.) los dafios llegan a USS142.5 rnillones.
1.2 Programa de Apoyo a la Emergencia Fen6meno El Niiio (PAEFEN)
Para mitigar los efectos del iltimo Nifio (1997-98), el Gobiemo del Peru desarroll6 el Programa de
Apoyo a la Emergencia Fen6meno El Nifo (PAEFEN), cuyo objetivo es minimizar las perdidas de
vidas humanas y los dafios materiales en la infraestructura de servicios y de producci6n.
El Gobiemo en 1997 declar6 en emergencia en 15 departamentos, de los 23 que confornan la divisi6n
politica del Peri. Para el financiarniento del PAEFEN suscribi6 en diciembre de 1997 dos Convenios
- 22 -



de Prestamo, uno con el BIRF (N 4250-PE) y otro con el BID (NO 1058/OC-PE), por USS150
millones cada uno, complementados con el aporte local de USS'130 millones, siendo el total del
fmanciarniento programado US$430 millones.
Para la operaci6n del PAEFEN, se crearon tres organismos: el Comite Ejecutivo de Reconstrucci6n de
El Niho (CEREN), conformado por ocho Ministros de Estado, la Comisi6n Especial integrada por
funcionarios de alto nivel del Ministerio de Economia y Finanzas, ambos, en reuniones mensuales
aprobaron, en sus respectivas instancias los proyectos y sus inversiones. El tercer organismo es la
Unidad Coordinadora del Programa (UCP).
La UCP de acuerdo a la Secci6n 1.02. "h" del Convenio de Prestamo, tiene a su cargo la
administraci6n e implementacion del PAEFEN a traves de un Equipo de Coordinaci6n, establecido en
la Oficina de Inversiones del MEF, asistida por la empresa consultora C. Lotti & Associati en los
aspectos tecnicos y ambientales. Los proyectos del PAEFEN se Ilevan a cabo a traves de organismos
Sub-Ejecutores, que son entes especializados permanentes de los sectores del gobierno, que ejecutan
los programas regulares de estudios y obras.
El PAEFEN se inici6 en enero de 1998 y debe operar hasta el 2001, cuando culmine el financiamiento
del BID y tiene cuatro Componentes, tres comprenden la estrategia de actuaci6n frente al evento
(Prevenci6n, Emergencia y Reconstrucci6n) y uno es el Fortalecimiento Institucional, con fines de
mejorar la capacidad de pron6sticos de El Nifio.
La ejecuci6n de todos los Componentes ha comprendido el desarrollo de 1629 proyectos, de los cuales
348 corresponden al fmanciamiento del BIRF y 1281 al BID.
2. CONVENIO DE PRESTAMO NO 4250-PE
2.1 Alcances y Desarrollo
El Decreto Supremo N 167-97-EF autoriza el endeudamiento extemo con el BIRF, el 17/12/97 se
suscribe el Convenio de Prestamo N 4250-PE por USS 150 millones, cuya fecha de cierre es el
31/12/2000 y ha sido extendida hasta el 31/03/2001. para ejecutar algunos gastos pendientes de
consultorias y obras.
Al cierre del prestamo se ha ejecutado US$69 millones, esto debido a que el periodo requerido fue
mayor al previsto, para la ejecuci6n de las obras de reconstrucci6n principalmente las carreteras, entre
otros. Dada la imposibilidad de extender dicho periodo, el Gobiemo solicit6 al BIRF cancelar
parcialmente el monto del prestamo de US$81 millones y fue atendida por el BIRF con fecha de 17 de
julio del 2000.
Los alcances del Convenio de Prestamo son los de brindar apoyo al Gobiemo Peruano, ante la
emergencia planteada por la ocurrencia del Fen6meno, en:
*   Reducir la perdida de vidas humanas y el deterioro de los estindares de vida.
* Prevenir los dafios a la infraestructura social y econ6mica;
* Rehabilitar la infraestructura social daiiada por El Nifio; y
* Reforzar la capacidad de las instituciones gubemamentales encargadas de pronosticar fenomenos
climatol6gicos.

2.2 Ejecuci6n Segun Categorias de Desembolsos
Las Categorias de Desembolsos del Convenio (SCHEDULE 1) fueron modificadas en dos
oportunidades, la primera solicitud del Gobiemo corresponde al Oficio N 662-99-EF/75.22,
(13/08/1999), atendida por el BIRF en la Carta del 29 de diciembre de 1999, y la segunda al Oficio N
474 -2000 -EF/75.22 (17/07/2000) para la cancelaci6n parcial del Convenio de Prestamo por
USS81.0 millones, atendida por el BIRF con la Carta del 13 de setiembre del 2000.
2.3 Enmiendas y Modificaciones a la Fecha de Cierre de Algunos Proyectos
*   El 25 de Agosto del 2000 el Gobiemo solicit6 al BIRF (Oficio N 997-2000-EF/68.01-FNI&O),
una enmienda al Convenio para financiar parcialmente las obras de 37 puentes ubicados fuera del
area de emergencia, establecida en el Convenio. Estos puentes correspondian al fmanciamiento del
BIRF del Convenio de Prestamo N 3717-PE cuya fecha de cierre fue el 30 de junio del 2000 a
cargo del Prograrna de Reconstrucci6n de Infraestructura Vial (PRT) del Ministerio de
Transportes.
-   El BIRF en la Carta del 6 de octubre del 2000, concord6 con el Gobiemo en establecer en la
Seccion 1.02 (a) del Convenio de Prestamo extender como "areas elegibles" al departamento de
Amazonas (provincias de Bagua, Condorcanqui y Bongara) y el departamento de San Martin
(provincias de Tocache y Mariscal Caceres), y de esta forma atender el fmanciarniento parcial
solicitado de las obras de puentes.
*   El Gobiemo (Oficio N 1408-2000-EF/68.0FNINO del 29/11/2000), solicit6 al BIRF la No
Objeci6n para ampliar la fecha de cierre del Convenio hasta el 31 de enero del 2001, para la
operacion de la empresa C. Lotti (asesora de la UCP) y la adquisici6n de dos radares por
US$110,429.52 del Componente Reforzarniento Institucional. El BIRF con Carta del 04 de
diciembre del 2000 declar6 procedente esta solicitud.
* El Gobiemo (Oficio N 027-2001-EF/75.22 del 10/01/2001), solicit6 aJ BIRF la No Objeci6n para
autorizar gastos realizados hasta el 31 de marzo del 2001 de los rubros: Direcci6n General de
Carninos por US$901,134.2 (cancelaci6n de las obras y supervision de 13 puentes) y del INADE
por US$388,725.4 para cancelaci6n de estudios y obras hidriulicas. El BIRF con Carta del 30 de
enero del 2001, como una excepci6n, consider6 procedente la solicitud.
2.4 Ejecucion Fisica y Financiera al Cierre del Convenio de Prestamo
La ejecuci6n por Componentes se describe a continuaci6n.
A. Componente Apoyo a la Prevenci6n y Ia Emergencia.
Fase de Prevenci6n
Comprendio los 116 proyectos ejecutados antes de la ocurrencia del Fen6meno, de julio a
diciembre de 1997, y corresponden a descolmataci6n y limpieza de cauces de rios, quebradas,
drenes y canales de riego, habilitaci6n de obras de defensa riberefias, etc. La ejecuci6n financiera
fue de US$40.3 rnillones (US$12.1 millones del gobierno y US$28.2 rnillones del BIRF),
desembolsados en enero de 1998, como reconocimiento de gastos. El inventario de los proyectos
fue realizado por las empresas HASKONING-LAGESA.
- 24 -



Los organismos Sub-ejecutores de los 116 proyectos han sido: Consejos Transitorios de
Administraci6n Regional (CTARs) 53 proyectos por US$13.21 millones, Ministerio de Agricultura
21 proyectos por US$5.0 millones, Direcci6n General de Caminos del Ministerio de Transportes 17
proyectos por US$2.45 millones y el Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo (INADE) 25 proyectos por
US$7.61 millones.
Fase de Emergencia
Se ejecutaron dos proyectos a cargo de la DGC-MTC por US$0.62 millones de endeudamiento
extemo. Uno corresponde a la rehabilitaci6n de las carretera Puente Paurcatambo - Oxapampa
(45.7 Km.), cuya ejecuci6n se culmin6 en febrero de 1999, restaurando la transitabilidad de
importantes ciudades. La segunda corresponde a la carretera Urcos-Puerto Maldonado (58 Km.),
que fue suspendida al 18% de su ejecuci6n, debido a la ocurrencia de fuertes lluvias (enero de
1999).
B. Componente de Reconstrucci6n
Este Componente cubre 166 proyectos de reconstrucci6n de infraestructura, ejecutados en el periodo de
julio de 1998 a marzo del 2001. La inversi6n con recursos del BIRF fue de US$27.3 rnillones. La UCP
traspas6 los recursos a los Sub-Ejecutores, quienes realizaron las adquisiciones (bienes, consultorias y
obras); los expedientes tecnicos a traves del Concurso Intemacional de Meritos (Listas Cortas) y las
obras a traves de Licitaci6n Publica Internacional. Las obras concluidas han sido entregadas a los
organismos puiblicos encargados de su operaci6n y mantenimiento.
Los 166 proyectos corresponden a: 88 proyectos de estudios y obras hidriulicas a cargo del Instituto
Nacional de Desarrollo (INADE), 41 proyectos (estudios y obras viales) ejecutados por el Ministerio de
Transportes (DGC) y 37 obras de puentes con financiamiento parcial, ejecutados por el Ministerio de
Transportes (PERT-PRT) .
Los 88 proyectos del INADE corresponden a: 32 expedientes tecnicos, 45 obras (39 obras hidraulicas,
2 puentes y 4 obras viales); y 11 contratos de consultoria para la elaboraci6n de estudios de impacto
ambiental y evaluaci6n econ6mica.
Los 41 proyectos viales son: (i) 10 consultorias (expedientes tecnicos) de tramos de carreteras de
segundo orden (8 tramos de longitud variable de 38 a 84 km., un estudio de variante de 3.0 Km. y
estudio de actualizaci6n de evaluaci6n econ6mica) y (ii) 31 consultorias de expedientes tecnicos de
puentes, de los cuales se han construido 13 puentes de longitud variable de 16 a 50 m. A traves del
Proyecto Especial de Reconstrucci6n de Transportes PERT-PRT se realiz6 el financiamiento parcial de
37 puentes, considerados en el Convenio de Prestamo N 3717-PE cuya fecha de cierre fue el 30 de
junio del 2000.
C. Componente de Fortalecimiento Institucional
En esta fase se ejecutaron 64 proyectos a cargo del Servicio Nacional de Meteorologia e Hidrologia
(SENAMH), Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE), Instituto Geofisico del Periu (IGP) y la Direcci6n
de Hidrograffa y Navegaci6n de la Marina de Guerra del Peru (DHN), por un monto de US$8.3
millones, de los cuales US$5.4 millones corresponden al BIRF y comprenden la adquisici6n y
operaci6n de equipos cientificos modemos, capacitaci6n especializada y asistencia tecnica de expertos

intemacionales en operaci6n de modelos.
3. ANALISIS DEL IMPACTO DEL PROGRAMA EN RELACION CON LOS OBJETIVOS
PLANTEADOS
3.1 Impacto socioecon6mico
Las obras del Programa han tenido la aceptaci6n de la poblaci6n beneficiada y han proporcionado los
beneficios esperados, principalmente en regularizar y garantizar el abastecimiento de agua para los
diferentes usos y regularizar el transito vehicular. No hay reclamos sobre la calidad de las obras ni
problemas por daiios en su ejecuci6n.
El nri:mero de beneficiarios en la Fase de Prevenci6n fue de 178,025 habitantes. En la fase de
Reconstrucci6n se beneficiaron 548,408 habitantes y se contribuy6 con la recuperacion de 52,402
hectareas de terrenos de cultivo.
Las obras de construcci6n de los puentes han perrnitido regularizar el transito, beneficiando a
importantes poblaciones. Cabe resaltar que el 75.66% de la cobertura del programa corresponde a
distritos considerados como pobres.
3.2 Impacto Ambiental
Los aspectos ambientales han seguido los procedimientos del BIRF y la normatividad nacional
vigente, fueron considerados los aspectos ambientales en los estudios y durante la construcci6n de las
obras.
Para las obras de Prevenci6n, de acuerdo a lo concordado con el BIRF, se realiz6 la Evaluaci6n
Ambiental Ex Post y no se encontraron alteraciones ambientales importantes, situaci6n que fue
confiumada por el estudio "Analisis de Impacto Ambiental producidos por la Desviacion artificial de
los rios La Leche y Motupe al Desierto de M6rrope".
Las obras de la Fase de Reconstrucci6n no han ocasionado alteraciones ambientales. Las obras
hidriulicas se han ejecutado en coordinaci6n con los usuarios del agua, sobre todo con los agricultores
de las areas sembradas, en lo referente a la interrupci6n del abastecimiento de agua para permitir la
construccion de las obras y el uso parcial de sus predios durante el proceso constructivo.
En la ejecucion de las obras no se han presentado ningun tipo de conflictos con la poblaci6n y con los
agricultores y no han ocurrido demandas al Programa por algun dano o perjuicio.
3.3 Aspectos Institucionales
La implicancia ambiental, econ6mica y social que tiene el Fen6meno El Nino sobre el desarrollo del
pais, propicio la participaci6n de las instituciones comprometidas en la toma de decisiones, para la
planificacion y disefio de proyectos de inversi6n dentro del contexto del Convenio de Prestamo N
4250-PE, las mismas que dieron una respuesta positiva durante toda la ejecuci6n del programa.
Como aspectos importantes se menciona el mejoramiento de la capacidad de las instituciones para
administrar y ejecutar recursos provenientes de endeudamiento extemo, lograda mediante la asesoria y
asistencia tecnica que brindo la UCP-PAEFEN asi como la uniformizaci6n de las especificaciones

tecnicas para todos los tipos de obras que ejecut6 INADE.
En el caso de la DGC-MTC se implement6 una oficina tecnica administrativa con el apoyo de la
Asesoria Tecnica de la UCP-PAEFEN que ejecut6 eficientemente los proyectos.
4. SOSTENIBILIDAD DEL PROGRAMA
Las obras y equipos del Programa, mantienen su sostenibilidad para su vida fitil, porque estan bajo la
administraci6n de organismos puiblicos perrnanentes. En el caso de equipos debe considerarse su
reposici6n, por perder su vigencia debido al avance tecnol6gico.
Las obras de la Fase de Prevenci6n no estan expuestas a su sostenibilidad porque en muchos casos
fueron fungibles, operaron durante la ocurrencia del fen6meno y su situaci6n antes y despues del Nifio
es similar. Por su naturaleza correspondieron a limpieza y adecuaci6n de los cauces de los rios y
quebradas para facilitar el drenaje natural del agua al mar, tambien se habilitaron obras de defensa
ribereflas para protecci6n de riberas.
Las obras de reconstrucci6n (hidraulicas y viales) pertenecen a entes que ejecutan labores permanentes
de mantenimiento, como el INADE y el Ministerio de Transportes.
En el Componente Reforzamiento Institucional, los equipos adquiridos necesitan en el futuro recursos
para su mantenimiento y reposici6n. Se debe mantener la integraci6n y coordinacion alcanzada durante
el Programa, por los entes del ENFEN, y la sostenibilidad de sus tareas a realizar, a cargo de los
profesionales capacitados por el Programa, quienes pueden renunciar cuando concluya sus
compromisos, entre otras causas por bajos salarios. Se ha coordinado con las entidades integrantes del
ENFEN para que elaboren e implementen un programa de mantenimiento y sostenibilidad.
5. Evaluaci6n del Objetivo del Programa y su Implementaci6n
5.1 Metas Planteadas/Metas Logradas
En algunos casos las metas ejecutadas fueron diferentes a las establecidas originalmente en el Convenio
de Prestamo, debido principalmente a la magnitud y tipos de dafios presentados, las variaciones son:
*   Los rubros de reasentamientos involuntarios y de infraestructura social no han sido atendidos con
el financiamiento del BIRF;
*   El subprograma de mitigaci6n de efectos de la sequia en el altiplano no se ejecut6 porque no se
presentaron las sequias;
*   Ha sido necesario incrementar el rubro de Asesorias, debido a la necesidad de estudios como: (i)
Estudio de la influencia de la derivacion del rio La Leche en la forrnaci6n de la laguna de la Nifia;
(ii) Estudio hidrol6gico de los rios de la vertiente del Pacifico; (iii) Asistencia Tecnica a la ODI y a
la DGC del MTC (iv) ejecuci6n de expedientes tecnicos de las obras hidraulicas y viales.
El Programa ejecutado para El Nifio 1997-98, ha permitido reducir los daiios significativamente
comparados con los producidos por el fen6meno 1982-83, a pesar que las descargas de los rios fueran
mayores en el primer caso en el orden del 30% para los rios de la costa norte.
5.2    Evaluaci6n Ex-Post de los Objetivos, Enfoque Metodol6gico y Componentes del Programa
- 27 -



A. Objetivos y Metas.
Los objetivos han sido mantenidos antes y despues del Programa. Los proyectos ejecutados
corresponden a los sectores considerados previamente, en los Comnponentes Fases de Prevenci6n y
Reconstrucci6n.
La selecci6n y contrataci6n de las consultorias y obras civiles, han seguido los procedirnientos del
BIRF y en forma supletoria las normas peruanas; s6lo se ha presentado un caso de incumplirniento
de una empresa contratista.
Las principales limitaciones consideradas del Programa son
*   El plazo corto para la ejecuci6n del prestamo, considerando el periodo necesario para la
reconstrucci6n de obras viales (Grafico 1) y las tareas del Programa (inventario de dafios;
priorizaci6n de proyectos; aplicaci6n de criterios de elegibilidad tecnicos, econ6micos y
ambientales, preparaci6n de TORs para consultorias; proceso de selecci6n y contrataci6n de
consultores; proceso de licitaci6n y contrataci6n de obras y finalmente el periodo para la ejecuci6n
de las obras).
*   Limitaciones de los profesionales de algunos Sub-Ejecutores, para aplicar los procedimientos de
adquisiciones de los organismos financieros, elaborar temninos de referencia de consultorias y
licitaciones y procesos de calificacion y contrataci6n.
*   Reducido  nurnero de tecnicos de la UCP-PAEFEN. En 1998, el 95%  del tiempo de los
especialistas ocupo el seguimiento de los 764 proyectos de Fase de Emergencia.
-   En algunos casos la licitacion de obras por Paquetes o Lotes, llevo a esperar hasta la culminacion
de expedientes tecnicos que tenian diferentes periodos de preparaci6n.
B.    Enfoque Metodol6gico
Estrategias
Los resultados favorables obtenidos, indican que la estrategia aplicada fue adecuada para afrontar
El Nifno, la cual comprende las Fases de Prevenci6n; Emergencia y Reconstrucci6n. Adicionalmente
se ha ejecutado el Componente de Fortalecimiento Institucional para afrontar eventos futuros en
mejores condiciones de prediccion.
Manejo del Programa por parte del Prestatario
Al inicio se presentaron algunas descoordinaciones institucionales entre la UCP y la secretaria
tecnica del CEREN, ocasionando el retraso de la ejecucion de algunas tareas.
El Gobierno ejecut6 el Programa a trav6s de organismos centrales. Algunas tareas como el
diagnostico de los dafios y la priorizaci6n de los proyectos, se pudieron realizar en tiempo menor
con la participaci6n de organismos descentralizados (Municipios).
C. Sub-Ejecutores Sectoriales
S6Mo una obra a cargo del INADE se anul6 por incumplimiento de la empresa contratista.
-28-



En el caso de la DGC-MTC fue necesario su reforzamiento institucional a traves de la asesoria
tecnica de la furna C. Lotti & Associatti.
En el caso del ENFEN se superaron las divergencias iniciales entre IMARPE, IGP, DHN Y
SENAMHI, cumpliendose las metas establecidas en el Programa.
5.3    Principales Factores que Afectaron la Implementacion y los Resultados Alcanzados por la
Unidad Ejecutora
Efectividad de la Gerencia de la UCP-PAEFEN:
La UCP y la Asistencia Tecnica (C. Lotti) han operado subdimensionada en cantidad de
profesionales, considerando la magnitud de las tareas del Programa y la falta de preparaci6n de los
profesionales de los Sub-Ejecutores.
La empresa de asistencia tecnica a la UCP-PAEFEN inicio sus operaciones seis meses despues de
la suscripcion del prestamo. Inicialmente no hubo adecuada coordinaci6n entre la empresa asesora
(C. Lotti) y la UCP en la ejecuci6n de las funciones, este impase fue superado despues de tres
meses de iniciada las labores de la consultora.
Monitoreo y Evaluaci6n:
La operaci6n del BIRF de Datos en tiempo real, tuvo problemas iniciales en los reportes del
avance fisico y financiero de ejecuci6n de los estudios y obras.
Condicionantes cimaticas:
El periodo anual disponible para la ejecuci6n de las obras se reduce a ocho meses a causa del
periodo de lluvias, que se presentan en el Peru.
Inestabilidad del Personal de los Sub-ejecutores:
Se han presentado carnbios frecuentes del personal clave de los organismos Sub-ejecutores, que ha
dilatado la continuidad de las labores, produciendo el reinicio de algunos procedimientos y
acuerdos.
Restricciones en el Gasto Publico:
Las restricciones en el gasto piublico a partir del tercer trimestre de 1999 limitaron la ejecuci6n de
las obras y por lo tanto las metas, especialmente carreteras y puentes.
Costos del Programa
Las ofertas de las licitaciones de las obras han sido  menores a los costos establecidos en los
expedientes tecnicos, habiendo un ahorro significativo de inversiones. En el caso de obras
hidriulicas han sido en promedio 12 % menores, solo un caso fue el 30% mayor al presupuesto
referencial, para una obra ubicada a 4,000 m.s.n.m. En el caso de obras de puentes la reducci6n de
los costos es del orden del 20%.
5.4 Resultados (Indicadores Fisicos y Sociales
No se han presentado diferencias notables entre el tamanio de los indicadores programados y ejecutados
y reflejan adecuadamente la magnitud de las obras.

6. LECCIONES APRENDIDAS
6.1  Preparaci6n del Programa
En la preparaci6n del Programa (afio 1997) no se ha dispuesto de informaci6n adecuada, a pesar de la
presencia de un Fen6meno similar en el periodo 1982-83. Los alcances establecidos en los Convenios de
Prestarno han sido en algunos casos de caracter general.
El PAEFEN tiene la Base de Datos con informaci6n detallada, que permitira, ante un evento futuro,
establecer una programaci6n adecuada con inforrnaci6n de: tipo de organizaci6n, estimacion de las
inversiones y periodo de ejecuci6n de las obras, procedimientos de adquisiciones, terninos de referencia
para consultorias y licitaciones de obras, criterios de calificaci6n, selecci6n y contrataci6n de empresas,
criterios de elegibilidad de las inversiones (tecnicos, econ6micos y ambientales), seguinmiento y
evaluaci6n de ejecuci6n de los Componentes y sostenibilidad y liquidacion tecnica y financiera de las
obras.
Se recomienda dos tipos de labores ante un evento futuro. La primera es de caracter permanente con
tareas de: zonificaci6n territorial de las areas criticas, normas legales que definan el uso del suelo en las
zonas criticas, participaci6n de la poblaci6n afectada, preparaci6n de los profesionales en las tareas
descritas anteriormente, disenio del tipo de organizaci6n para la ejecucion del Programa y su manual
operativo, disefio del inventario y criterios de evaluaci6n de las obras daniadas. Criterios tecnicos como:
alcances del tipo de obra a ser reconstruida (nivel de servicio, magnitud, disenio geometrico, disenlo
estructural tipo, magnitud de su costo, condiciones de mantenimiento y operaci6n), analisis de los costos
unitarios por tipos de obras, criterios de priorizacion de ejecuci6n de las obras, desarrollo de los
criterios de elegibilidad en los aspectos tecnicos, ambientales y econ6micos, etc.
El segundo tipo de labores corresponde a aquellas a ejecutar ante la certeza de la ocurrencia del
Fenomeno en las fases de Prevenci6n, Emergencia y Reconstrucci6n.
Hay una leccion muy importante: las labores de Prevenci6n, principalmente la limpieza de los cauces de
rios y quebradas y su acondicionamiento para grandes descargas favorecen altamente la mitigaci6n de
los efectos del Fenomeno.
6.2  Aspectos Contractuales
Los plazos del Programa fueron de 3 anos. En la prictica el Programa se inici6 en agosto de 1998 con
la evaluaci6n de daiios, preparaci6n de expedientes tecnicos, selecci6n de contratistas y ejecuci6n de las
obras, el plazo fue insuficiente algunos proyectos demandan un periodo de ejecuci6n mayor a 12
meses.
Los recursos asignados a la Fase de Emergencia han sido restringidos, comparados con la demanda.
6.3   Aspectos relacionados con la Ejecuci6n del Programa
*   Ha sido acertado establecer una Unidad Ejecutora del Programa, caso contrario hubiera significado
establecer una Unidad Ejecutora en cada Sector.
*   Es necesario la preparaci6n de los profesionales de los Sub-Ejecutores en procedimientos para
administrar y ejecutar recursos del fmanciamiento extemo.
*   La Unidad Ejecutora debe estar implementada en personal de acuerdo a la magnitud de las tareas.

6.4    Aspectos Financieros
Compromisos del gasto puiblico:
Es importante el compromiso del Gobiemo para atender el calendario establecido de fmanciamiento de
las obras.
Costos de las Obras
Las obras se deben ejecutar por Paquetes o Lotes por: sus costos se reducen significativamente, la
coordinaci6n es eficiente (se dispone una empresa para varias obras). Los criterios de selecci6n deben
considerar la solidez econ6mica de la empresa que permita atender los gastos, cuando se presenten
algunas demoras en los pagos.
7. PROPUESTA PARA LA EJECUCION DEL PROGRAMA
a) Fase de Ajuste de la Planificacion de las Acciones.
Se recomienda que despues del inventario de los dafios, se lleve a cabo la adecuaci6n de los
alcances del Convenio de Prestamo con la magnitud y tipos de obras necesarias.
b) Fase de Evaluaci6n de los Dafios.
Esta labor debe ser realizada por una entidad con experiencia y capacidad para ejecuci6n de tareas
masivas en forna sirnultanea, con capacidad para movilizarse en condiciones adversas, producto de
El Nifio.
c) Fase de la Reconstrucci6n
En los termninos de referencia de expedientes tecnicos, considerar que el consultor tendra la
obligaci6n de proponer modificaciones para mejorar las caracteristicas tecnicas de la obra y su
rentabilidad econ6mica y social, considerando los aspectos ambientales. Las obras reconstruidas
deben garantizar una vida iutil compatible con su tipo, en algunos casos podra significar una
mejora sustancial de la estructura dafiada.
Se debe considerar la posibilidad del empleo de la mano de obra de la poblaci6n afectada en las
tareas del Programa, para que dispongan de un ingreso econ6mico, por la paralizaci6n de las
actividades productivas por causas del fen6meno.
Se recomienda mantener un sistema de comunicaci6n con las poblaciones afectadas sobre el avance
del programa y sus areas de intervenci6n.
En el caso de obras reconstruidas deberan estandarizarse los criterios y la metodologia de
evaluaci6n econ6mica.
Tratandose de obras preexistentes, en general la evaluaci6n ambiental se centra en los impactos
temporales durante la construcci6n y el manejo adecuado de las canteras y botaderos.
- 31 -



Debe ser permanente las acciones para la predicci6n de un Fen6meno, realizando la evaluaci6n
critica del funcionamiento de predicci6n con vistas a actualizarlo, corregirlo y/o complementarlo,
incluyendo los adelantos tecnol6gicos.
