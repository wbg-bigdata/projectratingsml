MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A THIRD BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 67.3 million, the equivalent of
$100 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance the
Third Basic Education Project. The Government of China will allocate the credit
proceeds to the project provinces for 20 years, including a 5-year grace period, at a fixed
annual interest rate of 1.2 percent. The provinces would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.    Background. Compared with other developing countries, China's success in
providing comprehensive basic education to its population has been remarkable. In 1994,
enrollment rates for the first nine years of schooling were reportedly 98.4 percent of the
6-11 age cohort enrolled in primary education, and more than 60 percent of the 12-15 age
cohort in lower secondary schools. Of primary graduates, about 82 percent went on to
secondary schools (regular or vocational). Almost 98 percent of all school-age girls were
enrolled in primary education. A significant consequence of these high enrollment
figures is the high literacy rates: 80 percent for those above 15 years of age and about 93
percent among those between 15 and 25 yeaxs of age. The projected figures for 2000 are
134 million pupils at primary level and 70 million at lower secondary level.
3.    Global figures, though indicative of substantial progress, tend to mask disparities
in basic education development. There are noticeable imbalances in the availability of
educational services between the economically advanced and underdeveloped regions due
to the relatively high portion of educational expenditures funded at the local level.
Generally, urban and coastal areas have achieved the goal of nine-year basic education
but many poor, sparsely-populated and remote areas have not reached primary education
targets, sometimes by a significant extent. In China's 592 nationally designated poverty
counties, where the average annual rural income of Y 400 in 1993 was less than half of
the national rural average, schooling is marked by poor attendance and high repetition
and dropout rates. Government poverty reduction programs targeted at these counties
therefore include educational improvement.
4.    The Government's overall approach to education in poor areas is to improve
efficiency through reduction of high repetition and dropout rates, improved books for
basic education, training of teachers to use new text materials and provision of more
preservice and improved inservice training for teachers. In addition, the Government
hopes to encourage equity by providing subsidies to economically underdeveloped areas
so that they may introduce compulsory education and to encourage the transfer of funds
from provincial to local governments. The project will support the Government's efforts
to make primary education universal by the year 2000 by putting more educational inputs



- 2 -
into teaching points,' increasing the enrollment in complete schools, expanding
multigrade and multisubject teaching in rural areas and reducing dropout rates of minority
children through improved bilingual educational programs.
5.    The project would be implemented in 124 counties in Anhui, Fujian, Gansu,
Henan, Hebei, Jilin and Qinghai Provinces. The main criteria used in selecting the
provinces were the number of poor counties [counties identified as being National Poor
Counties in the State Council's "National 8-7 Poverty Reduction Plan (1994-2000)"] in
the province, level of teacher qualifications, percentage of minority population, primary
school completion rate, and girls' enrollment. The main criteria used in selecting project
counties were: inclusion on the national or provincial list of poor counties; relative
concentration of minority population among overall county population; poverty indicators
such as rural income per capita, public expenditure for education as a percentage of
provincial expenditure and books per pupil at primary level; and teaching and
management needs such as percentages of repetition, primary enrollment, and girls'
enrollment, transition rate from primary to secondary education and percentage of
qualified teachers.
6.    Minority nationalities and girls are at a particular disadvantage in many of the
poor areas.  China has 55 minority nationalities totaling 91.2 million people and
constituting 8 percent of the population. Areas inhabited by these minorities cover 64
percent of the country. There are 80 spoken languages and over 30 writing systems used
by the minority nationalities. In areas populated by minority nationalities, economic and
education levels are lower than the national average. In a study of school-age children in
25 minority counties conducted by the State Education Commission (SEdC), the gross
enrollment rate was 20 percentage points lower than the national mean, with female
enrollment being particularly low. In addition to the characteristics of education in poor
areas, education of minority nationalities suffers from shortages in teaching materials and
adequately trained teachers. Bilingual education,2 regarded as instrumental to promoting
minority nationalities to advance to upper and postsecondary education, also suffers from
various shortcomings:  a shortage of qualified teachers; unsatisfactory instructional
materials, and insufficient attention and research in the pedagogical, linguistic,
psychological and curriculum  aspects of bilingual education.  Components of the
proposed project such as increased provision of bilingual teacher training, procurement of
tent schools, increased emphasis on local content in minority-language textbooks,
training of minority headmasters and student assistance programs have been especially
designed for the small number of minority children (about 7 percent of the total) in the
project.
Teaching points are community-supported incomplete primary schools that generally have one or two
grades only, a single teacher and are located in villages. They are generally found in the poorest
sections of the countryside.
2 Bilingual education is currently employed by 24 minority nationalities.



- 3 -
7.    Among the deprived sections of the population, girls and women continue to be
more disadvantaged. Facilities for basic education are equally available for boys and
girls, yet there is a significantly lower level of utilization of facilities by girls and women.
Almost half the rural population is illiterate or semiliterate, and women make up 70
percent of this number. Factors that contribute to these problems are related to: (a) high
direct and indirect costs of schooling; (b) a nonsupportive learning environment;
(c) limited access; and (d) low expectations for continuing education and employment.
The proposed project will specifically advance female education by: (a) maintaining a
dialogue with educational officials at the national, provincial and county leveis on
important policy issues (through project supported studies, project supervision and
national seminars); (b) improving the learning environment (through gender-sensitive
teacher/administrative training, a special program of supporting female principals, and
experiments with single-sex schools); (c) expanding access, especially in the poorer and
more remote rural areas (through such programs as distribution of free textbooks to girls);
and (d) fostering innovation and experimentation to promote female education within a
local context.
8.    Project Objectives. The project would: (a) support the attainment of universal
primary education and expansion of coverage of lower secondary education in poor and
minority areas, and (b) build stronger institutions responsible for education delivery. The
project would contribute to the Government's poverty reduction efforts by focusing on
education, and thus the income earning potential of nearly 5 million children in some of the
poorer counties in China. The project will have a direct impact on approximately 46,000
schools and will provide varying lengths of training for approximately 138,000 teachers and
education managers.
9.    Project Description. The project would comprise three components. Under the
institutional component the project would finance renovation, rehabilitation, and some
new construction of primary and lower secondary schools, furniture, instructional
equipment and library books; and staff upgrading. Classroom teachers, school principals,
and local education administrators would receive training that would allow them to
provide better instruction in and leadership of education institutions at the provincial,
county and village levels.
10.   The management improvement component will develop management capabilities
for the education system at the national, provincial and institutional levels through staff
training, the provision of equipment and expert services.  It will include three
subcomponents: (a) the training of local education management authorities; (b) the
training of local project implementation authorities; and (c) the development of an
education management information system  (MIS).  The central component will:
(a) support the dissemination program which would focus on the documentation,
dissemination, piloting and evaluation of good results of previous educational
experiments; (b) support a pupil learning achievement study; (c) provide national-level
coordination for a student assistance program and (d) support a Chinese Experts Panel
(CEP) which will coordinate and oversee the central component activities in cooperation



with the provinces and SEdC. This component will also support national-level capacity
building and the coordination of certain technical assistance activities. The student
assessment study, dissemination program and the student assistance program will in part
be carried out at the provincial level.
11.   The project is estimated to cost about $191.8 million. The provincial and county
governments are expect to provided $91.8 million and IDA about $100 million (52
percent of total project costs.) To facilitate rapid project startup, retroactive financing of
up to 10 percent of the credit amount ($10 million equivalent) is recommended to cover
payments already made under the project starting from December 1, 1995 for training
activities and February 15, 1996 for civil works contracts. A breakdown of project costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the country
are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 15099-CHA, dated February 23, 1996, is being distributed
separately.
12.   Project Implementation. SEdC will provide overall project coordination. And,
through the central component, it will implement national level project activities in which
each province has a shared involvement, that is, national-level training, foreign study
tours and overseas training, research studies and the dissemination program. All national-
level activities will be implemented by the Foreign Investment and Loan Office (FILO)
and other appropriate SEdC technical departments, using technical and administrative
resources that are familiar to the Association and have proved satisfactory in the past.
FILO was formed in 1981 and has extensive experience in the technical aspects of Bank
Group project execution.
13.   Since the bulk of project activities will take place in the provinces, the main
implementation responsibilities will be assumed by provincial-level FILOs, headed by the
Vice Commissioners of the respective Provincial Education Commissions, and staffed
with officials familiar with education planning and management, financial management
and accounting, civil works and equipment procurement. A similar structure has been
repeated at the county level. The provincial FILOs will be responsible for overseeing the
activities of the county FILOs and arranging for the necessary training. This model has
worked in the implementation of the Education Development in Poor Provinces Project
(Cr. 2339-CHA) and Basic Education in Poor and Minority Areas Project (Cr. 2651-
CHA).
14.   Project Sustainability. The project will partially finance school-based activities
at the village, township, county and provincial level, activities that are embedded within
and support the key national education policy of achieving universal nine-year education
by the year 2000. The moderate level of IDA financing for the project (approximately 52
percent) and the annual amounts of provincial and county counterpart funding necessary
for the project as a ratio of the actual 1995 provincial and county education budgets (0.89



-5 -
and 3.3 percent, respectively, on average) increase the chances for both sustainability and
affordability of the project activities. Even during 1997, when the highest annual
disbursements can be expected (i.e., 35 percent of total disbursement), average county-
level counterpart funding will only be 4.7 percent of the projected 1997 education
budgets. Built into the project are maintenance costs for schools, classrooms and
equipment to be procured under the project, as well as technical assistance and training to
develop a planning-enhancing MIS system. The training of approximately 138,000
teachers and school managers builds and strengthens existing and new human resource
capacity, which will remain in place long after the end of the project.
15.   The recurrent cost implications of the project investment have been studied by the
Borrower and the costs have been found to be a small percentage (projected 0.5 percent)
of the provincial-level total recurrent costs projected for 2001.
16.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Operations. Valuable lessons
have been learned from the development and early implementation of the first two basic
education projects, on which the design of the proposed project is based. The lessons
include: (a) projects are better designed and implemented when they concentrate on a
reduced number of provinces, and when provincial and county authorities are involved in
their design; (b) provincial-level counterpart funding must be assured from the beginning
of the project, available early and sufficient to provide necessary start-up funds for county
and village civil works that account for a large percentage of the first half of project
disbursements in such education projects; (c) the project oversight and policy guidance
role of a CEP is critical in making minor but necessary adjustments in project design,
advising Association supervision missions, and resolving implementation problems at the
provincial and subprovincial levels; (d) Provincial Education Commissions should
concentrate less on quantitative targets and more on improving the quality of the project;
(e) provinces have tended to overrely on early and heavy use of force account for small
civil works projects in locations where National Competitive Bidding procurement
procedures would have been more appropriate and economical; (f) the Association and
the Government need to work together in the evaluation of education reforms; and
(g) national coordination of technical assistance, high-level training, collection of
educational and project indicators, and dissemination of lessons learned are necessary to
achieve efficiencies of scale, and countrywide coherence in the development and
expression of education policy and national standards.
17.   The proposed project design benefited from the above lessons by incorporating
the following: (a) a joint Association/Borrower training course on project design and
monitorable indicators for individuals from the preparation and implementing agencies
was carried out in Washington, D.C. early in project preparation; (b) the Borrower and
provincial education authorities have been responsible for organizing the participation of
stakeholders at the provincial and county levels to develop proposals based on local
identification of issues and optimal solutions; (c) a CEP has been used to assist in the
design of project components and will be used during project implementation to provide
ongoing high-level professional monitoring of project implementation; (d) a county



- 6 -
financing study and household survey have been initiated to better understand the
household burden of education; and (e) the central component aims at supporting
dissemination of previous IDA- and UNICEF-supported, action-oriented research
programs that identify innovative approaches to improving access to education for girls,
minorities and poor children.
18.   Rationale for Bank Group Involvement. The proposed operation is consistent
with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on June 1, 1995. For
the social sectors the CAS calls for priority to be given to the problems of the poorest
areas, including basic education and education for girls.  Under the project, the
Association would be deepening its support for China's efforts in improving basic
education in poor and remote areas, including those inhabited by minority nationalities.
The project would be in line with IDA's report "China: Strategies for Reducing Poverty
in the 1990s" (Report No. 10409-CHA, 1992), which identified investment in human
capital, in particular targeted interventions to the poor and vulnerable, as a key
component of the poverty alleviation efforts leading to healthier and smaller families,
higher adoption rates of new agricultural technology, and increased access to alternative
off-farm employment. The project also incorporates the Association's concerns for
improving the status of women in the development process by supporting targeted
research activities and consequent interventions to increase girls' enrollments, especially
in minority areas.
19.   Agreed Actions. The principle assurances obtained at negotiations concerned:
(a) terms of credit allocations to the provinces; (b) procedures for project monitoring and
evaluation in accordance with indicators acceptable to the Association, and annual
reporting to the Association by April 1; (c) implementation of the national-level training
program in accordance with an action plan acceptable to the Association; and
(d) submission to the Association of a mid-term report by October 31, 1998.
20.   The provinces would be required under Project Implementation Arrangements
with the Central Government to: (a) allocate the Credit to the project counties, as far as
possible on a grant basis, otherwise on terms at least as favorable as the terms on which
the province receives the funds from the national government; (b) carry out annual
Education Program action plans, which would be previously submitted to and found
acceptable to the Association; (c) carry out, monitor and report on action plans for
nonproject-supported counties in Hebei, Anhui and Gansu to ensure the continued
achievement of acceptable educational targets for those counties during the
implementation of the project; and (d) ensure adequate project monitoring. As a
condition of Credit effectiveness, Project Implementation Arrangements signed by the
Borrower and the participating provinces would be submitted to the Association.
21.   Program Objective Categories. No negative environmental impact from the
project is foreseen (the project is rated a "C"). Likewise, no resettlement or land
acquisition is foreseen in that all civil works will be rehabilitation, rebuilding or repair of
schools on existing school sites. Improved access to and quality of basic education will



-7 -
enhance the ability of the poor to take advantage of the opportunities presented by
economic growth, either in their own counties or areas of faster economic development.
Improved overall access to education will increase girls' enrollments. The project,
through its targeted training programs, will increase the numbers of women teachers and
principals and thus encourage enrollment and retention of girls in schools. It has been
shown that improved quality of education in general also increases the retention of girls,
with resultant economic and social benefits. Special attention has been paid, through a
participatory process, to design the project so as to ensure that the minority beneficiaries
fully benefit under the project in accordance with the requirements of the Bank Group's
Operational Directive 4.20.
22.   Participatory Approach. Based on experience with the previous projects, SEdC
organized three working groups which were instrumental in project preparation and will
be used in project implementation. These groups are: (a) a Project Working Group,
comprising relevant working-level staff from throughout SEdC, which organized all
project preparatory activities; (b) a Project Leading Group, comprising SEdC department
directors, which is responsible for providing guidance and coordination and resolving
major implementation issues that may arise; and (c) the CEP, comprising nine non-SEdC
experts specializing in basic education, minority/bilingual education, teacher training,
curriculum development, civil works, equipment and education management, which
advised and made suggestions on project preparation.   Directors of project
implementation units from provinces in the earlier basic education project are members of
the Project Working Group to ensure continuous input into the development of the
programs in the project-supported provinces as well as training of new project
implementation staff.
23.   SEdC organized a project preparation stakeholder meeting for the seven proposed
provinces as well as national and provincial financial and planning agencies. This initial
organization meeting determined the basic project design, outlined the project preparation
process and provided each of the provinces with a project proposal outline and financing
format derived from the preparation of the earlier basic education project. First drafts of
the provincial proposals were reviewed by SEdC and the Association in Washington
when SEdC participated in three weeks of training in project design.
24.   During project preparation, Association staff systematically interviewed selected
parents, grandparents and village authorities, most of whom were minorities, from some
17 townships and villages in poor counties of Qinghai and Gansu Provinces to learn local
reaction to and gather additional information for the tentative project design. The
findings from the interviews can be summarized as follows: (a) only by acquiring
literacy and numeracy skills will the children be able to escape the poverty with which
their parents/grandparents have had to live; (b) basic education in rural poor areas is
primarily to acquire skills necessary to contribute to the local economy and secondarily to
provide an educational foundation for higher education; (c) mastery of national language
is essential to enable school-leavers to move from poverty areas to where the jobs are;
(d) initial instruction in the mother language is important to retain awareness of minority



-8-
culture and to be able to talk to family members; (e) the project should place highest
emphasis on eliminating dangerous schools and providing good new classrooms;
(f) increasing teachers' qualifications, especially in bilingual education skills, is
important; (g) of lesser importance is the provision of school furniture and teaching
equipment; (h) the local curriculum should include local history and stories; and
(i) education of girls is important so that they can learn life skills that enable them to
contribute to the local economy. These interviews were instrumental in shaping the
package of investments targeted at the minority children in Qinghai, Gansu and Hebei.
25.   Financial Analysis. Analysis of the provincial feasibility reports for this project
indicates that there are funding needs in the project county educational budgets between
the estimates to achieve nine-year compulsory education by the year 2000 and the
estimated total domestic funding available to these counties during 1996-2000. These
gaps range between $5.5 million and $30.1 million per province. With the project, these
financing gaps would be reduced to a range between $0.5 million and $12.0 million per
province or by 77 percent on average for each province. The project will cover 100
percent of the gaps for the small number of nationally-listed poverty counties in Fujian
and Jilin Provinces, with differing percentages of counties covered in other provinces.
SEdC intends to increase the nonrecurrent budget investments in all provinces with
nationally-listed poverty counties so that these provinces can achieve universal nine-year
education by the year 2000 and this should, therefore, fill the financing gaps that the
project cannot cover. With this project, SEdC will have completed these investments for
Fujian and Jilin and made substantial investments to the other five provinces in the
project.
26.   Benefits. The project is expected to benefit about 5 million of the poorest school
children in some of the economically more disadvantaged counties of some of China's
poorer provinces. It will significantly expand basic education among the poor, especially
in the remote areas inhabited by minority nationalities. Provision of education to remote
and rural areas not only helps to create opportunities for rural development but also helps
to provide the skills necessary to participate in the economic growth in township and
urban centers. It would also improve school attendance of female students. Minority
nationalities students will be better prepared to participate in Chinese schools in the upper
and postsecondary levels.  Furthermore, the project includes specific interventions
designed to improve planning and management capacity of the central, provincial and
county governments to prepare and implement similar comprehensive projects and to
replicate them in other parts of the country. The project will have a direct impact on
between a third and all of the schools and children in 124 counties and approximately
46,000 schools, depending on the county, and will provide varying lengths of training for
approximately 138,000 teachers and education managers.
27.   Risks. There are three main risks in this project. First, three of the project
provinces (Hlebei, Gansu and Anhui) have other poor counties not covered by the project
and may not ensure that the population in these counties would benefit from improved
access to and quality of basic education. To deal with this, these project provinces will be



-9-
required to implement acceptable action plans with monitorable indicators to ensure that
education achievements in nonproject poor counties will not deteriorate during project
implementation. Second, the central, provincial and county officials may be unable to
oversee the implementation of the project activities. Cognizant of this risk, management
strengthening at all three levels is a principal activity of the project. Additionally, lessons
learned from implementing the previous Association-supported basir education projects
will be included in the training of provincial and county-level implementation units for
this project. Finally, there may be inadequate commitment on the part of SEdC, project
provinces and counties, which may result in insufficient counterpart funding to match
Association credits. However, SEdC has indicated that it is willing to allocate sufficient
amounts of its own annual budgetary allocation for poor counties to the seven project
provinces to assure adequate counterpart funding.  Additionally, implementation
experience of the previous education projects and the strong provincial and county-level
work necessary to develop the current project indicate that the risk is not excessive.
28.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
