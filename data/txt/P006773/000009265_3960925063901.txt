RURAL RLADS PROJECT (Loan 1966-CO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
ObJectives
1.       This project aimed to integrate less developed areas, support
agricultural development and correct regional imbalances in the road
infrastructure within Colombia, particularly in areas with little or no access
to centers where products could be commercialized. The project included
construction and rehabilitation of roads, a road maintenance program and a
technical assistance program. These goals were to be achieved by improving
managerial performance within the executing agency, the National Rural Roads
Fund (FNCV), through the adoption of more efficient plannJng, organization and
control practices.
2.       The loan was intended to support the 1981-84 program for rural roads
construction and rehabilitation. The roads financed were included in FNCV's
program and were not identified when the loan was approved. They were
selected, evaluated and constructed during project implementation, following an
agreed methodology (paras. 1.01 - 2.01).
Implementation Experience and Results
3.       The project was initiated and developed without major obstacles.
However, some delays were caused during implementation due to difficulties in
providing local funds. For this reason, the closing date was postponed for two
years. Accomplishment of original physical goals, although not fully attained,
was completed to a satisfactory level (paras. 2.01 - 3.09).
4.       The final total project cost was US$52.3 million or 16S  below the
appraisal estimate of US$63.0 million. The underrun was mainly due to lower
local construction costs resulted from high devaluation. As a result of the
devaluation, FNCV had difficulties in providing counterpart funds.
Consequently, the Bank increased its participation in the project to ensure
completion of the works (paras. 4.01 - 4.03).
5.       Adequate attention was given to the institutional aspects of the
project. However, the recommendations of the technical assistance component,
consisting of an organization study, statistics and information study, and an
archive study, could not be implemented by FNCV during the project due to lack
of funds. A plan of action for implementation of the above recommendations was
considered under the Rural Transport Sector Project (Loan 2668-C0), (paras.
6.01 - 6.04).



- v -
6.       The economic rate of return of the road sample taken for economic
reevaluation yielded 29.72, as compared with the 37Z estimated at appraisal.
Although physical goals were not fully attained, benefits accruing from
increased agricultural production and reduction in transportation costs were
significant and the roads analyzed proved to be economic (paras. 7.01 - 7.02).
Sustainability
7.       Prospects for project sustainability are good.  The follow-up project
will consolidate institutional improvements and initiate a plan of action to
upgrade road maintenance (paras. 6.01, 3.06 and 8.02).
FindinRs
8.       The project was succesful.  It achieved its objectives of supporting
agriculture, it attained .'.ts physical goals and it contributed to institutional
strengthtening. Two lessors were learned: a project should make provisions for
implementing study recommendations; and arrangements for obtaining adequate
counterpart funding should be improved (paras. 8.01, 8.03 and 8.04).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RURAL ROADS PROJECT (Loan 1966-CO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Colombia has a road network of about 100,000 km  (10,500 km paved), of
which 25,100 km comprise the national highway system, 48,500 km are
departmental roads and 24,400 km are rural roads. The planning, construction
and maintenance of the national roads network is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Works and Transport (MOPT) through its National Highway Fund (FVN).
The National Rural Roads Fund (FNCV) is in charge of the rural transport
infrastructure. FNCV functions as an autonomoue organization under MOPT with
overall responsibility for construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the
rural road network in Colombia. The Departments are responsible for
construction and maintenance of their own roads through their Secreteriats of
Public Works. However, the lack of resources and technical skills have
hindered departmental efforts to improve the efficiency in maintenance
operations.
1.02     The Bank has played an important role in the development of Colombia's
transport sector. Since 1950, the Bank has lent about US$845 million in 28
loans to the sector. These investments supported the construction of an
integrated highway network and, more recently, have contributed to the
rehabilitation and maintenance of the national network and to the development
of improved highway and rural roads organizations. This loan, however, was the
first Bank's direct intervention in ru,al transport. A second Rural Roads loan
(Loan 2668-CO) for US$62.0 million to support FNCV's 1986-1992 Investment and
Haintenance Program was approved on May 27, 1986. Previous to this Loan, the
Bank had established a good 0orkiug relationship with FNCV through a series of
agricultural projects in which FNCV has been involved through the construction
of rural roads. FNL,I's capability to undertake selection, evaluation, design,
and construction of rural roads is considered adequate.
1.03     The expansion of rural transport programs to isolated regions has been
a central item of the government's efforts to extend public services and to
integrate less developed areas into the mainstream economy, increase
agricultural productivity and raise income level of small farmers. Over one
third of the 27 million Colombians live in rural areas and depend upon
agricultural activities. Agriculture provides about a quarter of all the
employment and accounts for 20Z of the GDP and about 67Z of the country's total
exports. A number of public agencies, including FNCV, are involved in giving
support to the agricultural sector.



II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     In 1977, the Bank identified the need for direct involvement with FNCV
to support high priority rural roads improvements and to address FNCV'u needs
for institutional strengthening, including the establishment of effective
maintenance operations for rural roads and the future role of FNCV in
construction activities.
2.02     Active preparation of the project did not start until 1979.  An
analysis of FNCV's rural road network indicated that about 70? of the existing
network was in unsatisfactory condition because of the lack of adequate
drainage and routine maintenance. As a consequence, substantial rehabilitation
works were required. The Government, aware of the fundamental need to improve
the existing rural road system, approved a 1981-84 global rural roads
construction, rehabilitation and maintenance program for US$226 million to be
administered by FNCV. She main objectives of the program were: (i) gradual
increase in the proportion of rehabilitation works within the PNCV's total
working program that includes maintenance, construction and auplervision
activities; (i) establish the basis for a routine maintenanL.; program
consisting of equipment procurement, budgeting maintenance activities and
establishing the "peon caminero' program; and (iii) strengthen FNCV's
capabilities in the area of planning, management and control of a balanced
construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation program.
2.03    The program comprised five subprograms;  i. DRI I and DRI II
(Integrated Rural Development)s construction and rehabilitation of rural roads
in some rural areas with potential for regional commerce development; ii. Pico
y Pala: construction of new rural roads employing peasant workers that directly
benefit from the roads; iii. the Rural Roads Projects construction of rural
roads in areas with high agricultural potential! and iv. the ordinary FNCV
program including maintenance, construction and rehabilitation activities.
2.04    The component financed by the Bank was the Rural Roads Project for
US$63 million or 28Z of the Program. The Project consisted of the following:
(a) Part(l)  Construction of about 710 kms of roads;
(b) Part(2) Rehabilitation of about 710 kms of roads;
(c) Part(3) A program of routine maintenance of rural roads
including, inter alia, acquisition and utilization of
hand tools and about 250 units of equipment; and
(d) Part(4) Provision of technical assistance to strengthen
the borrower's administrative structure and, its
management information system.
The main beneficiaries of the project are small-scale farmers. The new rural
roads bring them new markets for agricultural products and access to services
offered by the government and private agencies such as medical, credit,
marketing, and equipment supplies.



-3-
2.05   The project focused on the institutional framework and on the selection
and evaluation methodology of candidate roads. Specific roads were selected
during implementation on the basis of agreed consistent criteria and
procedures, with sufficient flexibility to accommodate changes in priorities
and yet retain adequate control to ensure the program's regional balance and
adequate socio-economic justification.
2.06    The Bank financed 1002 of the foreign exchange component of the project
expenditures, equivalent to US$33 millions as follows:

III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01    Although the project suffered delays in becoming effective due mainly to
local legal technicalities, to insufficient counterpart funds and to lack of
timely engineering studies for the initial projects, implementation was not
delayed. Eight roads were selected and evaluated during appraisal, allowing
FNCV to initiate the project in early 1982. The rest of the roads financed by
the loan were selected during implementation. Due to the nature of the roads
-short roads geographically dispersed, and requiring low standard road
construction - the project was fragmented and awarded to numerous small
contractors. To avoid cumbersome and inefficient management of contracts, a
revolving fund was created which ensured prompt payment to contractors
undertaking the sub-projects.
3.02    Contracting of civil works was very effective and a substantial decrease
in the appraisal dollai cost of civil works was obtained. The Bank accepted the
Government's request to take advantage of the lower costs by extending the
coverage to additional economically justified rural roads, as a way of
supporting the Government's "Peace Plan" intended to assist economically certain
rural areas of previous terrorist activities.
3.03    Although the original scope was not fully achieved, the final results
were satisfactory. Some sub-projects were not completed due to several reasons
such as (a) cost underestimation, which led to contracts for lower values than
required by actual goals, (b) poor programming and supervision of works by FNCV,
(c) poor performance of some contractors, and (d) inclement weather conditions.
Table 1 compares the estimated and actual physical goals.
3.04      Development of the project was slow during 1984.  However, execution
improved during 1985; contracting developed satisfactorily and sufficient
counterpart funds were provided. By April 1986, bidding of all works, approved
by the Bank, were completed and counterpart financing appropriated. However,
due to adverse weather conditions, works could not be completed and a six-month
extension to the closing date was found justified by the Bank.
3.05     In 1985, some changes were made to the initially considered project
categories. Purchase of hand tools for $0.09 was cancelled since the program was
implemented without need for financing of them and the funds were transferred
for acquisition of equipment and spare parts. The technical assistance was
increased by US$0.1 million uo finance the additional study to post-evaluate
roads already completed and in absence of an effective road maintenance policy
and resources, the Bank agreed with FNCV's request to finance with loan
resources the inclusion of a periodic maintenance component in the project for
US$0.5 million.
3.06     FNCU gradually started to b-ild-up its own road maintenance capability
through (i) procurement of equipment; (ii) budgeting for maintenance by
progressively shifting funds from construction to rehabilitation and
maintenance; and (iii) setting-up the "peon caminero" (road-man) system, in
which each man is responsible for routine maintenance of 5 kms of road.



Periocic maintenance progressed satisfactorily. Routine maintenance however,
was inadequate and its reinforcement was considered under the Rural Transport
Sector Project (Loan 2668-CO). This new loan provides also for a study to
define a plan if action to resolve the serious problem of road maintenance under
the responsibility of the departments.
3.07    The equipment provided for in the project was procured and distributed
among FNCV's regions by December 1983, allowing initiation of the maintenance
program. Additional units of equipment were provided with funds remaining in
this category. However, delays in procurement were caused by cumbersome legal
import procedures and shortage of funds to pay for import taxes.
3.08      A  U.S. consulting firm was initially selected for the whole technical
assistance component. However, no final agreement was reached, owing to FNCV's
insistence on a stronger local participation. The Bank accepted the
Government's decision to divide the technical assistance component into three
independent studies, two of which, a study on FNCV organization, and a revision
of FNCV's statistical and information needs, were awarded to local institutions
and the third one, an archive study, was undertaken by the US firm initially
selected. The gtudies were completed as planned by June 1984. The consultants'
recommendations, however, were not implemented due to lack of funds in FNCV and
lack of commitment from the Government.
3.09     An inventory of rural roads under FNCV's responsibility was completed
as a loan covenant in June 1986. The report includes a listing by region of
existing roads, their length and condition. Inventory updating at regular
intervals is considered in the subsequent Rural Transport Sector Project
(2668-CO).
IV. PROJECT COST AND DISBUlRSEMENT
4.01    Slow initial rate of.disbursement for civil works was caused by a delay
of about a year in project start-up as explained in para. 3.01. Due to FNCV's
lack of experience with external financial procedures, and to the lower average
cost of roads compared to appraisal estimates, disbursements slowed down during
project execution. The last disbursement was made in June 1987. Planned and
actual total disbursements are as follows:
FY        Planed             Actual
(US$ Million)
82           7.7                1.3
83          18.2                6.0
84          27.4               16.0
85          33.0               21.0
86                             30.5
87                             33.0



4.02     Final cost of the project was US$52.3 million or 172 below appraisal
estimate (Table 1). The main reason for lower than expected cost was the high
devaluation that allowed for satisfactory accomplishment of physical scope at
lower local costs.
4.03      Devaluation also caused financial difficulties for FNCV to provide
counterpart funds which prompted the Bank to accept an increase in its
participation to ensure completion of the project as follows:
Engineering s             from 452 to 65Z
Construction:             from 45Z to 65Z
Rehabilitation:           from 45Z to 652
Equipment:                10OZ  (no change)
Technical Assistance:    872  (no change)
V.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     The creation of a Special Account for the Project contributed
significantly to FNCV's active financial performance. Up to 1984, FNCV's
financing met and sometimes exceeded appraisal forecasts.  Deposits to the
Special Account opened for the Project were made at. a faster rate than required
by the Bank deposits, thereby enabling the works to }roceed regularly.  In 1984,
FNCV started having difficulties with the provision of counterpart funds. High
devaluation of the Colombian peso made more difficult to keep up with the Bank's
dollar contribution. A change in the loan's percentage of disbursements was then
approved by the Bank as explained in para. 4.04, to ensure complete execution of
the project. In 1985 and until completion of the project, FNCV provided
sufficient counterpart funds, ensuring smooth development of works.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01     As a strategy for addressing the need to improve the existing rural
roads system, FNCV recognized the need to strengthen its planning, managerial and
control capabilities, with the aim of developing the organization into an
efficient planning and funding agency for programs carried out by the
decentralized departmental agencies. The performance of FNCV in this Project was
positive and the loan contributed to obtain significant institutional and
operational improvements. Consolidation of this improvements are considered in
the Rural Transport Project (Loan 2668-CO)
6.02     The main cause of project delay  -timely provision of sufficient
counterpart funds at start-up and during 1984 and 1985- was overcome by FNCV's
efforts to appropriate the required local financing for completion of the project
in 1285 and 1986.



- 7 -
6.63     Total manpower in FNCV grew from 1613 to 2340 during project
implementation due mainly to the number of positions the new maintenance and
construction equipment required and to increased supervision of works generated
by the project.
6.04     The overall institutional capacity was considered acceptable and
demonstrated a sound basis upon which to develop further its work execution
capabilities.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01    The pro3ect was justified at appraisal on the basis of quantified
benefits derivel froms (a) increased agricultural productivity, (b) savings to
existing traffic, and (c) improved access for the rural population. Since the
loan was conceived as a subsector loan supporting FNCV's 1981-84 Program, only
eight roads from typical geographical areas were selected and evaluated during
appraisal. The rest of the roads to be treated were selected and evaluated
during project implementation using an agreed methodology that allocated
resources among the 22 Departments of the country, ensuring regional balance.
Within each Department, the roads were selected among applications from users,
based on information reflecting costs and benefits of the projects. Roads with
greater social and economic benefits during a ten-year period, relative to
construction costs, and with economic rates of return higher than 112 were
selected, and a ranking of projects obtained, up to the point of FNCV's allocated
budget exhaustion. The eight-roads sample showed an average rate of return of
372.
7.02     For economic reevaluation of the project, 92kms out of the 671kms of new
roads constructed, and 63kms out of the 358kms of roads that received maintenance
were considered, due to lack of basic information on the rest of the roads
included in the project. Although physical goals were not fully attained,
significant benefits accrued from increases in agricultural production and from
savings in transportation costs, yielding economic rates of return within
expectations.  Table 4 shows the length and ERR estimated at appraisal and those
obtained ex-post for each road considered.  All roads prove to be economic as
well as the overall program. However, the overall ERR of 29.3Z obtained should
not be compared with the 37Z obtained at appraisal since the roads considered in
each case differ.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     The project was successful in achieving its objective of supporting
increases in agricultural production and reduction of transportation costs.
Attainment of physical goals was satisfactory, the equipment purchased supported
FNCV's aims to shift efforts from construction to maintenance activities and the
technical assistance recommendations, although not implemented under the project,
provided the basis for action concerning FNCV's institutional strengthening.



- 8 -
8.02     The contribution of the project to subsector management improvements,
such as building up of investment appraisal capabilities and more efficient
institutional performance, as well as expansion and better maintenance of the
rural road network were positive. However, consolidation of the improvement
efforts, in particular in the areas of programming, supervision and project
control, is recommended and considered in the Rural Trarsport Sector Project
(2668-CO).
8.03     A lesson to be learned from this project is that when a technical
assistance component is included in a project, some provisions should be made to
guarantee full implementation of the recommendations of the studies. Very
frequently the executing agency lacks the necessary funds, implementation has to
be postponed and the applicability of the studies may be lost.
8.04    Another lesson this project offers relates to FNCV's difficulties in
obtaining adequate and timely counterpart funds during the last four years of the
preject. The need for more efficient financial programming and coordinating
procedures is not a new problem in the Colombian transport sector and the issue
has been addressed in past and recent sector assessments by the Bank.
8.05     The project played a decisive influence in FNCV's 1981-87 activities in
its institutional development and produced a positive impact on the agricultural
sector and the communities affected.
