I:iTERNATICAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECaENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TURKEY
FOR AN IRRIGATION REHABILITATION AND CONPLETION PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to Turkey for the equivalent of $18 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a project for the rehabilitation and completion
of existing irrigation works in three areas.
PART I - I'nTODUCTION
2.     The level of Bank Group operations in Turlcey in the past has been
largely influenced by the almost chronic balance of payments difficulties
and the heavy external debt-service burden, the limited IDA resources which
could be made available to Turkey and to some extent difficulties in pro-
ject preparation. After 1968 the Bank and the Turkish authorities dis-
cussed the basis for a major increase in the level of lending. This was
regarded as primarily dependant on: firstly, improvements in Turkey's
general capacity to borrow a substantial part of its needs on Bank terms;
secondly, an intensification of measures to improve foreign exchange
earnings and particularly encourage exports by giving high priority to the
allocation of resources and incentives for export-oriented projects and
introducing a number of reforms in the system of trade and payments; and,
thirdly, a significant expansion in the capacity to select and prepare pro-
jects in priority areas. By the end of 1970, marked progress was made in
these fields, culminating in the devaluation of the Turkish lira in August
1970 and in the introduction of a stabilization program. The Government
recognized the need for Turkey to reach external viability within a reason-
able time period and gave high priority to the expansion of exports as the
principal means to achieve this. It also recognized the need for more
effective use of all resources, modernization of the organization and
machinery of government and rationalization of the existing industrial
infrastructure. Parallel with these developments, the Bank Group stepped
up the level of assistance in project preparation with special attention
being given to selection criteria, institution building and provision of
suitable arrangements for implementation.  As a result, the amount of Bank/
MDA lending reached $114 million in FY 1971, thus exceeding the level
achieved in the five preceding years.
3.     In the course of the joint efforts made by the Government and the
Bank to prepare projects, the continuing importance of agriculture was
recognized as well as, within this sector, the over-riding need to make
greater use of the substantial investments already made in major irrigation



works. It was felt that an improvement in the extent and efficiency of
water utilization on existing irrigation projects and the development of
high priced crops and high yielding varieties which this would permit,
would serve to demonstrate the benefits which could be achieved by allo-
cating greater financial and technical resources. At the same time, this
would provide a basis for re-examining the machinery for coordination and
implementation of the several ministries and agencies involved. It is in
this context that the irrigation rehabilitation and completion project
has been included in the Bank's lending program. The project is expected
to be the basis for a number of similar Bank Group operations in Turkey.
4.       A summary statement of Bank Loans, IDA Credits and IFC Invest-
ments is attached as Annex I. Past Bank Group operations in the Turkish
agricultural sector have focused on the Seyhan irrigation project (Loan
38-TU and Credit/Loan 143/587-TI), the execution of which has been satis-
factory after some initial difficulties. More recently one Credit (236-
TU) and one Credit and Loan (257/762-T'U) have been made to finance re-
spectively a Dairy Development Project and a Fruit and Vegetable Export
Project. The effectiveness dates of the five loans and credits made in
FY 1971 had to be postponed beyond the original dates due to delays in
fulfilling some of the conditions. However, four of the loans and credits,
namely the Dairy Project (Credit 236-TU), Education I (Loan 748-TU), and
the two power loans, TEK I(736-TU) and Cukurova IV (775-TU), have now been
declared effective. The delays are mainly due to the absence, within the
Turkish administration as presently organized, of a substantive, rather
than formal, coordinating link between the Bank and the Government. This
function was previously carried out by the State Planning Organization
which, following the change of Government in March 1971 and subsequent
administrative reorganization, lost its central coordinating role, and
has not so far been replaced in this regard by arn other body. The Bank
has made known to the Government its concern about this situation.
5.       Execution of previous projects has been satisfactory on the whole
with the exception of the Keban Transmission Lines Project (Loan 568-TU)
where progress has been interrupted by a dispute between Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) and the principal contractor concerning payment of the in-
creased cost of civil works following devaluation of the Turkish lira. This
matter has been put to arbitration. Meanwhile TEK has terminated the con-
tract and is arranging to complete the work themselves. It is expected
that the transmission lines will be completed in ample time to receive
power from the Keban hydroelectric project, which is itself delayed.
6.       Five Bank/IDA operations are planned for FY 1972 amounting to $153
million. In addition to the irrigation rehabilitation and completion pro-
ject, loans or credits are contemplated for livestock development, a steel
plant, a fertilizer plant and for urban development in Istanbul. Negotiations
for a $75 million loan for the expansion of the Erdemir Steel Plant are pro-
gressing but some arrangements with other lenders for the project (USAID and
Eximbank) and with the Government have still to be completed. The livestock



- 3 -
project ($15 million Credit), the fertilizer project ($23 million Loan)
and the Istanbul Urbanization project ($25 million Credit/Loan) have been
appraised and are expected to be negotiated in the first half of 1972.
7.     A Bank mission which visited Turkey in April 1970 identified the
need for rehabilitation and completion of a number of existing irrigation
schemes in Turkey. As a result, the Government submitted a list of schemes
which they consider suitable for Bank financing from which the present pro,
ject was selected. The project was appraised in May/June 1971. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington in November 1971. The Turkish delegation
was headed by Mr. A. T. Gul, Chief Commercial and Economic Counselor at
the Turkish Embassy, Washington, D.C., and included as representatives of
the Government agencies responsible for the construction of irrigation
works and on-farm development respectively, Mr. Sayin, Deputy Director
General of Devlet Su Isleri (DSI) and Mr. Erkenci, Director General of
Topraksu.
PART II - THE ECONG4Y
8.     A report "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-30a) dated
February 1, 1971 was distributed to the Executive Directors on February 14,
1971. This was updated by a memorandum entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Turkey"' (EMA-40a) dated July 19, 1971, which was distri-
buted on July 26, 1971. The next economic mission is scheduled for spring
1972. A country data sheet is attached as Annex II.
9.     Following the 1969 elections, which confirmed the Justice Party
in power, the Government under Prime Minister Demirel faced a constant
erosion of its majority in the National Assembly. At the same time, there
was growing violence by extremist groups of students and unrest among
workers, which continued through 1970 to the early months of 1971. In
March 1971, a new "above-party and reformist"' government was formed under
Prime Minister Erim following the intervention of the Armed Forces and
the resignation of the former government. The new government's program
called for the restoration of law and internal security, the reorganization
of the state administration, more rational management of the economy and
long overdue structural reforms. Growing opposition from Parliament and
the private sector to the reform proposals brought about the resignation
of a large group of technocratic Ministers in December 1971. A new coali-
tion Government, headed again by Prime Minister Erim, comprises a large
number of representatives of the political parties and fewer technocrats.
Its new program contains substantial parts of the Prime Minister's first
policy declaration in April 1971. It reiterates the national urgency of
executing major structural reforms, emphasizes the importance of the sur-
vival of democratic procedures in Turkey and appears to be conciliatory
both in tone and in the choice of key Ministers towards Parliament and the
private sector.



-'4-
10.    The report "The Development Prospects of Turkey" identified the
principal obstacles to development and noted that devaluation and the
stabilization program introduced in August 1970 reflected the Government's
aim to introduce a new external orientation of the economy and an effort
to develop exports and accelerate progress towards external viability. The
report pointed to the need to improve the situation of public finance and
to make more effective use of the budget as a fiscal instrument in con-
trolling the level of aggregate demand; to slow down the planned rate of
growth of public investment and improve its composition; to liberalize the
external trade regime and promote international competitiveness; and to
embark on an urgent program of rehabilitation of the principal deficitary
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs). These issues are not new; they have
been the central issues in Turkey's economic development for many years
but are of special importance at a time when Turkey aims at further rapid
growth and progress towards external viability.
11.    The Memorandmum on "The Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Turkey" reviewed economic developments since devaluation and described the
March 1971 Government program. The main thrust of the program was towards
long-term structural reforms which were unlikely to bear fruit in less
than 2-3 years. The wide-ranging reforms were to include: land and edu-
cational reform; far-reaching reorganization of the Government administra-
tion, including SEEs and control of external trade; reform of tax adminis-
tration and extension of tax coverage to agricultural incomes; nationalization
of private enterprise in mining, petroleum and forestry industries; and strip-
ter enforcement of the conditions for foreign capital investment, including
insistence on Turkish majority participation.
12.    While law and order were restored rapidly, the first Erim Government
was able, in its eight months of office, to translate few of its long-range
policies into detailed measures and decrees, although it was possible to in-
crease substantially the prices of various SEEs to make them financially viable.
The Government was unable to bring under control a number of critical short-
term difficulties, such as a serious fiscal imbalance and a rapid price in-
crease, both of which were adversely affected by the financial implications
of the ambitious Personnel Reform introduced by its predecessor. The
private sector's attitude was affected by what were believed to be anti-
business trends in the Government's policies and, consequently, economic
activity did not pick up as rapidly as expected. In the Prime Minister's
December 1971 statement more emphasis is placed on the role of the private
sector which is to enjoy the same importance as the State sector. Many of
the features of the original program of April 1971 affecting the private
sector have been modified and shoul& help allay the fears of both domestic
and foreign private investors.



13.      Economic grmoth in 1970 was influenced by factors associated with
civil unrest, growing balaiice of paynrents difficulty and devaluation as well
as by unfavorable weather for agriculture. GNP grew by 5.6 percent at con-
stant prices, compared with an average of 6.6 percent in earlier years. In-
dustrial growth slowed down to 3 percent, compared to 10 percent in 1969,
and agricultural output rose by only 1 percent. However, other sectors grew
in the aggregate at 7 percent. In 1971 the economic situation has been
favored by a remarkable improvement in the overall balance of payments
position following the devaluation and by the record agricultural output for
the 1970/71 crop year. Despite these favorable factors, which will probably
result in a record growth rate of about 8 percent for the year as a whole,
investment activity has only grown slowly from the low point reached at the
time of devaluation and industrial growth has only recently begun to pick ip
steam again.
14.      The trade deficit for 1971 has increased but this has been partly
offset, following devaluation, by the increase in workers' remittances to a
record level of $273 million in 1970 and an estimated $400 million for 1971.
The current account deficit was also financed by a substantial increase in
public capital inflow and some private foreign investment. As a result,
the net foreign assets of the Central Bank rose to about $230 million at
the end of September 1971 compared with about $10 million at the end of 1970
and a net liability at the end of 1968. Following the changes introduced in
the relationship between the major world currencies in December 1971, Turkey
established a central rate of 14 Turkish Lira to the U.S. dollar (instead
of the previous parity of TL 15 to the dollar).
15.      The growth in domestic savings, which had been improving during
earlier years, slowed down in 1969 and more noticeably in 1970, the rate
of increase dropping to 2.5 percent in 1970 compared to 14 percent in 1968.
Budgetary resources in particular have been severely strained, mainly be-
cause of the rise in civil, servants' salaries under the 1970 Personnel Re-
form Law. The public investment target for 1971 (10 percent above 1970)
is unlikely to be achieved. In the private sector investment has also
continued to lag and deposits in the banking sector have grown faster
than credits. Finally, due to increased government salaries and wage
settlements, the effects of the 66 percent devaluation on import prices,
and substantial price increases in the products of State Economic Enter-
prises, wholesale prices increased by 21 percent between August 1970 and
August 1971.
16.      The economic situation in 1971 can be regarded as a transitional one,
reflecting the first effects of major adjustments in exchange rate, domes-
tic prices and salaries. Other major factors not likely to be repeated are
probably once-for-all changes, such as clearing of the backlog of imports
and changes in the Personnel Reform Law, which have led to a jump to a new



- 6 -
plateau. However, the basic economic problems restricting growth remain
unchanged and the need for structural reform is as strong as ever. More-
over, the immediate economic situation is severely strained by the heavy
budgetary cost of the Personnel Reform Law, by a possible continued drain
on resources arising from the financial situation of some of the SEEs and
by the need to step up investment expenditure. At the same time, sub-
stantial inflationary pressures exist from the side of wages and output
prices. In view of these inflationary pressures and budgetary diffi-
culties, the Government will need to take energetic but delicately balanced
measures to contain aggregate demand whilst at the same time mobilizing
and injecting additional resources into the economy through efforts to
step up investment activity in both the public and private sectors. The
Government program attaches special importance to the allocation  of re-
sources required for efficient utilization of existing capacities, in-
vestment in quick yielding projects and concentration on completing on-
going ones. It reiterates the necessity for renewed efforts to promote
exports and calls for a major increase in taxation to balance the 1972
budget and finance an increase of 30 percent in the level of public in-
vestment expenditures in 1972. These measures, which will put the strengtl
of the new Government to a major test, should be supplemented by an overall
income policy and effective machinery for consultation between the Govern-
ment, employers and labor to exercise some control over wage and price
increases.
17.    Following successive debt rescheduling and arrangements for debt
relief, and the record level of workers' remittances in 1970, the debt
service ratio was lower than expected, amounting to 16 percent of total
foreign exchange earnings. In the longer term, if the country enjoys
political stability and if the Government intensifies its efforts to
promote exports and can push through at least a modified reform program,
the economic prospects remain promising. Turkey will continue to need
substantial amounts of external assistance. But even with a projected
gross inflow of external assistance in excess of $400 million per year
and gradually hardening terms, the debt service burden can be expected
to fluctuate around 15 percent of exports of goods and services, in-
cluding workers' remittances, provided exports and workers' remittances
continue to grow as projected.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
18.    A report entitled "Agricultural Policies and Problems" was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors as Volume III, Annex 1, of the report
"The Development Prospects of Turkey"t referred to in paragraph 8 above.



- 7 -
19.    Although agriculture contributes only about 30 percent of the na-
tional product it provides some 65-70 percent of total employment, supplies
most of the raw materials for industry, and accounts for the bulk of
Turkey's export earnings. Recent performance has been disappointing as
agriculture has lagged behind the economy and generally fallen short of
the First and Second Plan targets. In the First Plan period 1963-67,
agriculture value added expanded at 3.4 percent annually. The Second
Plan, 1967-72, calls for an increase of 23 percent in gross value added
by agriculture, equivalent to a growth rate of 4.2 percent annually, but
the actual rate was only 1.9 percent in 1968 and close to 1 percent in
1969 and 1970. Given the shortfall in the first three years, it is ex-
tremely doubtful whether the 1972 target can now be reached. However,
the crop year in 1971 was unusually good and with reasonably favorable
conditions in 1972 it should be possible to achieve an annual growth rate
of 3.0 to 3.5 percent for the Second Plan period.
20.    The cultivation of cereals accounts for about 70 percent of the
total cropped area and for over 30 percent of the value of production.
Livestock accounts for 27 percent of the value of production, industrial
crops (mostly cotton, tobacco and sugarbeet) for 17 percent, fruit and
vegetables, which have expanded rapidly in recent years, about 15 percent,
whilst forestry and fishing account for about 1.5 percent and less than
1 percent respectively and miscellaneous items for 9 percent. The rate
of growth of wheat production appears to have been about 2 percent per year,
well below the 2.6 percent population growth, despite the recent intro-
duction in some areas of new high yielding varieties as part of a techno-
logical package, including intensive      fertilizer use and improved cul-
tivation. Other cereals appear to have increased even more slowly, at 1.5
percent per year. In the case of cotton, its rapid expansion has been
favored by the increasing use of irrigated land as well as the existence
of profitable export markets. Until 1962 industrial crops, as a whole,
increased at about 4.3 percent per year but since then appear to have been
increasing at about 7 percent per year. In sharp contrast in performance,
livestock production appears to have virtually stagnated in recent years,
whilst forestry, with its rich resources, remains perhaps the least de-
veloped major sub-sector due to the fact that the nation's extensive forests
have not been effectively harvested.
21.    Several attempts have been made to introduce land reform since 1945
but without success. The Government which held office in March-December
1971 gave central importance to the subject in its reform program. It is
not yet known whether the new Government will maintain or amend the key
features of the draft bill which is under parliamentary discussion. The
main target of its proposals are the very small number of large holdings
above 20 ha. which occupy over 30 percent of the land. The equally im-
portant problem of land fragmentation appears to attract less attention.
Very little serious land consolidation has been done, although a regulation



-8-
exists requiring land consolidation to be carried out on major government
irrigation schemes. During negotiations for the present project, the Bank
has expressed its concern over the lack of progress on consolidation, and
it is expected that this subject will be given attention in the land re-
form legislation.
22.    An important factor contributing to the expansion of output and
offsetting in part losses due to adverse weather conditions has been the
extension of the irrigated area. Apart from the large increase in cotton
production, the provision of water has led to some expansion of citrus
and other fruit production and could lead to a major increase in vegetablo
production, provided profitable market outlets can be developed, and to
an increase in production of fodder crops which in turn would contribute
to an expansion of livestock production. An ambitious program of construc-
tion of major dams and irrigation works has been in execution for many
years. This has been undertaken efficiently but insufficient attention has
been given to the need to bring these projects into full productive use
by allocating corresponding resources to on-farm development and other
supporting services and strenghening proportionately the responsible
Government agencies. Thus, while Turkey's investments in irrigation works
in the past have been substantial, their contribution to overall agricultural
growth has been relatively small, due mainly to under-utilization, with re-
sultant losses to the economy.
23.    Turkeyts agricultural policy shows little change over the last two
decades although the country has substantially increased investment in
agriculture and increased the availability of inputs. Ihe main conditions
for progress, i.e. technological innovations of particular application
to Turkey and the improvement in resources allocation and incentives, are
still hampered by continued agricultural price support payments which at their
present levels are no longer economically justified; by inadequacy of appli.ed
research and extension work; by limited and somewhat ineffective credit
facilities; and by an insufficient utilization of the natural resources
available in livestock and forestry. Moreover, much of the investment has
not yet been brought to successful fruition. Finally, most of these short-
comings reflect the lack of a modern institutional structure centered on a
strong Ministry of Agriculture capable of formulating and implementing con-
sistent long term policies, and the difficulties of ensuring the coordina-
tion of effort and consistency of policies of other departments and agencies
affected.
24.    Agriculture's generally poor performance can be improved by approp-
riate changes in organization and policy, with greater concentration on
high priority activities. Priorities could include: (a) completion and
full utilization of existing irrigation projects while limiting the start
of new large-scale irrigation to fully integrated projects; (b) in-
creased wheat production, especially on the Anatolian plateau,



- 9 -
and integrated rural development projects in the poorest parts of Eastern
Turkey; (c) increased production of fruit and vegetables for export;
(d) development of livestock including dairying, fattening, feedstuffs
and marketing; (e) reduced production of the surplus commodities, tobacco
and tea, and a more rational program for sugar, through revision of price
policies and development of alternative products; (f) greater utilization
of forest resources; and (g) expansion of credit facilities, provision of
new high yielding and disease resistant seed varieties, adequate and
timely supplies of fertilizers and other inputs, and expansion of farmer
training and extension services.
25.    The Government is now giving priority to the completion of ongoing
projects in most fields. The present project represents the first serious
attempt to apply this policy in the irrigation sector. By adhering to
this policy in future and adopting the complementary measures called for,
in particular the creation of a unified structure of control and priority
allocation of resources for on-farm development and extension services, it
would be possible for Turkey to fully develop and bring into effective use
some 60-80,000 ha. per year of land connected with irrigation works either
constructed but incomplete or under construction. Further Bank Group
lending is planned to assist this policy through subsequent irrigation re-
habilitation projects and the extension of the irrigated areas in the
Cukurova region (financed under earlier Bank/ImDA projects). In addition,
Bank assistance will focus on livestock, fruit and vegetable and forestry
development as well as on agricultural credit which will be the subject of
a comprehensive survey financed under the 1971 Fruit and Vegetable Export
Project. Finally, while the crucial program for increased wheat production
has so far received adequate assistance from other foreign donors, little
has been done to prepare a program for rural development in the poorest
parts of Turkey, where most of the large-scale emigration to cities ori-
ginates; the Bank plans to study with the Government the possibility of
formulating such a program suitable for Bank Group assistance.
PART IV - T1E PROJECT
26.    A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
Report entitled "'Appraisal of an Irrigation Rehabilitation and Completion
Project" (PA-108a) dated January 4, 1972   which is being distributed
separately. A Development Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex
III.
27.    The project is situated in the following three areas of Asian Turkey:
(a) Silifke, on the Mediterranean coast about 400 km south-east
of Ankara near the town of Silifke.  The Project Area includes
about 5,000 net ha of irrigated land along both banks of the
Goksu river. Rice and peanuts are the main summer crops, with
some oranges and other fruits, vegetables and sesame.



- 10 -
(b)  Koprucay, on the Mediterranean coast about 360 km south-west
ofAnkara and about 40 km east of the city of Antalya. The
Project Area includes about 22,000 net ha. of irrigable lands
that can be served by gravity and pumping from the main canals
heading at the existing Eoprucay Diversion Dam. Cnly about
9,000 ha are presently under irrigation, with cotton and rice
the main irrigated crops. Dry crops are mainly winter cereals,
mostly wheat.
(c) Tokat, on the Anatolia Plateau about 350 km north-east of
Ankara and some 100 km from the Black Sea near the town of
Tokat. The Project Area includes about 23,000 net ha. lying
along both sides of the Yesilirmak river and consists of those
lands that can be served by gravity from the existing diversion
dam of Tolmakkaya in the Qmala plain and Gumenek dam in the
Kazova and Turhal plains. About 12,000 ha. are presently under
irrigation and the main irrigated crops are winter wheat, sugar
beet and orchard with small areas of vegetables, maize and vine-
yards. Under dry farming conditions, wheat is the prevailing
crop.
28.    The proposed project, which is estimated to cost $36.6 million equi-
valent, is intended to rehabilitate and complete the water distribution
network and on-farm development on the above irrigation schemes, now parti-
ally serving about 26,000 ha., which would be expanded to serve a total
area of about 50,000 ha. Additional features of the project include the
improvement of roads, provision of adequate credit and improvement of
extension activities. The project provides for equipment for construction,
operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage facilities and for use
in land levelling, for improvement of Topraksuls workshops at Antalya and
Sivas and for vehicles for extension agents. The project also includes the
use of Consultants to assist Tbpraksu and the Extension Service in organi-
zing their work and allows for training abroad of selected DSI, Topraksu
and Extension Service employees.
29.    Project Administration.  The coordinated action of four Goverrment
Agencies is required to impIement the project.
(a) DSI - State Hydraulic Works (an agency of the Ministry of Energy
and Natural Resources) would be responsible for constructing all
project irrigation and drainage works down to the farm unit;
(b) Topraksu - Soil Conservation Agency (an agency of the Ministry of
Village Affairs) would be responsible for carrying out all on-
farm development works including land levelling, installation of
tile and surface drainage, improvement of soil structure and re-
habilitation of existing roads in each Project Area;



- 11 -
(c) Extension Service (under the Ministry of Agriculture) would
be responsible for educating farmers in modern and improved
methods of cultivation in the Project Areas and bringing about
the required change in cropping patterns by expanding the areas
under higher value crops; and
(d) Agricultural Bank of Turkey (an autonomous government agency
under the Ministry of Commerce) would be responsible for pro-
viding agricultural credit.
30.    In order to achieve the coordination of these various activities,
the Turkish Government would be required to establish, within three months
of the date on which the Development Credit Agreement becomes effective,
a separate coordinating committee for each of the Project Areas on which
these Agencies would be represented. As far as the Extension Service is
concerned, where special emphasis on coordination is required, the Govern-
ment would appoint a local coordinator for extension in each Project Area.
Similar arrangements have proved effective in implementing the Seyhan pro-
ject.
31.    Consultants.  Both Topraksu and the Extension Service would require
outside assistance in organizing their work. The Government has therefore
agreed to appoint a firm of consultants who would provide two experts for
Topraksu to train equipment operators, layout a sequence of machine opera-
tion and supervise related work, plus two experts for the Extension Ser-
vice to train extension workers and provide guidance in establishing a
coordinated extension effort in the Project Areas. These experts would
be stationed at Koprucay and Tokat. The third Project Area at Silifke
would be assisted by the consultants now serving the Seyhan project who
can assume this task without difficulty. DSI has had considerable ex-
perience in constructing, operating and maintaining irrigation and drainage
projects in Turkey and is considered capable of processing work on the
project without outside assistance. However, if during the course of the
work outside assistance does appear necessary, the Association would re-
quest the Government to retain consultants also for DSI.
32.    Procurement. Equipment, materials and vehicles required for the
project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit would be pro-
cured on the basis of international competitive bidding. Local manu-
facturers would be allowed a 15 percent preference or the import duty,
whichever is lower, in bid comparison. Certain items of equipment,
materials and vehicles which can be manufactured locally have been reserved
for local procurement under normal government bidding procedures and would
be financed entirely by the Goverrment.



- 12 -
33.      Some civil works would be carried out without international com-
petitive bidding where coordination is required between work on the project
and the need to maintain water services, or where work of a specialized nature
is to be undertaken. This work would be carried out wherever possible by
local contractors and to encourage bidding for land leveling and tile drainage
work, bids would be invited for work on blocks of at least 1,000 hectares in each
project Erea. IWhere local contractors for any work could not be found, DSI and Top-
raksu would undertake the work through force account, the expenditure on which
is estimated at $6 million, of which about $2.7 million would be financed
from the proposed credit. All other work would be carried out under contract
following international competitive bidding procedures. To the extent prac-
ticable, all major works on each project would be put into one contract in
order to attract international competitive bidders but each contract would
be divided into different sections which could be bid separately, thus making
it possible for domestic contractors to bid. DSI and Topraksu have agreed to
submit, within six months of the date of signing of the Development Credit
Agreement, a schedule of work to be undertaken on each of the Project Areas
with recommendations for specific work to be carried out by contract or by
force account.
34.      Project Costs and Disbursements.  The total cost of the project
(including contingencies) is estimated at $36.6 million equivalent, of which
$12.3 million would be in foreign exchang e. A detailed breakdown of costs
is given in Annex III. The proposed Credit of $18.0 million would cover
about 50 percent of the estimated project cost, including the total foreign
exchange component, plus $6.7 million equivalent of local expenditure (pri-
marily part of the cost of civil works). Financing of part of the local ex-
penditure is recommended for high priority projects such as this, since the
shortage of public savings has become an increasingly critical constraint on
investment in Turkey, particularly since the August 1970 devaluation. More-
over the financing of local currency expenditures for this project is ex-
pected to encourage the government agencies concerned to step up preparation
and implementation of the sizeable backlog of rehabilitation schemes which
might otherwise continue to suffer from insufficient budget allocations.
35.      The Credit would be disbursed against the full cost of equipment,
materials and vehicles, the full foreign exchange cost of consultant ser-
vices and training and 46 percent of the cost of civil works. Turkey would
finance the balance of the local currency cost of the project, estimated at
$18.6 million, the incremental annual recurrent cost of the project estimated
at $0.8 million, and make available adequate agricultural credit to farmers ir.
the Project Areas, where credit demand is expected to double from $4 million
to $8 million per year.



- 13 -
36.    The cost estimates for the project in the Appraisal Report are
based on the exchange rate of TL 15 to the US dollar in force prior to
the establishment of the central rate of TL 14 to the US dollar in December
1971. While the overall impact of this change on the project is ex-
pected to be minimal, it is difficult to forecast what the detailed effects
of this and of the other recent currency changes will be. No major impact
on the foreign exchange cost of the project is expected in view of mutually
offsetting factors. As regards local costs, the share to be financed by
IDA may be somewhat reduced, but not significantly, and the Appraisal Re-
port estimates have not therefore been revised. The disbursement per-
centage for civil works will be adjusted later on as may be necessary in
the light of revised cost estimates to ensure that disbursements will
continue until all expenditures for such works have been made.
37.    Water Charges.  DSI would make arrangements for the setting of
water charges levied on farms in the Project Areas at levels which will
provide revenues at least sufficient to cover all operating and maintenance
costs and provide for the recovery of as much as practicable of the in-
vestment costs, taking into account farmers incentives and capacity to
pay, together with reasonable interest thereon. These arrangements are
expected to be introduced following the review of water charges now being
undertaken by the consultants appointed under the Seyhan Project, and will
be subject to periodic review at intervals not exceeding five years.
38.    Economic benefits. Most of the incremental cotton produc,ion from
the project is expected to be exported, and there would be an annual
increase of some US $4.4 million equivalent in foreign exchange earnings;
in addition a portion of the vegetable production would probably be ex-
ported. At full production, about five years after completion of the pro-
ject, the annual net value of production from the three Project Areas,
valued at international prices, is estimated at TL 260 million (US $17.3
million), compared to TL 119 million (US $7.9 million) at present and a
projected value without the project of TL 137 million (US 9.1 million).
The incremental net value of production due to the project would thus be
TL 123 million (US $8.2 million).



- 14 -
39.    The average life of project facilities has been assessed at 50
years. Over this period the economic rates of return are estimated at 19
percent for Koprucay, 18 percent for Silifke and 12 percent for Tokat.
40.    Some 11,500 farm families would benefit directly from the project.
The annual incremental income available to typical farmers, after operation
and maintenance costs, is estimated at TL 1,,490 per ha. at Tokat, where
climatic conditions restrict the opportunity for double cropping, TL 2,580
per ha. at Silifke, and TL 3,520 per ha. at Koprucay. Farm sizes vary in
each Project Area; however, taking a typical farm size of 3 ha. at Silifke,
4 ha. at Tokat and 6 ha. at Koprucay, annual incremental incomes would
amount to TL 7,730, TL 5,990 and TL 21,110 respectively. 'The project
would require some 14,300 man years or twice the present employment
opportunity. It is expected that this increase would be met by family
labor except at Koprucay where seasonal hired labor would be needed for
planting and harvest of cotton, rice and tomatoes. The project would also
generate additional employment opportunities in processing agricultural
products, such as in cotton gins, canning industries and sugar factories.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.    The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Turkey
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section i (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Reso-
lution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to
the normal pattern for credits for irrigation projects in Turkey.
42.    I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - REC1MMENDATION
43.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
