1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Since the devastating civil war ended in 1992, Mozambique has enjoyed a
remarkable recovery, achieving an average annual rate of economic growth of 8 percent
between 1996 and 2008. As a result, the poverty headcount index fell by 15 percentage
points between 1997 and 2003, bringing almost 3 million people above the poverty line
and out of extreme poverty (out of a total population of 20 million). Regional inequality
remained relatively low and progress was made toward the key Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) of infant mortality and primary enrollment. For instance there was a 32
percent decrease in under-five mortality from 1996-2006.

2.      Despite the promising progress, the country remained one of the poorest countries
in the world. In 2007, the Human Development Index ranked Mozambique 172 out of
177 countries. With an annual per capita income of US$330 in 2007 and 54 percent of the
population still below the poverty line, Mozambique was a poor country with
considerable social and economic challenges; infrastructure assets and services (energy,
transport, water and sanitation, and telecom) were inadequate and significant unmet
education and health needs. The national HIV prevalence rose from 13.3 percent in 2002
to 16.3 percent in 2004 among those aged between 15 and 49 years.

Education Sector Background at Appraisal

3.      In 1998 Mozambique introduced its first Education Sector Support Plan (ESSP)
(1999-2005) which was focused on primary education with specific objectives of
increasing access, quality, and capacity building as its key priorities.

4.       The ambitious reform agenda included (i) the abolition of school fees in 2005; (ii)
curricular reform and introduction of semi-automatic promotion (with exams in grades 3,
5, and 7); and (iii) provision of free textbooks and learning materials. In this period the
Ministry placed emphasis on accelerated classroom construction within a decentralized
institutional framework. Reforms aimed at improving access saw tremendous success,
including a 65 percent increase in net primary school enrollment. This vast expansion of
the education system led to significant challenges such as an increase in the pupil: teacher
ratio from 68:1 to 74:1 from 2004 to 2006. The education system was also characterized
by a number of additional challenges, including but not limited to: (i) only 41 percent of
boys and 28.7 percent of girls completing standard 5; (ii) around 25 percent, or
approximately 660,000 children in the age group 6–10 years, were out of school 1
(660,000 children); (iii) instruction hours were far below the750–900 hours required to

teach the new curriculum; and (iv) limited school infrastructure as well as school
furniture and teaching and learning materials.

5.      The second Strategic Plan for Education and Culture (SPEC/SPEC) 2006-
2010/11, operationalizes the Government Five Year Plan (PQG) 2005-2009 and re-
emphasizes the objectives of the previous plan, which continued to be valid and included
the reforms that were initiated in the latter phase of the implementation of the first sector
plan. The SPEC was designed as a framework for planning to help the government and its
partners plan effective interventions, allocate resources, and monitor and evaluate lessons
learned. The SPEC was organized with components that corresponded to the
organizational responsibilities of Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC). Although the
framework included all education sub-sectors, the highest priority for SPEC was primary
education and the achievement of the MDGs for education. As a result, there was more
emphasis on improving the quality of education and on increasing student retention up to
grade 7. At the same time, the SPEC anticipated an increase in the efforts to develop
post-primary education and reduce the level of illiteracy in order to create the necessary
human capacity to sustain an economy in continuous growth. Thus the SPEC also
incorporated the sub-sectors of higher education and culture.

6.      In Mozambique there were, and continue to be, approximately 21 active
Development Partners (DPs) including bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors that are actively
involved in the education sector. Three types of financing modalities were used to
support the education sector, including general budget support, stand-alone project
support, and the education sector support fund (FASE). FASE was developed in 2002 to
allow Development Partners to support the education sector through a pooled fund
mechanism. FASE was established to ensure that the Government and DPs support for
sector plan implementation was done in a more coordinated manner. Among the DPs, ten
channel their funds through FASE. MEC considers FASE the most harmonized and
aligned form of external support in the education sector. In 2008, the commitments to the
implementation of the sector´s strategic plan through FASE were US$120 million
including the Catalytic Fund of US$28 million (year 1)

7.     All DPs coordinated their support for the education sector through the sector-wide
approach (SWAp) involving joint reviews and evaluations as well as on-going dialogue
on strategic issues. Three meetings were (and still are) held each year during which
progress on the SPEC was measured against an agreed set of indicators (E-PAF). The
meetings also discussed strategic issues for future action.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The Program Document Development Objectives were to improve the access,
quality and equity of primary and secondary education by supporting the implementation
of the Government’s Strategic Plan for Education and Culture 2006-2010/11 (SPEC).

9.    To monitor progress of the SPEC, an education performance assessment
framework (E-PAF) had been developed. The E-PAF included a set of 22 education

                                             2
outcome, output, and process indicators corresponding to the various components under
SPEC. The SPEC and the full set of E-PAF were attachments to the Bank’s Fast Track
Initiative’s Project Document when the Project Document (PD) was submitted for
approval. The PD did not specify specific E-PAF indicators to measure achievement of
the PDO. Once the team began implementation of the FTI grant, the following education
sector indicators related to primary and secondary education and literacy were selected to
be monitored through the ISR:
 Primary completion rate
 Students enrolled in primary education
 Students enrolled in secondary education
 Illiteracy rate reduced

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators


10.   Neither the PDO nor the key indicators were revised during project
implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The principle beneficiaries of the project were the: (i) children enrolled in grades
1-12 who would benefit from an improved learning environment. Children are more
likely to complete the primary education cycle with a higher quality of learning due to
improved school environment including improved teaching and learning materials, and a
reduced pupil:teacher ratio resulting from an increase in the number of trained teachers;
(ii) teachers who benefitted from the reforms in pre-service and in-service teacher
programs focused on skills development; and (iii) central, province, and district staff who
received capacity building activities.

1.5 Original Components

12.     The components supported by FASE are defined by SPEC. The specific activities
are discussed and agreed upon on a yearly basis based on the sector needs and gaps of
MEC within a given year. The government presents annual plans to the DPs for their
review and no objection prior to implementation of the activities. The FTI grant request,
prepared by the Ministry and its DPs aimed at additional funding to fill the financing gap
of the SPEC 2006-2011 as identified through the projection model designed for the
costing of the SPEC that prioritized the achievement of the MDGs. FASE funding, and
through this the FTI grant, is primarily used to finance interventions directly related to
access and quality for primary and secondary education, as well as literacy. The original
components in the Project Document were described as follows:

13.    Component 1. Primary Education. This component supports the improvement of
access and quality in primary education by building additional classrooms in rural areas;
provision and utilization of primary textbooks, as well as basic teaching and learning

                                             3
materials, and strengthening the provincial and district level education management
capacity.

14.    Component 2. Non-formal Adult Literacy Program. This component supports
implementation of literacy programs for adult learners by, developing and distributing
teaching and learning materials, and provision of training to provincial and district
education officers involved in adult non-formal education.

15.    Component 3. Secondary Education and Technical and Vocational Education.
This component supports the development of a secondary and technical and vocational
education strategy and further construction of secondary and technical and vocational
schools, and provision and utilization of textbooks, and other teaching and learning
materials.

16.     Component 4. Teacher Training and Support. This component supports in-service
teacher training programs at all levels of education. More than half of the primary
teachers in Mozambique are considered “unqualified?. The component will also
strengthen school supervision through provision of training, transportation, and other
operational costs.

17.     Component 5. Higher Education. This small component supports strategy
development and finances technical assistance, consisting of goods and services, relevant
to the higher education reform.

18.     Component 6. Special programs in Distance, Special, ICT, Gender and HIV/AIDS
Education. This component supports the construction of special education centers (sites
to be determined), procurement of hardware and software for ICT application at the
central and provincial level, procurement of sensitization materials for gender and
HIV/AIDS education and prevention, and development of programs in distance education,
gender, and HIV/AIDs, including goods and services required for these programs.

19.     Component 7. Institutional Development. This component supports the
strengthening of Ministry institutional and fiduciary capacity at the central, provincial,
and district level. At all levels of education administration, there will be provision of
equipment, technical assistance and training in policy development, monitoring and
evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

20.    The original components were not revised.



1.7 Other Significant Changes



                                            4
21.     There were no changes in the project’s design, scope and scale. The closing date
of the project was extended. The extension was for 6 months from June 20, 2010 to
December 31, 2010. This extension allowed for the delivery of goods to take place before
the project closing date.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.      EFA-FTI Preparation Process. In 2002/2003 Mozambique was invited to
participate in the EFA-FTI partnership. This first phase was characterized by the
elaboration of the country sector plan for achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) in primary education. The plan included, among other aspects, reforms related
to: (i) abolition of fees for primary education; (ii) direct support mechanism to schools;
(iii) expansion of the primary education cycle from 5 to 7 years; (iv) development and
roll out of the new primary curriculum; (v) acceleration of teacher training; (vi)
construction of classrooms with controlled costs through community involvement; and
(vii) increasingly decentralized management (up to school boards). The Development
Partners (at country level) affirmed the credibility of this plan and committed to increase
their funding to support the implementation. Thus, the plan was endorsed by EFA-FTI
partnership in March 2003. This sector plan document was the basis for the preparation
of a new mid-term sector strategic plan (SPEC 2006-2010/11). SPEC, which was
approved by the Council of Ministers in June 2006, laid out the education sectors
objectives, strategies and financing to address key constraints in the education system
during the period of 2006 -2010.

23.     The second FTI phase in Mozambique started in 2007. In 2007 the EFA FTI
expanded the number of countries that qualified for their Catalytic Fund, the list of
eligible countries now included Mozambique. The Catalytic Fund grew out of a trust fund
arrangement between the Netherlands and the WB to channel funds to Cape Verde in
2003. The Catalytic Fund (CF) was expected to provide funds to countries with sound
and sustainable education sector plans that had been endorsed by the Local Education
Group and required additional external funding for implementation. At the time of the
Mozambique application the guidelines for the expanded Fast Track Initiative Catalytic
Fund (FTI-CF) applications were not yet comprehensive or detailed. Mozambique was
part of the first wave of countries benefiting from the support of the expanded FTI-CF.

24.    A costing module was included in SPEC, which presented a financing gap of
US$79 million. Filling in this gap became the basis of the application submitted to the
FTI-CF. In May 2007, the FTI Steering Committee awarded a CF grant in total amount
of US$79 million for which a Grant Agreement was signed between the Bank and the
Government of Mozambique in 2008, and the funds were channeled through the FASE to
support the financing of the sector strategic plan for 3 years (2008-2010).2



2
    The total program time was 2 years and 3 months, though it concerned the financing of three annual plans.

                                                            5
25.     World Bank Role in Grant Proposal Preparation In 2002, the pooled fund,
FASE was established guided by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) describing the
structure and institutional mechanisms for pooling funds, originally signed by 8 partners
including the WB in support of the implementation of the first strategic plan. In
preparation for the second SPEC 2006-2011, the original MoU for FASE was
renegotiated, aimed at better alignment with national systems. The revised MoU was
signed in 2006 between the Government of Mozambique and 6 development agencies
including the Department for International Development (DfID), Canada, Finland,
Germany, Ireland, and The Netherlands.3 The Bank did not participate in the MoU review
process and subsequent signing as there was no stand-alone Bank operation supporting
the sector at the time; the IDA project, Education Sector Support Project (ESSP) had just
closed. Thus, the revised MoU did not accommodate for Bank fiduciary procedures.


26.     When the FTI-CF awarded Mozambique USD 79 million with the World Bank as
the default supervising entity (SE), the WB was unable to commit to channeling the FTI-
CF through FASE. This raised concerns amongst the in-country donors as there was
general agreement that providing funds through FASE would be the most harmonized
and coordinated method for supporting the education sector goals. The following options
were considered: (i) an alternative to the WB be identified for the SE position; (ii) the
World Bank to manage the FTI-CF funds outside of FASE; or (iii) MoU be amended to
allow for World Bank procurement procedures. The discussion around these options led
to protracted and at times contentious debate between the Bank, DPs, and MEC. A final
agreement was reached between the Government and the WB resulting in the amendment
of the procurement arrangements under the MoU through a technical annex specifying
the Bank fiduciary policies, signed in September 3, 2008 and endorsed by all FASE
signatories. The FTI-CF was then channeled through the FASE. Although the process of
negotiation was lengthy and tedious, it did not delay the disbursement of FTI funds to
finance the implementation of the sector plan. 4 In part as a result of this contentious
experience in Mozambique, rules for the selection of an alternative SE were clarified.
Local Education Groups now must nominate the partner that will act as the SE before
submitting their FTI-CF funding request. Interestingly, however, the MINED and the
Development Partners agreed that the World Bank should continue to be the supervising
entity for the second EFA-FTI-CF approved for Mozambique in November 2010 and to
be implemented during the period 2011-2014.

27.     Project Design. The FTI-CF was expected to support the government’s endorsed
sector plan that consolidated the gains achieved through the implementation of the first
sector plan and former IDA-supported projects. In this way, the FTI-CF support was
well-aligned with Government priorities and major education sector issues. The Bank
team also undertook a Financial Management and Procurement Assessment which
detailed an action plan to mitigate fiduciary risks. The drawback in the project
design/preparation was that the PD lacked a detailed framework with targeted actions,

    Portugal, Spain, UNICEF, Italy and the Flanders signed more recently.
4
    The FTI request stipulated FTI CF disbursement in the third trimester of 2008.

                                                             6
risk ratings and the results framework. This was due to the fact that at the time, there
were no specific guidelines for the preparation of project documents for these grants, and
Project Appraisal Documents were not required. 5 The brief PD that was prepared
outlined the main areas supported by the overall FASE. However the FTI-CF funds were
expected to be allocated to support those selected components of the SPEC that
contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 6
Specifically, the funds were expected to be allocated to: direct support to primary and
secondary schools, primary teachers’ training, textbooks provision, classroom
construction and institutional capacity development. The ICR focuses on the
implementation and impact of these interventions.

28.     Quality at Entry. At the time of the FTI-CF application, there were no defined
FTI-CF procedures for a quality at entry review. The FTI-CF application was granted
based on the positive assessment of the local donor group that followed that the
guidelines prepared by FTI to assess sector plans. As the FTI contribution was meant to
support the implementation of the endorsed sector plan no specific procedures for a
quality review of the PD were set and the PD did not undergo a quality review.

2.2 Implementation

29.    Monitoring. MEC was the implementing agency for the FTI-CF and the FASE.
Three meetings were held each year to (i) monitor progress on the SPEC against an
agreed set of indicators (E-PAF); (ii) discuss strategic issues for future action; and (iii)
agree upon a yearly set of activities and a disbursement schedule for the FASE funds for
the coming year. The activities were always aligned with the country needs and in
accordance with the MoU signed by DPs and Government.

30.      Fiduciary Guidelines. In accordance with the MoU annex and the selection of
the Bank as the Supervising Entity, FASE funds were required to follow Bank
procurement guidelines. The project financial management and disbursements were
agreed in the MoU and each year the disbursements were made based on the agreed
yearly activities. Implementation of this process has been judged to be successful.
Initially, the procurement capacity within MEC was more limited. However, the Bank,
amongst others, provided technical assistance and MEC is now able to prepare detailed
annual procurement plans and provide the required procurement support for the entire
FASE.

31.      School Grants. The system for the distribution of the grants was established in
2003 through Education Sector Strategic Program Project (Cr. 3172) and has been
institutionalized. This mechanism includes the allocation formula, distribution model and
the reporting and monitoring system. The distribution of the project DSS funds used this
system and audits showed that the DSS funds were used appropriately.


5
 This has now changed. Whenever the Bank is the supervising entity the grants are processed per Trust Fund Bank
guidelines and PADs are prepared. Applications to the Partnership are made at project appraisal stage.


                                                         7
32.      Civil Works. The implementation of the civil works component of the FASE was
based on an accelerated construction program. The program was designed to be a
participatory decentralized program, with controlled costs 7 that was open to the
involvement of small local and large contractors, groups of craftsmen and local
communities. The implementation issues faced with this approach were: (i) poor
institutional capacity at the local level to manage the construction; (ii) low financial
ceilings for the works that discouraged larger contractors; (iii) lack of compliance with
contract conditions which slowed the process; and (iv)weak local government
involvement in the process. The positive impact of the rapid growth of teachers was
potentially somewhat constrained by the lack of accompanying growth in classrooms.
MEC is now making adjustments to the original methodology. It has increased the
financial ceilings, enhanced supervision at the central and provincial level, and improved
the tendering process. It is piloting a new construction methodology that proposes to use
large firms to construct the main building structure and then use local capacity to provide
the finished work. This is expected to improve the speed of implementation and overall
quality of construction.

33.     Textbooks. The Government agreed to the distribution of free textbooks for all
children to improve the quality of the classroom environment. In conjunction with
financial support to schools, FASE also provided 14,000,000 textbooks per year to
primary schools. This target was met each year for the last three years. This is a
substantial achievement. In a bid to improve quality of education, the primary education
curriculum was reviewed and a new one launched in 2004. This necessitated a review of
the instructional materials. By 2008, a national evaluation committee made up of key
stakeholders developed the national book procurement guidelines together with a list of
approved textbooks (for teachers and pupils). MEC also started the process of owning
intellectual property (IP) rights to several textbooks in 2007. A recent evaluation report
notes that the distribution chain was efficient and in general, books have arrived at the
schools on time. Planning is based on one textbook per subject per student ratio,8 using
the information gathered from schools during the annual statistics survey in March.
Based on textbook assessment recently conducted other challenges included lack of notes
from schools identifying what books they have received and proper book conservation
and utilization. To address this issue MEC developed a communications strategy
involving students, parents, and the community.

34.    Teacher Training. MEC experienced a substantial increase in teacher supply.
This was achieved by introducing a shortened pre-service teacher training
program/module in the teacher training colleges (10+1) which dramatically increased the
number of newly trained teachers into the system. Between 2008 and 2010, 28,000
teachers had been trained.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


7
    The original budget was at an average cost of US$10,000 per classroom, including furniture and housing for teachers.
8
    A lifespan of three years for 1 book is assumed, with the exception of 1st and 2nd grade student books.

                                                            8
35.     Design. The education performance framework (E-PAF) was developed in 2006
to monitor the progress of the FASE. These indicators were selected to cover all the
education sub-sectors. In some cases target goals were not realistic, particularly the
access targets. This led the team to include more realistic access goals in the ISR. The
Bank team selected four education sector core indicators to monitor in the ISRs. Two of
the indicators were derived from the EPAF: primary completion ratio and illiteracy rates.
Two additional indicators were also included: students enrolled in primary school and
students enrolled in secondary school. These two indicators although not EPAF indicators
were identified as key access indicators to measure PDO progress by the Bank team at
design stage. The ISR did not capture any equity indicators for primary or secondary.
Also it did not capture any quality indicators for secondary. The E-PAF did include one
equity indicator for primary (Net Enrolment Rate for girls). However it did not include
quality indicators for secondary, only access indicators.

36.     Implementation. The majority of the data collected to track the E-PAF and ISR
indicators comes from the Education Management Information System (EMIS). In 2004,
MEC EMIS was established and is being used regularly to collect data. In March of each
year school based data is collected and then sent to the provinces and headquarters. MEC
compiles the data and publishes a statistical yearbook for both school level and exam data.
Since 2007, there has been monitoring of the E-PAF indicators (Annex 8). Data is
collected on a regular basis by the provinces and provided to the central level. However,
some of the E-PAF indicators are not collected on a regular basis nor are they easily
measurable. In addition, some of the indicators do not have targets or baseline data. This
led to inadequate performance tracking. As a result, the government is now working with
UNESCO, amongst others, on refining the indicators and creating a more sophisticated
database of education statistics. This will provide MEC and provinces with better tools to
improve planning and monitoring as the system continues the process of decentralization.

37.     Utilization. The EMIS data was utilized for informing decision-making and
resource allocation related to the overall SWAp. It was used for the joint government and
DP sector meetings that reviewed the activity plan as well as for the annual donor review
meeting that reviewed the previous year’s implementation. During these sector meetings,
the Government and DPs identified areas where improvements were needed such as
construction, teacher training, and textbooks distribution. The data was also used to
calculate resource allocations for the school grants program. This calculation is based on
annual enrollment data collected at the school level, fed into the same EMIS system.

38.    Evaluation. The monitoring system has been successful in collecting the
fundamental data needed for planning purposes which is a considerable achievement for
the government. Looking forward it is recommended that the government begin
addressing issues of data quality. It is also recommended that the government begin to
consider implementation of learning assessments, impact evaluations and other studies
that can help measure cost-effectiveness and the impact of various interventions on
improving access, quality, and efficiency. These evaluations can guide whether an
intervention should be maintained and the financing scaled up or down as well as help the

                                            9
government understand how to make interventions more effective. Capacity building at
all levels will be required to rigorously evaluate the quality of learning interventions. The
government is moving in this direction. It benefits from a grant from the Russia
Education Aid for Development (READ) program and through this program it will
implement school-based assessment activities. The ministry initiated an independent
evaluation of the implementation of the SPEC 2006-2011. Its conclusions and
recommendations have fed into the process of elaborating the next strategic plan 2012-
2016.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.      The civil works program financed under the FASE and thus under the FTI grant,
regarding environmental issues was classified as Environmental Assessment Category B–
partial assessment. In 2006, MEC developed an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) that was used as an implementation tool to identify and mitigate any
potential environmental and social impacts related to planned and future construction
activities. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was also developed for the project.
To facilitate the understanding of the ESMF and RPF at the local level, the Bank,
working with the government developed a user friendly brochure that was provided to
community leaders and contractors involved in the construction of schools. Short courses
were also provided to help local community leaders understand the brochure content and
the importance of environmental management issues for schools.

40.     Financial Management: The overall performance of financial management is rated
satisfactory. Of the Original Grant of USD79 milllion, all funds were successfully
disbursed. The audits have been timely and without qualification. Reporting on key
programs such as the disbursement of school grants has been highly satisfactory and
allowed for timely decision making.

41.    Procurement. Overall procurement performance is rated moderately satisfactory.
Procurement at the central level was satisfactory, however at the decentralized level
procurement capacity and staffing remained weak.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.    The successful implementation of the FTI grant facilitated the Government of
Mozambique’s request to another grant from Education or All – Fast Track Initiative
Catalytic Fund. In November 2010, Mozambique was awarded a grant in the total US$90
million to ensure continued support to implementation of the education sector. Along
with the FTI-CF grant the International Development Associate (IDA) allocated US$71
million for the period 2011-2014. Due to the Bank’s successful management of the past
FTI-CF, the Bank was chosen by the DPs to remain the SE for the new FTI-CF grant.
Both IDA and FTI funds will continue to be channeled through the FASE. These
resources, coupled with other donor’s contribution, will ensure the continued
implementation of the government’s sector plan and reform agenda. The government will

                                             10
also use the Bank administered trust fund from the READ program to deepen the reforms
of the sector plan with a focus on quality of education in Mozambique.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

43.     Relevance of Objectives. The project development objectives remain highly
relevant given Mozambique’s development priorities: increasing access and reducing
geographical and gender disparities; improving the quality of education; and
strengthening the institutional capacity of the system at all levels. The program continues
to be relevant to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that focuses on the need
for human capital development ensuring that by 2015, boys and girls alike are in a
position to complete seven years of primary education, thereby contributing directly to
the Millennium Development Goals.

44.     Design and Implementation. The program effectively supported the
government’s education sector plan through a collective partnership approach. Following
a SWAp with a pooled funding financing modality the project supported the education
sector in a coordinated and harmonized fashion thereby reducing transactions costs for
the government, in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The focus on the
annual program of work allowed the project to be responsive to changing needs of the
Ministry.

45.     The 2006-2011 SPEC, which was the basis for FTI-CF support, is an ambitious
plan that focused on more efficient and effective use of funds in order to accelerate
progress towards meeting the MDGs. Overall weaknesses in institutional and human
capacity has contributed to delays in program implementation and, in some cases, less
progress that expected. All stakeholders (MEC, Government, NGOs) had been active in
the development of the sector plan however the preparation did not include a detailed
plan to address the disconnect between the reform agenda and the capacity/preparedness
of the overall sector at all levels to carry forward such an ambitious reform agendas.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives


46.     The FTI-CF grant contributed approximately 25 percent of the overall FASE and
the implementation of the SPEC over the three year (annual) implementation period and
therefore, direct attribution to the achievements to the FTI investments is not possible.
However, SPEC has been successful in improving access, equity and quality of education
in Mozambique as shown by the indicators in the E-PAF. These indicators have shown
progress toward improving the primary and secondary system; enrollments have
increased along with the girls’ participation rates, and completion rates have also
increased.

47.      The results of the ISR PDO indicators are as follows:

Access and Equity

                                                                                                   2010

48.     Evidence suggests that adequate infrastructure resources significantly decrease
dropout through their impact on pupil-teacher ratios, increased accessibility of schools to
students, and improved school environment (Duflo 2002, Woods and Mvalo 2007). The
annual number of classrooms constructed was 763 (2009). The total number of
classrooms completed during the two years was over 3,000. A number of these
classrooms had been initiated during the 2007 accelerated school construction campaign.
In addition, the number of complete schools increased from 950 in 2003 to 3,000 in 2010
representing 29 percent of the total number of public schools compared to 12 percent in
2003.9

49.     Even when there is sufficient infrastructure disadvantaged children face various
barriers to education opportunities. Relatively small in-kind transfers have positive
effects on school retention (Baird, McIntosh, and Ozler 2009, Fiszbein and Shady 2009).
The direct support to schools program which provides school supplies for children and
teaching aids for the teachers have also been linked to improving access and equity.
These grants have reduced financial barriers to enrollment by ensuring that all students
and teachers have the necessary supplies in the classroom. Methods for monitoring and
tracking resources have been updated yearly over the course of the project.

50.     The ISR and E-PAF indicators (enrollment) show a system that has been
expanding rapidly. During the FTI project implementation period (2008-10), the number
of primary school students increased from 4,100,000 to 4,986,338 exceeding the original
project target by more than one million students. In secondary school the target was not
met however the increase of over 60,000 secondary students is notable. This shows a



9
 Complete primary schools are those schools offering EP1 and EP2 grades. Studies have suggested that pupils who are
enrolled in a school that are not complete are likely to drop out before completion.


                                                        12
considerable increase during the two years of project implementation. Additional
statistics related to the overall E-PAF show that the enrollment rate of children between
the 6-12 years old in 2010 is estimated at 95 percent compared to 88 percent in 2007. The
number of participants in adult education increased from 674,934 (62 percent women) in
2007 to 680,455 in 2010 (64 percent women).

51.      Equity. The female participation rate in primary school increased from 46.4
(2007) percent in primary school to 47.3 (2010) percent and in secondary school it
increased from approximately 40 percent to approximately 45 percent. An analysis, per
district, of the percentage of girls of the total number of students attending primary
school, shows that, in 2004, there were 22 districts with a percentage of girls less than 40
percent and, in 2010, only one district had a percentage of girls of less than 40 percent.

52.     The FTI funds were also used to support access to second chance of obtaining
primary education skills through buying the equipment needed for the implementation of
literacy programs and support the regional training centers for adult education. However
the variations of results from region to region and between different age groups and
gender made it difficult to reach all populations. As a result the Government turned to the
use of Radio literacy programs, such and “Alfa rádio, Alfa funcional, Alfalit, Família Sem
Alfabetismo, Reflect e Alfa? which were used as a medium of instruction in the local
languages. This contributed to the improvement in literacy of rural and less advantaged
population.

Quality

* represents EPAF indicator.


53.     The pupil:teacher ratio has improved considerably from approximately 72:1 in
2008 to 66:1 in 2010. The Ministry also adopted a policy of allocating new teachers to
provinces with higher pupil: teacher ratios (PTR) which has led to a reduction in the
disparities between regions. To ensure that the rapid expansion of teachers led to
improved quality of education strides have been taken to ensure that the new teachers
translated to improved quality of learning including (i) improved in-service teacher
training and teachers’ support systems; (ii) zoning of schools into district
directorates/clusters (of about 20 and 25 schools); and (iii) assigning them to school
based District Directors to ease administrative and pedagogical supervision with
supervision funds being provided through the teacher training institutions.


                                            13
54.    To further ensure quality improvement at the school level key education reforms
were introduced. This included the introduction of a new curriculum; teacher training and
school management training; learning material for all students; and an increase in
pedagogical supervision activities.

55.     During the FTI project implementation period the primary completion rate
improved from 38.0 percent to 50.8 percent and this improvement was in all provinces.
As has been the case with the other indicators, the completion rate of girls has also
increased from 36.1 percent in 2008 to 45.8 percent in 2010. The increase in completion
rate (measures in terms of children that complete 7th grade over the total population of 12
year olds) improved as a result of a decrease in repetition and an increase in children
attending school.

3.3 Efficiency

56.     Textbooks Distribution. The ongoing textbook reforms include the acquisition of
the right to reprint. This, coupled with the introduction of the Bank requirement for
international competitive bidding, has led to significant cost reductions in textbooks. To
further explore avenues to reduce costs, the sector piloted the public (national) bidding
for book distribution in one province. With increased supervision in the distribution of
textbooks, the illegal sale and distribution of books has been reduced.

57.     Resources to the School Level. School grants played an important role in
ensuring that resources in the education sector were channeled to the school level for
financing activities such as: (i) supporting vulnerable children; (ii) deploying of female
teachers to the districts and school; (iii) training schools managers; and (iv) providing
vulnerable children with basic school materials. Such educational inputs and education
policies increase the probability of staying in school or completing a given level of
schooling for learners. Although we do not have exact data on the returns to education, it
is clear that an additional year of education has important long-term labor implications
for students.

58.     Teacher costs. Decreasing the number of years for pre-service teacher training
has decreased the initial cost for hiring teachers yet the substantial increase in the number
of teachers in the system has added considerable cost to the wage budget.

59.     Teacher Allocation. Historically teacher allocation across provinces is quite
uneven, with deployment highly skewed toward urban zones. MEC’s policy of
distribution of teachers to provinces with high PTRs has resulted in a decrease in the gap
between PTR by province. In 2006, the difference in PTR from the highest province
Zambezi 105.4:1 to lowest Maputo Province 55.6:1 decreased to a PTR of 82:1 in the
Zambezi and 48:1 in Inhambane in 2010

60.     Construction. Unit costs for classroom construction were capped at US$10,000
per classroom under the FASE. Progress in construction was hence affected by inability
of districts to attract quality firms in these areas. The response of quality contractors to

                                             14
small-scale school based contracts especially in remote areas within the established unit
cost was over-estimated. Similarly, the decentralization of construction to the provincial
and district levels was affected by weak operational capacity at these levels. This
unrealistically low unit cost coupled with weak oversight capacity led to poor quality
infrastructure in some provinces The anticipated gains in pupil-classroom ratios have thus
not been realized. Due to these problems, MEC introduced a new plan for infrastructure
development in 2010 that included removing the ceiling for the cost per classroom to
allow for the real cost of construction.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

61.    The overall outcome rating is Satisfactory. Despite the fact that the project did
not identify which of the 22 indicators covering the full education sector the project
would be responsible for, both the ISR and E-PAF indicators measure substantial
progress towards the PDO. In addition although the E-PAF indicators for access (net
enrollment rate at age 6 years old) were not met the team at the design stage agreed that
they was not a realistic targets therefore chose to track actual enrollment numbers in the
ISR.

62.     The satisfactory rating takes into account that there have been substantial
improvements in access and quality of education through the dramatic increase in key
education inputs. The critical inputs that influence long term education outcomes include
the increase in number of teachers, pedagogic materials, and management capacity. These
coupled with moderate satisfactory improvement in classroom infrastructure ensured this
project made important strides in improvement access, equality and quality of education
in Mozambique. The criteria of relevance, implementation, and efficiency were for the
most part met.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63.    As noted above, satisfactory progress was made towards gender equity

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64.     The need to strengthen institutional capacity is well articulated in the Strategic
Plan for Education and Culture (SPEC) with greater focus on supporting MEC and the
decentralized management systems at the provincial and district levels. This process was
initiated in 2003. However support from the FTI grant allowed the sector to strengthen
reforms initiated in the areas of: fiduciary management, decentralization, provision of
textbooks and learning, materials, increased level of budget allocation to successful


                                           15
programs such as school grants, and also reinforced activities dedicated to institutional
capacity development for improved service delivery.

65.     The Ministry have also undertaken provincial and district level workshops on use
of fiduciary norms in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance. Sensitization
meetings for other stakeholders have also been held. Consequently, improvements have
been registered in the quality of operational documents submitted by MEC to the Bank
resulting in shorter periods within which clearances are provided. Central level
supervision of provincial units is also regularly undertaken to ensure compliance. Overall
improvements in contracts management at the district levels are yet to be realized.

66.     Strengthening of the financial systems was also required to enable effective
national roll out of the DSS program. Technical assistance was provided in this area and
the annual audit reports inform MEC management and development partners on the
specific areas that need improvement. To date, a consolidated report is generated every
quarter including information from the 128 districts and 11 provincial states. A financial
system that enables computation and disbursement of grants to all the 13,434 primary
schools also exists.

67.    Six specialists were recruited to strengthen provincial capacity in the area of
school construction, and procurement guidelines developed and distributed to all
operational levels. Provincial and district level personnel working in the engineering
departments have been trained and provided with logistical support to enable school level
monitoring. Personnel gaps still exist at these levels to sufficiently address school level
supervision needs, which have contributed to poor contract management and supervision.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

68.    Improved institutional capacity of the Ministry, gained through the
implementation of the FASE, is key to ensuring effective and sustainable future
implementation. The multi-level approach where planning, fiduciary management, and
monitoring and evaluation functions were strengthened at all levels of the Ministry will
support efficient implementation of the program in the future.

69.    The ability to continue to expand the outreach of the program is not fully known
since most of the donors contributing to FASE can only commit to the short term (two-
year year timeframe). Netherlands and DANIDA out of 10 donors will stop disbursing in
2011 and 2012 respectively, however two additional donors (Italy and Flanders
Cooperation) will join the FASE thus continued implementation of key SPEC
components appear promising.

70.    While the overall education budget represents approximately US$600 million
annually in Mozambique, FASE contributed about US$120 million per year over the
period 2008-2010. The FTI-CF contribution represented about 25 percent of the FASE

                                            16
pool of funds during this period (i.e., approximately US$26 million per year). With this
new project over the period 2011-2015, the joint FTI and IDA contributions represent a
larger share of the FASE pool of funds, thus compensating for the potential negative
trend of reduced external funding previously mentioned, ensuring a FASE budget around
130-140 million USD per year through which the continuation of existing programs has
been guaranteed. Maintenance of school structures and furniture, school grants, as well as
supplying textbooks will be supported by the new FTI and IDA funds. Supporting
Teacher development will also be an important part of the new program.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.     The FTI-CF award to Mozambique was based on the SPEC. The WB, together
with other partners, was actively involved in the preparation and endorsement of the
SPEC, though not contributing through the pool fund FASE.10 In order to facilitate the
channeling of the FTI funds through FASE, the Bank quickly prepared a PD based on the
SPEC as was required by the WB. The PD did not include a results chain for the project
to allow for the Bank team to measure indicators for which the project is responsible. For
purposes of measuring access the team chose to monitor enrollment in primary and
secondary rather than NER at ages 6 which are measured in the E-PAF. This is an
indication that the team was aware that target goals in the E-PAF were not realistic.
However since the E-PAF was the results framework that was attached to the PD, it
should have been reviewed more carefully ensuring that the indicators were measurable
and targets realistic.

72.     Implementation of the reforms proposed in the SPEC has been very much
learning by doing. The short period of time needed to prepare the PD time did not allow
for a detailed review and incorporation of lessons learned in the development of the PD.
For example, the problems in the decentralized infrastructure modality were visible
during project preparation. The pilot for this modality was launched in 2005 based on
studies of infrastructure programs in Madagascar and Senegal. It became apparent early
in implementation that the targets for this new modality were very ambitious, especially
in terms of expected community/local oversight of infrastructure. At a time when the
education staffs in the provinces were being stretched to implement the SPEC, it was
difficult to expect them to also have the capacity or time to manage/oversee local
construction.



10

Rating: Satisfactory

73.    The Bank’s performance during implementation of the project was satisfactory.
The task team regularly alerted Government about issues identified during project
execution and facilitated prompt action to resolve these issues. The Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of
achievement of development objectives and project implementation.

74.     For construction, the Bank provided technical assistance to the unit responsible
for school construction (DIPLAC) through hiring of an architect. The consultant
supported MEC in the review of construction norms with a bid to introduce low
construction norms for efficiency and sustainable expansion. This enabled MEC to
identify strategies and develop an action plan to address the administrative and
managerial bottlenecks at the provincial and district levels that had been identified in the
construction audit report. The WB consultant has initiated in 2010 the design of a
maintenance manual. Plans to develop a construction tracking system across the country
with sub-national level access are underway to ease progress monitoring. Despite the
slow progress registered in classroom construction, systemic improvements have been
made especially in the establishment of supervision structures.

75.     The Bank’s fiduciary team worked closely with the Government to explain Bank
guidelines and procedures as well as to support capacity building. In regard to
procurement, as part of Bank supported supervision technical assistance was provided to
the procurement team which has contributed to developments in this area including the
development of: (i) the education sector procurement framework and cycle; (ii) a MEC
procurement plan which is updated annually; (iii) support materials to the procurement
teams at various levels including procurement manuals with clear roles and
responsibilities of key actors; (iv) and procurement monitoring tools; and (v) a
procurement tracking system. This resulted from a common understanding of the need to
improve procurement planning and implementation, which was mainly guided by the use
of the country procurement regulation but also the integration of a procurement annex
consistent with the World Bank norms. Bank support to fiduciary aspects greatly
contributed to the acceleration and prioritization of these institutional reforms. Skills
development for procurement staff has been undertaken at central level through courses
offered by the WB in close collaboration with MEC fiduciary team and the Ministry of
Finance.

5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

77.    The Government of Mozambique through MEC is commended in a number of
aspects including:

           Putting together a detailed sector program which is discussed and endorsed by the
            22 development partners. This reflects very strong Government ownership of the
            program; while the pooled fund modality is indicative of development partners’
            alignment to government programs and established systems.11
           Having an established and agreed performance assessment framework that allows
            monitoring of progress based on an agreed set of indicators. Indicators and targets
            are discussed with government and a comprehensive assessment of progress is
            made at the joint sector review meetings that are held mid-year and end-year.
           Implementation of actions to improve fiduciary management of the Ministry and
            prioritization of capacity development efforts to support the effective roll out of
            the procurement and financial management reforms.
           Personnel and skill requirements are well articulated by management at all levels
            which is a good basis for a solid capacity development plan. Ongoing programs
            like the Public Sector Reform Program have also played a big role in
            strengthening capacity at the lower levels most especially the filling of established
            positions to a reasonable degree. MEC also provides inspection funds to provinces
            and districts to enable regular inspection of schools although personnel gaps still
            prohibit effective execution of the inspection function at these levels.
           Effectively implementing commitments to the provision of textbooks, which is
            still a challenge in a number of African countries, has been successfully
            implemented. Enactment of supportive legislation in this area is also commended.

78.    A substantive amount of FASE funds are channeled through the Provincial
Directorates of Education and Culture (DPECs) and District Education Youth and
Technology Services (SDEJTs). Nevertheless, the decentralized reform is still in its
infancy and sub national structures are still inadequately resourced to support some
reforms. For example, one engineer is not sufficient to supervise school level
construction. In addition, personnel gaps still prevail at the provincial levels in the
procurement units which makes school level contracts management difficult especially
for remote places, with the skills development programs that have been provided
notwithstanding.

     Of the 22 Development Partners 12 are FASE donors but all are aligned the SPEC and the MOU.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

79.    Rating: Based on the Government’s performance during the preparation and
supervision as discussed above, the overall Borrower Performance is Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

     Government commitment at the highest level is critical to successful
      implementation of key education reforms. For example, dramatically increasing
      the number of teachers in the civil service could have only been accomplished by
      the government’s budget and political commitment to this expansion.
     Collective action, as is the case with the Joint Funding modality that supports the
      FASE, has potential to improve partner coordination not only for funding but
      provision of technical assistance to the government.
     Private sector/Community capacity to participate in government programs is not
      always predictable especially for remote areas.
     Implementation of programs with decentralized structures calls for capacity
      development across all institutional levels.
     There is significant demand for fiduciary support for sector-wide operations.
      Since the majority of activities take place at the provincial and district levels there
      is need to ensure the proper capacity for fiduciary management at those levels.
     Schools are able to plan and manage funds for effective learning at the school
      level. This has led MEC to allow more flexibility in fund usage. This, in addition
      to additional training, has strengthened the school councils. MEC would now like
      to further the reach of these school grants as a social protection mechanism.
     Regular meetings with stakeholders to review key monitoring indicators help in
      identifying key constraints in the system, prioritization of those constraints and
      interventions to address them.
     Increase in teacher supply should be accompanied by a detailed and
      implementable plan on continuous teacher education to ensure the increase in
      teachers lead to an improvement in education outcomes.
     A results framework linking components to measurable baseline and target
      indicators should be prepared in advance of program implementation to be able to
      properly track program progress.
     Evaluations should be put in place during implementation to allow evidence based
      decision making about scaling up various alternative interventions. This was not
      done in this program however it is planned in the next education project.
     Project Documents, even when using a SWAp, should specify components,
      implementation arrangements and an action plan. This document aligned with the
      sector plan would support the operationalization of the sector plans. A detailed
      PD would allow enhance accountability for delivery of components on both the
      Bank and the Government.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors



                                            20
(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

80.     Teacher training: There is concurrence on the short-term benefits of the 10+1
teacher training program in regard to the provision of qualified teachers in schools in a
cost effective manner. The interim reform in the teacher training program was supposed
to be anchored on a strong in-service teacher training system that would strengthen
teacher capacities to deliver on the curriculum follow up to the 1-year teacher training.
Most discussants believe that the anticipated in-service teacher training program is not
yet developed and the institutional delivery system will take time to deliver quality in-
service training programs. An assessment of the impact of the interim teacher training
program on teacher performance and skills is hereby recommended.

81.     School level management: Strengthening school level capacity is one of the
identified strategies by Government and development partners that need stronger support.
In order to implement decentralized management reforms. Areas identified include
support to schools in the development of school plans, budgeting and financial reporting.

(b) Cofinanciers/Donors

82.     Data issues: The monitoring framework of the SPEC (indicators and targets) was
based on the projections of the 1997 census which was undertaken soon after
independence. At the time the country had just come out of civil strife and was
characterized by under-reporting. The reliability of projections used was therefore
questionable. On a positive note, the 2007 Census was undertaken and MoE expects to
access single year age data to enable realistic education planning.

83.    National assessment system: The need for the establishment of a national
assessment system that enables regular monitoring of learning achievement was raised.
Results generated from this system could inform the design of strategies aimed at
improving teaching-learning processes, teacher training and program and strategy designs.

IDA and the FTI did not require the task team to prepare a PAD as part of the process of
acquiring funds. The project document that was prepared outlined the nine main areas of
the SPEC. The FTI funds were allocated to support activities in the SPEC that would
contribute to the MDGs. These activities include classroom construction, teacher training,
school grants, the provision of teaching and learning material, and adult literacy
programs. These activities are in line with Components 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7. The following

86.    The Government of Mozambique recognized the role of an educated population
as a necessary enabling environment for sustainable development. For the FTI-CF the
funds for primary education focused mainly on equipping students with basic knowledge

                                                               29
and skills to enable them to function as competent and productive citizens; at secondary
education the focus was on providing academic basis for gainful employment in the
informal, private and public sectors.

87.     A rigorous cost-benefit analysis of this program is not feasible. While it can be
straightforward to obtain estimates for private economic returns to education, credible
estimates of the social economic returns, which are necessary for public investment
analysis, are elusive. It is also very difficult to quantify positive non-monetary
externalities from education. Furthermore, the expected outcomes from education
projects are long term and are difficult to attribute to a specific intervention.
Nevertheless, based on the international evidence and the micro empirical evidence for
Mozambique, the potential benefits of this program can be expected at both the individual
and the social level.

88.     The underlying rational for public invest in education is the high social
economic and non-economic rates of return to education, in addition to the credit
market imperfections that preclude the poor from reaping the private returns to
education. Returns to education can be private returns which are benefits that accrue to
the individual himself after taking into account the private costs, or social returns which
occur when private benefits externalize to benefit the society as a whole, net of the social
costs. Moreover, these returns can be economic or non-economic. On the micro level
economic returns to education take the form of productivity enhancements leading to
higher earnings, and higher growth rates on the macro horizon. Non-economic returns are
manifested in the form of healthier lifestyle, more informed decision-making and
personal development, and can extend to social cohesion, civic engagement and
democratic participation. From a pubic economics rational, the significant positive
externalities from education justify government investment in the sector. However, even
if the magnitude of the economic private returns surpass the economic social returns, the
presence of noneconomic externalities to education coupled with credit market
constraints that result in individuals under investing in education, present an economic
rationale for some significant degree of public investment.

89.     The Theory of Human Capital (THC), supported by the empirical evidence,
suggests substantial economic private returns to education. The THC is currently
widely accepted as the micro-based premise for interpreting the education-earnings
relationship. The theory argues that education enhances individual worker productivity
which translates to higher earnings. There is ample robust empirical micro-evidence
supporting the THC (Card 1999). More selective research focusing on the causality
debate between the impact of schooling versus ability on earnings concludes that the
effect of ability does not exceed 10 percent of the estimated schooling return (Card
2001).

90.    The macro empirical evidence on the positive impact of education on
productivity and ultimately economic growth is less assertive in comparison to the
micro evidence. In recent years there have been attempts to verify and measure the
existence of positive externalities from education in the macroeconomic context of new

                                            30
theories of endogenous growth that suggest that increasing individual productivity, by
boosting human capital, would contribute to economic growth. Though the macro
empirical literature is inconclusive on this relationship (Islam 1995, Caselli et al 1996,
Temple 1999), some evidence on the positive impact of education on growth was found
when the assumption of the linearity relationship between education and growth was
dropped (Krueger & Lindahn 2001) and when the impact of education on growth was
considered with a time lag.

91.    However, the macro empirical evidence on the positive impact of education
on economic growth through the channel of reducing poverty and income inequality
is more robust. An alternative channel by which education can boost economic growth is
by reducing income inequality. The strong micro link between education and earnings
gives credence to the notion that education can play a role in reducing poverty,
decreasing inequality and ultimately boosting economic growth. (Persson & Tabellini
1994, Alesina & Rodrik 1994, Knight and Sabot 1990).

92.     Private and social Rates of Return (ROR) to education in Mozambique are
high. Both the social and private ROR to education in Mozambique show that investment
in education is an urgent necessity if the benefits in health, productivity and consumption
are to be improved and would be a basis for further social and economic development.
Mozambique’s high ROR in post-basic education may reflect the scare supply of
educated labor and the fact that education is still a rare privilege in Mozambique for
which the labor market is prepared to pay a high premium, compared to its costs.

93.     Studies in Mozambique show a positive correlation between the level of
education of the household head and both income and expenditure, and a negative
correlation with poverty. Among household heads, education is strongly correlated with
higher per adult equivalent consumption. Reflecting the relative scarcity of secondary and
post-secondary education, the returns to education rises with each additional educational
level completed. But the impact of education in urban areas is higher than in rural areas
for all levels of education (and especially for post-lower-secondary education). Results
from regressing household log per capita expenditure on education confirm literature
findings of a positive impact of education on well-being. For instance, having some lower
primary education is associated with a 18 percent increase in per capita consumption,
increasing to 35 percent for household heads who have completed upper primary
education, and to 99 percent and steadily upward, when secondary education and beyond
has been acquired. This analysis supports the Government´s focus on a holistic and
sustained development of the overall sector while continuing to prioritize primary
education since the largest share of the population is active at sustenance level.

94.     Notably, besides increasing the quantity of one’s education as previously
discussed, improving the quality of education also plays a significant role. In addition
to the commonly measured quantity of education impact on earnings, as captured by the
years of schooling or educational levels attained, the quality of education plays a
significant role on earnings. This is proven on the micro level (Glewwe 1996 & 2002,
Bedi & Edwards 2002). On the macro level, education was found to have a positive

                                            31
impact on growth when it was measured in terms of quality as opposed to quantity
(Hanushek & Kimko 2000). Common ways to improve the quality of education has to do
with the curriculum development, improving teacher qualifications, having adequate PTR
and acceptable classroom conditions (Hanushek & Luque 2003). The evidence for
Mozambique indicates that lower PTR, higher teacher qualifications, the availability of
textbooks are all positively and significantly correlated to higher test scores which reflect
the better educational quality.

95.      Furthermore, the robust evidence for the existence of considerable private
and social noneconomic returns to education, such as improved health and
education continuity within the households, are main arguments for public
investment in the sector, particularly for primary education. The benefits from
education go beyond individual economic benefits. Education leads to more informed
decisions regarding ones’ own and household health and hygiene and with respect
fertility control (Gupta & Mahy 2003, Glewwe 1999). Furthermore, there are positive
externalities of parents schooling on their children’s education (Glewwe & Jacoby 1994,
Tansel 1997). Notably health benefits are sometimes cited among the non-economic
arguments for public investment in education, nevertheless they can also be considered
under the economic debate given that a significant segment of human capital
development is related to investment in health care which results in a more productive
labor force (Strauss & Thomas 1998).
