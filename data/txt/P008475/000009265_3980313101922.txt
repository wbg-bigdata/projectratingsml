HUNGARY
THIRD INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT - LOAN 3020-HU
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Industrial
Restructuring Project in Hungary, for which a loan in the amount of US$140 million equivalent
was approved on February 7, 1989 and made effective on May 5, 1989. US$82.7 million was
disbursed and US$57.3 million was canceled. The Loan was closed on June 30, 1997.
The ICR was prepared by Hiran Herat, Senior Financial Analyst, Hungary Resident
Mission, of the ECA Region and reviewed by Roger Grawe (Country Director - ECC07) and
Hennie van Greuning (Program Team Leader - ECSPF). The Borrower provided comments that
are included as appendixes to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission, March 27, 1997. It is based on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to
preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and
commenting on the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TBIIRD INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Loan 3020-HU
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
(i)          Since lending to Hungary began in 1983, the Bank's strategy of assistance has focused on
supporting the country's program of structural adjustment to make the economy more efficient, flexible,
market responsive and competitive in external markets.  The Bank has been heavily involved in the
enterprise sector and has provided assistance in formulating a medium-term sector strategy as well as
support through nine lending operations. This includes four lending operations which are relevant to this
Loan: the First and Second Industrial Restructuring Projects, which closed in June and September 1993,
respectively; the Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan (ISAL), which closed in June 1991, and the Enterprise
Reform Loan (ERL) which closed in June 1992.
Project Objectives
(ii)          The objective was to support the restructuring of the industrial sector in order to enhance
its international competitiveness. To achieve this, the project aimed to: (a) redirect the product/market
mix of the sector to competitive areas suitable for convertible currency exports; (b) improve enterprise
management practices and capabilities; (c) stimulate the establishment and growth of small business
firms, including the private sector; (d) alleviate the adverse employment impact of industrial
restructuring; and (v) strengthen institutional capabilities in support of industrial restructuring.
Achievement of Objectives
(iii)        Most of the project objectives with respect to the line of credit components as originally
envisaged were not met (para 13), the exceptions being the small business development component.
However, with respect to the technical assistance components the success rate was much better. These
components were well defined and had the ownership of the respective agencies. The creation of the
labor development and training center at Miskolc in Northern Hungary was very successful, leading to a
follow-up operation and replication of several similar models throughout the country. Data from the
studies carried out by the State Property Agency and Ministry of Industry were used for various
programs within the respective agencies. Approximately US$83 million from the original loan amount
of US$140 million was disbursed.
(iv)         The main objectives of the project were conceived for a different economic and business
environment, and when this environment changed, most of the objectives became obsolete or were not
possible to achieve in the prevailing environment. The project supported restructuring in a period when
Hungary was experiencing a deep recession with large fiscal and current account deficits. Several
internal and external factors had a strong influence on Hungary's growth performance (para 9) over most
of the life of this project (1990-1995). Exogenous shocks were, in part, responsible for the decline in
output in Hungary. Economic activity was severely affected by the collapse of the CMEA, by major
droughts in 1992-93 which affected agriculture output and by the UN sanctions on Yugoslavia which had



ii
a major impact on transport and other sectors. At the institutional level, banks were primarily concerned
with restructuring their existing portfolios rather than extending new loans, and in a drastically changing
environment characterized by uncertainties associated with new export rnarkets, privatization of state
enterprises, and new legislation in general, banks preferred to "invest" in high-yielding, low risk
Government bonds, rather than seek out creditworthy clients (para 10).
(v)          The Bank, in consultation with the Hungarian Authorities, amended the Loan Agreement
twice (in 1991 and 1993) to facilitate the on-lending of funds in areas where some of the objectives could
be achieved in the prevailing business environment, and also canceled a part of the Loan for which there
was no perceived demand. These amendments enabled additional funding to be channeled to assist small
and medium enterprises, with 985 sub-loans being made for business development, working capital and
investment financing.
Sustainability
(vi)         The main objective of this project, after it was restructured, was to provide a line of
credit for investment and working capital purposes to help develop small and medium enterprises in all
sectors. To sustain the growth of the enterprise sector, a proper macroeconomic framework needs to be
in place, supported by efficient financial intermediaries (e.g. commercial banks) who are receptive to the
needs of this sector. The latter has been established to a large degree under the project and has also been
supported by the Bank's Enterprise Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL approved in 1997). With
respect to the macro framework, the authorities are moving in the right direction. The Government's
March 1995 stabilization package, aimed at forestalling a pending crisis by reducing maroeconomic
disequilibrium and prepared the stage for more fundamental reforms. Recognizing the major problems
faced by the banks and their negative impact on a sustainable recovery, the Government initiated a
program of enterprise and banking reform, supported by the EFSAL (para 16). Sustaining these reforms
will strengthen both the banking and enterprise sectors and in tum will help to maintain the progress
made under this project.
Bank and Borrower Performance
(vii)        The Bank's performance in all aspects of the project cycle was satisfactory. There were
no significant deviations in Bank policies or procedures in project implementation, and project supervision
was adequate. The Bank team was well rounded with the participation of several specialists in areas of
enterprise restructuring (para 17).  The overall performance of the Borrower and the concerned
government agencies was satisfactory in all phases of the project cycle, as was compliance with all main
loan covenants. The cooperation and exchange of information between the Bank, NBH, and MOI was
excellent. The NBH worked closely with the Bank to modify the Legal Agreement to suit the needs of the
prevailing business environment, and to cancel part of the Loan based on the perceived demand of the
participating commercial banks. Most of these issues were addressed through the frequent dialogue that
the Bank had with its counterparts.
Assessment of Outcome
(viii)       The credit line components as originally envisaged, especially the component for exports
to convertible currency markets and the component for employment creation did not materialize. The
exception was the credit line for the development of small and medium enterprises, where the original
allocation of $10 million was disbursed quite rapidly. However, the amendments made to the Loan
Agreement in 1993 (to further assist the small and medium enterprise sectors) had a major impact on the
credit line components. As a result of these amendments, disbursements increased substantially between



iii
1993-96. In total, 985 sub-loans were approved with industry and agro-processing accounting for about
85% of the subloans, followed by the service and tourism sectors (para 20).
(ix)         Assessment of the sub-projects were done on a sample basis (para 21). Based on this
assessment and combined with general information on the enterprises, the sample group was divided into
six groups: outstanding, successful, moderately successful, poor, failure and non- responsive (para 22).
The results are shown in Table 6 (C). The results show that nearly 69 percent of the sampled enterprises
were successful with their sub-projects. If the non-responsive enterprises were altogether left out of the
calculations, the success rate of sampled sub-projects would increase to 82 percent. The overall
experience with cash flow analyses shows that the enterprises cash flow situation improved after the
investment financed from the project, and in some cases dramatically. Only about 18 percent of the
projects were involved in the establishment of new facilities or products, while the remaining 72 percent
were engaged in expansion, upgrading or improvement of existing products, capacity or services (para
23). Based on the sample analysis and overall loan performance, it can be concluded that where sub-
projects tended to fail or do poorly, in most cases they were associated with loans below US$50,000, and
on-lent to single entrepreneurs or relatively small enterprises. In most of these instances, the failure was
due to a lack of business and or marketing experience.
(x)          The performance of the participating banks in the implementation of the credit line
component was mixed. With the exception of a few banks, most banks did not vigorously promote the
availability of the Bank credit line. However, based on the analyses of the sample sub-projects, one
could conclude that in most cases, the participating commercial banks business practices were prudent,
and most of the projects were justified and well prepared. The majority of failed enterprises or
enterprises declaring bankruptcy, tended to be small entrepreneurs, causing only minor losses to the
participating banks. In fairness to the banks, it must be noted that during the life of the loan, most of the
participating commercial banks went through tremendous changes, including privatization of most and
with high tumover of staff, resulting in a lack of continuity of counterparts at all levels. Despite these
problems, the collection ratios of the banks were around 87 percent.
(xi)         The technical assistance components had a much better success rate. The employment
services and retraining component was by far the most successful (para 25). This technical assistance
component supported the Government to develop an integrated set of employment and retraining
services to assist those who were experiencing temporary or long term difficulties in obtaining
employment, due to industrial restructuring or lack of development in certain areas (i.e. backward
regions). Apart from establishing a re-training center, several studies conducted under this component
laid the ground work for a follow-up project (Human Resources Development Project, which was
approved in 1991).
(xii)        An engineering sub-sector study was carried out to assess the performance,
competitiveness, future prospects and development of priority areas (para 26). The MOI prepared a
proposal to implement recommendations made under the study that were not already addressed under the
overall reforms that were taking place. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) coordinated the preparation
of the small business sector study which was conducted by Hungarian experts. Based on the study, CSO
developed a small business data base and software for data analysis and conducts regular surveys for data
gathering. The Restructuring Programs Office (RPO), established in the Ministry of Industry to assist
counterparts and enterprises in financial analyses, procurement, disbursement and project management
was subsequently privatized, and today is a very successful consulting company. A detailed study for the
regional development of the Borsod region was completed and its recommendations adopted by the
Government. Recommendation included, inter alia, the adoption of an integrated approach to regional
development, including the establishment of a Regional Development Agency (para 25).



iv
Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
(xiii)       The Bank's program of support has the broad objective of helping Hungary maintain
macroeconomic stability and accelerate growth to facilitate EU accession by focusing on a strategy of
growth that will be accomplished by continuing to downsize the state sector; strengthening and
privatizing Hungary's financial and enterprise sectors; reforming social policies and strengthening the
human resource base; improving environmental management; and attracting FDI and know-how,
especially in the infrastructure sectors.
(xiv)        Some of the lessons from this experience are as follows:
(a)    The rapidly changing political, social and economic environment in Hungary had a
decisive impact on project performance, both positive and negative. While it was hardly
possible to anticipate the dramatic changes, reaction to changing situations could have been
swifter. Given the evolving nature of the reform process, several years of experience with Bank
financed activities, plus availability of additional sources of extemal finance, it may have been
opportune for the Bank and the Hungarian authorities to have reviewed the overall strategy for
and comparative advantages of Bank assistance much earlier in the project life. This assertion is
not intended to imply that all was wrong and needed to be changed, but rather that, in light of all
the changes that took place, a fresh look may have optimized the benefits of Bank assistance.
(b)    Provided the country strategy calls for continuation of intermediation of Bank funds
through commercial banks, the Bank should be prepared to look again at the rationale and
structure of such lending arrangements, including the apex concept. The apex structure used in
this credit line operation was necessary at the beginning and has proved useful. However, other
lending instruments need to be considered. All design parameters of such transactions, including
interest rates, opening up general lines versus segmentation, types of goods and services covered
(leasing, used goods, land and buildings), financing a fixed share of subloans rather than
disbursement against goods and services for each subproject, small and medium and long-term
lending, linkages to subsidy schemes, single currency loans, passing of foreign exchange risk to
sub-borrowers, direct lending to selected banks, guarantees, time frame for commitment and
cofinancing should be considered.
(c)   The project design included too many components and eligibility criteria (for credit
lines), that made project monitoring and implementation difficult under the prevailing political,
social and economic conditions (para 30, iii). Implementation became much smoother, once the
Loan Agreement was amended and procedures were made simpler.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HUNGARY
Third Industrial Restructuring Project
Loan 3020-HIU
PART 1. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Statement of Objectives
1.           Background. At the time the project was conceived, industry was the leading sector in
the Hungarian economy, representing about one third of GDP, employment and investment, and 85% of
exports. Sector growth, productivity and exports to convertible currency markets stagnated in the first
half of the 1980s, while its structure, dominated by large vertically-integrated enterprises, did not
sufficiently shift to activities with competitive advantage. Most dynamism was demonstrated by the
small business sector which grew rapidly from a small base in the early 1980s. Constraints to better
performance included: restricted domestic and international competition, limited resource mobility, and
lack of financial discipline and autonomy of enterprises. To address these issues the Government in
1985 engaged in a medium -term program of industrial restructuring, developed jointly with the Bank,
including comprehensive policy reforms and support for specific restructuring investments. To
strengthen economic performance and accelerate the policy reforms, the Government adopted in 1987 a
medium-term economic stabilization and structural reform program supported in 1988 by an IMF
Standby Arrangement, and a Bank-financed Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan (ISAL). Small business
development was being encouraged through broadening of the private sector, and rationalization of the
tax and association framework. Parliament approved a law of economic associations and transformation,
and a unified company profit tax law which become effective on January 1, 1989. The Government also
initiated measures to address emerging unemployment due to restructuring, including support for
productive new job creation activities, and development of employment and retraining services.
2.           Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project contained two novel features in the Bank's
assistance program for Hungary at that time in line with the country's drive for reform. These were: (i)
support for small business and entrepreneurial development, including the private sector; and (ii)
development of measures for efficient employment creation and new employment services as a means of
alleviating the social costs of restructuring. It was believed at that time that support in these areas would
help accelerate the restructuring program. The Bank played an important role in the analysis of issues
related to the small business sector and designed an appropriate small business credit component for the
project. Further, the Bank's review of the Government sponsored schemes for addressing emerging
unemployment problems led to adjustments being made in the schemes. The project had provisions for
further development of the policy and institutional framework in this area. Also, it was felt that Bank
involvement would help improve the institutional framework for industrial restructuring, particularly the
banking system, and improve the feedback from enterprises on the impact of the reforms which would
facilitate the formulation of necessary adjustments to the reform process.
3.           Project Objectives. The objective was to support the restructuring of the industrial sector
in order to enhance its international competitiveness. To achieve this, the project aimed to: (i) redirect
the product/market mix of the sector to competitive areas suitable for convertible currency exports; (ii)
improve enterprise management practices and capabilities; (iii) stimulate the establishment and growth
of small business firms, including the private sector; (iv) alleviate the adverse employment impact of
industrial restructuring; and (v) strengthen the institutional capabilities in support of industrial
restructuring.

4.            Project Description. The project included three enterprise credit components and a
technical assistance component, to be onlent through the participating banks, to support enterprise
investments for: (a) increased direct and indirect exports to convertible currency markets (US$110
million of the Bank loan); (b) growth of entrepreneurs and small businesses (US$10 million);
(c) restructuring efficient employment creation in regions affected by emerging unemployment due to
industrial restructuring (US$15 million); and (d) a technical assistance component for participating
banks, enterprises and govermnent agencies to strengthen their institutional capacities (US$5 million).
5.            Eligible manufacturing subprojects under the first credit component were expected to
export to convertible currency markets at least 60% of output directly or at least 70% directly and
indirectly combined (of which at least 40% directly) and pay back foreign exchange investment costs
within five years from direct or indirect foreign exchange revenues. The second credit component was to
support growth of proprietorships, partnerships, small cooperatives and limited liability companies
engaged in manufacturing or related business services, with employment up to 60 persons prior to
investment. Eligibility under the third credit component was to be for employment creating investments
in manufacturing, agro-processing and business services in regions suffering from industrial
restructuring. Initially, it was to be for three counties in North Hungary affected by unemployment due
to restructuring of the steel and coal mining industries. Subproject were to be eligible under the
Government supported investment promotion program for job creation which was being revised
following a review by the Bank, including actions to stimulate the development of small firms in
manufacturing, tourism, construction, trade and business services, while the commercial, technical and
financial viability was to be assessed along criteria similar to those for the other credit components.
6.            On lending for the credit line components was based on a refinancing facility in the
National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to which fourteen participating banks had access (during
implementation) on a first-come first-served basis. The participating banks were to take the final credit
decision on each subloan, based on appraisal carried out by the banks with assistance from consultants
and/or the Restructuring Program Office (RPO) which had been established.
7.            The project also includes technical assistance to strengthen the participating banks in the
area of small business credit; to prepare subsector restructuring programs; to carry out a comprehensive
study of the performance and constraints facing the small business sector; and to help improve the
Government measures for addressing unemployment. The latter included assistance for improving
appraisal skills for productive employment project and preparation of a strategic plan for an area facing
unemployment, and assistance and investment support for development of new employment and
retraining services.
B.            Major Factors Affecting Project
8.            The project supported restructuring in a period when Hungary was experiencing a deep
recession with large fiscal and current account deficits. Several intemal and external factors had a strong
influence on Hungary's growth performance over most of the life of this project (1990-1995). Exogenous
shocks were, in part, responsible for the decline in output in Hungary. Economic activity was severely
affected by the collapse of the CMEA, by major droughts in 1992-93 which affected agriculture output
and by the UN sanctions on Yugoslavia which had a major impact on transport and other sectors.
Moreover, the recession in Western Europe affected the outlook for Hungarian exporters.
9.            The pace of structural reforms slowed down and this significantly affected the
perfornance of key economic sectors. The reduction of export subsidies and the introduction of a tough
bankruptcy law in 1992 forced interruption of several loss-making export activities, which also contributed
to the export collapse. After the wave of enterprise reorganizations and liquidations had swept the country



3
in 1992, restructuring and downsizing slowed down. Large enterprise losses fmanced through defaults
on bank loans, arrears to the State budget and Social Security, and arrears to other enterprises greatly
weakened the enterprise and financial sectors and contributed to the fiscal deficit. Due to improved legal
and regulatory framework, enterprise sector problems were reflected in the banks bad loan portfolios.
Thus, four large state banks became troubled at the end of 1992 and became technically insolvent in 1993.
The large bad loan portfolios of the state banks were subsequently addressed under the EFSAL.
10.           At the institutional level, the lack of demand for the credit line was due to a number of
factors: (i) banks were primarily concerned with restructuring their existing portfolios rather than
extending new loans, unless they were able to secure Govermnent guarantees and/or excessive amounts of
collateral; (ii) in a drastically changing environment characterized by uncertainties associated with new
export markets, privatization of state enterprises, and new legislation in general, banks preferred to
"invest" in high-yielding, low risk Government bonds, rather than seek out creditworthy clients;
(iii) many private and privatized enterprises increasingly had access to and preferred trade credit to other
forms of financing, thereby avoiding the high interest rates and collateral requirements; and
(iv) competing financing sources (Japanese EXIM Bank, bilaterals and others) at more attractive terms
(subsidized interest rates and less stringent procurement procedures) put the Bank's credit lines at a
disadvantage.
11.           In the case of the regional employment creation component, apart from the condition
described above, there were additional contributory factors such as: (i) lack/inadequacies of supporting
infrastructure that deterred potential investors; (ii) changes in the structure and organization of local self-
governments as a result of which the agencies responsible for such investment promotion and approval at
the local level were not in place; and (iii) difficulties faced by potential investors in raising the minimum
required equity financing.
12.           Because of the dramatic changes in the business environment in Hungary since the
approval of the Loan and the increased emphasis in the country on the privatization of enterprises as an
important element of industrial restructuring, the Bank in consultation with the Hungarian authorities
amended the Loan Agreements, once in April 1991 and again in March of 1993, to better serve the
prevalent business environment. The major features of these changes included: (i) relaxing eligibility
criteria (e.g. deleting export orientation as a requirement) for investnent; (ii) consolidating all credit line
components under one credit line; (iii) opening the credit line to all sectors; (iv) financing of free standing
working capital; and (v) increasing the limit of loans to small and medium enterprises from $150,000 to
$300,000.
C.    Achievement of Objectives
13.           Most of the project objectives with respect to the line of credit components as originally
envisaged were not met, the exceptions being the small business development component. However,
with respect to the technical assistance components the success rate was much better. Approximately
US$83 million out of the original loan amount of US$140 million was disbursed. The overall project
objectives, including the eligibility criteria for credit line components were from the outset overly
ambitious and too stringent. This project followed two similar projects (First and Second Industrial
Restructuring Projects), which were also structured with several components, utilizing the same
counterparts and same financial institutions (three state owned commercial banks) to on-lend funds.
Three restructuring loans in the space of three years amounting to $390 million put a lot of pressure on
the counterparts as well as on the financial institutions.
14.           The main objectives of the project were conceived for a different economic and business
environment, and as explained above when this environment changed, most of the objectives became
obsolete or were not possible to achieve in the prevailing environment. As mentioned in para 12, the
Bank in consultation with the Borrower amended the Loan Agreement, focusing on areas where some of



4
the original objectives were being met (e.g. assisting the development of small and medium scale
enterprises). This revised focus enabled 985 sub-loans to be made to small and medium scale enterprises
for business development, working capital and investment financing. With regard to the technical
assistance components, the achievement of the objectives were much better. The creation of the labor
development and training center at Miskolc in Northern Hungary was very successful, leading to a
follow-up operation and replication of several similar models throughout the country. Data from the
studies carried out by the State Property Agency and Ministry of Industry (Engineering Sub-sector
Study) were used for various programs within the respective agencies.
D.    Project Sustainability
15.          The main objective of this project, after it was restructured, was to provide a line of
credit for investment and working capital purposes to help develop small and medium enterprises in all
sectors. To sustain the growth of the private sector, a proper macroeconomic framework needs to be in
place, supported by efficient financial intermediaries (e.g. commercial banks) who are receptive to the
needs of the enterprise sector. The latter to a great extent has been established under the project, and is
also supported by the Bank's EFSAL (approved in 1997). With respect to the macro framework, the
authorities are moving in the right direction. The Govermment's March 1995 stabilization package,
aimed at forestalling a pending crisis by reducing maroeconomic disequilibrium and prepared the stage
for more fundamental reforms. Since that time, the Government has deepened the stabilization effort and
has continued to address long-standing structural bottlenecks, aimed at placing Hungary on a sustainable
path. Recognizing the major problems faced by the banks and their negative impact on a sustainable
recovery, the Government initiated a program of enterprise and banking reform, supported by the
EFSAL.
16.          Under the EFSAL, the Bank worked very closely with key members of the Government
and the NBH to help prepare a program to finalize the reforms of the enterprise and banking sectors.
This program, which has already been successfully implemented, helped finalize privatization of the
remaining State-owned banks and enterprises, tighten the budget constrains of enterprises, strengthen the
legal and regulatory framework for banks, and develop a strong bank supervisory capacity. Sustaining
these reforms will strengthen both the banking and enterprise sectors and in turn will help to maintain the
progress made under the Third Industrial Restructuring Project. The Bank will also support Hungary
through the proposed PSAL, with major reforms of the pension financing systems.
E.    Bank Performance
17.          The Bank's performance in all aspects of the project cycle was satisfactory. There were
no significant deviations in Bank policies or procedures in project implementation, and project supervision
was adequate. In some years, although the project was supervised officially only once a year, close
monitoring was carried out during other project work in Hungary. The Bank team was well rounded with
the participation of several specialists in areas of enterprise restructuring. The project also benefited from
the continuity of having at least one person from the original team remain with the project from its
inception to Loan closing. Through close monitoring of the project, the project team was able to modify
the Legal Agreement and restructure the project so that the resources were directed at objectives that were
more achievable in the prevalent business environment. However, in this respect, the Bank could have
acted more decisively by being more flexible with the amendments that were made much earlier on in the
project cycle (amendments were made in 1991 and again in 1993). The amendments made in 1993 (see
para 20) had a very positive impact on the project, and had these been implemented in 1991 at the height
of the transition, the overall impact of the project would have been far greater. The project team received
excellent support and guidance throughout the project implementation period from both the Disbursements
and Legal Departnents.

18.           The Bank's objective is to continue to support the systemic transformation process in
Hungary. Building on its long-term relationship with Hungary, and taking into account the recent
activities of other bilateral and multilateral organizations in the region, the Bank intends to coordinate its
activities closely with these institutions, to allocate resources in the most efficient and beneficial way.
Bank activities are expected to focus on three major areas: (i) restructuring and privatization of the
enterprise and financial sectors; (ii) budgetary/public administration reform; and (iii) imnprovement of the
social and economic infrastructure. During this period, the Bank plans to lend for capital markets
development, public sector adjustment, as well as for projects in energy, pension reforms, education,
health, and water supply.
F.     Borrower Performance
19.           The overall performance of the Borrower and the concerned government agencies was
satisfactory in all phases of the project cycle, as was compliance with all main loan covenants. The
cooperation and exchange of information between the Bank, NBH, and MOI was excellent. The NBH
worked closely with the Bank to modify the Legal Agreement to suit the needs of the prevailing business
environment, and to cancel part of the Loan based on the perceived demands of the participating
commercial banks. Most of these issues were addressed through the frequent dialogue that the Bank had
with its counterparts.
G.    Detailed Assessment of Outcome
Line of Credit Components
20.           As mentioned above, demand for the credit line components, especially the component
for exports to convertible currency markets and the component for employment creation (para. 5) did not
materialize. The exception was the credit line for the development of small and medium enterprises,
where the original allocation of $10 million was disbursed quite rapidly. The authorities were keen to
pursue the development of this sector and requested additional funding to be allocated to this component.
As a result of this request and the then prevailing economic conditions, the Bank in collaboration with
the NBH, amended the Loan Agreement (para 12) to facilitate the needs of the business environment.
The main thrust of the amendments were to open the line of credit to all sectors, including agro-
processing, tourism and services, include financing of free standing working capital, and to increase the
limit of the loan amount to S&M enterprises from $150,000 to $300,000. As a result of these
amendments, disbursements increased substantially between 1993-96. In total, over 985 sub-loans were
approved with industry and agro-processing accounting for about 84 percent of the subloans, followed by
the service and tourism sectors. Approximately 90 percent of the sub-loans approved were below
US$125,0001.
21.           In order to asses the outcome of the credit line operation, analysis was done on a sample
of selected sub-loans . Three methods were used for the analysis of the performance of sub-projects and
the beneficiaries. For projects where the loan amount was over US$190,000 equivalent, the financial
rate of return3 (FRR) was calculated whenever possible. For all enterprises which submitted their
I      The average exchange rate between 1993/96 was used to calculate the US$ amounts.
2      It was agreed with the Borrower that the sample would consist of approximately 5% of the total sub-loans
approved. In arriving at the sample, attention was paid to ensure that the sample contained sub-loans from different
sectors, participating banks and with different sub-loan amounts. Although, every effort was made to collect a
representative sample, several eligible projects had to be dropped due to the refusal of the sub-borrowers to provide
information (see footnote 4 below).
3      As per agreed criteria at project appraisal, FRR was to be calculated for sub-loans over US$300,000
equivalent. However, since there were only a few sub-loans above this amount, FRR was also calculated (ex-post)
for some selected sub-loans below this cut-off amount.



6
balance sheets and profit and loss statements and for which a FRR could not be calculated, cash flow
analyses were carried out to evaluate the performance of the beneficiary rather than the performance of
the sub-project. In the case of small sub-loans, when balance sheet and profit and loss accounts were not
available, a very simple analysis of turnover and gross operating profit was carried out.
22.           Based on the FRR calculations, cash flow analyses, turnover and gross operating profits,
combined with general information on the enterprises, the sample group was divided into six groups:
.4
outstanding, successful, --ioderately successful, poor, failure and non-responsive . The results are shown
in Table 6 (C). The results show that nearly half of the sampled enterprises were successful with their
sub-projects. If the moderate projects were to be added to this group, the percentage would increases to
69 percent. If the non-responsive enterprises were altogether left out of the calculations, the success rate
of sampled sub-projects would increase to 82 percent.
23.           The overall experience with cash flow analyses shows that the enterprises cash flow
situation improved after the investment financed from the project, and in some cases dramatically. Only
about 18 percent of the projects were involved in the establishment of new facilities or products, while
the remaining 72 percent were engaged in expansion, upgrading or improvement of existing products,
capacity or services. The turnover for the outstanding and successful groups tended to be in the range of
US$3 - 15 million, with most enterprises involved in export oriented businesses. Based on the sample
analysis and overall loan performance, it can be concluded that where sub-projects tended to fail or do
poorly, in most cases they were associated with loans below US$50,000, and on-lent to single
entrepreneurs or relatively small enterprises. In most of these instances, the failure was due to a lack of
business and/or marketing experience.
24.           The performance of the participating banks in the implementation of the credit line
component was mixed. With the exception of a few banks, most banks did not vigorously promote the
availability of the Bank credit line. Based on the analyses of the sample sub-projects, one could
conclude that in most cases, the participating commercial banks business practices were prudent, and
most of the projects were justified and well prepared. The majority of failed enterprises or enterprises
declaring bankruptcy, tended to be small entrepreneurs, causing only minor losses to the participating
banks. In fairness to the banks, it must be noted that during the life of the loan, most of the participating
commercial banks went through tremendous changes, including privatization of most and with high
turnover of staff, resulting in a lack of continuity of counterparts at all levels. Despite these problems,
the collection ratios of the banks were around 87 percent.
Technical Assistance
25.           The employment services and retraining component was by far the most successful.
This technical assistance component supported the Government to develop an integrated set of
employment and retraining services to assist those who were experiencing temporary or long termn
difficulties in obtaining employment, due to industrial restructuring or lack of development in certain
areas (i.e. backward regions). Apart from establishing a re-training center, several studies conducted
under this component laid the ground work for a follow-up project (Human Resources Development
Project, which was approved in 1991). The North Hungarian Regional Labor Development and Training
Center, located at Miskolc (project component) was soon followed by three other similar institutions
located at Debrecen, Pecs and Szekesfehevar by 1993. These institutions have launched over 2000
4      Because the loan disbursed over an eight year period, several sub-loans were fully repaid, and as a result in
most of these cases, the sub-borrowers were reluctant to give the infornation required to analyze their performance.
This does not indicate that the sub-projects or the enterprises themselves were bad, just simply the fact that the
enterprises did not have an obligation to the banks to provide any information.
5      The bank which had the most number of successful sub-projects had the same counterparts throughout
most of the project life, ensuring continuity and closer monitoring of sub-projects.

courses and have an enrollment of over 14,000. Due to the efficiency and high quality of the courses
offered, the drop-out rate has been minimal (5-10%). As for those who finished the courses successfully,
40% found a job within 3 months and 60% within six months, and the total rate of subsequent
replacement rose to about 80-90 %.
26.          An engineering sub-sector study was carried out to assess the performance,
competitiveness, future prospects and development of priority areas. The MOI prepared a proposal to
implement recommendations made under the study, that were not already addressed under the overall
reforms that were taking place. The proposal contained the role that the MOI and other agencies would
play in the implementation process. The proposal included areas for consideration such as marketing,
advisory/consultancy services, organization of seminars, implementation of quality assurance programs,
etc. Financing for most of these programs were subsequently obtained from donor agencies (consultancy
services, ISO-9000 quality assurance program were funded by the EU-PHARE).
27.          The Central Statistics Office (CSO) coordinated the preparation of the small business
sector study which was conducted by Hungarian experts. Based on the study, CSO developed a small
business data base and software for data analysis and conducts regular surveys of small and medium
businesses for data gathering. The RPO, which was established in the MOI to assist counterparts and
enterprises in financial analyses, procurement and disbursement matters was subsequently privatized,
and today is a very successful consulting company, who provided the background financial data and
analyses for this report.
28.          In line with the agreements reached with the Bank in the context of the project, the
Government streamlined its employment creation support schemes. It further developed new criteria for
selection of regions in need of support, including the so-called backward areas, and crisis areas, affected
by large lay-offs. A detailed study for the regional development of the Borsod region was completed and
its recommendations adopted by the Government. Recommendation included, inter alia, the adoption of
an integrated approach to regional development, including the establishment of a Regional Development
Agency.
I.    Future Operations
29.          The Bank's program of support has the broad objective of helping Hungary maintain
macroeconomic stability and accelerate its growth to facilitate EU accession by focusing on a strategy of
growth that will be accomplished by continuing to downsize the state sector; continued strengthening of
Hungary's financial and enterprise sectors; reforming social policies and strengthening the human
resource base; improving environmental management; and attracting FDI and know-how, especially in
the infrastructure sectors.
I.    Key Lessons Learned
30.          Some of the lessons from this experience are as follows:
(i)    The rapidly changing political, social and economic environment in Hungary had a
decisive impact on project performance, both positive and negative. While it was hardly
possible to anticipate the dramatic changes, reaction to changing situations could have been
swifter. The strategy for using the line of credit project approach cannot be determined in
isolation from the overall strategy of Bank's assistance to Hungary. Given the evolving nature
of the reform process, several years of experience with Bank financed activities, plus availability
of additional sources of external finance, it may have been opportune for the Hungarian
authorities and the Bank to have reviewed the overall strategy for and comparative advantages of
Bank assistance much earlier in the project life. This assertion is not intended to imply that all



8
was wrong and needed to be changed, but rather that, in light of all the changes that took place, a
fresh look may have optimized the benefits of Bank assistance.
(ii)   Provided the country strategy calls for continuation of intermediation of Bank funds
through commercial banks, the Bank should be prepared to look again at the rationale and
structure of such lending arrangements, including the apex concept.  The impact of
macroeconomic developments, development policies and financial sector reforms need to be
taken into account, both as opportunities and constraints. The apex structure used in this credit
line operation was necessary at the beginning and has proved useful. However, other lending
instruments need to be considered. All design parameters of such transactions, including interest
rates, opening up general lines versus segmentation, types of goods and services covered
(leasing, used goods, land and buildings), financing a fixed share of subloans rather than
disbursement against goods and services for each subproject, small and medium and long-term
lending, linkages to subsidy schemes, single currency loans, passing of foreign exchange risk to
sub-borrowers, direct lending to selected banks, guarantees, time frame for commitment and
cofinancing should be considered.
(iii)  The project design included too many components and eligibility criteria for credit lines
(para 5), that made project monitoring and implementation difficult under the prevailing
political, social and economic conditions. Implementation became much smoother once the
Loan Agreement was amended and procedures were made simpler. Once the Bank appraises and
accepts the procedures and credit guidelines of participating commercial banks as sufficient for
proper financial intermediation, the Bank should refrain from micro managing the credit lines
(e.g. setting standard Bank eligibility criteria).
(iv)   In designing technical assistance for participating financial intermediaries, attention
should be paid not only to strengthening the skill at the credit officer level, but also at providing
relevant information on credit risk management to top management levels This will help
facilitate a smoother implementation of the intermediation process.

Review of the
Third Industrial Restructuring Project
From the Borrower's Perspective
1.    Background
The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) received a loan from the World Bank (the Bank)
in the amount of US$140 million equivalent toward the cost of the Third Industrial
Restructuring Project. The loan was signed on February 24, 1989 and became effective
in May 1989.
At the Borrower's request the loan was amended on April 11, 1991 and on March 19,
1993.
The original closing date was June 30, 1995 which was extended twice, and the final
closing date was June 30, 1997.
The total utilisation from the US$140 million loan amounts to US$82.7 million.
The preparation of the ICR started in April 1997. A Bank mission, headed by Mr. Hiran
Herat, met representatives of NBH, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (MOI) and
the Participating Banks (banks). The elaboration of ICR was based on discussions with
the relevant officials of NBH, MOI, and participating banks, as well as the analysis of a
representative sample selected from final beneficiaries.
2.    Project objectives and components
The project objective was to support the restructuring of the industrial sector in order to
enhance its international competitiveness. The project aim was to help: (i) redirect the
product/market mix of the sector to competitive areas suitable for convertible currency
exports; (ii) improve enterprise management practices and capabilities; (iii) stimulate the
establishment and growth of small business firms, including the private sector; (iv)
alleviate the adverse employment impact of industrial restructuring; and (v) strengthen
the institutional capabilities in support of industrial restructuring.
To achieve these objectives, the project consisted of the following parts:
Part A:     studies to improve market strategy, organisation, management and
operating system of enterprises as well as development projects for direct and indirect
exporters, for small businesses and for employment creating enterprises.
Part B:     training program for the participating banks and other financial institutions
involved in small business lending.



23
Appendix A
page 2 of 4
Part C:     program to strengthen the Government's measures for restructuring the
industrial sector and addressing unemployment, including limited investment in support
for development of employment and retraining services.
During the implementation period several major political and economic changes had
happened, which had an adverse effect on the project. For this reason the project was
restructured in 1991 and in 1993 to serve better the demands of the current business
environment, i.e. "small business" financing.
After the restructuring of the loan, the main goal of the project component was to assist
the small and medium size enterprises and for this reason the credit line was opened to all
sectors. The technical assistance part of the program, which supported the Government
to develop measures for industrial restructuring, and for addressing unemployment due to
the restructuring, remained unchanged.
3.    Implementation experience and achievement of objectives
In respect of Bank loans in Hungary, this was the first credit line type loan, which
allowed the financing of small size enterprises, even if to a limited extent at the
beginning. At the time of the project appraisal this sort of lending policy could be
considered as a pioneering activity in Hungary.
During the implementation of the project, as it is already well-known, the former
COMECON countries have undergone significant economic changes. These changes
necessitated the revision of the project objectives by extending the eligibility to financing
small enterprises and entrepreneurs not only in the industrial but in the agroprocessing,
service, tourism and construction subsectors too.
The amendment dated March 19, 1993 rose also the limit of funds provided to one
beneficiary up to US$10 million and extended the maturity up to 10 years including 3
years grace period for all type of enterprises.
Taking the goals of the restructured project into account, the "small business" component
has been a successful one. More than 83% of the loan was utilised for this component.
The number of subloans amounted to nearly 1000, out of which the estimates of project
benefits, including financial rate of return, where applicable, were analysed on the basis
of a well-selected, representative sample of subloans.
A complete study of sample selection, its composition by sectors and evaluation of
performance was prepared and attached to the ICR.



24
Appendix A
page 3 of 4
Main findings of this study are as follows:
*     This loan provided a very important financial facility for small business in times,
when the need for loans increased considerably. The relatively long maturity and grace
period were very favourable conditions, because at that time loans with maturity over one
year were considered "long term" credits.
*     from  the responsive companies 57%  of the projects can be considered as
successful, 25% shows moderate and 18% poor results.
*     the project size in case of successful projects is quite diverse, but in case of
moderate and poor results the projects are rather small, suggesting, that smaller projects
are more vulnerable.
*     the cash flow analyses reveal that the participating bank's business practice was
prudent and most of the projects were justified and well prepared.
The good performance of the participating banks, which was also supported by the study,
can be attributed partly to the training of their staffs which was contemplated under the
loan. Actually the training was organised by International Training Center for Bankers,
supported earlier by the Bank, and financed from the banks' own budget.
The technical assistance component, for which 17% of the loan was utilised, can be
considered as a very successful one. This component supported the Government's effort
to restructure the industrial subsector and to develop a set of employment and retraining
services, to assist people who were adversely effected by the industrial restructuring.
In the frame of this component:
a)    An engineering subsector study was carried out, to assess the performance and
competitveness of the subsector and to recommend priority areas for development. Most
of the recommendations of this study were implemented under the overall reforms taking
place.
b)    A small business sector study, coordinated by the Central Statistical Office (CSO)
formed the basis of a small business data base and since then, CSO conducts regular
surveys to update the data base and prepares regular publications on the sector.
c)    The regional development study of the Borsod county, which was facing the
highest unemployment problem due to the industrial restructuring, recommended to
establish a Labor-development and Training Center at Miskolc, the capital of the Borsod
county. The operation of this Center, which provided employment and retraining services
for unemployed adults, has been very successful and proves to be sustainable.



25
Appendix A
page 4 of 4
Based on the experience obtained from this Center, five additional centers have been
established throughout the country, financed from the Bank's loan of "Human Resource
Development Project."
Bank performance
The performance of the Bank during the implementation of the project was satisfactory.
There was a good working relation between the Bank and the Borrower throughout the
full implementation period. The Bank was flexible and cooperative in program
restructuring and extensions of the closing dates which, despite the economic changes,
enabled the Borrower to utilise the loan successfully.
Assessment of outcome
Major economic changes took place during the implementation period of this program,
which impacted the original project. Consequently, the project original objectives could
be achieved to a limited extent only. However, the financial support granted for small
and medium size enterprises, during a period which was scarce of funds, can be
considered successful. Overall, as indicated earlier, 81 percent of the project investments
operate profitably in a difficult economic environment.
The technical assistance part of the program, which supported the Government to develop
measures for industrial restructuring and for addressing unemployment due to the
restructuring, met the objectives. From among its components, the employment services
and retraining component was highly successful and laid the ground for follow-up
projects.

HUNGARY
Third Industrial Restructuring Project
(Loan 3020 -HU)
AIDE MEMOIRE OF IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT MISSION
1.    A Bank mission consisting of Mr. Hiran Herat initiated work on the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Industrial Restructuring Project from April 9 - 14, 1997.
The mission met with the representatives of the National Bank of Hungary (NBH), the Ministry
of Industry and the participating banks (PBs). The mission would like to thank the various
Hungarian counterparts for all the cooperation and courtesies extended to it. The mission's
views expressed in this Aide Memoire are subject to confirmation by BANK management.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.     The project objectives, as set out in the Loan and Project Summary of the relevant Staff
Appraisal Report dated January 13, 1989 (Report No: 7456-HU) were to support the
restructuring of the industrial sector in order to enhance its international competitiveness. The
project aim was to help: (i) redirect the product/market mix of the sector to competitive areas
suitable for convertible currency exports; (ii) improve enterprise management practices and
capabilities; (iii) stimulate the establishment and growth of small businesses, including the
private sector; (iv) alleviate the adverse employment impact of industrial restructuring; and (v)
strengthen the institutional capabilities in support of industrial restructuring.
3.    To achieve these objectives, the project design included three enterprise credit
components to support enterprise investment by:
(a)   increasing direct and indirect exports to convertible currency markets related to
the implementation of enterprise restructuring programs;
(b)    growth of entrepreneurs and small businesses; and
(c)    efficient employment creation in regions affected by emerging unemployment
due to industrial restructuring.
4.     The project also included technical assistance to strengthen the participating banks in the
area of small business credit, to prepare enterprise and subsector restructuring programs, to
improve the analytical framework for the small business sector, and to help improve the
Government measures for addressing unemployment, including limited investment in support for
development of employment and retraining services.
5.    The dramatic political and economic changes that swept eastern Europe in the early
nineties had quite an adverse impact on the project. While some of the technical assistance



27
Appendix B
page 2 of 9
components and the small business development components were progressing well, the two
major credit lines for industrial restructuring and employment creation were hardly utilized. As
a result, the project was restructured in early 1993 to better serve the demands of the prevalent
business and political environment. The restructured project had a modest goal of assisting the
small and medium enterprises. $20 million of the original $140 million Loan was canceled, and
the credit line was opened to all sectors. Appraisal guidelines were modified to help small and
medium size enterprises. Since the Loan was restructured, nearly $43 million have been
disbursed for small and medium enterprises and an additional $12 million was canceled. In total,
nearly 900 subprojects were approved. The NBH has requested a cancellation of $5,170,000. It
is estimated that by the time the Loan is closed on June 30, 1997, total disbursements will be $81
million and the remaining undisbursed amount of approximately $22 million will also be
canceled.
OPERATIONAL PLAN
6.    The Bank's revised guidelines ( April 1994) on preparation of ICRs requires the
preparation of an operational plan by the Borrower and the implementing agencies, indicating
actions and measures to be taken by the Borrower, the relevant Government agencies, and the
project entities, to ensure satisfactory future implementation and operations under the project,
and the achievement of the project s objectives. The draft operational plan should include:
* the Government's views on the continued relevance of the project's objectives;
* actions and measures to be taken to ensure sustainability and continued satisfactory operation
of institutions and technical assistance programs under the project;
* actions and measures to be taken in the case of subprojects and subborrowers facing financial
difficulties, including enterprises that continue to be under state ownership.
7.    The operational plan should be supported by a table that indicates clearly, for each major
item under the technical assistance and credit line components, the following:
* major issues/problems;
* major actions/measures already take, being taken or to be taken;
* schedule and timing of each major action/measure; and
* the main Government and /or project agencies responsible for the actions/measures.
BORROWER'S EVALUATION OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
8.    The Borrower's responsibilities in the preparation of the ICR are indicated in the Bank's
Operational Manual Statement and Good Practices for ICR Preparation (GP 13.55 of April 1994.
paras 4 and 5). Copies of the Bank's BP 13.55 and relevant parts of GP 13.55 were given earlier
to the Borrower (NBH)



28
Appendix B
page 3of 9
9.    As indicated in BP 13.55 and GP 13.55, the Borrower's ICR should include a summary
not exceeding 10 pages, together with the supporting background information and annexes.
PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN
10.   To enable a comparison of appraised and actual project costs and financing plans, the
Borrower should update the relevant tables (Tables 5.3 and 5.4 on pages 40 and 42 of the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7456-HU).
INFORMATION TO BE SENT TO THE WORLD BANK
11.   To enable the Bank to complete the draft of Part I of the ICR, it was agreed that the
Borrower would ensure that the information in relation to the credit and technical assistance
components indicated in Annexes 1 and 2 is sent to the Bank together with the updated project
costs and financing table.
12.   For the credit component, given the large number (about 900) of subloans under the
project, it was agreed that the estimates of project benefits, including overall project financial
rates of return be prepared on the basis of well-selected, representative samples of subloans by
each of the PBs. The mission agreed with the NBH and the PBs on the number of subprojects to
be included in the sample (Annex 2). Careful consideration should be given to the composition
to ensure that the selected samples are truly representative of the overall subloan population and
the results can be relied upon as a reasonable basis for extrapolation of the project impact,
including net benefits. To ensure uniformity as well as independence in evaluation, it was
agreed that the Borrower and the PBs would engage an independent consulting institution to
carry out the analysis. Terms of reference (TORs) for the consultants' work are attached in
Annex 3. NBH has proposed that Econoconsult, a consulting company used previously by the
NBH and PBs in preparing the data for the ICRs for the First and Second Industrial Restructuring
Projects undertake the evaluation work for this project. NBH have requested the mission to
explore the possibilities of supporting this work through a Bank trust fund grant financing. The
mission undertook to look into the possibilities.
OUTPUTS and SCHEDULE
13.   To enable the timely submission of the final ICR, including both the Borrower's and the
Bank's parts to the Bank's Board of Directors by December 31, 1997, as required, it was agreed
that the following timetable would be followed:
NBH to send the Bank by August 31, 1997
(i)   the background information on the credit component, including the estimates
of the FRRs, prepared by the PBs and the consultants;
(ii)   the updated project cost and financing tables;

Introduction
1.    NBH received a loan from the World Bank in the amount of US$140 million equivalent
towards the cost of the Third Industrial Restructuring Project. The loan will be closed
(officially) on June 30, 1997, and an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will need to be
prepared within six months of loan closing that assesses the experience under the loan, including
whether and to what extent the project's objectives were met. This includes an assessment of the
financial impact of the project, including subproject and subloan performance.
2.     To assist in the preparation of the assessment, NBH wishes to engage the services of
qualified, experienced, independent consultants. Terms of reference for the consultant's work
are provided below.
Objective
3.     The selected consultants are expected to assist NBH and the participating banks (PBs) to
make a realistic assessment of the financial impact of the project by means of evaluating a
sample of subprojects chosen with the assistance of the PBs.
Main Tasks
4.    In view of the large number of subloans (about 900), the Consultants with the assistance
of the PBs will choose a representative sample of subprojects, which should adequately represent
the total population of subloans so that they can be used as a reasonable basis for extrapolating
the development impact, including the net benefits of the project investments. The consultants
should review with the PBs and NBH the samples provided by the PBs in regards to their
representation, taking into account relevant factors such as performance (including well-
performing as well as problem subprojects), sectoral composition, ownership characteristics, etc.
5.    The consultants should collect data for the calculation of the financial rates of return
(FRR), balance sheet, income statement and cash flow for each sample subproject. They should
use their judgment as to the need for field visits to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the
information and data provided. Wherever possible, cross-checking should be done to ensure that
the financial information provided for the calculation of subproject benefits and performance are
realistic and consistent.
6.    To respect the confidentiality of information, as well as to encourage the preparation of
truly representative samples, it was agreed that the consultants' assure the PBs as well as the

individual subborrowers that they would not be identified by name in the consultants' report
when presenting their analysis. Both the PBs as well as subborrowers/subprojects would be
coded by number for presentational purposes.
OUTPUTS AND SCHEDULE
7.    The consultants' draft report including all the analysis as above should be submitted to
the NBH by August 15, 1997. The final report would be prepared after comments by the NBH,
the PBs and the Bank.
