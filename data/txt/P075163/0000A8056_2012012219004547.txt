                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Global environmental objective is to demonstrate and provide for replication for the reduction of catastrophic accidental spills of transboundary pollution
                         loads from mine operations flowing into the Danube and Black Sea basins. In support of this objective, the project, through a GEF co-financed component, will
                         assist in piloting and replication of hazards prevention and remediation activities for improving the management and safety of tailings dams and waste dump
                         facilities; and in catalyzing transboundary cooperation on integrated water resources management of the Tisza Basin. The successful implementation of the
                         GEF co-financed component will serve as a model for replication for reducing mining accident risks to human and aquatic ecosystem health throughout
                         Romania and other parts of the Tisza and Danube basins.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation pace improved significantly in the second half of 2011 and all but three of the previously agreed critical actions were implemented, mainly due to the additional
                         funds allocated to the project, after the budget rectification of August 2011, to components B (Seismic Risk Reduction) and D (Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in the Tisza Basin).
                         Although the Project Development Objectives associated with flood and landslides risk, and reduction of risk of mining accidents were not at risk of not being met by project closing,
                         the implementation progress also increased substantially the chances of meeting the other development and environment objectives regarding strengthening the emergency
                         management capacity (under component A - Strengthening Emergency Management and Risk Financing), the seismic risk reduction (under component B), and development of a
                         mine-spill disaster response system and of a mine-specific environmental monitoring system contributing to a lasting, sustainable project impact (under component D). Adequate
                         budget for project completion has been allocated for 2012 in the state budget approved by the Parliament.

                         To make this happen, at the Government request, the Bank approved a second extension of the project closing date, until June 30, 2012, to allow for completion of a selection of
                         contracts which directly contribute to meeting the development and environment objectives of the project, activities which could not be completed within the previous Closing Date
                         (December 20, 2011). A thorough assessment undertaken by the Bank showed that, with sufficient funds allocated in 2012 and steady payments made to contractors, all project
                         development and environment objectives can be met (and even slightly exceeded) until June 30, 2012. In addition, an amount of about $ 6.67 million has been canceled from the
                         Loan because it could not be used within the extended project time.

                         Seismic retrofitting of 38 buildings was completed so far, of which 26 buildings have been completely finalized and are fully functional. Rehabilitation of nine more buildings will be
                         completed by June 30, 2012 and will be fully functional, making to 35 the number of buildings fully functional by the project end. During the proposed extension, structural seismic
                         retrofitting of six additional buildings would also be completed, while their rehabilitation and modernization will remain in the responsibility of the beneficiaries. It is, thus, expected
                         that, by June 30, 2012, the project would meet and exceed the target of buildings retrofitted and provide seismic protection to about 3.0 million people (of which 28,800 people under
                         direct risk of lives).

                         Development of the Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) under component A (Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity) progressed
                         significantly with successful operational testing leading to the issue of the operational acceptance. Roll-out activities started with supply of the communication equipment (routers,
                         switches), while the Contractor undertook the factory inspection of the main hardware to be further supplied and installed (including minimal functional testing) in all 40 locations
                         starting with December 5 and would be completed by January 15, 2012. Software roll-out will start in early February 2012, after the completion of the new training session, scheduled
                         for January 9-21, 2012.

                         Implementation of the Romanian Catastrophe Insurance Program (RCIP), formally launched in July 2010, continued to attract more people to subscribe insurance policies against
                         natural catastrophes. However, the system penetration remained lower than expected, with a peak of policies representing about 10% of total dwellings. The penetration of the
                         system slowed down since as the number of policies renewed diminished and an amendment to the legislation allowed for inclusion of the mandatory catastrophe risks in the

                         All works for flood protection and for safety of five dams have been completed as part of component C (Flood and Landslides Risk Reduction), while rehabilitation works for the last
                         dam in the project (Dridu Dam) are approaching completion. However, additional works for river regulation downstream of the dam and to secure safety of the right abutment are
                         needed to be done to complete the project, which increased the contract price by about $3 million, reallocated from component B. The landslides monitoring equipment has been
                         supplied and installed in both pilot locations (Sacele and Sinaia) and will be operational in early January 2012. In addition, the equipment for the national monitoring center (to collect
                         data from both pilot locations) was delivered. Therefore, the data collection for validation of the models and finalization of the landslides monitoring manuals could be completed
                         during the extended project time.

                         Under Component D the substantial cost savings for the physical remediation of high risk pilot sites, which were re-invested into expanding the number of rehabilitated sites, made
                         possib le meeting and exceeding the component objectives regarding increasing the safety of infrastructure for safety of tailings management facilities. The additional funding
                         allocated from the Loan and GEF Grant allowed for starting the contracting to develop a mine-spill disaster response system and of a mine-specific environmental monitoring system
                         contributing to a lasting, sustainable project impact. The study to develop a financial guarantee mechanism for post-closure cleanup, rehabilitation and maintenance activities for
                         mining activities will be finalized before project closure and made available as a template for future legislation in Romania.
