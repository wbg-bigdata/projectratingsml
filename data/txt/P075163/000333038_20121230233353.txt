F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the project was to assist the Government of Romania in reducing the
environmental, social, and economic vulnerability to natural disasters and catastrophic mining
accidental spills of pollutants through: (i) strengthening the institutional and technical capacity
for disaster management and emergency response through upgrading communication and
information systems; (ii) implementing specific risk reduction investments for floods, landslides
and earthquakes; (iii) improving the safety of selected water-retention dams; and (iv) improving
on a pilot basis the management and safety of tailings dams and waste dump facilities.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The PDO was not revised.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Global environmental objective was to demonstrate and provide for replication for the
reduction of catastrophic accidental spills of trans-boundary pollution loads from mine
operations flowing into the Danube and Black Sea basins. In support of this objective, the project,
through a GEF co-financed component, will assist in piloting and replication of hazards
prevention and remediation activities for improving the management and safety of tailings dams
and waste dump facilities; and in catalyzing trans-boundary cooperation on integrated water
resources management of the Tisza Basin. The successful implementation of the GEF co-
financed component will serve as a model for replication for reducing mining accident risks to
human and aquatic ecosystem health throughout Romania and other parts of the Tisza and
Danube basins.
Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The GEO was not revised.

1. Project Context, Development, and Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and Sector Background: Romania is severely prone to a range of natural disasters,
particularly earthquakes and floods that cause economic and human losses across the country.
Since 1908, 14 earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater, and eight major floods, affected almost two
million people and caused massive economic losses. Floods in 1997 and 1998 caused damages
estimated at US$310 million and US$150 million, respectively. Landslides are another natural
hazard. The total area exposed to landslide hazards is about 700,000 ha, putting at risk 50,000
households, 250,000 people, agricultural land, public and private buildings, public utility
networks, and roads. Romania also faces the risk of water pollution from mining accidents. The
accidents at tailings dams in the Maramures region in year 2000 (e.g., Aurul mine, on January 30;
and Baia Borsa mine, on March 20) demonstrated the need to mainstream safety and
environmental concerns into mining operations.
Project Background. The aim of the project was to assist the Government of Romania (GOR) in
reducing the country's social and economic vulnerability through a set of comprehensive and
high-priority measures addressing a number of critical hazards. The design was based on
experience from other countries, which showed that tackling each category of hazard in isolation
from other risks was less efficient and effective.
After the devastating earthquake in Turkey in 1999, which killed thousands of people and
destroyed many public buildings and private households, GOR resolved to take a proactive
approach to natural risk management by enhancing preparedness for earthquakes, floods
(including enhancing dam safety), landslides, and accidental spills of pollutants in case of mining
accidents. In addition, the project assessed the improvements needed to implement modern
procedures for disaster managment and response. This project – the first in the region and one of
the first that the Bank financed to help countries prepare for major natural hazards – helped
establish a new Bank paradigm for disaster risk management.
Mitigating different kinds of risks in Romania is the responsibility of various government
agencies. Therefore, the design considered implementation through three ministries and one
Government agency, which increased the complexity and proved difficult in implementation.
The implementation arrangements also aimed at raising ownership of the owners of the public
buildings through a project-specific (but cumbersome) co-financing mechanism. This added to
an already complicated design and should have been corrected during implementation, but the
Borrower and the implementing agency did not agree to do so. Thus, project implementation
became very complicated and difficult.
These difficulties were compounded by the lack of readiness for implementation (e.g., existence
of detailed designs ready to be translated into bidding documents for works), contrary to
information provided by the implementing agencies. Detailed (but incomplete) designs existed
only for one building; for all other construction activities, only feasibility studies had been
prepared. The underestimation of costs resulted in further delays.
Although the Government had strongly supported the project during preparation, it gradually
became less of a priority (the Government focused more to implementation of projects financed
from the EU structural funds), as manifested through insufficient funding, support, and

                                                1
supervision by the responsible officials (ministers, deputy ministers). Under such circumstances,
there were many barriers to the project achieving its objectives.
Rationale for Bank assistance: The project supported the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)1
objective of improving national preparedness for natural disasters. The CAS stated that the HRMEP
would assist in Romania's efforts to mitigate the costs of damage from earthquakes, floods, toxic
waste, and other natural and man-made disasters which, taken together, regularly plague the country.
Global operational strategy/Program objective addressed by the project: The GEF-supported
component was fully consistent with the GEF's Operational Strategy. It supported long-term
protection of international waters and complied with the long-term objective of "Water Body Based
Operational Program" (Operational Program No. 8), which is to "undertake a series of projects that
involve helping groups of countries to work collaboratively with the support of implementing
agencies in achieving changes in sectoral policies and activities so that trans-boundary
environmental concerns degrading specific water bodies can be resolved."
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The overall objective of the project was to assist the Government of Romania in reducing the
country’s environmental, social, and economic vulnerability to natural disasters and catastrophic
pollutant spills resulting from mining accidents. The project aimed specifically to: (a) strengthen
institutional and technical capacity for disaster management and emergency response by upgrading
communication and information systems; (b) implement specific risk reduction investments for
floods, landslides, and earthquakes; (c) improve the safety of selected water-retention dams; and
(d) pilot improvements in the management and safety of tailings dams and waste dump facilities.
1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project’s global environmental objective was to demonstrate the reduction of catastrophic
accidental spills of trans-boundary pollution loads from mine operations flowing into the Danube
and Black Sea basins.
Key indicators were:
•       Strengthened institutional and technical capacity for emergency management and emergency
        response through upgrading of communication and information systems.
•       Increased earthquake risk mitigation and retrofitting in priority public facilities.
•       Increased level of flood protection, with some high-priority investments implemented.
•       Improved dam safety in priority structures.
•       Gradual reduction in number and negative impacts of accidental spills of mining pollutants into
        the Tisza Basin and in the volume of toxic releases from mines.

The PDO was not revised. However, the following indicator was added at project restructuring.
•     Enhanced Borrower capacity to undertake land acquisition with positive net benefits to
      affected persons.
In addition, the targets for some indicators were revised at restructuring.
1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The GEO was not revised.
1.6 Main Beneficiaries
The expected beneficiaries of the project included:
• Government. Significant public benefits expected to be derived from the project included: (a)
strengthened government capacity to respond rapidly in the face of disaster; (b) increased
earthquake preparedness, with critical public facilities retrofitted; (c) reduction of water pollution
risk from mining operations; (d) improved dam safety in the selected priority structures; (e)
development of policy and technical foundations for a national insurance plan, which would shift
the financial burden of reconstruction from individual families and the government to international
re-insurers, capital markets, and the future insurance pool.
• Romanian population. The population expected to benefit from reduced risk of loss of life and
property included: (a) those living along the seismic Vrancea subduction zone, notably
Bucharest's 2 million inhabitants, through increased earthquake preparedness; (b) people living
in communities vulnerable to the risk of floods and landslides, through upgraded flood
protection infrastructure and better mapping of landslide risk areas; (c) people living in areas
adjacent to unsafe large and small dams; and (d) people living in proximity to operating and closed
mines, particularly in Tisza basin, through reduced risk of accidental spills.
• Local insurance industry. The possible creation of an insurance pool was expected to benefit
the local insurance industry by establishing best practices in underwriting property risks.
1.7 Original Components (as approved)
The project consisted of five components as follows:
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
The objective of Component A was to enhance the capacity of the Romanian authorities to better
prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural or man-made disasters, through modernization
of information technology and communications systems; increased planning and training efforts at
all levels of government; increased public awareness and preparedness; and complete technical
feasibility work and creation of an institutional framework for launching the Romanian
Catastrophe Insurance Program.
Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction
The objective of Component B was to assist the Government in reducing the seismic vulnerability of
priority technical and social infrastructure, through the retrofitting of key structures and
strengthening of relevant institutions.
Component C: Flood and Landslide Risk Reduction

                                                   3
The objective of Component C was to reduce flood risk and vulnerability in critical areas in
Romania; improve safety of large and small dams to enable them to function as designed; and map
and model the risk of landslides in order to reduce losses and provide for better land use planning
tools.
Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
The development objective of this component was to reduce the risk of water and soil
contamination and loss of human and aquatic life from catastrophic accidental spills of mining
pollutants. The global environmental objective was to demonstrate the methods for reduction of
catastrophic accidental spills of trans-boundary pollution loads from mine operations flowing into
the Danube and Black Sea basins, and provide for the replication thereof. In support of both these
objectives, the project was to assist in the implementation of mitigation and hazard prevention
replicable activities.
Component E: Project Management
The objective of Component E was to finance the costs of creation and maintenance of the Project
Management Units (PMUs) to be established in the ministries responsible for project components:
Ministry of Administration and Interior (Component A), Ministry of Regional Development and
Tourism (Component B), Ministry of Environment and Forests (Component C), and National
Agency for Mineral resources (Component D).
1.8 Revised Components
The components were not revised.
1.9 Other significant changes
Project Restructuring. The project was restructured three times during implementation:
First restructuring: The project was first restructured in August 2010 2 (Level 1), primarily to:
(a) Apply World Bank Safeguard Policy OP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement, to all project
components involving execution of works. During appraisal, OP 4.12 had not been triggered due
to Borrower confirmation that all project sites were on State–owned land, and no land acquisition
would be required. However, during project implementation, some land acquisition was required.
(b) Reduce the scope of envisaged project investments due to increased construction costs and
loan currency depreciation.
(c) Restructure output indicators for Components B and C to adjust them to the revised scope of
the investment program; and revise the Results Framework. Changes to project components
included:
    •   Component A: Financing implementation of a modernized management information
        system to integrate data management and voice communication.
    •   Component B: Reducing the number of high-priority public facilities to be retrofitted
        from 84 to 40 buildings.


2
 The first project restructuring was done only in August 2010 because of the slow preparation and approval of the
Land Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF) by the GOR, a condition for confirming compliance with OP 4.12.
The Bank was also slow in deciding the course of action once the land acquisition issue arose.

                                                        4
   •   Component C: Reducing the number of: (i) flood mitigation schemes on internal rivers
       from nine to eight; (ii) Danube River flood protection sites for rehabilitation from three to
       two sites; (iii) large dams to be rehabilitated from eight to four and small dams from five
       to three.
   •   Component D: Works for increasing the safety of two additional high-risk sites would be
       executed using savings from efficient contract management.
(d) Extend the project closing date from December 31, 2009 to December 20, 2011, to enable the
Government to complete all project activities.
Second restructuring: The project was restructured (Level 2) again in December 2010 to
reallocate part of the Loan proceeds, to allow for completion of activities under Components B
and C; and reallocation of a part of GEF Grant proceeds to allow for better use of funds for
ongoing and future contracts for goods and services under Component D.
Third restructuring was undertaken in December 2011, primarily to:
(a) Increase the percentage of Loan and GEF Grant financing to 100 percent for all categories of
expenditure.
(b) Reallocate the Loan proceeds as follows: US$3,085,000 from category (1)(a) to category
(1)(b); US$300,000 from category (1)(c) to category (2)(d); and US$34,000 from category (1)(a)
to category (4)(d)(ii).
(c) Cancel an amount of US$6,675,537 from the Loan, in response to Borrower’s request.
(d) Extend the current closing date for both the Loan and GEF Grant by six months, from
December 20, 2011 to June 30, 2012, in response to Borrower’s request to allow for completion
of all ongoing project activities.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project Design and Quality at Entry. The project did not create new institutions, but rather
supported existing government entities by setting up PMUs inside existing institutions which: (a)
drew on prevailing institutional capacities; and (b) provided technical assistance, training, and
consulting services to enhance the institutions’ technical capabilities for implementation. The
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) were prepared for Components B, C and D. For
Component B (Earthquake Risk Reduction), a pool of existing public buildings that met agreed
criteria was established during project preparation. A number of alternatives were considered
while designing the project.
The project design had the following drawbacks:
   •   Project design was overly ambitious. Having different types of hazards such as
       earthquakes, flood, landslides, and mining spills under one project added complexity and
       caused project funds to be spread too thinly.
   •   The implementation structure was complex, involving multiple institutions.
   •   With regard to earthquake risk reduction, the PAD referred only to structural retrofitting
       of buildings, but did not mention subsequent restoration of functionality and


                                                5
        modernization, which was left to the beneficiaries. This was a major deficiency in the
        design and affected the implementation pace and duration.
    • Financing by beneficiaries for restoration of functionality and modernization came into
       effect only after the project became effective. The Bank did not have control over
       beneficiary financing, as this parallel financing was not within project control. In
       hindsight, it would have been preferable for the Bank to finance all aspects, including
        retrofitting, functionality, and modernization, even though that would have meant
        covering fewer buildings.
    • Investment costs were significantly underestimated, which led to the selection of too
        many sites and activities.
Soundness of background analysis. As part of project preparation, sector issues were analyzed
in depth and Government strategies to address them were considered.
Lessons of earlier operations taken into account. The project introduced hazard risk
management instruments as the main project activity. In the past, the Bank operations were mostly
designed to respond to disasters, with the main objective being to contribute to reconstruction and
recovery efforts. The Bank's experience with post-disaster assistance worldwide had shown the
need for a more pro-active approach, and the importance of mitigation activities aimed at reducing
the impact of future disasters, including on state budgets.
Risk assessment. The overall risk of the project was rated Moderate in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD). The PAD had identified several potential risks to effective implementation
and put in place mitigation measures deemed appropriate at the time.
Adequacy of participatory processes. Many of the flood mitigation investments included in the
project were developed over several years and in most of the cases, public meetings and consultations
about the project scope and activities were carried out before Bank project formal preparation. The
meetings were attended by local authorities, engineers, planners, representatives of the National
Water Authority, the national land reclamation company (SNIF), various ministries, utility
companies, and the people who would be directly affected by the investments. For the other project
components, there was a series of meetings with key institutional stakeholders, including the
central and local offices of relevant ministries.
Adequacy of Government commitment.                    At project preparation, the Government’s
commitment to the project was exemplified by the process of prioritization and selection of
investments to be supported by the loan. Government institutions invested their own limited
resources in preparation of feasibility studies, designs, and other documents, such as
environmental management plans and social assessments, to prepare the project. These institutions
had previously made substantial progress toward setting up an institutional framework for coping
with disasters, consisting of central, sectoral, and local commissions with a mandate to coordinate
responses to emergencies.
2.2 Implementation
The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) in November 2007. Based on the
recommendations of the MTR, measures were taken to improve implementation performance.
The following factors affected project implementation:



                                                 6
•   Romania’s accession to European Union (EU). In 2007, in the middle of the project,
    Romania became a member of the EU. Under Component B, because regulations were
    changed to harmonize them with EU guidelines and norms such as such as sanitary law,
    education law, environmental process, and regulation for construction materials, some
    works had to be put on hold and realigned with the EU guidelines. This delayed works by
    about six months, as the redesign of retrofitting and functionality of buildings was a time-
    consuming and laborious process.
•   Financial crisis. Many project activities were severely impacted by the financial crisis in
    Europe in 2009, and the resulting fallout on the domestic budget situation. The financial
    crisis led to severe shortfalls in the Government’s contributions/releases to the project
    budget. For example, under Component B, the funds allocated by the Government in
    2010 and 2011 did not allow even for completion of all ongoing works contracts, with
    three critical buildings remaining unfinished.
•   Political instability. During the eight years of the project, the Government changed seven
    times, the prime minister changed five times, and the heads of relevant ministries also
    changed several times. Every time the Government changed, the new ministers and
    deputies (state secretaries) took time to learn the project details which created several
    months of uncertainty each time, and brought implementation almost to a standstill. In
    addition, even under the same Government, some PMUs were shifted to different
    ministries.
•   Depreciation of the Loan currency (US$) against the Euro and RON between Board
    approval and the onset of the financial crisis resulted in a loss of funds. In 2008, project
    funds decreased by about 35 percent (from 3.25 RON/US$ at appraisal to 2.40
    US$/RON) due to depreciation of US dollar. Since then, the dollar has gradually
    strengthened and is once again at the value at project appraisal.
•   Cost of labor and construction materials. Following EU accession, prices for labor and
    construction materials in Romania rose by 23 percent; and international oil prices caused
    fuel prices to rise by 20 percent. This reduced the availability of project funds and in
    particular affected components B and C.
•   Emergency Management Information System (EMIS). Implementation was affected by
    delayed decisions on the technical features of the system, and by the lack of adequate
    technical staff in the PMU.
•   Seismic risk reduction. Because the project design was silent about responsibility for
    restoring the functionality of each building after the seismic retrofitting, and for
    corresponding costs, this responsibility fell to the respective beneficiaries, from their own
    funds (or what they were able to mobilize from the state or local budget). This situation
    made it difficult for the PMU to manage contracts with multiple funding sources. Further,
    with the project funding covering, on average, only 41 percent of total costs, the balance
    of 59 percent remained the financing responsibility of the beneficiaries, a burden that not
    all of them could sustain; thus some of the buildings could not be fully completed (e.g.,
    Prefecture Calarasi, University of Music Bucharest) by project closing.
•   New Building Code. The project aimed to introduce innovative and cost-effective
    methods for seismic retrofitting in Romania through: (a) review of the Building Code for
    both new construction and retrofitting of existing buildings; and (b) pilot implementation

                                             7
       of new retrofitting methods. While the new Building Code was successfully harmonized
       with EU practice, the implementation of new methods for seismic retrofitting failed
       because of delays in design preparation and the MDRT-PMU’s late decision to address the
       causes of these delays.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. Outcome/impact and output indicators for the PDO and GEO were developed to
monitor the progress of each component. The targets were clear and appropriate. However, one
indicator that should have been included was the number of people who would be protected as a
result of project activities, in the event of an earthquake or flooding. All four PMUs used
adequate data collection methods. During the first restructuring in August 2010, output targets
were revised due to the downsizing of the project.
M&E implementation. The PMUs were regularly collecting data according to the indicators
developed during project preparation, as well as revised indicators developed at first
restructuring. These data were closely monitored and the actual figures were compared with the
target values. For example, under components B and C, monthly verification was done on works
to be paid, certifying the quantity of works completed and the status of implementation.
M&E utilization. Appropriate data collected by the PMUs was evaluated and used for decision
making on certain activities. For example, under Component B, technical data were used to
identify and resolve site problems. Under Component C, data on population and technical status
of dams were used to select dams in need of priority attention. Data were also used to identify
flood prone areas in need of attention. Under Component D, data were used for reassessment of
priority sites and selection of new sites. M&E data were also used to determine reallocations of
project funds and cancellation of contracts.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard issues. At the start of the project, the following safeguard policies were triggered and
provisions were made to ensure compliance.
Environmental
   •   Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). In accordance with the requirements for Category B
       projects, an environmental assessment was conducted by the Borrower and reviewed by the
       Bank. The Loan and GEF Grant agreements included covenants calling for implementation
       of the Borrower’s Environmental Management Plans under components B, C, and D.
   •   Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). Under Component B, some of the facilities identified for
       seismic retrofitting were classified by the Romanian authorities as historical monuments. The
       project assisted the GOR in the preservation of these cultural heritage structures, which
       also had essential public functions (e.g., city halls, universities).
   •   Projects in International Waters (OP 7.50). The project supported improvements to flood
       protection schemes in Romania, some of which are located on international waterways. The
       Bank's safeguard policy concerning Projects on International Waterways O.P. 7.50 therefore
       applied.
   •   Safety of Dams (OP 4.37). At project start, Romania had a well-defined system for dam
       safety, with the National Dam Safety Commission (CONSIB) serving as the consulting

                                                8
         arm of the Government. The project relied on a panel of highly skilled experts during all
         dam design and construction activities to ensure that all dam safety requirements were
         met. The project was implemented in compliance with all applicable environmental
         safeguards.
Social
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). As mentioned in Section 1.9, since some land acquisition
was found to be required, this Safeguard Policy was triggered during implementation, and
Component C was brought into full compliance with the Land Acquisition Policy Framework
(LAPF) and Action Plan developed in 2010, during project implementation. No other social
issues arose.
Fiduciary issues
There were no significant deviations from or waivers to the Bank’s fiduciary policies and
procedures during implementation of the project.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
 Transition arrangements. Transition arrangements for continuing the operation appear to be
adequate, as demonstrated by the following measures:
   •     EMIS. The Ministry of Administration and Interior will be transferring the software models
         developed under the project to the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations (IGSU),
         the PAID (National Catastrophe Insurance Pool) and the Commission for Insurance
         Supervision (CSA). In the case of the PAID, the transfer needs to be regulated through a
         legislation, since it involves the transfer of a good paid from public funds (project funds) to
         a private entity (PAID has the statute of a private insurance company). These agencies have
         staff adequately trained to operate the software.
   •     Seismic risk reduction. Each beneficiary has signed a protocol with the Government, under
         which the beneficiary is responsible for maintaining the functionality of the building or
         facility after project closure.
   •     Flood. All maintenance will be done by river basin authorities, which belong to the
         National Administration Romanian Waters (ANAR), a self-financing Government agency.
         After becoming an EU member, Romania implemented a revised water framework for cost
         recovery and to cover all expenses, including flood defense.
   •     Tailing dams. CONVERSMIN (state-owned company) has taken over the sites remediated
         under the project and assumed responsibility for long-term monitoring and maintenance.
         CONVERSMIN will be using the TMF inventory and risk rankings produced under the
         project to prioritize interventions and develop a long-term remediation program. It has
         adequate resources and experienced staff, recruited from the mines that have closed.
Follow-on project. No follow-on project is currently envisioned. Various ministries have expressed
interest in having a follow-on project to carry on with the activities conducted under HRMEP.
However, they have not pursued this with the MOF.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation


                                                  9
The PDO was clear, relevant, and important to Romania’s economic and social development. It
was also appropriate to the country’s current infrastructure needs, considering the high incidence
of flooding and large number of public buildings that were vulnerable to earthquakes, with
repeated requests from beneficiaries to retrofit and strengthen their buildings.
The GEO was and is still relevant for mitigating the risk of trans-boundary pollution at the Tiza
and Danube basins. The project set the framework and addressed high priority sites. This model
is now being replicated by CONVERSMIN in other sites. The project also set procedures for
environmental protection and the dumping of waste, which have taken up at the national level
and replicated in other projects.
As indicated in Section 2.1, the project design was overly ambitious, even after restructuring.
Addressing different types of hazards such as earthquakes, flood, landslides, and mine closings
under one project rendered the design too complex and spread project too thinly. In light of these
shortcomings, the project design has no relevance for future projects. Likewise, the
implementation structure was too complex, with multiple ministries and institutes involved in the
project implementation; therefore, implementation arrangements are not relevant for future
projects.
Rating: Considering these factors, the relevance of objectives, design, and implementation is
rated Moderate.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Moderately Satisfactory. As project scope was downsized and output indicators were revised
during the August 2010 restructuring, project outcomes have been assessed against achievements
before and after restructuring. To assist in arriving at an overall outcome rating, separate
outcome ratings have been weighted in proportion to the share of actual disbursements made in
the periods before and after the restructuring. Based on the two ratings, as shown in Table 2,
Annex 10, the overall achievement of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

          Project Outcomes before Restructuring

The following activities were implemented prior to the restructuring:
Component A. Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
•    EMIS was installed at six pilot sites.


                                                              11
•   Vrancea Earthquake Scenario. The technical capacity for disaster risk management was
    enhanced as a result of the project through the development of the Vrancea Earthquake
    Scenario, which has been used for: (i) risk modeling for Catastrophe Insurance; (ii)
    incorporation into the EMIS; (iii) ongoing and future training and education of emergency
    response professionals; (iv) earthquake response drills and exercises; and (v) ongoing
    development of the National Earthquake Preparedness and Response Plan.
•   The Catastrophe Insurance subcomponent achieved its original objective of assisting the
    Government with establishing the national catastrophe insurance scheme. It helped prepare
    the PAID legislation, supported regulatory norms, drafted risk management guidelines, and
    prepared an advanced earthquake and flood risk model. This consequently led to significant
    reinsurance cost savings for the PAID, and raised the level of public awareness of
    catastrophe risk insurance reflected in an increase of insurance penetration from 3 percent of
    households to 59 percent today.
•   Public awareness and education materials. The public awareness and education program
    increased the population preparedness for disaster risk management. The activity targeted
    school children, university students, public media, and the general population. The materials
    were used in several public awareness campaigns and disseminated in some counties with
    their own financing.
B. Seismic Risk Reduction
•   Works for seismic retrofitting of 22 public buildings hosting about 14,000 people were
    completed, and 18 of the buildings were returned to normal functionality.
•   The new Building Code became effective, including provisions for seismic retrofitting using
    innovative, cost-effective technologies.
C. Flood Protection and Improved Dam Safety
Flood protection works were completed in all 10 critical locations under the investment program.
Activities to enhance the safety of five dams (Maneciu, Varsolt, Berdu, Catmarasti, and Taria)
were completed, providing direct protection to more than 195,000 people, and indirect benefits to
an additional 250,000 people from services (water supply, irrigation) provided by the reservoirs.
The two remaining contracts were in progress.
D. Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
•   Since project implementation commenced, no major spills or accidents have occurred.
    Emission of contaminated mine water has been reduced. Replication under Government-led
    efforts considerably broadened the positive impacts.
•   Remediation works were completed at three high-risk sites, and procurement of works for
    two new sites was underway.
To arrive at the outcome rating before restructuring, separate outcome ratings were weighted in
proportion to the share of actual disbursements under each component (Annex 10, Table 1).
Rating: Based on these ratings, project’s outcome before restructuring is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.
       Project Outcomes after Restructuring

                                               12
The following outcomes had been achieved at the time of project closing:
Component A. Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
While the full potential of the EMIS has yet to be realized, its development process has
contributed to strengthening cooperation among relevant institutions, and is expected to improve
coordination in emergency situations. This, in turn, will improve disaster response and benefit
people living in hazard-prone areas.
Component B. Seismic Risk Reduction
The project assisted the Government in reducing seismic vulnerability of high- priority technical and
social infrastructure through institutional strengthening and retrofitting of 44 public buildings,
which will now provide safe shelter to about 24,000 people during earthquakes. Another 2.8 million
people who could be indirectly affected will also benefit.
Component C. Flood Protection and Improved Dam Safety
Flood protection in 10 vulnerable sites and increased safety of seven large and small dams are
expected to provide protection to about 266,000 people (68,000 households) at direct risk of
flooding; the outcome exceeded the estimate of 234,000 people protected by 14 percent. In addition,
94 km of national and 115 km of county roads have been protected, as well as many socio-cultural
buildings (schools, churches, kindergartens).
Component D. Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza River Basin
The project assisted the Government in piloting and replicating hazard prevention and
remediation activities by improving the management and safety of tailings dams and waste dumps
facilities, and catalyzing trans-boundary cooperation on integrated water resources management in
the Tisza River Basin. Remediation works at six sites have been completed, exceeding the initial
target of three; the quality of works and resulting post-closure condition of the mines has been
assessed to be high. The remediated sites have ceased to be a significant environmental risk, and
the emissions of contaminated dust, surface runoff, and groundwater infiltration have been
terminated.
Rating: Considering the above achievements, project outcome after restructuring is rated
Satisfactory.
Based on all the above achievements, efficacy is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
3.3 Efficiency
The efficiency outcomes of the four components are presented in this section.
Component A. Strengthening Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
The realization of benefits is dependent on the capacity of strengthened dams to withstand damage.
It was not possible to identify all scenarios that might arise, so an economic analysis was not attempted.
Component B. Seismic Risk Reduction
The benefits of capacity building under this component also could not be identified, so a full
economic analysis was not attempted.
Component C. Flood Protection and Improved Dam Safety

                                                   13
A full economic analysis was done for this component. The analysis related project costs to the
benefits from the economic value stream resulting from the project. Project costs for dam safety
and flood control were obtained from the implementing agency. Benefits were calculated as
losses avoided over the life of the constructed/retrofitted works and were estimated using a loss
probability function based on data collected from the project area. The detailed methodology for
estimating the benefits using loss probability functions is presented in Annex 3.
Actual cost at completion was as much as 28 percent higher than estimated at appraisal. The cost
of flood control infrastructure increased by 79 percent, while the cost of dam safety
improvements increased by only 12 percent. Project benefits derive from risk reduction to both
flood mitigation schemes and dam safety systems. Flood mitigation reduces the risk of flooding
and disrupted water supply and power production. Dam safety systems increase the life of the
dam, which benefits flood risk reduction, water supply maintenance, and incremental
hydropower production.
The overall evaluation found that the project provided significant benefits in spite of cost
increases. Total discounted project costs were US$103.9 million, while the discounted benefits
were US$345.1million, yielding a benefit/cost ratio of 4.3. This means that for every US$1 of
investment, US$4.30 in benefits are realized. The net present value of the whole project is
estimated at US$242.9 million. The internal rate of return (IRR) for flood control projects at
completion ranged from 25.5 percent for the Slanic sub-project to 11.2 percent for the Teleorman
sub-project, with an average of 19.4 percent. In the case of dam safety, the overall IRR was 22.4
percent, with a range of 28 to 14.5 percent. The results demonstrate that both the flood control
and the dam safety projects had healthy rates of return.
Component D. Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
The outcome of Component D is deemed to be efficient. For details see Annex 3.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
Based on the discussion in sections 3.1–3.3, the overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development
Poverty impacts
Following flood protection work, the price of agricultural and residential land in the project areas
has gone up. In addition, crop loss due to floods has been considerably reduced.
Gender aspects
N/A
Social development
•   The buildings rehabilitated and modernized under the project have created a feeling of safety
    and security, and an enhanced working environment. In the affected hospitals, a higher
    quality of service is being provided to patients due to more reliable power, sanitation, and
    sewerage.


                                                14
•   The project has particularly benefitted: (a) people living in communities vulnerable to the
    risk of floods and landslides through upgraded flood protection infrastructure and better
    mapping of landslide risk areas; and (b) people living in the areas adjacent to unsafe dams.
    For example, more than 43,500 people are protected against floods in 10 critical locations,
    and more than 222,700 people are protected by the seven improved dams. Further, the
    rehabilitated dams provide safe and reliable water supply and improved water management.
•   Remediation of tailing dams has contributed to reducing pollution and the risk of
    geotechnical failure that could harm the population living in nearby areas.
Institutional change/strengthening
The project had a substantial institutional development impact, as demonstrated by achievements
in following areas:
•   EMIS
•   National catastrophic insurance scheme
•   New Building Code, enabling the use of innovative methods for seismic retrofitting
•   Vrancea Earthquake scenario
•   Institutional capacity to manage and respond to floods and manage water resources
•   Institutional capacity to monitor the behavior of waste (including tailings) management
    facilities and respond in case of emergency
•   Remediation of tailing dams.
For details, see Section 3.2.
Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)
•   Land Acquisition Policy Framework. Under the project, the LAPF was developed in 2010 in
    response to the need to acquire private land for project activities. The purpose of the LAPF
    was to clarify land acquisition principles and organizational arrangements.
•   New materials such as geo-membranes and geo-composites were used for embankment of
    rivers, to provide for filtering and mechanical protection against erosion and stability. This
    new method is now widely used for all projects in Romania.
•   The project made contractors more responsible and gave beneficiaries more confidence in the
    quality of works, as site supervisors are more closely monitoring sites and keeping control of

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
PDO Rating: Moderate
•   EMIS. There is a clear interest on the part of General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations
    (IGSU) to maintain a fully functional EMIS system and upgrade it regularly. During the three
    year warranty period, all issues are expected to be resolved by the provider. It is, however,


                                               15
    important that the Ministry hire and retain adequate technical staff, at competitive salaries, to
    operate the system.
•   PAID. As established by Law 260/2008 and enacted by the Chamber of Deputies, PAID lost
    several important provisions contained in the original draft prepared under a Bank-supported
    technical assistance project. The main provisions dropped or modified dealt with the
    introduction of a small deductible and the establishment of actuarially sound premiums. In
    December 2010, Law 260/2008 was further amended to exempt Romanian homeowners who
    bought facultative catastrophe insurance from private insurers from the requirement to buy
    the same insurance from PAID. These three modifications to the original design have
    seriously undermined the financial viability of the program.
•   Seismic risk reduction. Operation and maintenance of the retrofitted buildings will be the
    responsibility of beneficiaries.
•   Flood and landslides risk reduction. The risk under this component is negligible to low, as
    all assets/works completed under the project have been transferred to the ANAR, which will
    be responsible for their operation and maintenance.
GEO Rating: Negligible to Low
Tailing dams. CONVERSMIN is well equipped and adequately financed, so the risk to
sustainability is very low. Funds will be allocated from the state budget for remediation of tailing
dams of all closed mines.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
 Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the
technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns. A number of alternatives were
considered for project design. The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and
budget to ensure quality preparation and appraisal. The project was consistent with the CAS and
Government priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a consistently good working
relationship with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal. To this extent, the Bank
performance was satisfactory.
On the other hand, as mentioned in Section 2.1, the project design had some major flaws, which
led to implementation difficulties. In light of these shortcomings, the overall quality at entry is
rated moderately unsatisfactory.
(b) Quality of supervision
Rating: Satisfactory.
The Bank's performance during implementation was satisfactory. Sufficient budget and staff
resources were allocated, and the project was intensively supervised and closely monitored. The
task team prepared regular aides-memoire, alerted the Government and the PMUs to problems
with project execution, and facilitated remedies in a timely manner, in conformity with Bank



                                                 16
procedures. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated project performance in
terms of both achievement of development objectives and project implementation.
The task team also monitored safeguards and fiduciary compliance. The Bank’s procurement and
financial management staff worked with the PMU staff to explain the rules and procedures to be
applied during project implementation. The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in
November 2007.
One important aspect of the Bank's performance was the continuity of the task team, including the
TTL and other key sector specialists, from project inception through completion. This continuity
engendered consistency, and provided expertise to help the Government resolve implementation
issues.
(c) Justification of rating for overall Bank performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
Based on Bank performance during lending phase and supervision, as discussed in Section 5.1,
overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government of Romania performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
As discussed in Section 2.1, at project preparation the Government had demonstrated its
commitment to the project. The Government performance during preparation is thus rated
Satisfactory.
During implementation, however, the Government’s commitment fluctuated with the change in
administrations, ministers, and deputy ministers. At times, the project was affected to a
significant extent by delays in the provision of timely and adequate counterpart funding. These
repeated temporary shortages of funding available to the project constituted one of the main
causes of implementation delays and thus the need for successive extensions of the closing date.
After Romania became a member of EU, with the EU becoming a major player and the Bank
being a junior player in the Government’s development agenda, the Government focused more
on EU-funded programs, and lost interest in Bank financing. Consequently, there was a lack of
attention to timely resolution of critical issues, which also delayed implementation.
In light of the above factors, Government performance during implementation is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Overall government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
(b) Implementing agency or agencies performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
Project management performance varied by component and was heavily influenced by the
stability, managerial skills, and dedication of the PMU staff. The management of Components B
and D performed better than other components, although high staff turnover occurred in all
teams. Unlike the other three components, implementation of Component A was affected by the
turnover of management, with three successive directors during project implementation.
Management of Component C was also deficient, particularly in the second half of project
                                               17
implementation, which delayed the decision making process, particularly with regard to pilot
activities on landslides.
Financial management. Overall, the FM performance of the implementing agencies was
moderately satisfactory throughout the project life. The PMU for Component A had adequate
FM capacity, but the other three PMUs were affected by significant FM staff turnover and, at
times, by lack of sufficient FM staff, so their overall FM capacity was lower. The PMUs were in
compliance with the project’s financial reports and auditing covenants, and generally delivered
their quarterly unaudited financial monitoring reports on time, except for small delays in a few
cases.
Procurement. The procurement rating varied by implementing agency. For example, the PMU
for Component D was highly satisfactory in its procurement performance. Under Component B,
the replacement for the initial procurement specialist had little understanding of Bank procedures,
which delayed procurement and project implementation. Under Component C, poor contract
management by the PMU, mainly due to lack of capacity, was among the main reasons for non-
completion of the Landslides Pilot Area Studies consultancy contract, and for not strictly
following the payment schedule under the contract for the supply of landslide monitoring
equipment.
Reporting arrangements. All four PMUs submitted all required quarterly and annual reports in a
timely manner. The status of performance indicators were incorporated in all progress reports
and served as valuable input to Bank supervision mission reports.
(c) Justification of rating for overall Borrower performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
In light of the Government and PMUs’ performance, as discussed in Section 5.2, the overall
performance of the Borrower was Moderately Satisfactory.
6. Lessons Learned
Project Design
In a project where many sectors and multiple ministries/agencies are involved in implementation,
the project design should be simple and focused on fewer activities.
Implementation
• It is important to establish the implementation team at the beginning of the project so that the
   implementation of project activities will be smoother. The PMU for Component C was
   established only after two years of implementation, which delayed progress on this
   component.
•   Assigning project implementation to a Government team exclusively dedicated to the task,
    working within the structure of the implementing agency, ideally from the advanced
    preparation stage, would be highly desirable, provided that the team is not affected by
    changes in Government. The team’s responsibilities should be clear, well defined and well
    known within the agency. Previous experience in managing investment programs should be a
    core requirement for selecting the team’s technical staff and managers.
•   The project benefitted from the continuity of the Bank task team from the beginning.
    Continuity of the task team, especially the TTL, engendered consistency, depth, and follow-
    up in the dialogue with the Government, and ensured the availability of expertise to support

                                               18
     the Government in analyzing issues and implementing actions as they arose during
     supervision. A similar level of continuity of project directors and PMU staff would have been
     an important factor for avoiding disruptions in implementation.
Procurement
• A good procurement plan should be in place from the start, and should be revised and
   updated annually, to reflect all changes in the project implementation schedule and address
   any shortcomings that become apparent.
•    As the Loan was denominated in US Dollars, it was exposed to significant foreign exchange
     fluctuation, particularly during the economic and financial crisis (2008-2009). Projects
     denominated in Euros did not suffer the same impact. Looking forward, loans to EU member
     countries might be better served if denominated in Euros. This was not common practice at
     the time the project was negotiated, but Euro-denominated loans may become more
     important in the future.
EMIS
Because of the complexity of the software and the limited capacity of the local provider, it would
have been preferable to adapt an off-the-shelf IT system to the needs of the EMIS than to
develop a unique system.
Seismic risk reduction
Multiple sources of funding for retrofitting, works, and modernization should be avoided so that
the Bank does not lose control over implementation. For example, when beneficiaries contribute
more than the Bank, as happened under Component B, they take it as their right to make changes
in design, which is dangerous in the case of structural seismic safety investments. It is essential
for the Bank to determine design criteria for functionality and modernization.
Tailing dams
It is advantageous to have a strong agency such as CONVERSMIN to complement the
Government during implementation, to ensure mutual support and cooperation. Such an agency
should continue after project closure and take responsibility for the closure of mines, remediation
of tailing dams, and post-monitoring of environmental factors.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A – Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing

The expected outcome of Component A was strengthened institutional and technical capacity for
emergency management and response functions, as well as strengthened disaster preparedness. The
activities leading to the achievement of this goal consisted of: (a) establishment of the Emergency
Management Information System (EMIS); (b) development of the Vrancea earthquake scenario; (c)
design of the public awareness and education program; and (d) preparation of the catastrophe insurance
program.
EMIS:
•   EMIS software has been developed, and operational acceptance was granted in October 2012. After
    the final acceptance, the system use will be expanded to all 48 sites simultaneously, including centers
    under the authority of the General Inspectorate of Emergency Situations (GIES), as well as other
    relevant agencies.
•   The training of trainers was conducted for 34 participants, representing all involved institutions.
The Vrancea earthquake scenario has been a very useful tool utilized for several purposes, including (i)
risk modeling for the Catastrophe Insurance; (ii) incorporation into the EMIS; (iii) ongoing and future
training and education of emergency response professionals; (iv) earthquake response drills and exercises,
such as the one carried out with all relevant institutions in 2008; (v) ongoing development of the National
Earthquake Preparedness and Response Plan.
Public awareness and education materials were developed with project assistance, and include programs
targeting school children of all ages, university students, public media, and the general population. The
materials were used in several campaigns and disseminated in some counties with their own financing.
Management of financial risk associated with natural disasters through insurance

    •   The project’s catastrophe insurance component was originally conceived as a specialized program
        of technical assistance to support the creation of a stand-alone mandatory national catastrophe
        risk insurance program that could provide affordable coverage for earthquakes and flood to
        millions of Romanian homeowners.
    •   The PAID was established by Law 260/2008, but upon its enactment by the Chamber of Deputies,
        it lost several important clauses contained in the original draft prepared under the Bank-supported
        technical assistance project. The main clauses that were either dropped at enactment or modified
        at a later stage were those dealing with the introduction of a small deductible and the
        establishment of actuarially sound premium rates. In December 2010, the Law was further
        amended to exempt those homeowners who bought catastrophe insurance coverage from a private
        insurer from the requirement to buy that coverage from PAID. Together, these three important
        modifications to the original design of the program, which were introduced through the political
        process, gravely undermined its financial viability, resulting in: (a) severely underpriced
        catastrophe insurance products; (b) insufficient premiums to enable the program to self-finance;
        and (c) unchecked cut-throat competition in the price of coverage by the private insurance market.
        While initially the number of policies sold by the pool increased steadily, since early 2011, it has
        been in precipitous decline.
    •   As a result of the December 2010 amendment to the PAID Law, out of 5 million property
        catastrophe insurance policies sold currently in the Romanian catastrophe insurance market, more

                                                     21
        than 90 percent are sold by private insurance companies in the form of an endorsement to the
        FLEXA (fire) policy. Unfortunately, due the lack of effective risk-based supervision, inherently
        political decision making process (due to its governance setup), and weak technical capacity of
        the CSA, the private market for catastrophe risk insurance products remains virtually unregulated.
        As a consequence, some private insurers engage in aggressive and unsustainable market practices,
        characterized by gross underpricing of catastrophe risk and inadequate risk management practices,
        which severely jeopardize their ability to pay claims in case of a severe catastrophe event. Based
        on Government data, the project team estimates that more than 3.5 million policies have been
        sold by insurers that are likely to face immediate insolvency if there is a major catastrophic event,
        leaving their policyholders with unpaid claims.

Component B – Earthquake Risk Reduction
Sub-component B.1 – Retrofitting of High-Priority Public Facilities and Those Hosting High- Priority
Public Services
Under this sub-component, structural works were financed by the project, and additional works, including
functionality, modernization, and rehabilitation of buildings were financed by the beneficiaries. Seismic
retrofitting brought 44 public buildings to a level to withstand a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Out of the
44 facilities selected for retrofitting:

    •   17 facilities (38 percent) are categorized as Emergency and Disaster Response Facilities, of
        which: (a) five are fire stations/command stations; (b) eight are disaster control and response
        centers; (c) two are structures ensuring public order; and (d) two are rescue centers.
    •   14 facilities (32 percent) are categorized as Emergency Health Facilities (emergency hospitals).
    •   10 facilities (23 percent) are categorized as Educational Facilities, of which: (a) seven are higher
        education facilities; and (b) three are child protection centers.
    •   3 facilities (7 percent) are categorized as Essential Public Buildings (facilities essential for the
        administrative functioning of communities at risk after disaster).
Sub-component B.2 – Design and Supervision
   • Twenty buildings were subject to technical review of existing designs.
    •   Seven technical surveys were prepared by registered technical surveyor engineers under

Dam Safety Panel. Subcomponents C3 and C4 were supported by a Dam Safety Panel appointed by the
Ministry of Environment and Water Management (MEWM) and accepted by the Bank. The Panel
comprised a group of experts to ensure that works adhered to dam safety assurance objectives under
related legislation, regulations, standards, and criteria.
Environmental Advisory Group. The construction activities supported by Component C (subcomponents
C1, C2, C3 and C4) were guided by an environmental advisory group in addition to the local environment
supervisor who implemented the Environmental Management Plan.
Sub-component C.5 – Landslide Pilot Area Studies and Development of Standardized Monitoring
Manuals
Pilot Landslide Monitoring. The activity was designed for two pilot areas for which GIS maps were
developed, including information on morphology, hydrogeology, land use, soil type, and soil strength. It
allowed collection of data for model refinement.
Development of Models to Predict Landslides. Based on the data collected, the landslide risk forecasting
models were developed and tested under different conditions of soil, land slopes, land cover, and rainfall.
Field monitoring equipment was installed in two pilot locations (Sinaia and Sacele) with different
geological and morphological conditions, and data collection started before project closing. A National
Center for Landslide Monitoring was set up at the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and two local
monitoring centers were established. IT monitoring equipment was also procured and installed at the three
monitoring centers.
Development of Manual for Monitoring Landslides in Critical Areas, and Development of Emergency
Preparedness Systems. A draft Manual for Monitoring was developed based on local data collected,
describing the requirements for monitoring the critical landslide areas. However, the training program for
local operators was not implemented, and the final version of the Monitoring Manual remained to be
completed after the project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)
    1. Introduction and background
This section presents the economic analysis of the flood control and dam safety projects implemented.
The analysis is based on the actual costs and the expected benefits from the investment based on
probabilistic estimates of the benefits. The results, the Net Present Values (NPV), Benefit cost ratio
(B/C), and the Internal Rates of Return (IRR) are presented and are compared to the ex-ante estimates
arrived at the time of project development and presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD).
    2. Methodology
Separate methodologies were followed for the dam safety projects and the flood mitigation projects and
are presented below:
2.1 Dam safety projects
The project feasibility studies and the site visits to the project areas show that in the absence of dam repair
there is a high probability of dam failure in the near foreseeable future. In the absence of repair, even if
the remaining life span cannot be clearly assessed, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of a
failure in the structures of the dam is increased due to a major flood event. Hence, the assumption is that
investment in dam safely provides benefit in the form of avoided damages and this is the basic premise in
the estimation of project benefits in this analysis. Thus it follows that:
•   Benefit (Option “Dam safety investment?) = Avoided Damage (Option “Dam safety investment?)
•   Avoided Damage (Option “Dam safety investment?) = Total Damage (Option “Do Nothing?) – Damage   (Option “Dam safety
    investment?)
The typical life of the dam without the project (do nothing option) is 25 years. As the time progresses the
probability of dam failure increases and the value of risk of damage increases and the loss of ability of
supplying water supply and hydropower diminishes. Hence the value of loss of function goes up, to $18
million in the case of Dridu dam. A typical dam safety/loss function is presented in Figure 1. If the dam is
strengthened the life of the functionality is increased to almost 50 years and the probability of loss of
functionality will increase as it gets closer to 50 years shown by the red line. Then the net difference of
the blue line and the yellow line in figure 1 is the project benefits.

                                                      27
The damages/benefits are calculated considering a probabilistic function representing failure of the dam,
under the present conditions and with the project investment through the life span of the dam. The benefit
streams/avoided damages are discounted over the project period to compute the present value of the
benefit streams. The following measures of project worth are computed and presented:
•   The Net Present Value (NPV), the present value of net benefits from stream of benefits and costs;
•   Discounted Benefits versus discounted costs;
•   The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), which is the discount rate at which project´s net present value
    equals zero’
•   The Benefit – Cost Ratio (B/C), as the profitability index; and
•   Benefits per unit of investments.
2.2.1 Flood Mitigation Projects
As in the case of dam safety projects, the benefits from flood mitigation/defense projects (dykes) were
computed at the damages avoided due to the project compared with total damages in the case of the do
nothing option. Thus the benefit from the flood mitigation project becomes:
• Benefit (“with flood mitigation investment?) = Avoided Damage (Option “with flood mitigation investment?)
• Avoided Damage (Option “flood mitigation investment?) = Total Damage (Option “Do Nothing?) – Damage (Option “with flood
    mitigation investment?)
“Damages? and “Avoided Damages? were calculated using “Loss/Probability – curves? as shown in the
following figures. The threshold value from which floods cause damages was estimated by the
responsible design group (damages = zero). Damages caused by a flooding with an infinitesimal rate of
return are calculated automatically in the models of the economic assessment (assets of “annual average
damages? for different options).

Overall Evaluation
Investment Cost Comparison
The actual costs were all revised to 2012 dollars based on inflation rates provided by the World
Bank which also agree with the IMF figures of inflation See Table 1. Overall cost of the flood
control increased 33%. The Dam safety sub project costs increased by 22% and overall cost
increased by 23%.

Comparison of Nominal ICR Costs with PAD Costs for the sub projects Implemented 3

The incremental costs when compared with the appraisal incremental costs show that costs have
considerably increased by as much as 28%.overall. The flood control infrastructure had increased
by 79% while the dam costs had increased by only 12%. The cost increase seemed to be less for
the dams compared to the PAD estimates because the elements for dam safety had been studied
more thoroughly and the costs are clearer to define. The cost increases in some of the flood
control scheme are much higher than the PAD and it can only be blamed on “Apele Romane? for
not working out these costs in detail during the appraisal especially for the Bank mission.
Despite this, the overall costs only increased by 30%.

Benefits and Net Benefits Values
Incremental Benefits Comparison

The benefits were estimated with the risk reduction for both flood mitigation schemes and for
dam safety system which reduce the risk of flooding, water supply and power production.
Benefits for dam safety projects will come from increased life of the dam and reservoir to
maintain the benefits of both flood risk reduction and also water supply maintenance and a small
amount of hydropower production. The computed benefits compared with the benefits computed
at appraisal are shown in Table 3.
The forecasted incremental economic benefits during the appraisal were converted to constant
2012 dollars using the inflation factors given by the World Bank for Romania. These factors are
similar to those used by the IMF. The discount rate used was also the same as at the appraisal of
12%. When incremental discounted benefits are compared using 2012 constant values the ICR
discounted benefits increased by 9.7%. The flood control benefits increased by 73% while the
dam safety benefits decreased by 1.9%. The flood control benefits increased substantially also
because of two new sub projects Slanic and Valsan and due to increased benefits. The benefits

                                               31
increased substantially 73.7% indicating that the flood control projects are showing significant
more benefits recently not due to the additional projects but because of the concentrated rainfalls
and flooding has been more pronounced due to global warming in many areas including the S.E.
European Countries. It should also be noted for investments of $111 million (see Table1) the
economic benefits are $345 million-this 300% of benefits for the flood control and dam safety.

Table4 shows a comparison was made for ICR values of all the discounted costs (incremental
investments plus O and M) and the discounted benefits and the net present values. The
investment costs were provided by the ICR Mission and the O & M costs were based on costs
provided estimated on the sub-project and it varied from 1.5% to 5% of the investment costs.
These were estimated in detailed during the appraisal (labor, materials, repair needs, etc) and
updated using the escalation figures for the ICR. The Benefit Cost ratio in the appraisal
compared with the ICR computed values are also shown in Table 4. It should be noted that the
total discounted costs (capital and O & M) are $103.9 million (see Table 4) while the discounted
benefits are $345.1million. The ratio of costs to benefits is about 1: 3.4 which means that for
every 1$ of investment we get $3.4 benefits. The net present value of the whole project is
estimated at $242.9 million dollars.

The benefits cost ratio declined from 6.1 to 4.3. There seem to be so many variations in the
individual sub-projects that it is difficult to predict why this decline occurred. The Appraisal B/C
ratios seem to be more erratic than the ICR figures which seem to be consistent. A B/C ratio of
1.9 for flood control and that for dam safety of 4.3 is very consistent with B/C worked out
internationally. Flood control generally has fewer benefits due to flood risk reduction compared
to the investments.
Comparison of Economic Rate of Returns
Detailed computations were worked out and an appraisal comparison is shown in table 5. Overall
the IRR decreases by 31.7% from Appraised values to the ICR values for the flood control while
the dam safety values drop 15.3%. A detailed evaluation of why the IRR values changed is given
in Table 6. Most of the declines are due to cost increases but sometimes there are declines in
benefits.
The ICR rate of return for the flood control projects averaged about 19.4% is a very good rate of
return. The overall rate of return declined from 28.4% at appraisal to 19.4%. The highest IRR
was 25.5% for Slanic subproject and lowest was for Teleormann subproject of 11.2%.
For the dam safety the overall IRR was 22.4% and it declined from the appraised value of 26.5%
and the decline was a 15.4%. This decline is less because the benefits are for not only flood
control, water supply and for a small hydropower component and are more stable. These benefits
are also easier to assess throughout the project implementation period. Again the IRR of 22.4%
is a very healthy rate of return for this component

Economic Unit benefits for Investments
The investments for flood control and dam safety can often be valued by examining the net
returns for every dollar invested. The net returns for each dollar invested is shown in table 7 and
are 3.32 for the ICR estimate and 6.06 for the Appraised estimate. Appraisal values seem to be
overestimated. The flood control projects have unit benefit estimates from $3.25 down to $1.14
for every dollar invested. The returns depend very much of how much earlier investments have
been done previously so that new projects now cannot get as much returns. These figures are
similar to figures worked out for China and many South Asian Countries where flood are very
prevalent.

For dam safety the unit benefits are much higher from a low of $1.66 to $5.92 per unit of
investment. These values are more realistic than the appraisal values.

Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
The budget for Component D of about $12.50 million was utilized for three different broad
categories: (i) construction works and goods; (ii) consulting services fir analyses, designs and
advice; and (iii) project administration. Even if only considering only the results of one sub-
component, D2, that deals with direct, linear risk reduction for seven TMF with a tailings volume
of approximately 50 Mill m3, the utilization efficiency of the investment is considerable:
Conservatively a failure risk of 1 % per un-remediated facility and year may be assumed,
meaning that there would be one major accident every 100 years on every facility. For seven
facilities the individual risks would be added to a total of 7%, or 7 accidents per 100 years.
Experience from the TMF failures at Aurul TMF (Baia Mare Mine) and Novat TMF (Baia Borsa
Mine) suggests that – under very conservative assumptions – about 50,000 m3 of contaminated
waters, and 10,000 m3 of contaminated tailings may be expected to be released per given
accident. The actual numbers for the above quoted accidents were twice as high. This would thus
amount to a total of 350,000 m3 of contaminated waters, and 70,000 m3 of toxic tailings released
into the environment over a period of 100 years, from the sites remediated by the project.
The environmental and socio-economic cost of such accidents is hard to estimate, but data from
the Baia Borsa Accident suggest, that the direct economic damage on fisheries, tourism, drinking
water as well as the required immediate repair remediation cost were in an order of magnitude of
about 10-20 Million USD. The long term impact on biodiversity, fish stocks, drinking water
resources, agricultural land may easily double this amount. Using only the numbers for
immediate damage the total for a 100 year period would be 70-140 Mill USD, or between 0.7
and 1.4 Mill USD per year. Thus, looking at it from this angle the amortization of the investment
for Component D (12.50 Million USD) would take between 9 and 18 years only.
An additional, yet harder to quantify impact on risk reduction will be caused by the insights and
information gained under sub-component D1. (Establishment of a Baseline and an
Environmental Monitoring System), as well as the more strategic activities and interventions
carried out under D.3 (Engineering and Environmental Guidelines for Tailings Dams and Waste
Facilities), D.4 (Regional Mine Spill Disaster Response System) and D.5 (Promoting
Transboundary Cooperation). The improved capabilities for monitoring, analysis, risk
assessment, emergency planning, early warning, communication and the cooperation between
national emergency response units will have a long term and far-reaching positive impact, that
will reduce risks significantly beyond the direct interventions under sub-component D2.
Of the project cost about $1.35 million was used for project management, which is only 10.8%
of the project budget, and can be considered remarkably low.
Overall Economic Evaluation and Conclusions
Overall evaluation is the project implemented has maintained its benefits despite cost increases
and has a healthy rate of return of 19.4% for flood component and 22.4% for the dam safety
components; benefits cost ratio of 4.3 for the whole project; and the benefit are $3.32 for every
dollar invested. Hence the project has achieved all the targets required and reduced the risks due
to flooding and dam safety by about $345 million. In addition the net present value of the project
is $242 million.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This Report is prepared for purposes of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in accordance with
World Bank procedures.
Romania is the first country in the ECA Region whose Government has requested the Bank`s assistance
in preparation of a comprehensive hazard risk management project on an ex-ante basis. Since the usual
pattern has been that the Bank is asked for support in the aftermath of disasters, Romania can be regarded
as a leader and a good example for other disaster-prone countries in the region, for adopting a strategic
and pro-active approach to reducing vulnerability to multiple natural hazards.
The project included four components, each addressing a specific risk falling under the authority or
responsibility of different public authorities, which were entrusted with the implementation of the specific
activities. In the following, the project achievements, risks, and lessons learned are presented together, for
the entire project.
1. PROJECT OUTCOME/ACHIEVEMENTS
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
This component had two main objectives:
A.1 Strengthened institutional and technical capacity for emergency management and emergency
response through upgrading communication and information systems
Achievements:
• The equipment, infrastructure, standard software, and custom software were procured and installed in
   48 emergency operations centres (EOCs), which improved their technical capacity for emergency
   management and emergency response. The EOCs were interconnected through an integrated
   management information system designed to improve decision makers’ ability to monitor and respond
   to emergencies in real time. The project also provided training of EOCs staff.
•   The communication management system will be partial assured by a voice communication system
    integrated with the informational management system (EMIS). It will initially be implemented in
    seven EOCs, with the possibility of expansion to the national level if funds become available to
    procure the necessary equipment. The existing software and licenses are already sufficient for a
    national system.
A.2 Reduce the government’s contingent liability due to natural disasters by transferring highly
concentrated catastrophe risk to the insurance industry.
Achievements:
•  Catastrophe financial risk transfer was realized through enactment of the Law on the Compulsory
   Insurance of Dwellings against Earthquakes, Landslides or Flooding.
•   Increasing awareness of the benefits of the mandatory insurance of dwellings against natural disasters.
•   During its first year, the Romanian Catastrophe Insurance Program (PAID) concluded 791,728
    mandatory policies, distributed as follows:

        Per type of the           482,151 mandatory policies for     309,577 mandatory policies
        building                  Type A                             for Type B
        Per type of region        485,158 mandatory policies in      306,570 mandatory policies in
                                  urban region                       rural region

Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction
                                                     49
The main objectives of this component were to assist the Government in reducing the vulnerability of
high-priority technical and social infrastructure, mitigating the costs of damage from earthquakes, and
preserving national cultural property. The investments in mitigation and emergency preparedness
measures will have positive long-term effects on central and local government budgets by reducing losses
and damage to public and private assets as result of the catastrophic events. These expenditures often are
not fully accounted for in the budget planning process and have had to be accommodated from other
categories in an ad hoc manner. The project also contributed to fiscal savings by reducing the costs of
reacting to disasters when they do occur.
These objectives were achieved through two main types of activities:
B.1 An investment program, which included:
• Preparation of designs for retrofitting and modernization of 34 buildings, and review of existing
    designs (prepared prior to project commencement) for 20 buildings.
•   Retrofitting of 44 public facilities to a level that allows them to withstand a 7.5 magnitude earthquake;
    this also allowed for modernization/rehabilitation of the facilities to ensure full functionality after the
    retrofitting works ended. Despite the cumbersome financing arrangements that made the
    implementation more difficult and challenging, the general rehabilitation (structural and functional) of
    the public facilities is considered a comprehensive and positive approach, leading to a positive
    outcome of the project and a high level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries highly
    appreciate the quality of working conditions and quality of services created after retrofitting and
    modernization/rehabilitation of the buildings.
•   Supervision of construction for 44 facilities, to assure compliance with the engineering designs.
B.2 Institutional strengthening
• Promoting innovative seismic strengthening methods (base isolation and energy dissipation dampers)
    which were used to designing the retrofitting works for the General Inspectorate for Emergency
    Situation, command unit, in Bucharest and the City Hall Iasi.
•   Preparation of the Energy Sector Risk Assessment Study for the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
    Business Environment.

•   Technical support for review of the new Building Code (P100/3), including provisions for seismic
    retrofitting of existing buildings using innovative, cost-effective technologies.
•   Preparation of a Handbook for “Professional training in innovative and cost-effective retrofitting
    methods? for MRDT’s on-going use in preparing training sessions on cost-effective and innovative
    retrofitting methods for Romanian experts.
Component C: Flood and Landslides Risk Reduction
The activities supported by this component were designed to reduce flood and landslide risks in the most
vulnerable rural and urban communities through construction of new flood protection infrastructure,
improved safety of large and small dams, and development of models to predict landslides based on
monitoring of critical natural factors. To achieve these objectives, two approaches were used:
C.1 Investment program for construction of new flood protection infrastructure and dam safety, which
included:
•   Flood protection infrastructure at 10 sites located along Danube and internal rivers, including
    construction or rehabilitation of concrete and gabion walls, small concrete waterfalls, bottom sills,
    dikes, culverts; as well as river bank protection and consolidation, and riverbed improvement. More
    than 43,500 people are now protected against floods in these locations.


                                                     50
•   Enhancing safety of large and small dams through construction of screens; sealing of dam body, its
    foundation, and the area between the screen and water discharge; construction or rehabilitation of
    drainage system; rehabilitation of spillway, stilling basin, and bottom outlet and its canal; grouting;
    sealing or drainage drilling of inspection galleries; rehabilitation of electrical and hydro-mechanical
    equipment; bottom sills and river banks rehabilitation downstream of the dam; rehabilitation or
    installation of monitoring and information system, including alarm and warning system; construction
    or rehabilitation of surveyor house/dam control building. Seven large dams and three small dams
    benefitted, and more than 222,700 people living downstream of these dams are now protected against
    the risk of dam failure.
C.2 Consultant studies for landslide monitoring and emergency response, including development of
mathematical models for landslide risk forecasting, procurement and installation of monitoring equipment
in two pilot locations, and development of a Manual for Landslides Monitoring and Emergency
Preparedness for use in pilot and possible additional locations.
Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
The main outputs expected from this component were hazard prevention and mitigation measures
implemented in the Tisza Basin, to reduce risk of accidental spills of mining pollutants. Emergency
preparedness and effective environmental monitoring capacity were established, and trans-boundary
collaboration on water resources management was strengthened. Specific achievements include:
D.1 Risk-based priority investment programs to reduce risk of mining accidental spills of pollutants in the
Tisza Basin, which included:
•   Preparation of a comprehensive inventory of tailing dams facilities and waste dumps facilities and
    risk assessments procedure, followed by high priority site risk classification and identification of the
    risk reduction measures for every critical site
•   Implementation of efficient and cost-effective hazard prevention and mitigation measures in six high
    risk tailings facilities in the Tisa Basin through preparation of detailed engineering designs and
    environmental monitoring system designs reviewed by a independent technical Panel of Experts in
    tailings dam safety, topographical surveys and geotechnical and geochemical site investigations,
    installation of monitoring equipment, execution of hazard prevention and remediation works,
    execution of water passive treatment systems, monitoring of the environmental factors (air, water,
    soil, stability, meteorological conditions, noise and vibrations) during the execution of works at 6
    tailing dam facilities and during warranty period and sites supervisions of executed works.
D2. Institutional strengthening for emergency preparedness and establishment of effective environmental
monitoring capacity, through:
•   Preparation of environmental monitoring system design in the Tisa Basin for mining related impacts
    on streams and aquatic ecosystems, air and soil
•   Procurement and installation of a fix and mobile laboratory for sample collection, preservation and
    preparation of chemical, physical - chemical and complex analyses of environmental factors
•   Development of a comprehensive mine specific information technology-based environmental
    monitoring and decision support system to facilitate the administration of the environmental
    procedures within the mining sector and ensure the storage and easy access to the environmental and
    mining technical information, capable of reporting ongoing environmental impacts, and able to
    detect and timely report emerging hazard conditions, in a form capable of supporting an effective
    emergency planning and response system
•   Development of 10 engineering and environmental guidelines for tailings and waste facilities to
    minimize environmental risks during operation, closure and post-closure in the mining sector

                                                    51
•   Development of Financial Guarantee Regulations for rehabilitation of the land affected by the
    mining operations
•   Development and implementation of the Regional Emergency Preparedness and Response System
    through development of Internal and External Emergency Response Plans, a code of practice,
    environmental assessment, development of the design and partial infrastructure for early warning and
    alarming systems and organizing an ecologic accident simulation exercise with trans-boundary
    cooperation
•   Providing various specific training programs, including study tours for almost 130 stakeholders and
    public authorities.
D3. Development of a regional policy of cooperation in the management of tailings and waste facilities in
the Tisza and Danube basins through:
•   Establishment of a Regional Task Force to review failure modes and effects analysis process and
    standards in connection with the high-risk spots identified for remedial actions
•   Promote dialogue of Romania experts and institutions on basin-wide cooperation with other riparian
    countries on the management and safety of tailing dams facilities in the Tisa and Danube basins
    through participation of around 20 Romanian specialist to various international
    conferences/workshops/seminars
2. FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
•   Because of the lack of necessary resources from the Loan and local contribution, and the lengthy
    process of amending the Loan Agreement, implementation of the AC-2 and AC-9 sub-components
    was delayed.
•   Opposition from the insurance industry caused delays in the process of approving the Law on the
    compulsory insurance against earthquakes, landslides, or flooding.
•   A factor that negatively affected the completion of EMIS was the poor collaboration among the
    contractor, the PMU, and the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations.
•   The PMU operated for a period of 2-3 years with fewer staff than required to maintain its functions
    effectively, as stipulated in the Loan Agreement, which led to lower performance.
Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction
Project preparation stage
• The project was insufficiently prepared in terms of not identifying or including rehabilitation and
   modernization works along with retrofitting works, as required by national legislation, in order to
   ensure the full functionality of the buildings after the completion of the retrofitting.
•   The project did not foresee the consequences of Romania’s accession to the European Union in 2007,
    involving substantial changes in norms/technical regulations for design and execution of the works, as
    well as increased construction costs.
Project implementation stage
• Depreciation of the Loan currency against the local currency (RON) by 35 percent during 2005-200
   led to a decreased value of most local contracts.
•   The complexity of the designs and their poor preparation led to a longer than anticipated review
    process and continual design modifications.


                                                   52
•   The long procurement process for consultant services and works contracts led to the low interest of
    capable local and international contractors in participating in tendering.
•   Lack of beneficiaries’ preparedness for project implementation (slow and bureaucratic process to
    allocate funds, lack of technical capacity, delays in handing over the sites) led to delays in
    investments and sometimes to cancellation of the procurement process by the PMU.
•   The project lacked adequate funding in 2009-2012, following the economic and financial crisis,
    resulting in implementation delays.

Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
During year 2006, the legal arrangements which were currently in place did not allow NAMR to use the
project funds to finance remediation works at the tailings facilities and waste dumps belonging to the
mines under the administration of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. This situation sprung from
the chance in the legal status of NAMR: at the project formulation NAMR was under the coordination of
Ministry of Economy and Commerce, and after one year it become under coordination of Prime Minister
Office and thus, the use of NAMR project funds would be in conflict with Law of Public Finance. NAMR
initiated an Emergency Ordinance for changing the Ratification Law of the Loan Agreement assigning
NAMR the right of special administration over the project sites in December 2007. The Government
restructuring from April 2007 caused a delay in Emergency Ordinance process of approval.
Another problem that slowed down Project implementation starting from year 2009 till 2012 was related
to the lack of available funds and timely supply of the necessary funds from the Government share, as
under the economic and financial crisis Government imposed limited funds allocation to the
implementing agencies.

3. TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUSTAINING PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
   AFTER CLOSURE

Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
•   The main beneficiary of EMIS will identify the financial resources to extend the standard software
    licenses after the warranty period, or to include those licenses in the Government agreement with
    Microsoft.
•   To ensure proper maintenance of the EMIS, the beneficiaries may contract outsourced maintenance
    services.
•   An amendment to the Law on compulsory catastrophe insurance has been sent to the Chamber of
    Deputies; the amendment would eliminate the exemption for individuals or legal entities with
    voluntary (optional) catastrophe insurance.

Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction
•   The complementary rehabilitation and modernization works contracted under the project and financed
    with beneficiaries’ funds will continue under MRDT management. For these works, protocols
    regarding the execution of the investment sub-projects have been signed between the MRDT, as
    special administrator of the facilities, and all respective beneficiaries, as co-financers.
•   The innovative seismic strengthening methods developed under the project are being used by the
    Romanian engineering society.
•   Experts of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Business Environment are fully committed to using
    the Energy Sector Risk Assessment Study developed under the Project.


                                                  53
•   The new Building Code (P100/3) for retrofitting of existing buildings is in force.
•   MRDT will use the Handbook for Professional Training in Innovative and Cost-effective Retrofitting
    Methods? in preparing training sessions on cost-effective and innovative retrofitting methods for
    Romanian experts.

Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
•   This goal was successfully achieved, and many project activities will be continued by Ministry of
    Economy, ANRM, CONVERSMIN, and local authorities.
•   As a result of the project, the Government, local authorities, and the public are now fully conscious of
    the benefits of reducing environmental risks in the mining sector.
•   The Government now has the capacity as well as the commitment to adhere to EU requirements
    regarding dam safety and emergency response to accidental pollutant spills.
•   Based on findings, leasson learned, good practice measures diseminated by the project, SC
    CONVERSMIN SA, a state-owened company overseen by the Ministry of Economy, has already
    finalized the rehabilitation works of 20 high risk TDFs, and works are in execution for another 25
    high-risk TDFs, with funds allocated from the State budget.
•   CONVERSMIN has taken over the sites remediated under the project and assumed responsibility for
    long-term their monitoring and maintenance.
•   CONVERSMIN established 3 Regional Monitoring Centers, in Bucovina, Baia Mare, and Deva with
    project funding. The Bucovina Center was equipped using Phare funding, and the Deva Center was
    equipped using project funding. In these centers, post-closure environmental monitoring of the mines
    will be continued for many years, in conformity with EU requirements.
•   An IT-based environmental monitoring and decision support system has been installed and is
    operational, and staff have been trained in its use, at each regional center and at CONVERSMIN
    headquarters.
•   The State budget will fund CONVERMIN’s expansion of the early warning and alarm system to all
    high-risk sites.
•   Training (accident simulation exercises) based on the project-funded External and Internal
    Emergency Response Plans has increased the capacity of local authorities to respond to emergency
    situations.

4. RISKS FOR SUSTAINABILITY
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
•   There is a risk that continuing financial constraints could lead to the emigration of personnel qualified
    to work with or manage the EMIS, resulting in insufficient capacity to maintain and further develop
    the system.
•   There is a risk of insufficient funds to renew annual licenses for the EMIS; the Government’s
    agreement with Microsoft ensures renewal for only a limited period.
•   Unless the exemption from compulsory insurance for individuals and legal entities is overturned,
    there is a risk that PAID will conclude fewer mandatory policies and face possible bankruptcy. An
    additional risk is that private insurance companies issuing voluntary policies may have insufficient
    resources to pay the large claims for catastrophic events.
Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction

                                                    54
•   There were insufficient beneficiary funds to finalize rehabilitation and modernization of the
    retrofitted buildings before the project ended.
•   The beneficiaries lacked the technical capacity to implement the project-specific activities.
•   Political instability (Government change) may adversely affect the pace of implementation of the
    remaining modernization works.

Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
•   The risk for sustainability is very low, as the main project achievements will be continued by
    SC Conversmin SA, a state owened company under coordination of Ministry of Economy,
    once the project is over
•   The Government, through the “Mining Strategy for years 2012 – 2035?, is committed to
    provide the necessary funding to improve safety of high risk tailings dams and waste dump
    facilities, to operate and maintain the monitoring system on the long-term, to prepare for
    preventing, responding and mitigating emergency situation

5. BANK PERFORMANCE
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
The Bank ensured quality at entry and supported implementation through appropriate supervision during
the project. Quality at entry and of supervision, averaging two supervisory missions per year, was rated
satisfactory. The Bank showed flexibility in administering and adapting the project design when
necessary.
Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction
The Bank’s performance during implementation was satisfactory. Sufficient budget and staff resources
were allocated, although as Component B became more complicated and difficult, more support would
have been helpful. The Bank team conducted two supervision missions per year and a mid-term review
mission.
Component C: Flood and Landslides Risk Reduction
The Bank’s performance during supervision was highly satisfactory. The involvement of all Bank
officials connected with the project had a positive effect on coordinating the work of PMU staff, relations
with relevant authorities, and solving implementation challenges. The PMUs had the support and
guidance of the Task Team Leader, Environmental Specialist (who advised on Bank safeguard
procedures), Lead Financial Sector Specialist, Financial Management Specialist, Operations Officer,
Procurement Analyst, and Financial Management Analyst.
Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
Supervision by the Bank was timely, frequent, and technically sound. Bank staff were very supportive of
PMU decisions, and provided timely technical advice, especially on risk reduction works for TDFs safety
and rehabilitation. There was excellent communication between the Task Team Leader for GEF financing,
the Task Team Leader for Loan financing, PMU staff, and NAMR management. There was also
excellent support from Bank’s Procurement Specialist, who reviewed and approved procurement
documents quickly, often in one day. A highly qualified Bank consultant, further GEF task manager,
provided valuable support during project implementation. During execution of the project, the Bank team
held regular meetings with stakeholders to keep them apprised of the project’s performance.

6. BORROWER’S PERFORMANCE

                                                    55
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
•   The Ministry of Public Finance ensured that funds were available and disbursements were made in a
    timely manner. The project did not suffer from counterpart funding problems. PMU personnel were
    deeply involved and dedicated to the project, determined to solve the problems that occurred in
    project implementation in order to be able to reach the project objectives. However, many PMU staff
    trained in Bank procedures left before the end of the project, and were replaced by others not familiar
    with Bank procedures. This resulted in poor collaboration between the Ministry’s legal specialists and
    the PMU, beneficiaries, and suppliers involved in EMIS implementation, leading to lower quality of
    and delays in implementation.
•   EMIS is nevertheless a unique and complex system created to collect, analyze, and share real-time
    data among emergency management agencies and key public officials at the national, regional, and
    local levels.
•   The project developed material for the education and public information sub-component and put in
    place a coherent budget for the program. The PMU transferred the copyrights for the material to the
    beneficiary.
Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction
The Borrower’s performance during the implementation of the project was rated satisfactory.
a) Government performance
•   The numerous changes in Government and subsequent numerous shifts in leadership of MRDT (7
    Ministers and 7 Secretaries of State) led to administrative, legal, and financial problems in
    implementation. With every change, the new officials needed time to become familiar with the
    project. This created discontinuities in decision-making processes and led to lack of cohesion in the
    strategy vision. One of the major consequences of this was reduced funding for implementation
    during the project’s final three years (2010-2012). Considering the increased difficulty of the
    Component B, more support would have been needed from the line ministry.
•   A Project Steering Committee was established to supervise project implementation and coordination
    among all project implementing agencies.
b) Implementing Agency Performance
The PMU in MRDT had good performance in terms of commitment and dedication, especially
considering the increased volume and complexity of activities (procurement, technical, financial,
management) carried out by PMU specialists following the decision to increase the beneficiaries’
complementary investments.
Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
•   The Government’s ownership and commitment were demonstrated by the creation of the high-level
    Project Steering Committee and the Project Management Unit (PMU) to support project
    implementation.
•   There were some delays in the availability of counterpart local funds beginning in 2009, which
    slowed down project implementation.
•   During implementation, the good relationship between the Ministry of Economy’s PMU and
    CONVERSMIN promoted synergies among related activities. Further, both the Ministry of Economy
    and CONVERSMIN strongly supported establishment of the Regional Monitoring Center and the IT
    Environment System to help ensure the sustainability of project outcomes.



                                                    56
•   Because of changes in national government, NAMR, which was responsible for Component D,
    suffered from numerous shifts in leadership (6 NAMR presidents), resulting in poor continuity and
    the need for extensive briefings for new senior officials. The last four NAMR presidents were
    strongly supportive. PMU staff were clearly engaged and committed to the developmental objectives
    of the project. During implementation, the PMU benefitted from the support of qualified Bank
    procurement and financial staff. The participation of PMU staff in training courses on the World
    Bank's standard procedures improved their professional skills. Good financial management was
    secured, following the audit reports. The cooperation with the World Bank specialists involved in
    project was very good.
•   PMU-NAMR prepared quarterly reports highlighting the project progress for monitoring and
    supervision.

7. LESSONS LEARNED
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity
•   It is necessary that at least one member of PMU is involved in project preparation.
•   It is necessary that the PMU is in place at the approval date and before starting the procurement
    process to allow time for training of PMU staff. Procurement should not start until six months after
    the PMU staff is complete.
•   The organizational chart of the PMU needs to be correlated with the institutions involved in or
    affected by project implementation.
•   The PMU staff should include a legal expert from the Ministry’s legal department, trained to work
    with World Bank procedures.
•   Consultancy contracts should provide for termination in the event that the consultant’s performance
    does not meet expected quality standards.
•   Direct access to a decision maker is very important for the PMU’s performance. For example, PMU
    MAI benefitted from the fact that the decision maker for the project, the State Secretary, was also the
    coordinator of the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situation and also vice president of the
    National Committee for Emergency Situations.
•   The project costs estimated at design stage have been exceeded during implementation because of
    unrealistic estimation made in the Feasibility Study, depreciation of Loan currency, delays in Project
    activities implementation;
•   Public education and information programs cannot be put into force without proper planning and
    budgeting. Further, such programs need to be tested on target groups and their feedback incorporated
    the programs are implemented.
Component B: Earthquake Risk Reduction
Project design
• More attention should be paid to technical aspects at the design phase, with a view to identifying and
   including all categories of works and their sources of financing.
• It is important to pay attention to national norms in the construction field.
• To envisage the norms and the legal framework at the Project design stage in order to be applicable
   during the project implementation.
Implementation:



                                                    57
•  It is necessary for the PMUs to have more decision-making authority so implementation is not
   dependent on a very slow and centralized decision-making process in the ministry;
• It is necessary to promote simultaneous investments for retrofitting and rehabilitation/modernization
   of buildings to ensure that they are fully functional.
Procurement:
• Consultancy contracts should require adherence to deadlines regarding timely delivery of services.
• It may be necessary to adjust the formula in works contracts as a result of increasing manual labor
   costs (e.g., after EU accession).
• It is important that procurement for different activities be carried out in the proper sequence.
• To shorten the procurement process, the World Bank’s no objection (NO) to procurement decisions
   should be allowed.
Financing:
Works contracts should include provision for 15 % in contingency costs.
Other lessons:
•   The PMU needs to have a strong, experienced manager familiar with Bank procedures to ensure
    achievement of project objectives on time and at the expected quality.
•   This type of hazard risk mitigation and emergency preparedness project should continue. The
    beneficiaries see it as a model project that could be scaled up, building on new hazard risk data, risk
    mitigation techniques, and other project outputs.

Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin
•   To ensure project success, commitment of the main stakeholders needs to be in place at all levels.
•   Maintain close coordination with the Implementation Support Committee (interested stakeholders) to
    ensure the quality and relevance of project deliverables and avoid any duplication of activities.
•   Rubinia Acacia, the trees planted on all sites remediated under the project, have a high rate of survival
    and growth, and can be used successfully at other remediation sites.
•   An understanding of international practices (best available techniques) for tailings dams/waste dumps
    development, operation, and closure on the part of designers, mine operators, contractors, and
    engineers is crucial for reducing the risk of mining accidents.
•   Component D project results can be replicated worldwide.
•   Continuity of the PMU staff responsible for project oversight, management, and implementation is a
    key factor in project success.
•   Including penalties in consultancy contracts is necessary to prevent delays in the delivery of services.
