                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation remained slow since last mission (November 2010) and many of previously agreed critical actions were only partially implemented mainly because of

                         insufficient funds allocated to the project in 2011, which limited progress on commitments and disbursements from Loan and GEF Grant, as well as launching tendering for new
                         contracts. The lack of funds affected particularly implementation of components B (Seismic Risk Reduction) and D (Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents). The Project Development
                         Objectives associated with flood and landslides risk, and reduction of risk of mining accidents would be fully met by project closing, while meeting the objectives associated with
                         strengthening the emergency management and risk financing capacity it at risk because of the delay in implementation of the Emergency Management Information System.
                         Unfortunately, the objectives associated with reduction of seismic risk would be only partially met.

                         Seismic retrofitting of 23 public buildings has been finalized while works are underway for 14 more buildings. Three new works contracts would be signed in early June and are likely
                         to be completed before the project closing (December 20, 2011). However, the current funds available for this project component are insufficient for completion of the ongoing works
                         contract for retrofitting the Bucharest City Hall Sector 1, which would remain to be finalized in 2012. It is, thus, expected that, at project closing and with the current funding, structural
                         retrofitting would be completed for 35 buildings, of which 32 fully functional, providing seismic protection to about 2.8 million people (of which 22,500 people under direct risk of lives).
                         However, the target of minimum 40 buildings retrofitted (of 48 buildings in the investment program), and about 3.8 million people protected (of which about 30,000 people at direct risk
                         of lives) would not be met.

                         Progress in development of the Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) under component A (Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity)
                         slowed down in the last six months because the critical system shortfalls have not been addressed by the Contractor. Therefore, the pilot operational testing and pre-commissioning
                         could not be completed and system the roll-out is now at risk of not being completed within project lifetime. Implementation of the Romanian Catastrophe Insurance Program (RCIP),
                         formally launched in July 2010, continued to attract more people to subscribe insurance policies against natural catastrophes. However, the system penetration remained lower than
                         expected (5% of total dwellings) mainly because the deadline for policies subscription was extended to July 2011.

                         All works for flood protection and for safety of five dams have been completed, while rehabilitation works for one dam are underway, as part of component C (Flood and Landslides
                         Risk Reduction). However, the activities regarding the landslides pilot studies are delayed, mainly with respect to contracting the supply and installation of the monitoring equipment;
                         for this, only very limited data collection during project time will be possible.

                         Under Component D smart design solutions and strong competition during the bidding process lead to substantial cost savings for the physical remediation of high risk pilot sites,
                         which were re-invested into expanding the number of rehabilitated sites. Despite meeting and exceeding the objectives of component D regarding increasing the safety of
                         infrastructure for safety of tailings management facilities, insufficient allocation of GEF funds will allow only the partial development of a mine-spill disaster response system and of a
                         mine-specific environmental monitoring system contributing to a lasting, sustainable project impact. A study to develop a financial guarantee mechanism for post-closure cleanup,
                         rehabilitation and maintenance activities for mining activities will be finalized before project closure and made available as a template for future legislation in Romania.

                         Although sufficient funds are available in the Loan and GEF Grant accounts, the limited time remaining until loan closing wILL not allow for contracting new, major activities under the

                         project, which would require cancellation of significant funds from the Loan and GEF Grant by project closing.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Additional funds of about $3 million should be allocated to component B at the upcoming budget rectification to allow completion of all ongoing works contracts before project closing.
                         In addition, sufficient funds should be released by the Government from the GEF Grant to finance the preparation of guidelines for environmental financial guarantees (environment
                         contingency funds) before project closing.

                         In absence of additional budget allocation, the Government (MInistry of Public Finance) would need to cancel the funds likely to remain unused, amounting to about US$ 16.5 million
                         from the Loan and US$ 1 million from the GEF Grant.
