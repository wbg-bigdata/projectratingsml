MENORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION.OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED LOAN3 TO INDIA
TO THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF INDIA AND TO THE
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA I.IMITED
FOR THE ELECTRONICS INXUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on proposed Bank loans
to India (US$8 million), Industrial Development Bank of India (US$101
million), and Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd.
(US$101 million) is submitted for approval. The proposed loans would be
for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate to help finance an electronics industry development
project. Cofinancing of US$16.2 million equivalent from the Swiss
Development Cooperation and US$2.7 million equivalent from the Japan Grant
Facility are expected as grants.
2.       Back&Lo-  .  India has the potential to develop a competitive
electronics industry based on its large pool of engineering and scientific
manpower and its potentially large domestic markets. Gross production of
electronics products grew at an annual average of 22% from 1980-87 and
reached Rs. 47.2 billion (US$3.7 billion) in 1987. The sector now accounts
for more than 5 of manufacturing value added, which is shared about
equally between the public sector, organized private sector and small scale
industry. Though some firms produce cost competitive products, and exports
(about 7% of production) are expanding, much of the industry is inefficient
and its products are usually of high cost and relatively low quality.
3.       The electronics industry's problems are rooted in past industrial
policies which until recently had restrained domestic competition,
discouraged technological updating, contributed to inappropriate scale and
fragmentation of capacity, prevented import competition and discouraged
exports. A priority industry, electronics has benefitted since 1981 from
sector-specific policy measures and since 1985 from both sector-specific
and general policy measures to improve its performance. They include
deregulation of capacity licensing, easing of restrictions on dominant and
foreign-owned firms, small-scale industry dereservations, elimination of
the public sector enterprise monopoly of telecommunication equipment,
reduction of quantitative restrictions and lowering of import tariff and
excise tax levels and reduction in barriers to foreign technology. These
measures have been complemented recently by liberalization in the financial
sector, especially in capital markets.
4.       These reforms have greatly increased domestic competition and
facilitated access to foreign technology and as a result domestic prices of
electronics projects have fallen sharply. This trend, together with
improvements in export administration and reductions in the real effective
exchange rate, have helped expand electronics exports. Investment,
especially from the private and joint sectors, has increased dramatically.
Import constraints are still significant, however, and industrial closure
is difficult. Other industry constraints ir lude lack of communications
infrastructure, undeveloped supporting servi_..es, inadequately trained
skilled manpower, inflexibility of financing and lack of risk capital.



-2-
5.       Rationale for fank Involvement. The Bank completed a sector
strategy report (India* Develozment of the Electronies Industrv - A Sector
=gg. No. 6781-IN) in mid-1987, which highlighted possible future
directions for the industry and proposed a set of needed policy reforms.
The proposed project would allow the Bank to continue to work with the
Government on further reforms in electronics and more generally the
industrial sector.  In this project, the Bank would support tie 001's
objective of developing an efficient electronics industry eventually
capable of internationally competitive production by addressing the major
constraints of the sector while laying the basis for additional policy
reforms as part of the continuing dialogue begun during preparation of the
sector report.
6.       Proiect Objectives.  The objective of the project is to assist the
Government of India, IDBI and ICICI foster a competitive electronics study.
It would (a) upgrade the capability of the financial institutions to
identify, appraise and finance sound projects in this sector; (b) provide
them with financial support to meet investment, working capital, and
technology-purchase requirements of eligible electronics firms; (c) upgrade
the capacity of technical education institutions to develop technical and
professional skills required for the rapid and efficient growth of the
industry; (d) help to shape the strategy, and identify specific projects
for development in computer software; and (e) help to improve the
informational and analytic basis for investment and policy decisions
concerning the industry.
7.       Prolect Descriotion.  The project would include the following
components: (a) private and joint sector investment (US$420.2 million) in
fixed assets and permanent working capital with Bank financing through
ICICI and IDBI (US$202 million) using a new "single window" mechanism to
finance both fixed investment and permanent working capital requirements of
sub-borrowers; (b) improvement of skilled man-power development and
training capacity of selected education and training institutes (US$26.8
million) through grants from DOE (financed by US$8.0 million from the Bank,
$16.2 million grant funds expected from the Swiss Development Cooperation
and US$2.6 million from GOI) for equipment, training and other assistance;
and (c) technical assistance (US$3.0 million) for: (i) development of the
computer software industry (studies, seminars, and project identification);
(ii) support of electronics investment and policy development (seminars and
studies); and (iii) upgrading the capability of financial institutions to
screen and appraise electronics projects (financing of US$2.7 million
expected from the Japan Grant Facility, $0.2 million from GOI, and US$0.1
million from the DFIs). The total cost of the project would be US$450.0
million, of which US$211.9 million would be in foreign exchange. A
breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of the
project's key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
India are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7704-IN, dated Nay 23, 1989, is being distributed separately.
8.       Agreed Actions.  The Government and the DPIs have established an
Exchange Risk Administration Scheme (ERAS) for relending to large scale
borrowers which was reviewed in the context of the Export Development
Project approved on May 12, 1989. Under the ERAS scheme, DFIs will pool



-3-
their foreign currency borrowings and relend in local currency at
adjustable rates, which will be adequate to provide a 2% spread for DFIs
and cover the foreign exchange and interest risks. Each subloan will
initially bt set at the prevailing ERAS rate with a maximum cap rate
(presently 15% and 18%, respectively). The Government would: (a) adjust
the ERAS rate as necessary to cover the interest rate and foreign exchange
risks; and (b) would make ar. advance to the ERAS fund if tne fund runs into
a deficit in the short-run due to unexpected exchange rate movements, but
would be repaid when the Fund is in surplus.
9.       With respect to the Manpower Development and Technical Assistance
components, (i) the Government has agreed to establish a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) and Steering Committee in accordance with a
timetable and staffing acceptable to the Bank; (ii) to select and support
under the project resource centers, engineering colleges, polytect.1c
institutions, and centers for electronics design and technology
satisfactory to the Bank; and (iii) enter into an agreement with the
Government of Switzerland for cofinancing which will become effective no
later than December 31, 1989, and (iv) to conduct the programs on software
industry development and support of electronics investment and policy
development in accordance with a schedule, organizational arrangements and
procedures to be agreed with the Bank.
10.      The financial institutions have agreed to: (a) follow procedures
for administering the term lending component, acceptable to the Bank,
including repayment terms of no more than fifteen years (five year maximum
for permanent working capital loans) including up to three years of grace,
a free limit of US$8 million for a single sub-project, minimum financial
and economic rates of return of 15% and 12% on sub-projects, respectively,
working capital to be financed only as part of investment project
financing; and (b) provide the Bank with a satisfactory work program for
the implementation of the DPI technical assistance component by September
30, 1989.
11.        f        The project would support the Government's long-term
goal of making the electronics industry internationally competitive and of
disseminating the benefits of information and telecommunications technology
more widely in India. It would strengthen the ability of two major DFIs to
identify and finance viable new projects in this sector, as well as upgrade
the technical capability of existing firms. All investments financed would
have satisfactory financial and economic rates of return. The credit
component would finance about 30 sub-projects, resulting in investments of
about US$420 Pillion and employment of about 12,000 people. The project
also would provide improved training for this industry's principal
resource, skilled manpower, which in turn would raise productivity and
facilitate transfer of technology that is critical for electronics
development. This component would result in an upgraded capability to
produce 4,000 middle and higher level technical and professional staff
annually in the fields of electronics and computer software. The project
would develop programs and identify projects to help relieve other
constraints in the highly promising computer software industry. Finally,
it would foster a more informed dialogue within India about the future of
this industry, and how it can become a viable part of the electronics
industry worldwide.



.4-
12.      Rlska.  First, the Government will be slow in implementing further
needed reforms, espe¢ially concerning import competition, which would make
it more difficult to develop an economically efficient electronics
industry. Recent policy reform provides a sufficient basi: for a project,
and the Bank and the Government will continue to discuss further reforms
both in the context of macro-economic and sector work and the proposed
project. DFI screening and appraisal capability, which this project would
upgrade, would help to ensure efficient resource allocation to economically
viable projects. Second, is the rate of utilization of the credit line
under the proposed Exchange Fate Adminristration Scheme (ERAS). Since the
attempt to lita the relending rate to the cost of funds through fVoe a g
rates is new, the Governmex,, the DFIs and the Bank will monitor
developments closely to ensure that the relending rate adjusts properly to
market conditions and adequately meets the objective of covering the
foreign exchange and interest rates risks, and the needs of the financial
institutions and sub-borrowers for some predictability in their financial
planning. Third, there is a potential risk of delays in implementation of
the manpower component because the organizational set up is new, and the
institutions are not familiar with Bank procedures. Additional supervision
at start up will help reduce this risk.
13.       ece.lAti, . I am satisfied that the proposed loans comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loans.
