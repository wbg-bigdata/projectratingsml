                                A. Introductory Remarks

This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the
following changes in the Afghanistan Civil Service Refonn Project (the" Project ", IDA
grant H2970; Project ID P097030) and accompanying amendments to the Project's legal
documents.

The proposed changes address challenges resulting from pursuing a complex public
administration refonn agenda in an increasingly difficult political refonn and worsening
security environment with diminishing government commitment and implementation
capacity constraints on the part of the project's implementing agency - the Independent
Administrative Refonn and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC).

The proposed restructuring would recalibrate the Project's development objectives to
focus on more attainable priorities, adjust the Project's scope to focus on areas with
stronger government ownership; and strengthen implementation arrangements within the
IARCSC.

The proposed modifications will focus the project and expected results on introducing
core building blocks for more effectiveness and transparency in the management of
human resources in the public sector, including adoption of new recruitment procedures,
development of a more systematic approach job grading and associated pay levels; and
introduction of human resource management functions in selected line ministries. It will
thus contribute to the adoption and enforcement of a more orderly, fair and unifonn
system for the administration of public sector employment. Refonning the selection,
management and development of the human resources across all sectors continues to be a
critical need and prerequisite for the long tenn process of strengthening public
administration and service outcomes.

                     B. Background and Reasons for Restructuring

Project background
On May 29, 2007 an IDA grant (H 297) in the amount of SDR 13.5 million (US$ 20.4
Million equivalent) was approved for the Project and the grant became effective July 11,
2007. The Project was designed to achieve the following objective:

Across the timeframe ofthe project (by 2011) a significant proportion ofservice delivery
ministries will be performing their functions to an acceptable level and can be held
accountable for the use of public resources. This will have resulted from these
ministries/agencies having been reorganized according to their core functions and civil
servants being managed according to clear rules and procedures.

The Project was intended to serve as an instrument to assist the GOA in the
implementation of a comprehensive public administration refonn agenda. The original
Project design has three components:




                                           3
        1. Organizational Reforms within Core Ministries: proVIsIon of technical
assistance for line ministries to develop strategic plans for improving services delivery,
with efficiency and transparency in use of public resources (US$8.4 million).

         2. Implementation of Merit-Based Human Resources Management Policies and
Practices in Government: provision of technical assistance for (i) development of civil
service rules and regulations derived from new Civil Servants and Civil Service Laws;
(ii) strengthening the system of merit-based appointments; and (iii) implementing GOA's
new pay and grading policy (US$8.7 million); and

        3. Oversight and Monitoring of the Public Administration Reform (PAR)
Program; providing technical advice and assistance to support IARCSCs stewardship
role as provided under the 2005 Civil Service Law (US$3.3 million)

Project performance
At its mid term, the project's track record has been mixed. After significant delays,
procurement of three major technical assistance contracts with a combined commitment
of US$ 16 million has been completed. In addition, about 33 out of 46 national
consultants agreed in the procurement plan have been procured. US$ 3.2 million has been
disbursed as of August 31, 2009.

The roll out of the new pay and grading policy is underway with five large ministries
having substantially completed the re-grading of positions with job descriptions and
qualifications. Development of a simple registry of personnel is also in progress. Reform
Implementation Management Units (RIMUs) have been established in five core
ministries. A viable model for human resource management that is ready for further
application has been developed and is being implemented in five core ministries.

However, overall progress in meeting the PDO has been lacking. Government
commitment at all levels to the comprehensive public administration reform agenda
originally supported by the project has weakened since the project approval. The political
environment has become more challenging with political attention largely being absorbed
by immediate and short term agenda of resolving a worsening security situation in the
country. Many line ministries do not consider strategic planning and broad organizational
reforms as a priority. Fragmented responsibilities within IARCSC, weak coordination and
communication both internally and externally have impaired the ability of the IARCSC to
manage the project effectively.

Consequently, progress targets for the first project year were almost entirely missed, and
only limited progress was made in the second year. Progress in the preparation and
enactment of key civil service regulations has been lagging. The roll out of the Pay and
Grading reform started with almost one year delay, and the focus has been largely on
achieving quantitative targets with little regard to quality. While legally required,
implementation of merit based procedures continues to be a challenge in a public sector
environment that is still characterized by patronage and ethnocentric politics. While some
modest changes to organizational structures of ministries are being achieved as part of the
roll out of the new pay and grading policy, anticipated텶ARCSC support to line ministries
with regard to strategic planning and more substantial organizational reforms has not
                                            4

been effective. As a result, the project is unlikely to achieve the anticipated impact on
ministry performance and service delivery in selected line ministries set out in the PD~.

Reasons for restructuring
The Project operates in an exceptionally challenging environment and a number of risks
identified in the original project document have materialized despite efforts to mitigate
them. The restructuring is undertaken to align the PD~ with a more feasible set of
outcomes that can be achieved in the remaining implementation period. There continue to
be reasonable prospects for achieving significant results from a more focused, less
ambitious agenda so that suspending the project would not be advisable.

                                       C. Proposed Changes

The proposed restructuring covers a revision of the original PD~, a redefinition of the
scope and focus of the project components, and a number of supporting changes to
improve implementation arrangements.

Project Development Objective
Both the Government and IDA have recognized that a revision of the PD~ is required
and that expectations need be scaled back taking into account the difficult environment
for public administration reform, the mandate and capacity of the IARCSC, and the
resources available to the Project. The original PD~, cited above, was very ambitious
from the outset. The original project design envisaged that IARCSC would spearhead
major institutional reform in line ministries, however, in spite of having a legal mandate
to promote line ministry reorganization and public service delivery, IARCSC lacked the
necessary political support and organizational capacity to lead and support significant
reform efforts in other ministries.

It is proposed to modify the PD~ as follows:

Across the timeframe ofthe project (by July 2011) more accountable and transparent practices in
the management ofthe civil service will be introduced in selected ministries.

The proposed changes are designed to focus on meaningful results that can be achieved by the
Project in the remaining implementation period together with measurable indicators. The revised
development objective will focus the project and expected results on core building blocks for
more effective, accountable and transparent management of human resources in the public sector.
There remains general agreement that reforming the selection, management and
development of the human resources across all sectors continues to be a critical need and
this is where IARCSC holds a clear mandate.

Project Components
Project components would be modified to support achievement of the revised PD~.

Component I Strengthening HRM Capacity in Core Ministries:
Initially, this component focused on efforts to substantially restructure selected ministries through
the creation of Reform Implementation Units (RIMUs) within those ministries supported by the
project. After restructuring, this component would be more limited to supporting the

                                                 5

strengthened human resource management functions in selected line ministries. There
remains a high level of interest among most ministries to improve human resources
management and practices, motivated by the desire to introduce the new pay and grading
policy. In addition, the component would intensify training to help internalize basic
foundation concepts and practices of human resources management, needed to build the
new human resources management units.

Component 2 Implementation ofMerit-Based Human Resource Management Reforms in
Government:
The original activities planned for this component remain viable, although they would be
modified to accommodate actual progress being made in the development of the HRM
units under Component 1. Additional effort would be made in building up a simple and
manageable personnel registries and human resource information systems with the aim to
create a basis for monitoring employment, strengthen internal and external controls on
payroll systems and mitigate risks of employment related fraud, including ghost workers
and absenteeism.

Component 3 Project Management and Support Services:
This component will be reengineered to strengthen project governance, coordination and
project management capacity of IARCSC, rather than supporting broad reform
communication and coordination efforts envisaged under the original design. The original
project design envisaged that project administration be carried out through a multitude of
existing units in the IARCSC. While this was intended to avoid ring fencing and
therefore to provide for more sustainable implementation of the project, in practice
fragmentation of-implementation responsibility in the IARCSC has impacted on overall
Project performance. The redesigned component 3 is addressing these inefficiencies by
providing resources to strengthen and streamline project management within the
IARCSC.

Implementation Arrangements
Implementation arrangements are revised to strengthen project management procedures
and operational controls to reinforce accountable and result oriented management of
project resources of toward achieving the revised project objectives. The main
modifications are as follows:
      Establishment of a project steering committee (PSC) consisting of all involved
       implementing units within the IARCSC which would be charged with the overall
       decision making and oversight responsibilities;
      Technical aspects of contract management of the three international TA
       Consultants will be shifted to implementing units (lARCSC line departments)
       who are responsible for the implementation of reforms that are supported by the
       project,
      Establishment of a project management unit that would provide administrative
       support to all involved implementing units;
      Establishment of Civil Service Advisory Committee, comprised of Deputy
       Ministers of Administration and/or senior officers of line ministry with similar
       responsibilities for HRM, to enhance communications between the IARCSC and
       line ministries on proposed and enacted civil service policies and regulations
       while strengthening IARCSCs external accountability.
                                            6
Project Costs, Disbursement Categories, Procurement; Financial Management
Financial management under the project has been rated moderately satisfactory. The audit
report for SY 1387 is due on September 22 2009, but submission of all project audit
reports in the Afghanistan portfolio are expected to be delayed due delays in the
procurement of the audit firm.

Restructuring would not affect current arrangements for procurement and financial
management. Overall project costs will remain at US$ 20.4 million but some
reallocations will be done in accordance with revised project objectives and outcome
indicators. The reduced cost benefit ratio (scaled back results at same cost) of the
restructured project reflects i) cost escalation associated with the worsened security
environment which resulted in actual costs of contract CSRP 602 and 601 exceeding cost
estimates at appraisal and ii) nature of time based technical assistance contracts with no
direct link between costs and outputs.

The restructuring would not substantially alter the project's original economic, financial,
institutional and social aspects.

No new safeguard policies are triggered as a result of the restructuring and the
environmental category "C" remains the same.

No exceptions to World Bank policies are requested.

                                          E. Expected Outcomes

The revised PD~ would concentrate on introducing more accountable and transparent
practices in the management of the non-uniform civil service. The following revised
outcome indicators would measure progress towards achieving the PD~:

  By Project Closing Date, 100 percent of civil service posts will be re-graded
   according to the provisions of the Civil Servants Law & related regulations;
  By Project Closing Date, 100 percent of civil service appointments being made on a
   merit basis following the Civil Servants Law and related regulations;
  By Project Closing Date, regulations and procedures for key HR actions, including
   recruitment, promotion, disciplinary actions, retrenchment/severance, and code of
   conduct have been adopted, in accordance with the Civil Servants Law, and are
   applied consistently across the human resources department of Participating Line
   Ministries

                                                        8
The intennediate results and corresponding indicators for each component will be
adjusted to reflect changes in component scope. The new results framework after the
restructuring is included in annex 1.

                                   F. Benefits and Risks

With the restructured CSRP, the GOA would build some of the key foundations for a
more coherent and potentially effective civil service (i) that is introducing merit-based
appointment processes; (ii) that is rationalizing the structure of the civil service through
transparent job descriptions and perfonnance expectations; and (iii) and that is
systematically linking pay levels to job types as a key step in securing fair and rational
pay. These steps are necessary, though not necessarily sufficient, to ensure greater
openness and fairness in hiring and administration of personnel, and human resource
management structures that allow the Government to maximize perfonnance and
accountability among staff. The y are intended to contribute to a gradual, long term
process of state-building which is the only feasible approach in an environment as fragile
as Afghanistan.

Restructuring explicitly responds to the risk of declining GOA commitment and by
lowering and focusing short term expectations would allow additional time for promoting
shifts in long held attitudes and cultural patterns surrounding public sector employment,
in a time of political and economic instability. Restructuring will also mitigate the
implementation risk of low IARCSC capacity, by strengthening the project
implementation structure and reducing complexity in the design of the project and
focusing it on a more modest work agenda.

However, even with modifications there remain substantial risks to achieving even these
more limited goals, owing to the continuing unstable political and administrative
environment which could be further aggravated by the election process and outcomes.
There remains only cautious political commitment to making even incremental changes.
Moreover, IARCSC implementation capacity remains limited even under the restructured
project and implementation structure and project success will continue to depend heavily
on line ministries' readiness and capacity to implement envisaged civil service refonns.
