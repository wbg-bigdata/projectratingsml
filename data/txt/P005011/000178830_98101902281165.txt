SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
Loan and Prolect Summary
Borrower:            Suez Canal Authority (SCA)
Guarantor:           Arab Republic of Egypt
Amount:              US$100 million equivalent
Terms:               20 years, including 5 years of grace, at 8.0 percent
interest per annum.
Project              The proposed project is designed to expand and improve
Description:        canal facilities to allow it to be used by more and
bigger ships. By 1980 ships drawing up to 16.1 meters
(53 feet) will be able to use it. This would include
almost all the world shipping fleet except for the
larger tankers which still could not pass when fully
loaded. The project includes dry excavation and dredg-
ing to widen and deepen the canal, breakwater construc-
tion, miscellaneous civil works of mooring facilities,
workshops and a training center; also equipment and
material procurement and technical assistance. The
project generates economic benefits to Egypt through
increased canal revenues, to ship owners who will bene-
fit from shorter routes and possibly to consignors and
recipients of freight through reduced freight rates.
The benefits have been estimated on the basis of very
conservative traffic forecasts. The project does not
face any special implementation risks. Although large,
its construction is relatively straightforward.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE SUEZ CANAL AUTHORITY WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT FOR
A SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Suez Canal Authority, with the guarantee of the Arab Republic of Egypt,
for the equivalent of $100 million, to finance part of the foreign exchange
costs of a project for the expansion of the Suez Canal, to allow transit of
ships drawing up to 16.1 meters (53 feet). The loan would have a term of 20
years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8.0 percent per annum.
The Japanese Government made a loan for the project in 1975 and is considering
a further loan, as are the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, the
Islamic Development Bank, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development,
and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. The Saudi Fund for Devel-
opment has approved a loan for the project equivalent to $50 million. USAID
and other bilateral donors will also participate in project financing.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An Economic Report on the Arab Republic of Egypt (No. 870a-EGT),
dated January 5, 1976, has been distributed to the Executive Directors. An
updating economic report dated March 22, 1977 was distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors on June 8, 1977. A basic economic mission visited Egypt in
May/June 1976 and its report is under preparation. Updating missions visited
Egypt in October 1976 and January 1977; the findings of these missions are
incorporated in this report. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        From 1960 to 1966 Egypt experienced rapid growth (around 6 percent a
year in real terms) under fairly rigid centralized planning and control. This
system came under increasing pressure in the second half of the decade follow-
ing bad harvests and increased defense expenditures, particularly as a result
of the civil war in Yemen. It deteriorated further after the war of 1967,
with the loss of the Sinai oil fields, the closure of the Suez Canal, the
abandonment of the Canal cities and the cost of resettling the population of
about a million, and the virtual cessation of Western economic assistance.
With the continuing military confrontation in the Middle East, Egypt further
increased defense spending at the expense of other types of consumption and

Report for the Regional Electrification project, distributed to the
Executive Directors on May 27, 1977.



- 2 -
of its development program. Thus, in 1973 the economic picture was one of
rigorously curtailed private consumption and inadequate investment, with a
deteriorating capital stock of infrastructure and productive facilities. Real
GDP growth for 1967-73 averaged only 3.5 percent a year.
4.        The changed political situation after October 1973 laid the ground-
work for a new "open-door" policy enunciated by President Sadat and approved
in a national referendum in May 1974. This policy reflects a major effort
to accelerate economic development through modernization and making Egypt's
largely publicly owned and centrally controlled economy more market-oriented.
Specifically, the policy envisaged (i) decentralization of decision-making in
state-owned enterprises, (ii) liberalization of the private sector, (iii) in-
centives for private foreign investment, and (iv) expanded economic coopera-
tion with Arab countries. Since 1974 Egypt has initiated a number of steps
which are expected to lead to a significant restructuring of the economy. In
particular, steps have been taken to remove some of the restrictions on private
business activities, to decentralize public enterprise management, to encourage
foreign private investment, to expand foreign exchange transactions outside
the official rate, and to loosen many of the restraints on banking activities.
5.        Substantial inflows of external assistance from both Arab countries
and Western aid donors and institutions have eased some of the problems of the
Egyptian economy in making the transition. However, major structural diffi-
culties remain, largely due to the continuing tension in the region and the
neglect of investment. These structural difficulties are also linked to the
major immediate weaknesses of the economy: the large deficit in the balance
of payments, the low level of government savings, and low efficiency in public
sector enterprises.
6.        The present government was formed in November 1976 following elec-
tions to the People's Assembly, which were the first in which a choice of
candidates representing diverse political views was offered to the voters.
The Cabinet was strengthened on the economic side, and a Deputy Prime Minister
for Financial and Economic Affairs was appointed to coordinate economic
policy-making, while President Sadat directed that economic questions should
be in the forefront of the new Cabinet's tasks.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        Growth in National Income.   Real growth in GDP (1975 prices) in-
creased from less than 3 percent in 1973 to about 3.2 percent in 1974 and an
estimated 9.8 percent in 1975 1/; the rise is attributed largely to recovery
of industrial activity through the provision of greater aid-financed inputs,
increased construction (particularly in the Canal Zone) and growth of trade
and services. The high rate of growth for 1975 was in part due to the recovery
of the Sinai oil fields (November 1975) and the reopening of the Suez Canal
(June 1975). If their effect on growth of the gross domestic product is ex-
cluded, the overall growth rate is estimated (by the Ministry of Planning) at
1/   Ministry of Planning.



- 3 -
8.0 percent. Preliminary production data for 1976 indicate that the economy
continued to expand. The estimated rate of growth of 6.1 percent, however,
reflects increasing capacity constraints in some sectors.
8.        Investment.   Egypt was able to sustain a higher level of investment
during 1974 and 1975, largely as a result of generous external assistance from
Arab countries. Gross investment increased from $1,373 million in 1973
to $2,867 million in 1975 (in 1975 prices). This included a considerable
replenishment of stocks, which had been drawn down in the pre-October 1973
period. During 1976, as a result of shortages of both domestic and foreign
resources, investment is estimated at only about $2,300 million (1975 prices).
9.        Public Finance.   Because of the size of the public sector, the bulk
of Egypt's domestic financial resources for development is mobilized through
the state budget and public sector corporations. Considerable efforts have
been made in the past to increase such resources, largely by way of taxation.
In 1975 tax revenues were 22 percent of GNP. Public enterprises (although
hampered by Government-imposed pricing policies) and social insurance and
pension funds contributed an additional 8 percent and 5 percent of GNP, re-
spectively. Total public revenues reached 38 percent of GNP, a major effort
for a country of Egypt's low per capita income.
10.       The high level of Government current expenditures, however, absorbed
most of these resources. This was almost entirely due to the level of defense
expenditures, and, more recently, to the growth of subsidies, which increased
from $480 million (about 5 percent of GNP) in 1973 to $1,830 1/ million (about
15 percent of GNP) in 1975, as the Government endeavored to protect domestic
consumers from the sharp increases in the import prices of foodstuffs and other
essential commodities. While exact data on defense spending are not available
(since a large portion is channelled through a separate account, partly foreign
financed--the Emergency Fund) it appears that the defense burden on the budget
eased over this period. Although it increased in absolute terms--from $1,100
million in 1973 to $1,485 million in 1976--defense spending, as a proportion
of total current expenditures, declined from about 39 percent to about 28 per-
cent in this period. Expenditures on economic and social services provided by
the Government (education, health, etc.) and other general expenditures have
risen at approximately the same rate as GNP.
11.       With increased current spending, public savings declined from 4 per-
cent to less than 1 percent of GNP between 1973 and 1975. However, preliminary
data for 1976 show an increase in public sector savings. As of May 1, 1976,
a number of subsidies were abolished, saving $140 million. A decline in inter-
national prices also helped cut the actual subsidy bill for 1976 to $1,600
million.
12.       Credit expansion in 1976 was 16 percent, a much smaller increase
than the 42 percent registered in 1975. Credit policy was more restrictive
and the credit needs of public sector companies were reduced because of a

running down of inventories and a decline in import commitments. Money and
quasi-money expanded by 25 percent compared with 21 percent in 1975. The
official consumer price index for the urban population estimated the price
index in 1975 at 10 percent, but the real rate was probably much higher. The
index for 1976 is not available, but indications are that the rate of infla-
tion was comparable to that in 1975.
13.       Balance of Payments.  Despite an increase in the value of com-
modity exports by 56 percent between 1973 and 1975 (largely as a result of
improved international prices) export earnings fell well short of imports.
Indeed, the country's import bill almost tripled in this period due to in-
creases in quantities imported, and soaring food and other prices. Egypt's
export receipts were influenced by declines in the physical production of
certain field crops (particularly cotton) due to a shift towards more profit-
able cash crops (fruits, vegetables, clover) and increased domestic demand for
exportable products. As a result, there was a decline in both the value and
quantity of some important exports.
14.       The imbalance in Egypt's trade was compensated to some extent by
fast-growing earnings from services and from workers' remittances. Never-
theless, the overall deficit on the trade and services account reached record
levels, increasing from $654 million in 1973 to $2,480 million in 1975.
15.       In 1976 the deficit was reduced significantly, although at $1,390
million it was still high. Preliminary estimates show export earnings in-
creased by about 16 percent, due mainly to increased receipts from the Suez
Canal and to oil exports. Imports of goods and services fell by about 13
percent, in large part due to a decision to abandon the second tranche of the
1976 investment program and to restrict imports of intermediate and capital
goods. While there were some reductions in imports of consumer goods as well,
the smaller deficit must have been partly purchased at the cost of Egypt's
future growth.
16.       The large deficits on the goods and services account in 1974-1976
were met mainly through assistance from Arab countries, Iran and the United
States. The Arab support comprised grants as well as loans, and deposits in
the Central Bank of Egypt. However, in 1974 the deficit could be fully met
only by a substantial increase in short-term borrowing, including the use of
banking facilities. Higher levels of concessional assistance enabled a re-
duction in the use of these facilities in 1975, but lower aid flows in the
following year led Egypt to increase the use of this type of credit by over
$200 million to a total of $1.45 billion.
Development Problems and Prospects
17.       Egypt's rapidly growing population, widespread poverty and dilapi-
dated infrastructure require the generation of more resources for investment
and a more rigorous determination of the priorities of the projects into which
they are channelled. In turn, this implies: (i) greater restraint on the
growth of consumption; (ii) the removal of constraints created by inadequate
infrastructure (particulary ports, power, transport, and telecommunications);



- 5 -
(iii) greater emphasis on quick-yielding projects; (iv) more emphasis on com-
pleting ongoing projects than on starting new ones; (v) more active use of
prices (including the price of foreign exchange) as indicators of relative
scarcities; (vi) streamlining bureaucratic processes; (vii) a vigorous move
towards increasing industry's efficiency and making it more export-oriented
and employment-generating (which would involve using existing industrial
capacity more fully, paying more attention to considerations of quality, and
encouraging small-scale industry); and (viii) a strengthened program to curb
the growth of population and the articulation of urban and rural strategies
which would decentralize the growth of the urban population away from Cairo
and Alexandria and create more productive opportunities in smaller towns and
the rural areas. These issues will be addressed in the context of a medium-
term plan the framework of which has been completed. The plan is presently
under preparation.
18.       Over the long-run, Egypt's economic potential is considerable.    The
reasons for this are in brief: (i) the country has a large domestic market, a
proficient population, low wages, varied raw materials, and a key geographical
location, which makes it a natural base for industries that wish to supply the
growing regional market; (ii) Suez Canal revenues are estimated to continue to
rise gradually until the Canal expansion program is completed in about 1980--
there is then likely to be a substantial increase in revenues; (iii) Egypt's
improved prospects for oil production, which is put (by the oil companies) at
one million barrels a day by 1980-82, substantially exceed domestic require-
ments; (iv) considerably increased earnings from tourism--these reached an
estimated $383 million in 1976; (v) the possibility of using agricultural
land more intensely with greater emphasis on high-value crops; and (vi) an
increasing flow of remittances ($445 million in 1976) from Egyptians working
abroad. 1/
19.       However, Egypt's long-term potential also hinges upon a number of
factors outside its own control. The most important is a movement towards an
equitable and definitive peace settlement in the Middle East. Moreover, Egypt
requires the transfer of large amounts of capital from abroad; this, in turn,
must be preceded by preparation of a suitable portfolio of projects to which
potential investors, whether private or official, foreign or domestic, can
contribute. Finally, it requires fundamental changes in economic policies
and institutions. Hence, it will probably take 5-10 years to achieve a
significant restructuring of the economy.
20.       Recent Policy Actions.   Beginning in 1976, the Government, in close
consultation with the Bank and the IMF, began to undertake a series of policy
actions aimed at making more effective use of foreign resources, curbing excess
consumption, and improving allocative efficiency. Thus (i) the parallel ex-
change market has been successively widened (the last widening took place in
1/   Additional substantial remittances came in the form of "own-exchange"
imports.



- 6 -
March 1977), to comprise all exports except raw cotton, rice and petroleum and
all imports except basic mass consumption commodities and also excluding Suez
Canal revenues; (ii) the parallel market rate itself was further depreciated
to about 56 percent of the official rate; (iii) the attractiveness of the
parallel market was increased by establishing a list of items which may be
imported through it without exchange restrictions; (iv) parallel market imports
were valued for customs duties at the parallel market exchange rate (a measure
equivalent to an increase of about 80 percent in the tariff on applicable
imports); (v) ceilings on interest rates were removed and interest rates in-
creased; and (vi) the "general organizations" that exercised rigid control
over public industrial enterprises were dissolved and replaced by "higher
councils," which permit somewhat more initiative to the individual enterprises.
The Government submitted a letter of intent to the IMF on March 4, proposing
to undertake further economic reform. On April 20, 1977, the Fund approved a
standby arrangement for the Government authorizing provision up to the equiv-
alent of SDR 125 million (approximately $145 million) over the next 12 months.
Drawings under the standby arrangement will be closely monitored and depend on
Egypt remaining within a series of quarterly credit ceilings designed to limit
the increase in the net domestic assets of the banking system to $1,536 million
in 1977.
External Assistance
21.       In 1967 the substantial amounts of Western external aid which Egypt
had been receiving practically ceased, and up to 1974 service payments gen-
erally exceeded disbursements. During the period 1968-1973, non-military
aid from Eastern countries, estimated to have been in excess of $800 million,
financed the bulk of Egypt's development.
22.       Since 1973 the substantial deficits on the goods and services ac-
count have been financed primarily by official Arab grants, loans and deposits
with the Central Bank of Egypt. Western medium- and long-term (M&LT) capital
assistance began to grow after October 1973. However, because of the slow
disbursements inherent in the aid process, and the heavy repayments due on
past loans, net M&LT transfers from OECD countries to Egypt were initially
small. Commitments from the OECD countries have, however, led to a strong
aid pipeline, and it is estimated that there were substantial inflows in 1976
which should continue in 1977.
23.       Among western aid donors, the US Government is currently committing
about $700 million of project and commodity aid per annum (in addition to about
$210 million of food assistance under US Law PL 480). Aid from the other OECD
countries, especially France, Germany and Japan, has remained at the increased
levels of 1974/75 (i.e., about $235 million per year). The European Community
is providing increasing amounts of food aid; moreover, in January 1977 the
Community signed a financial protocol with Egypt committing, over a five-year
period, $70 million in grants and $119 million in concessional loans.
24.       It is estimated that in 1977 Egypt needs to import goods, including
capital goods in the order of $5.0 billion, in part to compensate for the



- 7 -
severe reductions in imports in 1976. While prospects for increases in re-
ceipts from exports are good, a current account deficit of approximately $1.86
billion is forecast; in addition, a reduction in short-term debt of at least
$700 million (including paying off $450 million in arrears as of December 31,
1976) is desirable, amortization of M&LT debt will require $840 million and
there will be a reduction in bilateral balances of about $200 million. Thus
total foreign exchange requirements will be about $3.6 billion. Taking into
account estimated aid disbursements of $1,470 million 1/, and estimated sup-
pliers' credits, private transfers and foreign investment of $480 million
Egypt would still have a foreign exchange financing gap for 1977 of approxi-
mately $1,650 million. A major step towards meeting this gap was accomplished
recently. In early April 1977, GODE agreed to provide additional financial
support to Egypt in the amount of $1.475 billion to be made available in 1977
as a loan to the Central Bank of Egypt in stages, while Egypt carries out its
declared policies to correct its balance of payments disequilibrium.
25.       Consultative Group.   In July 1976, Egypt requested the Bank to set
up a Consultative Group comprising a number of oil-producing Arab countries,
Iran, major western countries and Japan and leading international and regional
institutions, including the IMF. The first meeting of the Consultative Group
was held in Paris on May 11 and 12. At the meeting the major aid-giving
countries and institutions discussed in detail the most important problems
confronting the Egyptian economy, its prospects over the next few years, and
its needs for external assistance. Delegates, while appreciating the magni-
tude of the task with which the Egyptian Government was confronted recognized
that the structural changes undertaken by the Government would take a number
of years to complete. They felt that the Government was taking energetic
steps towards accelerating growth and expressed their support of the Govern-
ment's statement on its development strategy and of its efforts to direct
future development within the framework of an integrated plan to be completed
this year. Delegates accepted the World Bank's estimate that Egypt will re-
quire disbursements of $3.6 billion in 1977, of which about $1.65 billion will
have to come from new commitments. As the result of the commitment by GODE
and an increase in the commodity aid portion of US assistance, it is likely
that the bulk of the foreign exchange gap in 1977 will be covered. However,
current projections of foreign exchange earnings and requirements indicate
that in the period 1978-80, Egypt will require external assistance of about
$2.8 billion annually in disbursements (compared with $3.6 billion for 1977).
About $1.6-1.8 billion of disbursements will come from existing commitments
I/   This amount includes among others disbursements from (i) a $250 million
cash loan made in 1976 by the Gulf Organization for Development in Egypt
(GODE), which is a $2.0 billion fund created by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE
and Qatar to participate in financing Egypt's development program; (ii)
a Eurodollar loan of $250 million from a consortium of American and
European banks, guaranteed by the Gulf Organization; and (iii) M&LT
project aid estimated $435 million (including $185 million from bila-
teral agreement countries). It excludes the additional assistance to be
provided by the Gulf Organization mentioned at the end of paragraph 24.

leaving a gap of about $1.0 to 1.2 billion to be covered by new commitments.
A large part of this aid will be required in quick-disbursing form, i.e., as
cash or commodity aid.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
26.       Egypt's non-military medium- and long-term debt outstanding and dis-
bursed at December 31, 1975 was estimated at $5,101 million. This was almost
double the amount at end-1974 of $2,760 million. During the first nine months
of 1976 the debt rose to $5,670 million. Of this, official M&LT loans amounted
to $3,043 million (of which $731 million was in clearing currencies). Another
$1,942 million was in convertible currency deposits and $685 million in sup-
pliers credits. Major creditors were Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, USSR, USA, Abu
Dhabi and Iran. IBRD/IDA debt comprised about 2.7 percent of the total. Debt
service on medium- and long-term debt was estimated to amount to $680 million
in 1975, giving a debt service ratio of 26 percent. No reliable estimates of
military debt are available; Egypt is still making efforts to obtain resched-
uling of service payments on such debt.
27.       While the bulk of external assistance to Egypt was obtained on con-
cessional terms, the continued high level of short-term indebtedness continued
to be a cause of serious concern. Commercial bankers' credit facilities out-
standing (including undisbursed) amounted to $2,297 million at the end of
December 1976 of which $1,447 million were disbursed. The liquidity require-
ments of this type of indebtedness created severe problems for Egypt in 1976
when arrears in repayments were reported.
28.       The Government's recent policy actions (discussed in paragraph 20
above) have initiated the structural adjustments required by Egypt's economic
situation and international environment. The situation however requires con-
tinuing review and further action. At the Government's request, the Bank has
arranged to review developments in the economy by economic missions three or
four times a year.
29.       If progress towards curbing the increase of both consumption expend-
itures and imports is maintained and the country's export earnings potential
realized, Egypt's foreign capital inflow requirements are estimated at about
$2.8 billion per annum for the remainder of the decade. The required capital
inflows are large--but if they are available on the terms expected, Egypt
would have the debt servicing capacity to borrow the amounts envisaged, includ-
ing a limited amount on harder terms. The burden of servicing M&LT debt as a
percentage of total foreign exchange earnings is estimated at 25 percent in
1976 and is expected to decline to 19 percent in 1980. In these circumstances
Egypt may be considered creditworthy for a limited amount of Bank lending in
addition to the IDA assistance which Eygpt merits on the ground of its poverty
and difficult balance of payments position.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN EGYPT
30.       The proposed credit would be the World Bank's thirty-first lending
operation in Egypt. It would bring Bank and IDA commitments made since 1970
to $967 million. Annex II contains a Summary of Bank loans and IDA credits as
of June 30, 1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
31.       The principal objective of the Bank/IDA lending program in Egypt is
to support its development program through lending for (i) increasing utiliza-
tion of available productive capacity, (ii) projects which would increase pro-
duction and foreign exchange earnings or substitute for imports, particularly
in the key industrial and agricultural sectors, (iii) projects aimed at rehab-
ilitation and expanding infrastructure necessary to facilitate development,
and (iv) selected social sectors, namely population and education. The impact
of Bank/IDA participation in projects has been widened by attracting addi-
tional foreign exchange required for most of these projects from other donors.
Besides the technical assistance included under the Bank/IDA projects, the
Bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed National Power Sector Survey and
for a Master Plan for Water Resource Development and Use. The Bank also
extended limited technical assistance in April 1976 in the preparation of a
five-year development plan.
32.       The projects financed to date have been in support of the strategy
outlined in the preceding paragraph. Preparation of projects for future lend-
ing is following the same line. A second telecommunication project has been
appraised, while projects for agricultural development, the urban sector, and
the textile industry are to be appraised soon. A pipeline of projects for
possible future lending is also being developed, including additional projects
in water supply and sewerage, population, education, power, rural development,
agriculture (including drainage), industry, and tourism.
33.       Bank Group disbursements will continue in 1977 to represent less
than 10 percent of Egypt's overall capital inflow requirements. The Bank/IDA
share of total external debt outstanding and disbursed was less than 1 percent
at the end of 1975. For the future, the Bank/IDA share of total external debt
outstanding and disbursed (excluding military debts) is estimated to reach
about 11 percent in 1980, of which the Bank share would be about 7 percent.
It is estimated that in 1980, debt service payments due to the Bank and IDA
will represent about 3 percent of service payments due on Egypt's external
debt.
34.       The first IFC participation and lending, for a ceramics project, was
approved by the Executive Directors in April 1976. IFC is also discussing
several other private sector and joint venture projects.

PART III - THE SUEZ CANAL
35.       The first navigable waterway connecting the Mediterranean and Red
Sea was built in 2000 B.C. It joined the Nile River and Bitter Lake, which
then opened into the Red Sea. The present Suez Canal (see map), which is
160 km long, was built between 1859 and 1869; it shortens the sea voyage
between Western Europe and Asia by about 5,000 nautical miles. It was one of
the most important waterways for international traffic until it was closed
in 1967 following the outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East, and follow-
ing reopening in June 1975 has rapidly regained its former status.
36.       In July 1956 the Government took over the Canal from Compagnie
Maritime Universelle du Canal de Suez which operated under concession. In
1957 the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) was established as an autonomous legal
entity to operate and improve the canal. The Bank provided a US$56.5 million
loan (243-UAR) in December 1959 to widen and deepen the canal to its present
11.6 meter draft, to improve operations at Port Said, and to supply floating
equipment to replace obsolete equipment and to meet future requirements. The
11.6 meter draft allows transit by ships of about 60,000 deadweight tons (dwt)
loaded, and about 225,000 dwt in ballast. The project was carried out satis-
factorily and the loan has been fully repaid.
37.       Under SCA's management, canal operations were efficient and increased
steadily from 1956 to closure in 1967. The canal was the principal route for
Middle East oil destined for Europe and the Western Hemisphere. In 1966, 36
percent of the oil loaded in the Middle East and 14 percent of total world sea-
borne traffic passed through the canal. Revenues reached $235 million in
1966-67 and it was Egypt's second foreign exchange earner, after cotton. In
1976, revenues reached $340 million, still Egypt's second foreign exchange
earner.
Closure and Reopening
38.       Between 1967 and 1973, the canal was the demarcation line between
Egyptian and Israeli armed forces. Although the main structures of the canal
were largely undamaged, its banks were fortified, the channel was mined, and
left with many unexploded shells and bombs. The canal cities also suffered,
especially Suez and El Kantara which were almost entirely destroyed. Most SCA
facilities there were badly damaged and almost all floating equipment was
sunk. Ismailia was less seriously damaged, although the water supply plant
and most of SCA's buildings were affected. Port Said suffered less, but the
Port Fouad shipyard was seriously damaged.
39.       Following the disengagement in the Middle East in the autumn of
1973, it was decided to reopen the canal as soon as possible. The Egyptian,
French, UK, US and USSR Navies cleared explosives, and together with the
SCA and a US contractor, removed wrecks. A loan of $50 million from the Bank
(Loan Number 1064-EGT of December 1974), and loans totalling $125 million
equivalent from Arab countries also contributed to the estimated total $288



- 11 -
million ($181 million in foreign exchange) cost of rehabilitating the canal.
The canal was reopened to traffic, at its previous depth, in June 1975; equip-
ment necessary for more efficient operation is still being procured with the
balance of the above loans. Progress to date on project implementation has
been good. However, disbursement under the Bank loan has been slow; $8.1 mil-
lion had been disbursed as of June 30, 1977. This is because SCA first drew
upon the lower interest rate loans available from other sources and the imple-
mentation of the reconstruction proved more complex than originally estimated
by the appraisal team. Commitments under the Bank loan are expected to reach
70 percent of the total by the end of 1977.
Canal Traffic
40.       Total traffic using the canal during 1976 and total SCA revenues
have both been substantially more than was forecast prior to reopening; ton-
nage of ships was 198 million in 1976 compared with a forecast of 146 million.
Revenue was $340 million compared with $225 million forecast. By the end
of 1976 the average number of daily transits had reached 80 percent of the
1966 level. In 1966 the canal was the main route for oil traffic between the
Gulf and Europe, and tankers laden and in ballast accounted for 75 percent of
shipping tonnage using it. However, in 1976 the estimated 86 million net tons
of tanker traffic, despite being 40 percent above the forecast figure, was
less than 45 percent of total traffic and was also less than half the 1966
figure. The 112 million tons of ships carrying dry cargo in 1976, on the
other hand, as well as being 30 percent above forecast, was 65 percent higher
than in 1966.
41.       The reason for the decline in tanker traffic is the limited depth of
the canal. The size of tankers in world trade started to increase during the
mid-sixties. In 1964 tankers of over 50,000 dwt carried only 16 percent of
total world traffic, but by 1966 they carried more than 40 percent. The first
tanker of over 100,000 dwt was built in 1965; by 1975 tankers over 125,000 dwt
accounted for 42 percent of world tonnage. Most tankers built while the canal
was closed cannot use it when fully laden. The closure of the canal increased
the economic benefits from the use of larger tankers for traffic between the
Gulf and Europe, and so led to more such vessels being built. It also encour-
aged the development of pipelines to provide alternative routes from the Gulf
to Europe, including the SUMED pipeline from Suez to Alexandria; the total
capacity of pipelines competing with the canal is about one-third of the pre-
sent oil traffic between Europe and the Gulf.
42.       By 1967 SCA had prepared an expansion program, so as to enable the
larger ships then coming into service to use the canal. However, the canal
was closed before work could be started.
The Suez Canal Authority
43.       SCA is administered by a Board of Directors and a Chairman who is
also the Chief Executive. All are appointed by the President of the Republic.
SCA follows efficient commercial procedures. As with other Government-owned
agencies SCA's annual budget is reviewed by the Ministers of Planning and



- 12 -
Finance and approved by Presidential decree. Within the limit of the approved
budget SCA can draw foreign exchange from the Central Bank without further
approval. This procedure has worked smoothly.
44.       SCA has its main workshop and repair facilities at Port Fouad and
auxiliary workshops at Port Said, Ismailia, and Port Tewfik. SCA also operates
water treatment plants and electricity generating plants in the three cities
in the Canal Zone for its own and for public use. SCA has subsidiary companies
for ship-building and repair, civil works, manufacture of maritime equipment,
rental of equipment, and ship services. The subsidiaries are financially auton-
omous, with separate budgets and accounts, independently audited. Government
loans to the subsidiaries are channelled through SCA, but otherwise they have
no call on SCA's financial resources. SCA receives 10 percent of their profits
after deduction of reserves, the balance being divided between SCA and the com-
panies' workers in the ratio of 75:25. In 1975, SCA's income from subsidiary
companies amounted to LE 370,000 (US$925,000).
Organization, Management and Staff
45.       SCA's management is competent and experienced in the operation of
the canal. The Chairman was able to keep the nucleus of his team together
while the canal was closed, and has rapidly rebuilt it since 1974. The speed
with which the canal was cleared and reopened, and the good results obtained
since, are a tribute to their abilities. After some initial delays SCA managed
procurement under the rehabilitation project satisfactorily. SCA's nine Board
members are also the Directors of the main departments: although this may to
some degree limit the experience and specific expertise that suitable directors
coming from outside SCA might have provided, it is adequate for the day-to-day
operation and management of the canal.
46.       SCA (not including its affiliates) currently employs about 11,500
people. This is about 20 percent fewer than in 1967; SCA is recruiting new
staff, both to build up its capacity and to replace the large number of
employees approaching retirement. SCA has no difficulty in finding suitable
recruits, and has adequate training programs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
47.       The project was prepared by SCA, taking into account studies com-
pleted in September 1976, financed partly under the Bank's rehabilitation loan
and partly from British and French bilateral aid, prepared by consultants
Maunsell (UK) and Sogreah (France). The Bank was first asked to participate
in financing this stage of the expansion of the canal in July 1975. The proj-
ect was appraised in October 1976, and negotiations took place in Washington
from April 26-29, 1977. Mr. Ezzat Adel, Project Director, and Mr. Abdel
Rahman Montasser, Director for Shipyards, of SCA represented the borrower, and
Mr. Samir Koraiem, Director General, Ministry of Economy and Economic Coopera-
tion, and Mr. Ismail Kamel, Under Secretary, Ministry of Planning represented
the Guarantor. A report entitled "Appraisal of Suez Canal Expansion Project"



- 13 -
(No. 1474(b)-EGT), dated July 22, 1977, is being distributed separately. A
loan and project summary is attached, and a supplementary project data sheet
is Annex III. Maps of Egypt's transport and pipeline system, and of the proj-
ect, are also attached.
Canal Expansion
48.       The objective of the project is to deepen and widen the canal, and
to improve its operational efficiency, so that ships drawing up to 16.1 meters
(53 feet) will be able to use it. This is at present the expansion scheme
with the highest return; it would allow use by ships up to about 150,000 dwt
laden, and about 300,000 dwt in ballast. This includes 90 percent of tanker
tonnage currently in use on relevant routes in ballast, and almost all the
rest of the world shipping fleet. Only the larger tankers would still not be
able to pass when fully loaded. The canal will have adequate capacity, after
the currently planned expansion, to meet expected demand at 16.1 meters draft
up to about 1985. After 1985, further expansion in canal capacity may be
necessary, requiring additional bypasses or anchorages.
49.       SCA has plans for a further increase in depth, to 20.4 m. (67 feet),
which would allow use by all but the very biggest ships. However, this deep-
ening would be very expensive, probably costing an additional $2,000 million,
and the need for it is not yet firmly established. The need for deepening
to 20.4m draft depends particularly on future oil traffic patterns after 1985,
which have not yet been sufficiently studied. For the 150,000 dwt to 250,,600
dwt laden vessels, and the 300,000 to 380,000 dwt in ballast vessels, which
the further expansion would seek to attract, the structure and levels of canal
tariffs would be a crucial factor in deciding whether to use the Suez Canal
route. For those reasons, the Government and SCA have agreed that any fur-
ther expansion would be undertaken only after they have decided, after con-
sidering alternatives (including works to satisfy expected traffic demand at
16.1 meters), that such expansion is economically justified in the context of
national economic priorities, and after giving the Bank adequate opportunity
to exchange views with them on their proposals (Sections 3.06 draft Loan
Agreement and 3.03 draft Guarantee Agreement).
Project Description
50.       The project involves deepening and widening the canal, improving its
alignment, and expanding and improving canal facilities (including construc-
tion of a new length of canal to bypass Port Said) to allow use by more and
bigger ships. It would include the following components:
(a) Dry excavation and bank protection: Removing sand on the
east bank above water level, removing the existing bank
revetment and installing a new revetment on the new align-
ment;
(b) Dredging: Removal of approximately 500 million cubic meters
from the canal and its approaches, including the by-pass.
This is the major project item, accounting for over two-
thirds of total cost;



- 14 -
(c) Breakwater construction: A main breakwater and a groyne will
be built to protect the Port Said bypass; the existing Port
Said breakwater may also need to be extended, and other,
smaller breakwaters built;
(d) Miscellaneous civil works; including the following main
items: Demolition and reconstruction of mooring caissons,
and construction of mooring facilities; construction of a
workshop training center, and expansion of the SCA work-
shops at Port Fouad;
(e) Equipment and materials procurement including navigational
aids, radar installations, traffic control equipment, tugs,
a floating dock and other floating equipment, fire fighting
and pollution control equipment, vehicles, spare parts and
materials;
(f) Consultants and technical assistance will be financed to
assist SCA as necessary in final project engineering, in
project execution and in future operations.
51.       It is expected that the canal will be open to 16.1 m draft vessels
by June 1980, although some parts of the project (such as breakwater construc-
tion and equipment procurement) may not be completed until the end of 1980.
Final engineering for breakwaters and other civil works remains to be com-
pleted.
Project Execution
52.       In order to coordinate all aspects of project execution, SCA has
revised the powers and functions of its Engineering Department to transform
it into a Project Department, with overall responsibility for implementing
the project. The Project Department, under the control of the Project
Director (formerly SCA's Engineering Director), has five senior officers
responsible for the different aspects of project execution: the Project
Planning Manager, Engineering Supervisor, Dredging Superintendent, Project
Cost Controller and Project Administration Manager. These senior officers
(who all have substantial experience with SCA) form the Project Management
Unit in which direct, overall responsibility for project execution is vested
(Section 3.02(a) draft Loan Agreement). The Project Planning Manager is
responsible within the Project Department for coordination of the work of
other Departments relevant to the project. Consultants will be employed,
as needed, to assist the Project Department.
53.       SCA does not at present have the necessary staff to carry out eco-
nomic and financial forecasting and planning. A financial, economic and
traffic planning office is therefore to be established in SCA's Planning
Department. The office will be fully established by December 31, 1977 (Sec-
tions 3.02(b) and 7.01(a), draft Loan Agreement).

Project Cost
54.       The'total project cost is estimated at $1003 million (using the
parallel market rate of exchange) 1/, of which $676 million or 67 percent
would be in foreign exchange. SCA is exempt by statute from customs duties.
Detailed cost estimates are given below. Civil works estimates are based on
firm dredging contracts, and on tenders received. Thus they afford a good
basis to permit a well-founded analysis of the project.

Financing Plan
55.       The Bank loan of $100.0 million would finance about 10 percent of
total project cost and would be used specifically to help meet part of the
foreign exchange cost of dredging and other civil works, tugs and other equip-
ment, spare parts and materials and technical assistance. In view of Egypt's
shortage of foreign exchange, the Government and SCA are seeking to take full
advantage of SCA's reputation and borrowing capacity in securing as much as
1/   The parallel market rate has been used since from March 1977 all equip-
ment imports and civil works contracts have been required to be valued
at' that'rate.



- 16 -
possible of the foreign exchange cost of the project from external sources.
At meetings between potential cofinanciers and the Egyptian Authorities in
Cairo in October 1976 and March 1977, the Bank described the findings of its
appraisal mission. These meetings formed a base for tentative agreement on
the proposed financing plan, and the respective conditions of participants'
proposed loans. The Saudi Fund for Development has made a loan for the proj-
ect of $50 million. The Government of Japan, through the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund, made a loan of $135 million equivalent in 1975 to finance
the foreign exchange costs of a dredging contract awarded to a Japanese com-
pany to start the expansion of the canal. Japan has received and is consider-
ing a request for a further loan of $89 million equivalent to finance a second
dredging contract awarded to the same firm. The Arab, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait
Funds and the Islamic Development Bank are also seriously considering loans
for the project, in each case in the form of parallel financing, mainly to be
used to finance dredging contracts. These loans will probably total about $93
million. USAID has allocated $25 million from its 1977 commodity loan to
Egypt for equipment purchases for the project, while bilateral financing for
equipment from other industrial countries is expected to total at least $40
million. These external sources would, together, finance some 53 percent of
project cost, with the balance of up to $144 million of foreign cost and all of
the project's local costs being met by Egypt. The Government has undertaken
to permit SCA to retain sufficient of its revenues to complete the project,
and to provide any additional funds that may be needed (although in fact SCA's
cash flow should be adequate for the purpose). Signing of agreements with the
principal cofinanciers is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan
(Section 7.01(b) draft Loan Agreement). A special condition of default is the
failure of any of these agreements to become effective (Section 6 draft Loan
Agreement).
56.       Procurement.   Contracts have been awarded for the dry excavation,
the bank protection, approximately 56 percent of the dredging, and miscel-
laneous civil works, amounting to 52 percent of the estimated construction
cost. In addition, SCA is undertaking approximately 20 percent of the dredg-
ing work (14 percent of the total cost), and has invited tenders for most of
the balance of dredging works. All contracts financed by the Bank above
$100,000 will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Contracts financed by the Bank of less than $100,000, but not exceeding $4
million in the aggregate, would be procured using SCA's normal procurement
procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. Domestic preference of 15
percent or the customs duties, whichever is lower, will apply to equipment
procurement, while preference of 7 1/2 percent will apply to civil works pro-
curement. Local contractors will probably undertake minor civil works such
as small wharves for harbor craft and mooring launches. It is unlikely that
local suppliers of floating equipment will bid due to the heavy backlog of
orders for the rehabilitation of existing equipment.
57.       Disbursement.   For equipment, spare parts, and materials directly
imported the Bank would disburse 100 percent of foreign exchange cost; for
locally produced equipment 100 percent of ex factory cost, and for imported
equipment procured locally, 80 percent of total cost, representing the esti-
mated foreign exchange component. Disbursements for dredging would be 100



- 17 -
percent of foreign expenditures; for technical assistance, 100 percent of
foreign exchange cost for foreign consultants and 80 percent of total ex-

Retroactive Financing.   It is proposed that $700,000 retroactive financing be
provided from the Bank loan, for expenditures after January 1, 1977 for tech-
nical assistance for project design and engineering.
58.       Tariffs.  SCA derives almost all its revenue from canal dues.    The
current tariffs are SDR 1.611 per Suez Canal Net Registered Ton (SCNRT) for
laden ships and SDR 1.289 for ships in ballast; laden container vessels pay
a 5 percent surcharge. Tariffs are related neither to canal operating costs,
nor to the amount or type of cargo carried. In the present depressed state
of the world tanker market, SCA believes that the current tariff level is
appropriate; it appears to be close to the level which, given the present
simple tariff structure, maximizes canal revenues. SCA sees its duty as being
to maximize not only revenues and benefits to Egypt but also traffic in the
canal and so benefits to the world. The financial projections given below
conservatively assume that existing tariffs will remain constant in nominal
terms.
59.       Financial Position.   SCA is in a strong financial position.   Canal
dues are paid in foreign exchange and translated to Egyptian pounds at the
official rate. It is as yet unclear whether the revenues will be switched to
the parallel market rate: for the time being, therefore, the official rate
has been used for financial forecasts. SCA's revenue in 1975 (mostly from
dues subsequent to reopening in June) totalled LE 43.5 million. In 1976
revenue was at LE 132 million, of which LE 127 million was operating revenue.
Revenues are expected to remain relatively constant until 1980, when larger
ships will be able to use the canal: revenues in 1980 are expected to be
about LE 152 million (operating surplus LE 120 million), rising to LE 250
million (operating surplus LE 209 million) in 1985. SCA's annual net profit
after interest, income tax and government royalty, which is transferred to the
Government, is not expected to drop below LE 57 million, and after the expan-
sion should rise to LE 109 million by 1985.- Interest was 26 times covered in
1976 and for the foreseeable future will not be less than 6.7 times covered.
SCA will generate sufficient funds to service its debt and to finance the
approximately LE 200 million local costs of the project, leaving a cash sur-
plus of LE 40 million at the end of 1981. Sensitivity tests showed that
doubling interest rates for foreign loans other than from the Bank, a 15 per-
cent reduction in revenues, or a 10 percent increase in project cost, would
not impair SCA's financial viability.
60.       Because of the nature of SCA's assets and the high level of its earn-
ings, covenants on debt/equity ratios and return on assets would not be appro-
priate. SCA will maintain the covenant of Loan 1064, not to incur further

debt without Bank agreement unless its net income for the preceding 12 months
is not less than 1.5 times total debt service requirement in any succeeding
year (draft Loan Agreement Section 5.04).
Economic Benefits
61.       The project generates economic benefits to Egypt through increased
canal revenues because more and larger ships will use the canal, to the ship
owner who by using the canal will be able to benefit from shorter routes, and
possibly to consignors and recipients of freight, from reduced freight rates.
Use of the Suez Canal shortens a number of major trade routes, thus allowing
more productive use to be made of the capital invested in shipping, and reduc-
ing operating costs. For the oil trade, use of the canal gives one way trip
savings of about 18 days to the Mediterranean, about 13 days to NW Europe,
and between 7 and 10 days to North America. Analyses of trade forecasts for
major trade routes relevant to the canal, of shipping costs for alternative
routes (including use of pipelines), and for different types and sizes of
ships and of the present and likely future world shipping fleet, were carried
out to estimate the volume of additional traffic likely to be generated by
the expansion. For the purpose of the analysis, the present level of canal
tariffs was assumed.
62.       On the basis of this analysis, summarized below, the estimated over-
all economic rate of return of the project is 31 percent, based on global sav-
ings in transport costs. The economic rate of return to Egypt from increased
canal revenues is 15 percent. Sensitivity tests indicate that a 25 percent
project cost increase would lower the rate of return to Egypt to 12 percent,
or a five-year delay in recovery of the tanker market would lower it to 13
percent. A 25 percent cost increase and a five-year delay combined would
reduce the return to Egypt to about 10 percent.
63.       The present 11.6 meter draft restriction limits canal use to ships
of about 60,000 dwt loaded and 225,000 dwt in ballast. After expansion the
maximum will be about 150,000 and 300,000 respectively. The potential for
increased canal use is largely in oil traffic. Over 90 percent of tanker
tonnage currently in use on relevant routes would be able to use the enlarged
canal in ballast (compared with 35 percent at present). However, more than
half the total oil tonnage would still be carried in ships too large to use
the canal when loaded, first because of the increasing concentration of very
large tankers on the North West European route, and second because the fast
increasing Gulf-North American oil trade, which now uses tankers of less than
150,000 dwt, is likely to be transferred to larger ships as deep water term-
inals are developed on the US Atlantic Coast. In addition, under the existing
tariff structure, much of the operating cost savings for larger tankers from
use of the canal is paid in canal dues, so lowering the incentive to use the
canal in the present slack market. Nonetheless, oil tanker traffic through
the canal is conservatively projected to increase as shown in Table II.

64.       The project will permit passage of almost all dry bulk carriers,
some of which are now above the laden maximum size (iron ore, grain, coal,
bauxite and phosphate), and of all container ships expected to be in use.
This will generate about 2 million SCNRT additional dry bulk shipping traffic,
and an additional 5 to 7 million SCNRT general cargo traffic, including con-
tainers. Total traffic is expected to increase by over 90 percent in tonnage
(Table II) between 1977 and 1985, and the total number of ships from about
17,000 to about 24,500, that is by 44 percent. The enlarged canal will have
sufficient capacity to meet demand (in terms of number of ships physically
able to pass) until about 1985, although to do so SCA may need to adopt re-
vised operating procedures after 1982.
65.       The global savings in shipping costs from the project are forecast
at $125 million in 1980 and over $550 million in 1985, of which almost 85
percent will be in oil traffic. At present tariff levels, Egypt will recoup
about half the benefits flowing from the project in 1980, and about 33 percent
in 1985.
66.       The project will provide a major increase in Egypt's foreign exchange
earnings, of which the canal is Egypt's second biggest source. Even with no
increase in tariffs, the total net incremental foreign exchange flow (that is,
total incremental revenues less incremental foreign debt service payments)
between 1976 and 1985 will be about $650 million. By 1985 annual gross canal
revenues, with no tariff increases, would be about $637 million, and could be
much greater if a revised rate structure were put into effect.    The main risks
of the project are that the additional traffic will not materialize, and for
that reason very conservative traffic forecasts have been adopted.' However,
the'unexpectedly rapid increase, both in number and tonnage of ships, since
reopening, and in particular the-use by tankers of over 200,000 dwt in ballast,
indicates,that these risks are minimal. There are no special risks connected
with the expansion.work itself: the project although large in scale is rela-
tively'straightforward.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
67.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Suez Canal
Authority, and the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Arab Republic of
Egypt and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III



- 20 -
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
68.       Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special
interest are listed in Section III of Annex III.
69.       Special conditions of effectiveness are that SCA has commenced
staffing the financial, economic and traffic planning office in its Planning
Department and that it has signed loan agreements with the Arab, Abu Dhabi,
Kuwait and Saudi Funds and the Islamic Development Bank and a second loan
agreement with Japan (Section 7.01 draft Loan Agreement).
70.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
71.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 181-UAR - Nile Delta Drainage I Project; US$26 million Credit
of April 17, 1970; Effective Date: December 22, 1970; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
At present, about 65 percent of the project is completed; full com-
pletion is expected by end-1979, i.e., 2-1/2 years behind schedule. However,
procurement is proceeding satisfactorily and it is expected that the whole of
the credit will have been committed by December 1977, and that disbursement
will be completed by mid-1978. Due to inflation the local cost of the project
has increased by 90 percent, from $116 million to $220 million. There is no
foreign exchange cost overrun. Progress in project implementation during 1976
was satisfactory and, for the first time, the project reached the established
annual target. Government has allocated the required local funds for the year
1977 for the implementation of the ongoing Bank/IDA financed drainage projects.
It has also agreed that local funds required in the future would be included
in the medium-term development plan.
Cr. No. 284-UAR - Egyptian Railway Project; US$30 million Credit of February
9, 1972; Effective Date: July 17, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project generally is being implemented satisfactorily. All
procurement contracts have been awarded, and the credit has been fully com-
mitted. To allow the remaining balance to be utilized, the closing dates
(originally, September 30, 1976 for the parts of the credit allocated to
signalling and telecommunications items and December 31, 1973 for the other
parts) were postponed one and five times respectively to December 31, 1977.
Cr. No. S-13-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Engineering Project;
US$175,000 Credit of November 17, 1972; Effective Date: June 15, 1973;
Closing Date: November 30, 1973.
This credit was fully disbursed and subsequently refinanced under
Cr. 423 below.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 393-UAR - Upper Egypt Drainage I Project; US$36 million Credit of June
8, 1973; Effective Date: November 28, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
At present, about 30 percent of the project is completed; full com-
pletion is expected by end-1980, i.e., 6 months behind schedule. About 50
percent of the contracts for equipment have been awarded. Foreign exchange
costs have risen by about 14 percent almost entirely due to price increases
of chemicals for bilharzia control. The foreign cost overrun of the bilharzia
control program is being financed under the Upper Egypt Drainage II project
(Loan No. 1285-EGT and Credit No. 637-EGT).
Cr. No. 412-UAR - Development Industrial Bank (formerly Bank of Alexandria)
Project; US$15 million Credit of June 29, 1973; Effective Date: November 29,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The entire amount of the credit has been committed to subprojects.
As of June-30, 1977, 13.3 million had been disbursed. The transfer of respon-
sibility for this project to the newly established Development Industrial Bank
became effective on March 28, 1977.
Cr. No. 423-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project; US$18.5 million
Credit of July 30, 1973; Effective Date: February 15, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
The scaled-down project financed by IDA is estimated to be completed
in June 1979 and the remainder of the full project financed by a loan from the
Saudi Fund for Development, which became effective in July 1976, is expected
to be completed by June 1981. The foreign cost of the project ($34.3 million)
is now firm as all procurement has been completed, but the local component
continues to escalate mainly due to steady increase in the cost of civil works.
By Presidential Decree of 1977 the Project Implementation Unit was upgraded to
the status of a General Authority for Rehabilitation of Ginneries which should
give the management more freedom regarding financial and administrative
matters.
Cr. No. 437-UAR - Population Project; US$5.0 million Credit of November 6,
1973; Effective Date: March 25, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project had been greatly delayed by a shortage of local funds
and by administrative problems. It is now being carried out with a reduced
scope but substantially in accordance with a revised schedule. Seven general
health centres financed under the project are to be opened shortly.
Cr. No. S-15-UAR - Talkha Urea Fertilizer Engineering Project; US$400,000
Credit of November 20, 1973; Effective Date: April 24, 1974; Closing Date:
March 31, 1975.
The credit was refinanced under Cr. 484 below.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6
Cr. No. 484-UAR - Talkha II Fertilizer Project; US$20 million Credit of June
24, 1974; Effective Date: January 22, 1975; Closing Date: April 1, 1979.
The project is proceeding well and mechanical completion by mid-
1978 appears feasible. Additional foreign exchange financing to cover a
32 percent cost overrun has been secured from the Arab co-lenders under the
project.
Cr. No. 524-EGT and Ln. No. 1062-EGT - Agricultural and Industrial Imports
Project; US$35 million Credit and US$35 million Loan of December 20, 1974;
Effective Date: March 19, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The bulk of the procurement actions has been completed and dis-
bursements are well advanced. One of the six surveys of industrial sub-
sectors has been completed and the five others are expected to be completed
by end-1977.
Ln. No. 1064-EGT - Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project; US$50 million Loan of
December 20, 1974; Effective Date: April 21, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
Progress to date on project implementation has been good, although
the implementation of the reconstruction project proved to be much more
complex than originally estimated by the appraisal team. The financial
situation of the Borrower is sound; canal traffic and revenues are both
higher than expected at appraisal.
Ln. No. 1085-EGT - Tourah Cement Expansion Project; US$40 million Loan of
February 10, 1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1979.
Contracts have been awarded for all equipment packages, and disburse-
ments are proceeding. Construction of civil works is under way but at a slow
rate and is about six months behind schedule. Consultants which assisted in
bid evaluation are now assisting in supervision of project execution and
improvement of the existing plant.
Ln. No. 1098-EGT - Railways II Project; US$37 million Loan of April 2, 1975;
Effective Date: August 20, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Progress on physical investment items under the project is generally
satisfactory. However, the Egyptian Railways (ER) experienced operational
difficulties with a large number of locomotives out of service because of in-
adequate maintenance largely due to lack of spare parts. Spare parts are now
being delivered and a gradual improvement of the traction and traffic situa-
tion is expected. Also, declining traffic and rising costs resulted in a
worsening of ER's financial position. Government is considering increases in
rail tariffs proposed by ER.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6
Cr. No. 548-EGT - Telecommunications Project; US$30 million Credit of May 16,
1975; Effective Date: August 14, 1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1978.
Project works are about two years behind schedule, primarily because
of initial delays in building construction. However, construction has recently
accelerated and is expected to proceed satisfactorily. Contract awards for
cables have been largely completed: Telex equipment has been obtained with
financing from other sources and use of the credit allocation for this purpose
to purchase additional cables has been requested.
Cr. No. 576-EGT - Second Development Industrial Bank (formerly Bank of
Alexandria) Project; US$25 million Credit of July 30, 1975; Effective Date:
February 19, 1976; Closing Date: October 31, 1979.
As of June 30, 1977, about $19.9 million had been committed under
the project and $3.7 million had been disbursed. The transfer of respon-
sibility for this project to the newly established Development Industrial
Bank became effective on March 28, 1977.
Ln. No. 1239-EGT - Alexandria Port Project; US$45 million Loan of April 19,
1976; Effective Date: August 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Project implementation is slower than expected. Civil engineering
consultants have completed the first phase of their work; proposals from
management consultants have been invited. Prequalification of contractors for
dredging and construction works has started. Tender documents for floating
cranes are being prepared.
Ln. No. 1276-EGT - Fruit and Vegetable Development Project: US$50 million
Third Window Loan of June 11, 1976; Effective Date: December 20, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Steps are being taken to commence project implementation. Bank
Misr has signed sub-loan agreements for most of the identified sub-projects;
consultants have been appointed for Bank Misr and for the Nubariya civil
works. The project became effective December 12, 1976, two months behind
schedule. In view of the complexity of the project and the uncertainty
caused by delay in approval of the Government budget for 1977 containing
funds needed for the project, progress is generally satisfactory. This
latter problem now appears to be resolved auguring improved future progress.
Consultants have started their work with the Drainage Authority, as well as
with Bank Misr, and the consultants for Nubariya Seed Production Company are
being procured. About 75 percent of Nubariya Seed Company farm is presently
cultivated. The new Agricultural Development Lending Unit in Bank Misr is
rapidly coming to grips with its tasks and ensuring that the various agro-
industrial subborrowers are proceeding as planned with their respective
investments.
