APPRAISAL OF
SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Suez Canal was closed from July 1967 to June 1975 as a result of
hostilities in the Middle East. After being cleared of mines and explosives,
it was reopened to traffic. Its present depth and width are inadequate to
accommodate the large tankers that now carry most of international crude oil
trade. The Government has therefore requested Bank assistance for financing
the expansion of the canal; this would be the third Bank involvement for the
Suez Canal; the first one was Loan 243-UAR of December 1959 to finance the
deepening of the Canal to a maximum draft of 11.3m and replacement of equip-
ment; the second was Loan 1064-EGT of December 1974, for financing the re-
placement of equipment and facilities destroyed or damaged during the war.
ii.       The project is to widen and deepen the canal so that it can accom-
modate ships with a 16.lm draft. The main component is dredging, which ac-
counts for 67% of project cost. The project is based on consultants' studies
to determine the optimum size and timing of expansion. The consultants'
studies were substantially completed in October 1976, but the Suez Canal
Authority (SCA) started dredging in 1976, on the assumption that this would
not conflict with the conclusions of the studies.
iii.      The project cost is estimated at US$1.0 billion.  The foreign ex-
change component cost of the project is US$675.7 million (67%). The cost of
the civil works has been derived largely from actual contract prices. Specific
requirements for equipment are not available because project preparation is
incomplete and the estimates are based on what may be required and on recent
suppliers' prices.
iv.       A Bank loan of US$100.0 million is proposed for a 20-year term
including 5 years of grace, covering 14.8% of the foreign exchange cost of the
project.  SCA has already obtained a US$135.0 million loan from the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan to finance dredging and is request-
ing an additional loan of US$89.0 million for the same purpose. Other lenders,
most of them from Arab countries, have expressed interest in the project, with-
out any firm commitment yet. The execution of satisfactory agreements with
other external sources to cover the total foreign exchange cost of the project
is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan, Local currency
will be provided by SCA from their own resources.  Retroactive f.inancing up
to US$700,000 is recommended to meet expenditures by SCA after January 1977 on
technical assistance.
v.        The SCA will be rcsponsible for carrying out the project, and is
competent do so, with the s,;istance of the project management unit estab-
lished for supervision and coordination of project execution. Dredging will
be done partly by contract, partly by SCA's dredging flee;. miscellaneous



construction works should attract local bidders.  Local preference to the
extent of 15% of the CIF landed price of imported goods or the actual customs
duty, whichever is lower, will apply to local bids. Bona fide domestic con-
tractors will be granted a preference of 7.5% for civil works. The construc-
tion period will extend to September 1980, and the ships would be able to
transit at a 16.1m (53 ft) draft by December 1980.
vi.       Reopening of the Suez Canal has greatly reduced the sea distance
on a major number of trade rotutes and specially between the Arabian/Persian
Gulf area and Europe. Since the Canal in its present condition can accommo-
date most dry cargo ships, the project will mainly benefit oil traffic and
is forecast to generate savings in shipping costs of US$280 million in 1981
rising to US$555 million in 1985. Egypt will recoup part of the benefits from
canal tolls, which are presently some 50% to 100% higher than in 1967. The
rate of return to shipping is estimated at 31% and to Egypt 15%.
vii.      SCA's financi4al situation is sound and the Authority is Egypt's
second largest earner of foreigni exchange after cotton. The SCA will generate
sufficie.: funds to service its debt to finance the local currency cost of
developmernt and to transfer a slzeable surplus to the Government.  The audit
of SCA's accounts by Government auditors is satisfactory to the Bank.
viii.     Subject to the recommendations in Chapter VII of the present Report,
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$100.0 million to the Suez Canal
Authority for a 20-year term, including 5 years of grace.



APPRAISAL OF
SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since it was opened in 1869, the Suez Canal has been deepened and
widened at regular intervals to permit it to accommodate the ever-increasing
dimensions of vessels. Before the 1967 war, a development program was being
prepared to bring the maximum permissible draft from its present 11.6m (38ft)
to 12.2m (40ft), this being the first stage of a long-term development plan to
bring the draft to 14.6m (48ft) in 1972. However, as a result of hostilities,
the canal was closed from 1967 to 1975; most service infrastructure and opera-
tional equipment was damaged or destroyed. When the canal was reopened in
June 1975 the SCA directed their efforts to clearing the waterway of debris,
to replacing or rehabilitating their equipment, and to resuming the execution
of their development program. The Bank participated in financing the rehab-
ilitation (Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project, Loan 1064-EGT). This included
the study of the feasibility and optimum dimensions and phasing of the enlarge-
ment of the canal to accommodate the large tankers and bulk carriers that now
form an important part of the world merchant fleet. The study was to serve as
a basis for the appraisal of an expansion project, in the financing of which
the Bank intended to participate.
1.02      The study was well advanced by end of September 1976 and a Bank
mission visited Egypt in October 1976 to appraise the expansion project.
1.03      The present depth of the Canal allows ships with a 11.6m (38 ft)
draft to transit and the expansion will allow the passage of ships with a
16.lm (53 ft) draft. The project is expected to cost US$1.0 billion, in-
cluding a foreign exchange cost of US$675.7 million. To help finance the
foreign exchange cost, a US$100.0 million Bank loan to SCA is proposed. The
balance would be financed from borrowing from other sources. The SCA will
finance local currency costs and part of the foreign exchange costs from its
own revenues.
1.04      The Bank Group was involved in transport in Egypt with two Bank
loans of US$56.5 million (243-UAR, December 1959) and US$50.0 million (1064-
EGT), December 1974) to SCA, an IDA Credit of US$30.0 million (284-UAR,
February 1972) and a Bank loan of US$37.0 million (1098-EGT, April 1975) for
Railways, and a Bank loan of US$50.0 million (1239-EGT, April 1976) for the
Port of Alexandria. A Bank-financed transport survey is underway. Details
on the Bank's involvement in transport in Egypt are given in Annex I.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of the October 1976 appraisal
mission composed of Messrs J Grosdidier de Matons (Senior Port Specialist),
J. Burns (Senior Financial Laalyst), C. Evans of Wallace Evans and Partners
(United Kingdom) (Coasultant Engineer) and P. Nichols (Consultant Economist).
S. Rosen (Consultant Economist) assisted in the preparation of this report.

II. THE SUEZ CANAL
A. General
2.01      The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and was
built between 1859 and 1869. Its length is 160 km and its permissible draft
is 11.6m, having been increased from the original 6.7m in successive steps.
The Canal shortens the voyage between Western Europe and Asia by about 5,000
nautical miles (n.m.) and between the US East Coast and Asia by about 3,500
n.m.
2.02      The Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez operated the
Canal under a concession until July 26, 1956, when the Egyptian Government
took over the canal, and set up SCA, an autonomous legal entity, to manage,
operate, maintain and improve it. In December 1959, the Bank lent US$56.5
million (243-UAR) to: widen and deepen the Canal; improve Port Said opera-
tions; and supply floating equipment to replace obsolete equipment and to meet
future requirements. The project was carried out satisfactorily and, despite
closure of the Canal in 1967 as the result of hostilities in the Middle East,
the loan was repaid on schedule. Canal operations under SCA were efficient
and uninterrupted from 1956 to closure in 1967; the Canal had become the
principal route by which Middle East oil was transported to markets in Europe
and the Western Hemisphere. In 1966, 36% of petroleum loaded in the Middle
East and 14% of world seaborne traffic passed through the Canal. Dry cargo
represented only 5% of the combined loading and unloading for European and
American ports, but from 24% to 41% of loading and unloading for Asian and
African ports located on the main routes served by the Canal. The SCA's
operations were highly profitable; operating expenses, including depreciation
and interest, amounted to 12% of revenue; most of its net revenue was trans-
ferred to Government as royalty, income tax or profit; such transfers growing
from US$15.1 million in 1957 to US$195.5 million in 1967, the last full year
of operation making SCA Egypt's second largest foreign exchange earner after
cotton. In addition, the Canal generated service activities in the canal
zone and provided most of the income of three cities of Port Said, Ismailia
and Suez.
B. Past Traffic
2.03      Whereas, before World War II, dry cargo accounted for about 75%
of canal traffic, its share had declined to 27% by 1966 because of the rapid
growth of petroleum traffic from the Middle East after the war. The direction
of trade was, therefore, strongly imbalanced in terms of tonnage northbound
but was more balanced in terms of numbers of passage northbound and southbound.
By 1966, 93% of the petroleum passing through the Canal went to Europe, 6% to
North America and 1% to Africa. While the average number of tankers passing
through the Canal from 1962 to 1966 did not vary much, the size distribution
changed considerably.  In 1964 tankers of over 50,000 dwt carried only 16% of



-3-
oil traffic, but by 1966 they carried more than 40%; the first tanker of over
100,000 dwt was built in 1965, and for the first time, the permissible draft
of the Canal became an obstacle to future traffic development. SCA prepared
an expansion program, the first stage of which would have brought the permis-
sible draft to 14.6m (48 ft) in 1972, enabling tankers of up to 300,000 dwt to
pass in ballast and tankers of up to 100,000 dwt laden. The Canal was closed
before the dredging program started.
C. Closure of the Canal
2.04.     Closure of the Canal from 1967 to 1975 lengthened many trade routes,
creating a shortage of ships for petroleum and dry cargo. Substantial in-
creases in freight costs for oil transportation reflected longer distances.
Shipping lines and conferences of dry cargo shipowners imposed a special
closure freight surcharge, which on average was 25% of prevailing tariffs.
Dry bulk shipping rates also increased reflecting longer distances, higher
costs of bunkering and tight supply of ships. Individual countries have felt
the closure of the Canal, with some having a decline in port traffic (such as
European ports in the Mediterranean) and some having a marked increase (such
as bunkering ports in West Africa and Canary Islands). Egypt lost the foreign
exchange earnings from canal dues and the imports and exports of some coun-
tries have suffered from increased transport costs. Total costs and transfers
prior to closure are not known; based on estimates by the UNCTAD in 1973, the
shipping costs increases alone may be of the order of US$10.0 billion.
2.05      Closure of the Canal changed the shipping industry.  The petroleum
shipping industry ordered additional tankers to be built and the number of
large tankers (over 125,000 dwt) increased substantially from 1.2% of world
tanker tonnage in 1966 to 42% in 1975; most tankers built during closure are
unable to use the Canal fully laden at its preclosure draft. In addition, a
number of pipelines have or are being developed to provide alternative routes
to Europe for Middle East oil. Among them are the recently opened Suez-
Mediterranean (SUMED) Pipeline from Suez to Alexandria in Egypt, (Map 12567),
with an initial capacity of 80 million tons, the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline in
Israel, operating with an annual capacity of 20 million tons and the Iran-
Turkey pipeline, planned to begin operations in 1977 with an initial capacity
of 20 million tons.
2.06      Between 1967 and 1973, the Canal was the demarcation line between
the Egyptian and Israeli armies. Fortifications were built on its banks; the
channel was mined; artillery duels caused damages to buildings; the towns of
El Kantara and Suez were almost entirely destroyed; Port Fouad shipyards, and
the towns of Ismailia and Port Said were damaged; much of the floating equip-
ment was evacuated safely; the remainder was sunk or damaged. Clearance of
the Canal was started in k.Dfil 1974 onwards and it reopened in June 1975 at
its previous depth 11.6m (L8 ft).



-4-
D. Present Situation
2.07      The cost of reopening the Canal and restoring its pre-1967 efficiency
was estimated in 1974 at US$288.0 million, of which US$181.0 million was for-
eign exchange. The foreign exchange cost of rehabilitation was covered by
loans from Arab countries totalling US$125.0 million, an IBRD loan of US$50.0
million (Loan 1064-EGT) and participation in kind (wreck removal) by the US
Government equivalent to US$6.0 million. In addition, the Egyptian, French,
U.K., US and USSR Navies have removed more than 400,000 mines, explosives and
debris from the Canal bed; the cost of this removal is not known but was cer-
tainly high.
2.08      The Canal is presently open to ships of about 60,000 dwt loaded and
200-225,000 dwt in ballast. Traffic has increased steadily since reopening
and the number of transits by the end of 1976 was about 80% of 1966 levels.
Tankers account for 17% of transits and 41% of SCRNT against 47% and 75%
respectively in 1966, whereas non-oil traffic exceeds pre-closure levels by
61%.  The change in traffic patterns reflects the fact that the Canal cannot
accommodate much of the tanker fleet now being used for seaborne crude oil
transport. As soon as the decision to reopen was taken, SCA decided to resume
its development program and dredging started again early in 1976. In the mean-
while, SCA appointed consultants Maunsell/Coopers and Lybrand (United Kingdom)
and Sogreah (France) to study the optimum size and timing of the expansion.
The study was mainly financed by grants from the British and French governments
and the Bank found the terms of reference satisfactory. As stipulated in Loan
Agreement 1064-EGT, the Bank was given adequate opportunity to comment on the
study and appraised the proposed project on the;basis of the consultants' find-
ings.
III.  THE SUEZ CANAL AUTHORITY
A. General
3.01      The Suez Canal Authority, a state-owned authority, was set up in
1956 to manage, operate, maintain and improve the Canal. SCA's statutes pro-
vide that it is an autonomous legal entity administered by a Board of Directors
and a Chairman, who is also the Chief Executive; all are appointed by the
President of the Republic. By law, SCA (i) is exclusively competent to issue
and enforce regulations regarding canal operations; (ii) has authority to levy
tolls on traffic; (iii) is forbidden to discriminate between users; and, (iv)
is bound by the international instruments relative to the Canal, such as the
Constantinople Convention of 1888 (Annex 3). SCA also (i) operates as a com-
mercial entity; (ii) can own, appropriate, let and hire property; and, (iii)
has authority to borrow, including specific powers to borrow from foreign
sources. The legislation is adequate for the purposes of the project and for
a lending operation.

3.02      In addition to operating the Canal, SCA holds all of the capital of
affiliated companies. These deal with shipbuilding and repair (Timsah Ship-
building Co., Canal Naval Construction Co., Suez Marine Arsenal Co.), civil
and marine works (Canal Harbour Co.), ship equipment and ship services (Port
Said Engineering Co, Canal Mooring and Projectors Co.), and manufacturing of
ropes (Canal Rope Co.). SCA appoints their Boards of Directors; its financial.
liability is limited to channeling Government loans to the companies; it
receives 10% of the companies' profits after deduction of reserves, and the
balance is divided between the SCA and the companies' workers in a 75:25
ratio. In 1975, SCA's income from the companies amounted to LE 370,000
(US$925,000) i.e. about 1% of SCA's revenue in that year. As authorized by
legislation enacted in 1974, the affiliated companies are presently forming
mixed companies with participation of foreign capital, which SCA is debarred
from doing, for salvage works, consulting services, etc. The present arrange-
ments regarding the affiliated companies do not impinge upon the project.
B. Organization and Management
3.03      SCA's Board of Directors comprises the ten heads of the Authority's
main departments, dealing with planning, works, transit, finance, legal, ship-
yards, procurement, administration, projects and affiliated companies. In
addition, two offices (Public Relations and Follow-Up) report directly to the
Chairman; Annex 4 shows the organization of SCA, the headquarters of which are
in Ismailia. The operational efficiency achieved since the reopening of the
Canal is a tribute to the present management's ability. However, the present
composition of the Board makes it more an internal committee and may limit the
experience and expertise it could draw from suitable external directors, but
it is adequate for managing and operating the Canal.
3.04      SCA's Departments are autonomous, with their own accounting and per-
sonnel sections; they work independently within their own field budget and
coordination is effective only at the Chairman's level. While this organiza-
tion can be considered adequate for usual operations; it is not for the pur-
poses of the project, which will require close coordination between depart-
ments. As a consequence, a project management unit has been established;
details are given in para 4.18 infra.
3.05      The Planning Department, which is responsible for long-term devel-
opment, is fully competent in engineering, but lacks expertise in economic
and financial evaluation and planning. The Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project
(Loan 1064-EGT) included provision for strengthening the SCA's capabilities
in these areas with the assistance of consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
SCA has undertaken to establish in the Planning Department, not later than
December 31, 1977, a financial, economic, and traffic planning office, satis-
factory to the Bank. Coi'mercement of the staffing of this office is a condi-
tion of effectiveness of tie proposed Bank Loan.



-6-
C. Operations
3.06      SCA controls navigation in the Canal, which is governed by rules
issued by SCA, that define procedures to be followed in approaching the
entrances, forming convoys, and transit. Transiting vessels are organized
in convoys, one northbound and two southbound every 24 hours; southbound
convoys anchor in by-passes to allow the northbound convoy to transit without
stopping. These arrangements are adequate and operations are satisfactory.
However, an improved convoy system appears feasible, by which vessels would
transit both directions without stopping. It was agreed that when SCA had
experience of operating the canal at 16.lm (53 ft) draft, they would inves-
tigate alternative convoy systems, including the four convoy system, as pos-
sible ways of increasing canal capacity, subject always to safety considera-
tions (para 4.22). SCA also operates all tugs, signal stations, navigational
aids, etc; the equipment is sufficient for the present level of traffic, but
needs to be modernized to accommodate the increasing traffic of large tankers.
To that end, the Suez Canal Rehabilitation Project included the installation
of navigational aids, radio and radar systems; this has not yet been done
because SCA has yet to decide on the system for transiting convoys in the
future (para 4.22).
D. Maintenance
3.07      Maintenance of facilities and equipment is adequate for the purposes
of the project. The main workshop is situated at Port Fouad; Loan 1064-EGT
includes an allocation for replacement of its equipment and consultants are
in the process of being appointed to plan its organization and development.
E. Staffing and Training
3.08      SCA employs at present about 11,500 staff, including 244 pilots, 50
tug masters and 12 harbor masters. The number of staff is about 20% less than
before closure, and SCA is recruiting new staff; there is no difficulty in
recruitment and personnel are willing to return to the Canal zone. However,
because no staff was recruited during eight years, a large number of staff are
approaching retirement age, and new staff needs to be trained. SCA's training
program for 1975-76 covers 1,500 staff and is adequate for the purpose of the
project as is the organization of the Training Department. A sound program
exists for training workshop staff over a four-year period; execution of the
program has started and the proposed project cost estimates inciude an alloca-
tion to finance the workshop training center to be developed in the shipyards
(paras 4.04 and 4.06).



- 7 -
F. Insurance
3.09      SCA has full and adequate insurance coverage for all risks including
third party liability for damage caused by its personnel or equipment. In
accordance with the law of the sea, shipmasters are responsible for damage to
and by ships.
G. Finance
3.10      The main source of SCA's revenue is canal dues which are set in
accordance with the terms of the Egyptian Government's Declaration of April
24, 1957 to the United Nations (Annex 3). Some subsidiary income is also
derived from affiliated companies and the sale of water and electricity. SCA
pays 5% of its gross income from canal dues to the Government as a royalty and
also income tax. As formerly, the surplus for 1975, after payment of royalty,
taxes and interest on outstanding debt, has been transferred to the Government
although the statutes do not so require.
3.11      SCA' annual budget for current and capital expenditures is reviewed
by the Finance and Planning Ministries and is approved by Presidential Decree.
The annual budget is based on the past year's results and includes SCA's local
and foreign currency requirements for the next year. Within the limit of the
approved budget, SCA can 'draw foreign exchange from the Central Bank without
further approval and this procedure appears to work smoothly now that the
Canal is operational. These arrangements are adequate for the purpose of
the project.
H. Canal Dues
3.12      Prior to the reopening of the canal, SCA appointed various consul-
tants (Shipping Consultants A/S, Norway; Westinform, UK; ASCOT, France; Pacific
Consultants International, Japan) to study potential traffic patterns and to
make recommendations on the structure and level of dues.
3.13      After reviewing the consultants' proposals, SCA decided to base their
tariffs on Special Drawing Rights (SDR). SCA fixed tariffs for transit are
1.611 SDRs per Suez Canal Net Registered Ton (SCNRT) for laden vessels with a
20% discount for ballast vessels and surcharges of 5% and 7.5% on container
ships.  This level is approximately 100% above the 1967 level for laden vessels
and 200% for vessels in ballast. By statute, SCA is bound by the terms of the
Egyptian Government's Declaration of April 24, 1957 to the United Nations, by
which "any increase in the current rate of tolls within any twelve months, if
it takes place, shall be limi-ed to 1%; any increase beyond that level to be
the result of negotiations."  3CA has presently no immediate plans to increase
dues, since they believe that Lhe current level is appropriate to the present



state of the world shipping market.  Significantly, the surcharge of 10% on
container ships, which was established when reopening the Canal, was reduced
to 5% and 7-1/2% for two and three tier container ships as from January 1,
1977.
I. Audit
3.14      Auditors from the Government's Central Organization for Accounting
and Auditing audit SCA's accounts. The audit is satisfactory and acceptable
to the Bank.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The objective of the project is to enable ships of up to 16.lm
(53 ft) draft to transit the Canal. The project is the first stage of the
development program planned by the SCA, the second stage of which is further
deepening and widening to enable vessels of 20.4m (67 ft) draft to transit.
Two independent firms of consultants employed by the SCA (Maunsell-Great
Britain; Sogreah-France) in accordance with the provisions of the Bank Loan
Agreement 1064-EGT, to recommend the optimum size and phasing of the enlarge-
ment, have both recommended that the 16.1m (53 ft) draft scheme is the optimum
at this stage, which the Bank accepts. In accordance with Section 3.03 of
Loan Agreement 1064-EGT, the Bank had an opportunity to comment on the consul-
tants' studies.
4.02      The project as planned will have adequate capacity to meet expected
demand up to the year 1985 or thereabouts. By then, it will be necessary to
increase capacity of the 16.lm (53 ft) Canal, or to restrict the number of
vessels that can transit the Canal. Increased capacity can be obtained either
(i) by constructing additional by-passes, with eventual dualling of the Canal
(as recommended by Maunsell), or (ii) by changing to a 36 hour transit cycle
with the construction of additional anchorages (as recommended by Sogreah),
or (iii) by allowing small ships to pass in opposite directions (para 3.06).
4.03      The consultants also recommended that further deepening and widening
for vessels of 20.4m (67 ft) draft should be commenced immediately on comple-
tion of the first stage, which SCA plans to do. However, the Bank considers
that the 20.4m scheme is more questionable. The feasibility of that project
will depend particularly upon the anticipated volume and distribution of in-
terregional seaborne crude oil movements (para 5.48). SCA and the Government
have agreed that any further expansion of the Canal shall be undertaken only
after (i) they have decided, after due consideration of other works includ-
ing those necessary to satisfy the expected traffic demand at 16.1m (53 ft),
that such works are justified in the context of national economic development



-9-
priorities; and (ii) they have given the Bank adequate opportunity to exchange
views with them on proposals for such expansion. SCA's strengthened Planning
Department (para 3.05) will undertake the necessary review of all relevant
factors and data in that respect.
B. Description
4.04      The project is to deepen and widen the existing Canal to a depth of
19.5m (64 ft) and an appropriate cross-section (which varies in different sec-
tions of the Canal according to soil conditions) to allow 16.lm (53 ft) draft
ships to transit the Canal, to construct additional by-passes, to improve the
alignment of the Canal and to meet projected future demand. The project as
planned by SCA is described hereinafter.
(a) Civil Works
(i) Dry Excavation. Removing the sand on the east
bank above water level for the appropriate dis-
tance from the existing Canal to enable the new
bank protection to be constructed in advance of
the widening of the Canal by dredging.
(ii) Bank Protection. Removing the existing bank
protection and reconstructing-a new revetment on
the new alignment; the alignment is designed for
the 20.4m draft Canal, therefore avoiding high
reconstruction costs, if and when further widening
becomes necessary. The additional cost is, there-
fore acceptable.
(iii) Dredging. Excavating the Canal and its approaches
to the new dimensions (approximately 525 million
cu.m to be dredged) is the major item in the project
accounting for approximately 66% of the cost. Typical
cross section is shown in Map 8794 and Annex 5 gives
the detail of quantities to be dredged.
(iv) Breakwater. A main breakwater is to be constructed
to the east of Port Fouad by-pass. An extension
to the existing western submerged breakwater and
building a groyne to the west of Port Fouad by-
pass may also be required.
(v) Miscellaneous Civil Works. Demolition and recon-
struction of Loiring caissons; mooring quays for
SCA service ves3els; additional mooring facilities;
workshop traii ;g center; and workshop extension.



- 10 -
(b) Equipment, Spare Parts and Materials. Required for the operation
of the enlarged Canal. Necessary equipment will be: additional
navigational aids; radar installations at Port Said, Ismailia and
Suez; ships monitoring and control system; additional tugs for
escorting very large tankers; floating equipment including a float-
ing dock for dredgers, mooring and service launches; fire-fighting
and pollution control equipment, vehicles and other ancillary
equipment. Annex 6 gives details of the list of equipment.
(c) Consultants and Technical Assistance. Consultants are employed to
assist the SCA in completing the engineering design and in program-
ming project execution; experts may be required to strengthen the
proposed project management unit.
C. Engineering
4.05      Final engineering of the project is not complete but the project as
planned will meet the objectives. SCA have prepared engineering designs and
tender documents for the contracts which have already been awarded (para 4.07)
and for the works which they are undertaking themselves; the items in the
project which still have to be designed or require engineering decisions to
be made include:
(i) design of bank protection; the protection presently under
construction is based on previously used methods and both
consultants have recommended alternatives; the SCA are
undertaking research and engineering for the optimum method
and the contracts will be amended accordingly;
(ii) breakwater design; additional subsurfaces investigations are
necessary before the design can be completed and consultant's
services may be necessary; and
(iii) details of radar system, navigation aids, etc. Consultant's
services may be necessary to assist in the design and super-
vision.
Annex 7 gives details of the engineering evaluation.
D. Cost Estimates
4.06      The project is estimated to cost US$1,002.9 million, including con-
tingencies, but excluding customs duties on basic equipment because SCA is
exempt by law from such duties, and interest on external loans during con-
struction. The foreign exchange coxuponent is estimated at $675.7 million or
67%. Annex 9 gives details of the cost estimates which are summarized below,
and Annex 10 indicates phasing of expenditure spread in 1975-1981.  It has



- 11 -
been assumed that expenditures for physical contingencies will be incurred
in 1980. Expenditures in 1981 are retention moneys for civil engineering and
some equipment contracts. Additional details and computations appear in Proj-
ect Files. The cost estimates were reviewed and agreed with the SCA during
negotiations. In accordance with exchange rate reforms introduced by the Gov-
ernment, the appropriate parallel market rate for foreign exchange transac-
tions has been used in preparing these estimates.

Price contingencies are computed in accordance with Bank's guidelines; based
on January 1976 prices, escalation on civil works is 13% in 1976, 12% each
year from 1977 to 1979 onwards, and 10% in 1980.  Two exceptions were made
(i) for contracts which have been let (para 4.07) and include a clause fixing
the maximum amount of price escalation payable to the contractor and (ii) for
dredging conducted by SCA's own fleet, escalation has been taken at approxi-
mately half the rates for civil works as depreciation which accounts for about
half the cost is not subject to inflation.
4.07      Contracts for appr>ximately 60% of the total cost have been let and
where applicable the estima'Ls have been based on actual contract prices,
thereby reducing the risk of underestimating costs. Where contracts are on a
fixed price basis, or where a maximum percentage is allowed for inflation, it



- 12 -
has been assumed that tender prices have included an allowance for inflation
during the period of construction and have therefore been discounted to 1976
costs for the purposes of economic evaluation. All costs in the above table
are therefore 1976 costs with the appropriate price contingency added to give
current costs. Rates for the dredging work to be carried out by SCA are
based on costs supplied by the SCA and include amortization and loan interest.
Rates for the balance of the dredging work are based on tender prices already
received, SCA's costs and the consultants' estimates. Since detailed engineer-
ing for the remainder of the civil engineering works is not available, the
estimates are based on SCA's estimates. The estimates of cost for equipment
are based on SCA's list of equipmment requirements and SCA's estimates.
Physical contingency of 10% allows for unforeseen expenditure both for the
contracts let and for contracts to be awarded.
E. Items Proposed for Bank Financing
4.08      The proposed Bank loan of US$100.0 million will contribute towards
the foreign exchange cost of the following project elements to the extent
stated:
US$ Million
Equipment, Spares and Materials                 19.0
Civil works including dredging                  63.0

F. Financing Plan
4.09      The financing plan is summarized below:

SCA (from internally generated funds)                 327      123        450
Others - expected foreign borrowing
currently under discussion
(Arab and other external sources,
including US$89 million from Japan)                 -       243       243
327      676       1003



- 13 -
4.10      The present Japanese credit is for 26 years including a seven years
grace period at 2% interest. The Saudi Fund Loan terms are 20 years, includ-
ing a five years grace period at 3.5% interest. The terms and conditions for
Arab and other external loans have been assumed to be 19 years with a four
year grace period at 3.5% interest. The proposed Bank loan will be for 20
years including a 5 year grace period at 8.0% interest.
4.11      It is expected that local currency costs and foreign exchange costs
to the extent stated above (para 4.09) will be financed from SCA's internally
generated funds. The Government has agreed to permit SCA to retain that part
of its earnings necessary to complete the project and has also guaranteed cost
overruns.
4.12      The Government and SCA have confirmed that the necessary external
finance is being secured; execution of the satisfactory agreements between SCA,
the Government, and other external sources will be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed loan. Failure of the other loans to become effective by March
31, 1978 is a condition of default.
4.13      Formal arrangements will be made with the co-financiers for exchange
of information during execution and supervision of the project.
G. Project Execution, Supervision and Reporting
Execution
4.14      The SCA is competent to execute the project with the assistance of
consultants for (i) additional soil investigation and engineering design of
breakwater, (ii) finalization of details of the project and (iii) programming
project execution, including the critical path program to ensure that all ele-
ments of the project are completed as required to prevent any delay in comple-
tion due to a delay in any one element.
Construction Schedule
4.15      Construction which commenced in 1975, will extend to September 1980.
The execution program shown in Annex 10 and the critical path program has been
discussed and finalized with SCA. Allowing for unforeseen delays and addi-
tional work, the Bank expects that the Canal will be open to 16.lm (53 ft)
draft vessels by December 1980.
Supervision
4.16      In order to coordinate all aspects of execution of the project, SCA
has established a Project Mar±-gament Unit (PMU) within the Project Department.
The PMU, under the control of he Project Director will complete the planning,
and supervise the execution of the project and will have five senior officers
responsible for the different aspects of project implementation: (i) the



- 14 -
Project Planning Manager, (ii) the Engineering Supervisor, (iii) the Dredg-
ing Superintendent, (iv) the Cost Controller and (v) the Personnel Manager.
Annex 11 gives the organization chart for the PMU and Annex 12, job descrip-
tions for the senior personnel.
4.17      Consultants satisfactory to the Bank will be employed, as needed,
to assist PMU in carrying out its activities under the project.
Reporting
4.18      The project management unit will provide SCA with quarterly progress
reports, including updating of the critical path. Copies of these reports,
the format of which has been agreed with SCA, will be sent to the Bank.
Retroactive Financing
4.19      Retroactive financing for an amount of US$700,000 from January 1,
1977 may be necessary for:
(i) consulting services for project design and finalization,
(paras 4.05 and 4.14). However, some or all of these ser-
vices may be financed from the proceeds of Loan 1064-EGT,
which includes an allocation for the study of Suez Canal
expansion; most of the amount allocated has not been
disbursed, because foreign grants financed the study
(para 2.08); and
(ii) technical assistance as needed for the project management
unit (para 4.17).
H. Procurement and Disbursement
4.20      By December 1, 1976, contracts had been awarded for the dry excava-
tion, the bank protection, approximately 56% of the dredging, and a small
amount of miscellaneous civil work, amounting to 52% of the estimated con-
struction cost. SCA are undertaking approximately 26% of the dredging work
(10% of the total cost). It is probable that local contractors will under-
take the work included under miscellaneous construction, such as small wharves
for harbor craft and mooring launches. Dredging and all other contracts for
US$100,000 and above, to be financed by the Bank, will be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group
"Guidelines for Procurement". Contracts of less than US$100,000, financed by
the Bank, will be procured using SCA's normal procurement procedures which are
satisfactory. It is unlikely that local suppliers of floating equipment will
bid due to the heavy backlog of orders for the rehabilitation of existing
equipment. For the purpose of bid comparison, a domestic preference of 15%
or the customs duties, whichever is lower, will apply. A preference of 7.5%
will be granted to bona fide domestic contractors in the evaluation of bids
for civil works.



- 15 -
4.21      For civil works including dredging, disbursements will be on the
basis of 100% of foreign expenditures; for equipment, spare parts and
materials, 100% of the CIF landed cost of items directly imported, 100% of
the ex-factory cost of local manufactures and 80% of local expenditures for
imported items procured locally. Technical assistance will be reimbursed on
the basis of 100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures for
such assistance as is locally procured. Annex 13 shows estimated disburse-
ments under the loan.
I. Safety
4.22      The safety of ships in transit through the Canal is of prime impor-
tance to the SCA and with large tankers beginning to use the Canal, safety
becomes even more important. Considerable research, which will benefit SCA,
has been done by the consultants into safe stopping distances and maneuver-
ability of ships in confined waterways. Tugs will be required to escort
tankers above a certain size through the Canal to assist in stopping the
tankers and enabling them to moor in an emergency. Additional navigational
aids and lighting of the Canal will have to be installed to improve safety of
navigation in all weather conditions. Provision has been made in the esti-
mates for equipment for this, and detailed requirements will be identified
later, following the conclusions of consultants' studies and SCA's final
choice of a traffic control system.
J. Ecology
4.23      The ecology of the area should not be affected by the enlargement
of the Canal. The dredged material is being deposited to the east of the
Canal, a largely uninhabited desert which will be unaffected by the deposited
spoil. At the north end, the Port Fouad by-pass, which is a new length of
canal, will pass through Menzala Lake. The lake exists on both sides of the
existing Canal and as can be seen from Map 12591, the new section of canal
affects such a small part of the Lake that the ecology of the area is unlikely
to be disturbed.
4.24      On completion of the project the number of laden tankers transiting
the Canal will increase and with it the risk of oil pollution both in the
Canal itself and the Mediterranean. The SCA is aware of this risk and suit-
able booms, oil skimmers, pumps and fire fighting tugs are being purchased
under the previous loan or will be procured under this project. When the
Canal is deepened, south-bound ballast tankers will be able to transit at a
greater draft than in the existing Canal and will not therefore have to debal-
last before entering the Canal. There will therefore be a reduced risk of
pollution from deballasting. The reduction of this risk is likely to be
greater than the increase ii risk of pollution from laden tankers.

4.25      The SCA is represented on Egypt's National Committee for the preven-
tion of oil pollution in the Mediterranean and Egypt is party to the recent
agreements reached between Mediterranean countries for protection of the envi-
ronment in the Mediterranean Sea.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The success or failure of the proposed project depends almost
entirely on the Canal's ability to attract large oil tankers, which are pre-
sently unable, because of their size, to use the Suez Canal. The SCA there-
fore asked two firms SOGREAR of France and Maunsell, Coopers and Lybrand of
U.K. to carry out extensive studies, under terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank.  These studies were completed in September 1976.  Both studies came
to the same conclusion that expansion of the Canal is financially economically
attractive to the SCA and is beneficial to Egypt's economy. The studies have
been evaluated and the information and analysis contained in them form a par-
tial basis for the economic evaluations of the project by the Bank.
B. Present Situation
5.02      Traffic of the Canal since its reopening has exceeded earlier expec-
tations. The total tonnage and number of ships transitting has increased.
The average number of daily transit is approximately 55, compared to 11 in the
first few months after reopening. Tonnage has increased at an even faster
rate, with the use of the Canal by larger vessels, from 2.3 million SCNRT per
month in 1975 to a level of 23 to 28 million SCNRT monthly in early 1977.
5.03      The continued growth in Canal traffic will be constrained by the
existing canal draught of 11.6m (38 ft). In recent years an increasing por-
tion of interregional movements of crude oil has shifted to larger vessels
which physically cannot transit the Canal fully laden. In 1976, the Canal
attracted 60% more bulk and general cargo traffic than it did in 1966, but
laden tanker traffic was only about one-fourth of the 1966 level (Annex 15).
The use of the Canal by the larger vessels now dominant in crude oil movement
represents the major single source of potential new traffic for the Canal.
The consultants' studies indicate that the Canal with its current 11.6m (38
ft) draft cannot be expected to achieve the 1966 level of 65 transits a day
until 1985.
5.04      The expansion of the Canal to accommodate these large crude oil
carriers will attract this traffic and accelerate the growth of traffic and
revenues from the Canal. The consultants report that ninety percent of the
anticipated incremental traffic revenues from the Canal under the proposed
project would come from the interregional shipments of crude oil. Two main



- 17 -
points have therefore been considered as critical to the appraisal. Firstly,
what is the probable interregional flow of crude oil and secondly, how much
of this would transit the Suez Canal.
C. Methodology
5.05      The translation of the interregional flows of oil into probable
traffic through the Canal is purely judgmental and is based on past trends,
current conditions, and forecasts of the particular elements involved. The
main elements involved are discussed in sections F, G and H of this chapter
and the method of converting to final traffic estimates is shown in Annex 15.
The basic inputs of interregional flows are shown in Annex 16 and the results
shown in Annexes 17 to 19. The consultants' conclusions based on similar
logic are discussed below and the estimates arrived at by the Bank are the
basis for the economic evaluation.
5.06      The Consultants' reports identified the relative contributions of
the various interregional commodity flows to future Canal traffic and reve-
nues that would result from the project. Crude oil movements from the Gulf of
Arabia, to the Mediterranean, to the Black Sea, to Northwestern Europe and to
the East Coast of North America were judged to provide the greatest potential
for future traffic growth since an expanded canal can offer distance savings
over alternative routes. The Bank's analysis has focused on these crude oil
flows, and their relevance to additional Suez traffic.
D. Interregional Crude Oil Flows
5.07      The major consuming areas relevant to the expansion of the Suez
Canal are Western Europe and North America; these areas account for just
over 60% of world oil demand, 65% of oil imports and approximately 60% of
oil imported from the Gulf in 1974. Within North America, oil consumption
and the future requirements for crude oil imports are dominated by the
United States of America. The basic assumptions are that oil will maintain
a dominant energy role, but at a decreasing rate of consumption for the
respective consuming areas. In view of the inevitable uncertainty surround-
ing any forecast of energy demand, assumptions and forecasts are based on
the best documents available such as the studies carried out by the Energy
Commission of the European Economic Community (EEC) concerning Europe and
the U.S. Bureau of Mines for the United States and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for other developed eountries.
5.08      Energy consumption in Western Europe rose approximately 20% from
1970-1974, a rate of 4.7% p a. Consumption of petroleum as a source of energy
increased by only 11.7% over the same period at a 2.8% rate p.a. Western
European production remaine2 approximately stable, declining from 3.8% of
total consumption in 1970 to 3.2% in 1974 and imports rose over this period by
approximately 15.4%, at 3.7% rate p.a. The major source of oil imports to



- 18 -
Western Europe is the Middle East, increasing from 56.8% in 1971 to 68.9% of
total oil imports in 1974. This increasing dependence of Western Europe is
reflected in the 1971-1974 growth rate of imports from the Middle East of
10.1% p.a. In 1974, 93.7% of Middle Eastern oil imported into Western Europe
was from the Arabian Gulf area.
5.09      Crude oil traffic to Europe, relevant to the Suez Canal, was 385
million tons in 1975. Based on the anticipated rate of economic growth, and
the detailed energy balance, according to sources (crude oil, gas and hydro-
electric power, oil consumption is expected to increase by 2% per year during
the next decade, but the growth of North Sea oil production is expected to
restrict imports from the Gulf to fairly stable levels. Because of the linger-
ing effects of the recent recession, and the need to firmly root the expected
recovery of economic activities, crude oil movements from the Gulf to Europe
are expected to decline slightly between 1975 and 1980 from 430 to 410 million
tons/year, but would climb to 425 million tons by 1985; these are conservative
forecasts. The present 60/40 ratio of traffic distribution between North and
South Europe is expected to change to approximately 50/50 by 1985, because
production will develop in North Europe, thus reducing the need for imports.
5.10      The USA, which imported 95 million tons of oil from the Gulf in
1975, are expected to provide the largest growth market for Middle East crude
oil in the future. Declining domestic production in the U.S., the limitation
of Canadian exports of oil and increased demand for Venezuelan oil in the
Western Hemisphere, as well as voluntary domestic limitations of production,
make the Middle East the only oil-production-region that can massively export
to the USA. As a result crude imports from the Gulf are estimated to increase
to 295 million tons in 1980, an increase of 215.3%, an annual growth rate of
25.6%. In 1980-85 period, imports to the United States from the Gulf are esti-
mated to rise to,305 million tons, a growth of 3.4% for the 5-year period. In
the subsequent 1985-2000 period, imports are expected to increase by 3% per
annum. The diminishing rate of growth reflects the changing pattern in the
use, and the development of new sources, of energy.
5.11      The increase in imports of crude oil to the USA from the Gulf in the
1975-80 period is based on the assumptions that USA consumption will increase
from 3% to 4% per annum to 1980 and USA domestic production will decrease
through this period. The most recent experience of 1976 indicates total
energy use increased by 4.8%, reversing the decline of 4.9% for 1973-75 2-year
period. Net imports of crude oil and petroleum products rose 21.4% in 1976-77,
reflecting both increased total energy consumption and declining USA domestic
production.
5.12      The rate of growth of 3.4% for the 1980-85 period is based on con-
sumption rising at a 1.5% per annum rate and a decrease in domestic produc-
tion. The post-1985 period assumes a 2.5% per annum rate of growth in USA
consumption and a decline in USA domestic production.
5.13      The Canal also offers distance savings for oil being exported from
the Arabian Gulf to Canada, Europe, and to the Caribbean for processing into
products for Central American countries, but the oil movements to these areas
are relatively minor by comparison to the Western Europe and U.S. oil markets.



- 19 -
5.14      The forecasts of crude oil movements on trade routes relevant to the
Suez Canal include provision for a considerable expansion in pipeline capacity
and throughput over the next decade. These pipelines, which deliver Middle
East crude oil to Mediterranean terminals, reduce the potential seaborne traf-
fic available to the Canal. Based on present and planned pipeline capacities,.
and the expected influence of the depression in the oil tanker market and its
implications for oil transport costs, it is estimated that pipeline throughput
for European and North American destinations will increase from 50 million
tons in 1976 to 220 million tons in 1985 of which 100 million tons, i.e. 60%
of the increase, is attributable to the Suez Mediterranean pipeline (SUMED),
the remainder being attributable mainly to increased capacity utilization of
existing pipelines. Since their operating costs are less than pipeline, trans-
shipment and demurrage charges, large crude carriers are a less costly means
of transporting crude oil between the Gulf and Europe/North America. In the
long term, the main advantage of pipelines such as the SUMED line is seen to
be in terms of transshipment to smaller Mediterranean ports that cannot accom-
modate large tankers. Crude oil handling losses, limitations in crude grades
that can be transported, political uncertainty, terminal storage requirements,
and vessel operational and programming difficulties will also serve to restrict
pipeline expansion.
5.15      Annex 16 gives details of estimated crude oil movements to Europe
and the United States over the period 1977-1985.
5.16      Altogether, sea borne crude oil traffic (i.e. after deduction of
pipeline traffic) from the Gulf to various destinations is conservatively
estimated to be:
Million Tons
Via Suez
Actual  Forecast  Forecast   Canal
Destinations                                 1975     1980       1985     1985
To Europe                                     385      270        225      144
To the USA                                     95      295        305       30
To others (Canada, Black Sea, etc.)           35        35         35       -
515      600        565      175
The distribution between the three areas reflects the traffic projections
formulated hereinabove for the various destinations. However, based on an
analysis of the current tanker fleet and current mix (paras 5.24 and 5.25) it
has been concluded that only part of that traffic will pass through the Canal
(31% of total traffic in 1985 of which the European proportion is 55% and the
USA 10%).
5.17      A higher forecast af crude oil movements would clearly result in the
recovery of the tanker market at point in time earlier than the assumed year
of 1985 (para 5.27). Should this occur the incentive to ship operators to use
the Canal will be greater and forecast incremental revenues to the Canal will
increase at higher rate than has been assumed.



- 20 -
E. Other Commodity Flows
Petroleum Products
5.18      The possible development of export refineries in the Gulf is of
particular relevance to the Suez Canal as a potential source of Canal traffic.
However, the existing excess of available refining capacity in industrial
countries, as well as the increasing consumption of refined products by oil
producing countries, as well as environmental considerations, make it unlikely
that flows of refined products relevant to the Suez Canal will increase sig-
nificantly in the near future. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Iran is
expected to be exported to Europe and the USA from 1980 onwards. Exports of
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will increase very substantially, reflecting
increased demand by the USA and diminishing imports from Venezuela and Canada.
Altogether the annual traffic of petroleum products is forecast to rise from
a total of about 8 million tons in 1977 to some 30 million tons by 1985. The
present technology of gas transport and trends in that respect make it likely
that this traffic will be transported in vessels of less than 60,000 dwt,
which are capable of passing through the existing Canal, the forecasts are
not significant in terms of evaluating the deepening of the Canal, but will
reflect on the ancillary equipment requested for operation, such as escort
tugs during transit.
Dry Cargo
5.19      Bulk cargo traffic includes iron ore from India and Australia to
Europe, coal from Australia to Europe, grain from North America to South
Asia, and bauxite and phosphate movements. Approximately 70% of the bulk
vessels employed on these trades are less than 60,000 dwt and can pass laden
through the Canal. The project will physically permit the passage of most
of the remaining bulk fleet. However, the additional traffic attracted will
amount to only about 2 million SCNRT annually, or less than 3% of the incre-
mental traffic allocable to the project.
5.20      The main flows of general cargo trade of relevance to the Suez Canal
involve the Far East, Southeast Asia, India, the Arabian Gulf, East Africa and
the Red Sea. Given the wide variety of commodities involved and the lack of
precise data, the forecasts are based mainly on (i) a general assessment of
the likely future growth of general cargo trade, taking into account historical
trends and future economic development, (ii) the good correlation observed
between world dry cargo trade and traffic in the Suez Canal, and (iii) the
likely variation in the growth of trade on individual routes. On this basis,
the general cargo trade on the routes relevant to the Canal is estimated to
increase by about 4-1/4% per annum in 1985. The distribution between conven-
tional vessels and container ships is likely to show a continued trend towards
the use of large container ships, as demonstrated, inter alia, by the distri-
bution of ships on orders in shipyards. In addition, an estimated one-third
of the container ships presently operating between Europe and the Far East
cannot transit the Canal fully loaded and additional container traffic will
therefore accrue to the Canal under the project. During the period to 1985,



- 21 -
general cargo traffic in conventional ships is expected to increase by less
than 3% annually compared to about 8% annually for container and other unitized
cargo vessels, which reflects the development of container and roll-on/roll-off
traffic over recent years. The incremental general cargo traffic, generated
under the project, would amount to 5.2 million SNCRT in 1980 and 7.1 million
tons by 1985, i.e. 6% to 7% of the total additional traffic.
F. Total Traffic
5.21      Traffic in the Canal is affected by three factors.  They are the
current fleet and its composition, the state of the tanker market, and the
level and structure of tariffs which are discussed below.
5.22      The approach adopted in forecasting the development of the fleet in-
volved (i) classifying the existing world fleet into size groups, (ii) project-
ing the future fleet taking into account deliveries of new tonnage and annual
scrappage and loss, (iii) determining the total demand for shipping and compar-
ing it to supply of shipping, and (iv) determining the existing and expected
distribution of tonnage between the categories of vessel sizes on the trade
routes relevant to the Canal. On the above assumptions, the total number of
ships passing through the Canal is expected to increase from about 17,000 in
1977 to about 24,500 in 1985 (Annex 18) or by 44% over the period. Except for
small tankers, all categories of vessels will show an increase, and the number
of tankers over 120,000 dwt will increase by 300%. Total cargo traffic will
increase from 190 million SCNRT to 365 millions (92%) whereas tanker traffic
alone will increase from 80 million SCNRT to 204 million (155%). Details are
given in Annexes 19 and 20.
5.23      However, until the expansion project is completed in 1980, traffic
in the Canal is likely to grow only from about 198 million SCNRT in 1976 to
about 219 million tons in 1980. Much of the potential dry cargo traffic avail-
able at the 16.1 m (53 ft) draft canal design has apparently now been attracted
back to the Canal and further traffic growth will largely reflect normal trade
potential. The growth in tanker traffic will be restrained by depressed tanker
market conditions, the trend away from the employment of small tankers capable
of transiting the existing Canal, and by the decline in seaborne oil movements
to Europe.
G. Current Tanker Fleet and Current Mix
5.24      The existing Canal can handle laden tankers of less than 60,000 dwt
and tankers in ballast of 200,000-225,000 tons maximum, subject to limitations
respecting vessel characteristics. This means that the Canal can presently
accommodate only about 15% o_ the world's tanker fleet laden and 35% in bal-
last.  On the Gulf-Europe t. de, the trend toward the use of larger tankers,
particularly above 250,000 dwt, is expected to continue mainly because their
daily cost of operation is much lower than that of smaller ships (in 1976 it



- 22 -
cost US$8.0 to carry one ton of oil from Ras Tanura to Rotterdam by a 250,000
dwt tanker and US$15.0 by a 60,000 dwt tanker) and because an increasing number
of oil ports in industrialized countries can accommodate them, mainly in Europe.
Over the short term, because of lack of deep draft oil terminals in the US,
direct shipments to the U.S. Gulf and East Coast will remain concentrated in
tankers of less than 120,000 dwt.
5.25      Beyond 1980, it is expected that very large crude carrier shipments
to new offshore terminals in the U.S. Gulf or to Caribbean transshipment points
will account for most long-haul crude movements from the Middle East to the
U.S. With the Canal expansion, the percentage of tankers over 120,000 dwt
using the Canal is expected to grow from 15% in 1976 to almost 60% in 1985.
Crude oil tanker traffic is estimated to reach 175 million SCNRT in 1985, com-
pared to figures of 72 million tons in 1977, an increase of over 133%, and only
an estimated 70 million in 1985 with the present 11.6 m Canal design. Annex 21
summarizes crude oil tanker traffic to 1985.
H. State of Tanker Market
5.26      The current tanker market is characterized by an oversupply of
capacity and the tanker freight rate is depressed. Ship operators are minimiz-
ing their losses through slow steaming and through lay-up. The consultants'
studies estimate that the point at which an operator is indifferent between
operating his vessel. a4 withdrawal from service is when market rates are equal
to 80% of fixed operating costs and normal variable costs under conditions of
slow steaming.
5.27      The market, which is extremely sensitive to US demand for crude oil
is seen to improve in the 1975-85 period (paras 5.10 and 5.12). Improved
freight rates from increasing oil movements will be reflected in the provision
of additional capacity through reintroduction of laid-up vessels and faster
steaming until an equilibrium is achieved in 1985. The ship operators under
these conditions will expect to cover all costs including capital costs.
5.28      The depressed tanker market situation is the critical factor in
achieving the full traffic benefits of an expanded canal in 1985. Until this
market establishes an equilibrium between the current excess supply of tanker
capacity and world demand for crude oil carrier tonnage, there will be small
incentive for ship operators to use the Canal, since little value is attri-
buted to vessel time savings. The use of the Canal must represent a cost
saving to the shipping operators. In a situation of equilibrium, in which
new capacity will be supplied at a rate just sufficient to cover increments
in demand, the ship operators will obtain a freight rate in the market which
will permit them to cover fixed and variable costs. These costs, on a daily
basis, are a value of a ship's time and measure the savings that are obtained
through use of the Canal, taking due account for the tolls to be paid, which
transfer part of the savings to the Canal operator.



- 23 -
I.  Tariffs
5.29      The level of tariffs is kept under continuous review on the basis of
a detailed analysis of all factors affecting shipping transport costs. It is
assumed that the ship operator will use the Canal if the addition to his costs
is less than the increment to revenues that can be achieved from the use of
the additional capacity represented by the days saved in Canal transit. This
daily savings can be valued in cost terms within a range which extends from
the point at which the operator will choose to operate rather than lay-up the
vessel, under condition of excess supply, to another point at which he will
recover more than full costs including capital costs, under conditions of
excess demand for shipping.
5.30      The present Suez tariff schedule provides for a flat rate computed
in SDR's equivalent to $1.84 laden and $1.48 ballast per SCNRT. Container
ships pay surcharges of 5% and 7 1/2% according to capacity. This flat tariff
structure means that the cost savings per cargo ton resulting from a reduced
voyage time are less for larger ships.
5.31      The present level of Canal tariff appears reasonably close to the
level at which SCA's revenues are maximized and has been assumed in develop-
ing traffic forecasts (para 3.13). If shipping market equilibrium conditions
prevailed, this level of tariffs could be higher, but a significant tariff
increase at the present time would reduce the attractiveness of the Canal to
larger tankers; the associated losses in traffic and revenue would largely
offset increased transit receipts from smaller vessels.
5.32      The consultants have suggested that the most suitable tariff struc-
ture, relating to future expansion plans, is one under which (i) the tariff
for ballast and laden tankers be equalized to reflect similarity in vessel
operating costs on both legs of the voyage, and (ii) tariffs per SCNRT are
reduced as vessel size increases to reflect the difference in cost savings
per ton of cargo of small and large ships. A modified tariff structure, which
could be devised to recover for the SCA a specified proportion of the savings
benefits, could be introduced over time as expansion schemes are completed.
The matter will be reviewed by the economic financial planning unit being set
up in SCA's Planning Department (para 3.05).
5.33      Ideally if advantage is to be taken of the increases in shipping
costs and changes in shipping conditions expected after 1980, then tariffs
could be increased. However, the Government and SCA are constrained both by
the Government's Declaration of April 24, 1957 (para 3.13) and the need not
only to maximize revenues for Egypt but also, through SCA's policy of maximiz-
ing traffic in the Canal, the benefits which the Canal brings to the world at
large.



- 24 -
J. Project Benefits
5.34      The process shown in Annex 15, is used to obtain both the estimates
of the increment in Canal revenues, which represent the benefits to Egypt from
the project, and the cost savings per trip, which are the global benefits from
the project. The definition of Alternative Route Choices, future tanker fleet
composition, and forecasts of interregional flows are used to derive potential
Canal traffic for both a 11.6m (38 ft) and a 16.lm (53 ft) draft.
5.35      This potential traffic minimizes its costs by using the Canal, under
the assumed cost and rate conditions for the particular year of the forecast
period, if not prevented by the size or shape of the vessel. Such traffic is
identified for both the 11.6m (38 ft) and 16.lm (53 ft) draft with no capacity
constraint on the use of the Canal by all the eligible traffic. Constraints
are introduced as traffic increases to full capacity of a 16.1m (53 ft) (1985)
and 11.6m (38 ft) (1982) canal to obtain actual traffic. The differences in
revenues generated by the actual traffic forecast are taken to be the incre-
mental benefits to the project.
K. Global Savings
5.36      The cost savings to the operator from the shortened distances on
a number of major trade routes results from (i) reducing capital and fixed
operating costs per unit of cargo due to faster turaround of ships and (ii)
reducing voyage costs and mostly fuel costs. For the oil trade, the trip
savings in time through use of the Suez Canal rather than the Cape route
as follows:
One-Way Trip Savings
Trade Route                                   Via Canal
Gulf - Black Sea                                            22 days
"   - Mediterranean                                        18  "
- N.W. Europe                                         13
- East Coast Canada/U.S.                              10  "
- U.S. Gulf/Caribbean                                  7
5.37      The project will make these transport cost savings available to a
greater number of vessels, through the expansion of capacity, and to larger
vessels which are now unable to pass through the Canal. Savings through use
of the Canal will be different for various types and sizes of vessels, and
for various routes; representative vessel categories and routes were selected
in the calculation of comparative shipping costs.
5.38      The global savings in shipping costs achieved as a result of the
project are forecast to increase from US$279.0 million in 1981 to more
than US$550 million in 1985 (Annex 21). Almost 85% of total savings will



- 25 -
accrue to oil traffic. However, because of the higher traffic volume and the
higher relative saving in ship-time, global savings are much higher for the
Mediterranean and North West Europe trades than for the North American trade,
the Mediterranean/Black Sea region is expected to draw some 45% of the bene-
fits, North West Europe, 42%, and North America, 13%. Failure of the shipping
market. to achieve equilibrium will delay realization of these benefits. If
oil movements to regions which are relevant to Suez Canal transits exceed
forecasts, then the realization of full global benefits will be accelerated.
5.39      The global savings in transport costs not recovered by the SCA will
initially accrue to shipowners and shippers and because the shipping industry
is competitive should exert downward influence on freight rates on relevant
routes.  The potential net effect on the c.i.f. landed price of oil in import-
ing countries, after providing canal tolls, is likely to be modest and affect-
ing as it does only a portion of the world's oil movements (about 10%-15% in
1985).
L. Benefits to Egypt
5.40      The benefits to Egypt are the incremental revenues from the expan-
sion and are based on present SCA tariffs. They rise through the 1980-85
period, but at a lesser rate than global benefits.
5.41      Egypt will recoup by way of transit fees approximately 45% of the
global benefits generated by the project in 1981, declining to one-third by
1985 (Annex 20), because of the forecast improvement in the tanker market and
increases in freight rates, and unless toll rates are increased.  The increase
in revenues during the period reflects the assumption of that improving tanker
market and hence, increased cost savings to ship operators through use of the
Canal, in conjunction with constant tariff levels. Any increase in tariff
levels from current levels would alter the relative distribution of global
benefits.
5.42      Under shipping market equilibrium conditions, it is estimated that
the maximum level could be approximately SDRs 2.5 per SCNRT compared to SDRs
1.6 at present. To the extent that Canal tariffs are adjusted upwards as
tanker rates improve, and the incentive to use the Canal increases, the rela-
tive share benefits that would accrue to Egypt will be maintained. Over the
longer term, and once the Canal has clearly reestablished its user markets,
it is likely that the Canal tariff system could be changed in order to recover
a greater proportion of the total benefits for Egypt while still providing
shippers with sufficient incentive to use the Canal.
i. Economic Returns
5.43      The economic evaluation of the project is based on a comparison of
the incremental costs and benefits associated with expanding the Canal from



- 26 -
its present 11.6m (38 ft) draft to one of 16.1m (53 ft). The rate of return
calculation takes into account all project costs, including physical contingen-
cies but net of price contingencies. Benefits, that is, incremental revenues,
are computed in US dollars using the current tariffs. Testing the rate of
return for changes in significant variables (Annex 22), we obtain:
CI (Existing Cost                C2 (Cost Estimates
Estimates)                     increased by 25%)
Global Returns:
Tanker Market
Equilibrium in 1985          31.0                              27.0
Returns to Egypt:
Tanker Market
Equilibrium in 1985          15.0                              12.0
1990        13.0                               10.5
Capacity Constraint
delayed to 1990              16.0                              13.3
5.44      The rate of return from global benefits of the project is 31%.  This
return, representing the value of time savings obtained by vessels using the
expanded canal, is shared by the SCA and the shipping operators. The ability
of the SCA to obtain a larger share of this return depends upon its success in
raising tariffs without discouraging desired traffic.
5.45      The economic return to Egypt from the proposed project is approxi-
mately 15%, if the tanker market achieves equilibrium in 1985. This return
declines to 13% if an excess supply of tanker tonnage persists until 1990.
If the SCA is able to delay the imposition of a capacity limit in the Canal
until 1990 through improved operational procedures, construction of bypasses,
etc., the additional traffic raises the rate of return to canal expansion to
16% and represents the most advantageous economic situation for SCA.
5.46      In the event of large cost overruns, the rates of return for all the
cases are impaired. In a situation where full recovery of the tanker market
is delayed until 1990 and a cost increase of 25% is experienced, the rate of
return declines to approximately 10.5%. This case could be considered to be
the lowest limiting case.
N.   Long-Term Development
5.47      The SCA is considering additional deepening of the Canal to a draft
of 20.4 m (67 ft). This would increase from 35% to 75% the proportion of the



- 27 -
tanker fleet able to transit the Canal laden and would permit all tankers in
ballast (from 95% under the 16.1 m (53 ft) canal). However, further Canal
deepening beyond 16.1 m (53 ft) draft is expected to produce diminishing
marginal returns, with later stages bringing lower increments in potential
traffic.  The economic feasibility of such deepening will be sensitive to a
number of factors, mainly:
(i) The costs savings inherent in using the Canal versus alter-
native routes diminishes for large vessels, i.e. the vessels
for which the deepening is designed. Traffic estimates for
large ships are therefore more sensitive to Canal tariffs
and to the decision-making formulae used by ship operators
when deciding which route to select.
(ii)  The incentive to use the deepened Canal will improve when
the tanker market stabilizes and freight rates increase.
Conditions and developments in the tanker industry will
therefore affect the feasibility of future expansion
projects.
(iii) The future growth in oil traffic from the Gulf to consuming
areas, and primarily Europe, will have an important effect
on the feasibility of future Canal expansion projects. A
sensitivity analysis has shown, for example, that the eco-
nomic return of the 20.4 m (67 ft) scheme would be halved
if oil imports from the Gulf were to remain steady from
1980. Further Middle East pipeline developments would also
affect potential Canal traffic. Egypt itself may become a
significant oil producer and exporter, and the transport
mode used to carry that oil to the Mediterranean could also
affect Canal traffic.
5.48      It is therefore necessary, before it is decided to expand the Canal,
that the various feasibility studies of such expansion should be thoroughly
updated in the light of new information, and supplemented where necessary with
additional engineering and economic studies, to be monitored by SCA's Planning
Department (para 4.03).
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
6.01      SCA is a revenue earning entity whose income is mainly (97% in 1976)
from dues levied on ships transiting the Canal; other income is derived from
towing, electricity and wat.L supplies to Canal Zone cities, shipbuilding and
repairing and equipment rental.



- 28 -
B.   Canal Dues
6.02      Canal dues are levied on ships' tonnage expressed in Suez Canal Net
Registered Ton (SCNRT) equivalent to 2.83 m3; they are not based on canal
operating costs and are not charged on the cargo carried. The current tariff
is set at 1.611 SDR per SCNRT for laden transits and 1.289 SDR for transits
in ballast; there are at the moment 5% and 7-1/2% surcharges on laden container
vessels (the US$ equivalent at January 1, 1977 were US$1.84, $1.48 and $1.93/
$1.98 respectively). Dues are payable in advance in Egyptian pounds acquired
by selling convertible foreign exchange to the Central Bank. In accordance
with exchange rate reforms introduced by the Government, dues continue to be
converted at the official rate of exchange.
C.   Operating Results
6.03      The Canal was reopened in June 1975 and revenues to the end of that
year totalled LE 43.5 million. The operating profit was LE 29.0 million and
the operating ratio a satisfactory 33%. The debt-service ratio is 5.4, com-
pared with the minimum requirement set forth in Loan Agreement 1064-EGT which
stipulated a ratio of 1.5 between the net revenue of any fiscal year and the
maximum debt service requirement for such year. Revenue from transit tolls
in 1976 totalled LE 127.2 million.
6.04      At December 31, 1975, SCA's long-term debt was as follows:
LE Million
OECF Japan                   9.7
Qatar                        4.0
Kuwait                       10.2
Central Bank                59.9
LE 83.8
Local loans from the Central Bank to meet past losses and debt service require-
ments amounting to LE 54.7 million were cancelled by the Government in 1975.
The accumulated deficit was LE 29.7 million, but cash reserves amounted to LE
21.5 million.
D.   Balance Sheet
6.05      The Balance Sheet at December 31, 1975 as summarized below includes
the fixed assets taken over when the Authority was set up in 1956, including
the Canal itself, at a nominal value of LE 1.0.

6.07      Revenue forecasts are based on canal dues at the current levels of
1.611SDR per SCNRT for lade; transits; 1.289SDR per SCNRT for transits in bal-
last and 5% and 7-1/2% surcharges on laden container ships (para 6.02). Costs

have been projected at 1976 levels with provision for normal increases in
salaries and wages, on the assumption that future dues will be adjusted to
account for inflation. No provision has been made for transfers of revenue
surpluses to the Treasury, although 1975 surplus was so transferred, Annex 23
gives details of other assumptions.
6.08      Cash flow estimates indicate that SCA will generate sufficient funds
to service its debt and to finance the local currency cost of the project LE
208.3 and LE 86.0 million of foreign expenditures, leaving a cash surplus of
LE 18.2 million at the end of 1981. A summary of the 1976-1981 cash flow
details of which are given in Annex 24 is as follows:

Total           127.7
Surplus          18.2
It should be noted that the conversion of canal dues at the official rate of
exchange has the effect of reducing the funds available to the SCA during this
period by some LE 550.0 million.
6.09      The capital resources available to and required by SCA during the
ten-year period 1976-85 are summarized below. About 51% of the funds required
for capital investment during the period of execution of the project (1976-81)
will be provided from SCA's own resources and the remaining 49% from loans.

While no specific provision has been made for the further deepening of the
Canal to 20.4 m (67 ft) an estimate of LE 310.0 million has been included
above for capital expenditure during the period 1982-85.
F.   Financial Covenant
6.10      Because of the structure of the balance sheet (para 6.05) the usual
financial covenants for debt/equity ratios and the return on net fixed assets
have not been sought for this project. However, SCA acceded to a debt limita-
tion covenant, namely, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, SCA will not
incur any further debt unless its net income for the fiscal year next preceding
the date of such incurrence, or for a later twelve month period ended prior to
the date of such incurrence, whichever is the greater, shall not be less than
1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year
on all its debt including the debt to be incurred.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The Government has agreed to:
(i) retention by SCA of that part of its earning necessary to
complete the project according to schedule (para 4.11); and
(ii) guarantee cost overruns (para 4.11).
As recorded in the Draft Guarantee Agreement (Sections 2.02 and 2.03).
7.02      SCA and the Government have agreed not to undertake any further
expansion of the Canal until:
(i) it has been decided, in the context of national economic
development priorities, that such works are justified
(para 4.03); and
(ii) the Bank has been given adequate opportunity for an
exchange of views on proposals for such expansion (para
4.03);
As recorded in the Draft Loan Agreement (Section 3.06), and the Draft
Guarantee Agreement (Section 3.03).



- 32 -
7.03      SCA has undertaken not to incur any debt, unless it is shown that
its net revenue for the fiscal year next preceding the date of such incurrence,
or for a later twelve-month period ended prior to the date of such incurrence,
whichever is greater, shall not be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt serv-
ice requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all its debts including the
debts to be incurred (para 6.10).
As recorded in the Draft Loan Agreement (Section 5.04).
7.04      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan are:
(i)  Commencement of the staffing of the financial, economic
and traffic planning office in the Planning Department
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.05); and
(ii)  the prior conclusion by the SCA of arrangements, satis-
factory to the Bank with other parties for the financing
of the foreign exchange cost of the project not covered
by the Bank Loan (para 4.12);
As recorded in the Draft Loan Agreement (Section 7.01).
7.05      Failure of other loans to become effective by March 31, 1978 is a
condition of default (para 4.12).
As recorded in the Draft Loan Agreement (Section 6.01).
7.06      Formal arrangements will be made with co-financiers for exchange of
information during execution and supervision of the project (para 4.13).
7.07      Subject to the conditions of effectiveness hereinabove, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$100.0 million for 20 years including five
years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
World Bank Operations in the Transport Sector of Egypt
The proposed project would be the third Bank Group operation for
the benefit of the SCA and the sixth for transport in Egypt. In addition the
Government has also asked the Bank for assistance with a National Transport
Survey.
I.   Railways
1.1  Credit 284-UAR, February 19729 First Railway Project
The project formed the first phase of Egyptian Railways (ER) Invest-
ment Program for the period 1971-1976 and consisted of all the investments to
be made in the fiscal year 1972 and 1973 and the complete installation in the
fiscal years 1972 to 1976 of electric signalling, interlocking and automatic
block on two major sections and a centralized traffic control on a third im-
portant line. The cost was estimated at US$134.3 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$65.7 million equivalent; the credit was for
US$30.0 million. Project execution was delayed about a year by shortage of
foreign exchange; some items had to be deferred. The project is expected to
be completed by the end of 1977, one year behind schedule.
1.2 Loan 1098-EGT, April 1975, Second Railway Project
The project covers all planned expenditure for 1975-1977; this
comprises motive power and rolling stock, relaying of track, signalling and
communications systems, spare parts, and workshop equipment. Total cost of
the project is estimated at US$296.0 million equivalent, of which US$148.0
million are foreign exchange. The Bank loan is US$37.0 million and the
difference is financed from Arab sources and bilateral suppliers' credits.
The progress of physical investments items under the project is generally
satisfactory. However, declining traffic, low availability of motive power,
higher staff and other costs and non-adjustment of tariffs have resulted in
a worsening financial situation, and the railways are operating at a heavy
deficit.
II. Ports
2.1 Loan 1239-EGT, April 1976, First Alexandria Port Project
The project provides for rehabilitation of the facilities and
equipment of the port and for developing additional facilities, and for
improving port management. The main elements of the project are deferred



ANNEX 1
Page 2
maintenance dredging, a new channel, three deep sea berths, storage facil-
ities, cargo handling and floating equipment. Total cost is estimated at
US$151.0 million, of which US$95.0 million are foreign exchange. Loan 1239-EGT
is US$45.0 million, the remainder being financed by USAID and OECF of Japan.
The Guarantee Agreement includes a clause by which Egypt will implement no
major port development before the completion of the ongoing national trans-
port survey and the national port development plan to be produced following
such survey. Consultants are presently preparing final design and civil
works are expected to start by the end of 1977; procurement of equipment
should start in mid-1977.
III. Suez Canal
3.1 Loan 243-UAR, December 1959
The project provided for widening and deepening various sections
of the canal to permit the passage of vessels having a maximum draft of 11.3m
(37'), providing various buildings (including the research laboratory),
financing the procurement of a floating dock, floating cranes, tugs, pilot
vessels and other equipment. Total cost was estimated at US$108.0 million,
of which US$56.5 million were foreign exchange, covered by the Bank loan.
The project was carried out satisfactorily, and, despite closure in 1967,
the loan was repaid on schedule.
3.2 Loan 1064-EGT, December 1974, Rehabilitation of the Suez Canal
The project provides for the procurement of equipment and material,
and for the rehabilitation of damaged or destroyed infrastructure and build-
ings, as well as for technical assistance and studies. Its objective was to
ensure that SCA obtained the necessary equipment to operate the canal under
safe conditions. Total cost was estimated at US$288.0 million, of which
US$181.0 million were foreign exchange, to be covered by the Bank loan
of US$50.0 million and various contributions, mainly from Arab countries.
Execution of the project has made good progress, and, by the end of November
1976, commitments on sources of finance other than the Bank amounted to 95%
of these sources. Commitments on the Bank loan were slower because the terms
and conditions were less favorable, however they are expected to reach 70% of
the loan amount by the end of 1977.
IV. Transport Survey
The Transport Survey is financed from the proceeds of Loan 1098-EGT
(2nd Railway Project). It covers all transport modes serving domestic and
international demand and reviews the construction and storage industries to
the extent that they influence transport costs. The Suez Canal and its ports
are however excluded from the Survey except insofar as they contribute to
serving the country's transport demand. The first phase of the Survey was
entrusted to consultants Louis Berger, Inc., (USA); their draft final report
is due to be issued by early 1977. It will include an inventory of existing
facilities, together with preliminary forecasts of traffic flows, identifica-
tion of main problem areas and a preliminary evaluation of priority transport
projects.

THE SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
International Instruments Relative to the Suez Canal
1.   The Convention de Constantinople of 1888
1.1       The Convention de Constantinople of 1888 resulted from the Declara-
tion of London relative to the Free Navigation of the Suez Canal, signed in
1885, by which the Powers "agreed to recognize the urgent necessity for nego-
tiating with the object of sanctioning, by a Conventional Act, the establish-
ment of a definitive regulation guaranteeing at all times, and for all Powers,
the freedom of the Suez Canal." The parties to the Convention agreed that (i)
"the Suez Maritime Canal shall always be free and open, in time of war and in
time of peace, to every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of
flag; and (ii) no right of war, act of hostility or act having for its purpose
to interfere with the free navigation of the Canal shall be committed in the
Canal."
1.2       Egypt became a party to the Convention in 1922 as successor to
Turkey and the sovereign of the territory through which the Canal passes.
Practice following during the wars of 1914, 1939 and 1948, and acquiesced
in, if not approved, by all concerned (i.e. the parties to the Convention) is
that the Convention must be deemed suspended for the duration of the war when
Egypt is a belligerent. The Convention is presumed to be still binding on
all the signatories; it is not operative among non-signatories, but all
nations of the world, whether signatories or non-signatories, always retain
the right to send through the Canal their merchant vessels in peace time.
2.   The Security Council Resolution of 1956
2.1       Following the Suez crisis of 1956, the Security Council agreed
in a resolution dated October 13, 1956, that (i) there should be free and
open transit through the Canal; (ii) the sovereignty of Egypt should be
respected; (iii) the operation of the Canal should be insulated from the
politics of any country; (iv) the manner of fixing tolls and charges should
be decided by agreement between the users; and (v) a fair proportion of the
dues should be allotted to development.
3.   The Declaration on the Suez Canal of 1957
3.1       The Declaration made by the Government of Egypt on the Suez Canal
and the Arrangements for its Operations was issued on April 24, 1957 in
elaboration of the principles set forth in a memorandum dated March 18, 1957.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
In the Declaration, the Government (i) reaffirms their policy and firm purpose
to respect the terms and the spirit of the Convention de Constantinople; (ii)
affirms their determination to maintain free and uninterrupted navigation;
(iii) affirms their determination to continue to levy tolls in conformity
with the agreement concluded on April 28, 1936, between the Government of
Egypt and the Suez Canal Company, and that any increase in the current rate
of tolls within any twelve months, shall be limited to 1 percent, any increase
beyond that level to be the result of negotiations, to be settled by arbitra-
tion if necessary; (iv) fixes the percentage of revenue that SCA shall pay
as a royalty to the Government; (v) embodies all regulations regarding the
Canal into a Canal Code; (vi) affirms the principle that no advantage or favor
may be granted by SCA to any user; and (vii) submits all complaints against
discrimination or violation of the Canal Code to an arbitration tribunal
if necessary.
3.2       In the Declaration, the Egyptian Government also indicated that a
Suez Canal Capital and Development Fund into which the SCA shall pay 25 per-
cent of all gross receipt will be established, "to assure that there shall
be available to the SCA adequate resources to meet the need of development
and capital expenditure for the fulfillment of the responsibilities they have
assumed and are fully determined to discharge". The Fund was not established
as such, but the necessary resources have always been made available to the
SCA for their capital expenditures.
3.3       The Government of Egypt Declaration contains the express proviso
that "the declaration, with the obligations therein, constitutes an interna-
tional instrument." It was deposited and registered at the United Nations
Secretariat on April 24, 1957.

SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Details of Engineering Evaluation
1.        Dry Excavation.  The volume of dry excavation is based on building
the new bank protection on the line required for the canal bank for a 20.4m
draft canal. This is an additional cost not required for the 16.1m draft
scheme, but avoids the high abortive cost that would be incurred if the bank
protection were built now for the 16.1m draft scheme, and subsequently widened.
The additional cost is therefore acceptable.
2.        Bank Protection.  The design of the bank protection for which the
contracts have been awarded is based on the designs developed over a long
period by the SCA, but which have not been entirely satisfactory. Both
consultants have proposed alternative designs and the SCA are continuing
their research in this field in order to improve the method of bank pro-
tection. It is possible for the contracts in progress to be changed.
3.        Dredging.  The dimensions to which the expanded canal is being
dredged have been determined for 16.lm draft vessels by the SCA following
the recommendations of the consultants employed under the previous Bank
loan. Although these recommendations differ slightly, the dimensions adopted
will achieve the objective of the project. However, it is possible that the
dimensions may not be the best solution. If for example the system of main-
tenance dredging used by SCA at present is improved, it is possible that the
depth to which the enlarged canal is being dredged could be reduced, with a
possible saving of $10 million. Alternatively, if the canal is enlarged to the
dimensions now planned, it is possible that vessels with a draft greater than
16.lm (possibly up to 17.lm) could transit the canal. The dimensions of the
canal are also dependent on the speed of the largest tankers that will transit
the canal. If the transit speed for the largest ship able to transit the
canal were reduced, the dimensions of the canal could be reduced, making a
very large saving in dredging costs. Alternatively larger vessels than pre-
sently planned may be able to transit the canal at slower speeds.
4.        Breakwater.  Although a breakwater is undoubtedly required to the
east of the Port Said by-pass to prevent siltation of the channel and to
provide wave protection for ships entering and leaving the by-pass, the exact
location and length of the breakwater have not yet been determined, and
further sub-surface investigations are necessary before the breakwater can be
designed and tenders for construction invited. The cost estimates are there-
fore very preliminary, and are based on the estimates of the consultants and
the SCA (all of which vary considerably). The Hydraulic Research Station in



ANNEX 7
Page 2
England are carrying out further research under Maunsell's contract into the
design of. the breakwater, and consultants should be retained to assist the SCA
in final engineering for a location and design of the breakwater. It is not
critical that the breakwater should be completed when the Port Said by-pass is
opened for traffic and the program allows for further research and design in
1977, with construction from 1978 to 1980.
It is possible that a groyne may be required to the west of Port Said by-pass
and that the submerged portion of the existing western breakwater may need to
be extended to prevent excessive siltation in the deepened and lengthened
channel. However, it is considered that any lengthening of this breakwater
should be deferred until the channel has been opened and the actual rate
of siltation can be measured. The cost of maintenance dredging can then be
compared with the cost of extending the breakwater.
5.        Miscellaneous Civil Works.  Demolition of existing caissons in
the area of the canal being widened has already commenced. Final engineering
for much of the work has not yet been completed, and for some items such as
the quays for service vessels, the training center and workshop, the detailed
requirements have not yet been identified. The new mooring caissons have been
designed by the SCA using steel sheet piles which involved a very high propor-
tion of foreign currency expenditure. It is possible that these caissons
could be constructed equally satisfactorily using concrete piles, with a much
smaller percentage of foreign currency expenditure, and it is recommended that
the SCA should investigate this.
6.        Equipment.  The equipment requirements are based on a list of equip-
ment supplied by SCA and include both equipment for operations (such as tugs)
and also equipment for construction of the project (such as sheet piles,
vibrating hammers, etc.) Two particular points regarding equipment have been
discussed with the SCA. It is considered that additional navigation lights
should be provided along the whole length of the canal. The present lights
are battery operated and require changing of batteries periodically. It is
suggested that the SCA should consider the use of solar-charged batteries,
which would have a theoretical life of more than 15 years and which should
therefore reduce maintenance costs.
The present system of requiring all vessels transiting the canal to have avail-
able or take on board two mooring launches and seven crew for the transit in
case of emergency stopping and mooring, could, it is considered, be improved.
The present mooring launches do not have engines, and are not therefore
efficient in assisting in mooring in an emergency. Consideration should be
given to the provision of powered launches at strategic points along the canal
possibly at signal stations every 10 km. In an emergency these could be
called out and arrive at the location of the incident to be of more practical
use in probably less time, than the mooring launches could be manned and
lowered from the vessels needing to moor. This system would require fewer
launches. They need only be manned during the period that each convoy
is passing their base station, but could be used for other purposes at other
times.



ANNEX 7

7.        Maintenance Dredging.  Maintenance dredging accounts for a very
high proportion of maintenance costs and will increase when the canal enlarge-
ment is completed. The present method of maintenance dredging is by cutter
suction dredgers, which cannot work while convoys are passing. The SCA should
investigate the use of a specially designed trailer suction dredger with self-
propelled barges which would travel to pumping stations at say lOkm intervals
where the spoil would be pumped into lagoons. Such a dredger could travel
behind a convoy and would therefore be able to work for a much greater portion
of its time. By dredging a cut of say .3m at a time, instead of the 1.5m
Cut normally made by the cutter suction maintenance dredger, at more frequent
intervals, the initial depth of cut which allows approximately 1.5m for silta-
tion could be reduced by about Im (as discussed in 3 above). A specially
designed dredger would cost less than a similar capacity normal type, as it
would not need to be designed for operating in adverse sea conditions, and
could have less powerful engines as it would not have to travel at high speed
to spoil grounds.
8.        Mooring Facilities.  A detailed analysis of all mooring facilities
required should be carried out to determine the number, type and location
of all mooring facilities necessary for the proposed future operations.
In this connection consideration could be given to the multi-purpose use
of buoys in the canal to serve both for mooring purposes in emergency and
also to carry navigation lights. If this is feasible, bollards on the
shore may not be required and if access to the bank from the canal is not
then required, the type of bank protection necessary could be affected.
9.        Dredging Measurement.  Methods of sounding and measuring dredged
quantities requires to be investigated and carefully controlled to ensure
correct payment to contractors. For example when dredging is taking place
between say -15m and -19.5m, an error of 5% in the soundings before and after
dredging could give an error in measurement of 1.725m in the actual amount
dredged, which could result in over-payment of 38% to the contractor. Even
an error of 1% in the soundings could result in an overmeasurement and over-
payment of 8%.

APPRAISAL OF
SUEZ CANAL EXPANSION PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Assumptions on which Suez Canal Authority's Financial Forecasts are Based
The financial projections are based on the following assumptions:
1.        Revenues have been derived using the traffic and tariff assump-
tions discussed in Chapter 6 of the report.
2.        Constant 1976 prices for operating costs have been assumed with
provision for normal increases in salaries and wages. Allowance has been
made for increased operating and maintenance cost as a result of the ex-
pansion of the Canal.
3.        The existing fixed assets have not been further depreciated due
to the necessity of a complete revaluation. Depreciation of fixed assets
to be acquired has been calculated using the estimated economic lives of
the assets.
4.        The terms and conditions for the proposed Bank Loan of US$100.0
million (LE 70.0 million) are 20 years including five years grace period with
interest at 8.0% p.a.
5.        The terms conditions of other foreign loans and credits are as
follows:

6.        Local currency borrowing which at December 31, 1975 amounted
to LE 59.9 is carrying an interest of 4.5% p.a. SCA are seeking to have
this debt forgiven but for cash flow purposes a 20-year repayment period
including 4 years of grace has been assumed.



ANNEX 23
Page 2
7.        Local currency requirements for the project and other capital expend-
iture will be met from internal cash generation.
8.        Royalties paid to the Government will continue at 5% of the transit
toll revenues, and income tax has been assessed at the current rate of 39.7%
of net income.
9.        No attempt has been made to allocate the cash shown to be accumulated
in the forecast cash flow statements (Annex 25). This is a matter of annual
negotiation between SCA and the Government and this cash may be held by SCA for
future investment or transferred to the Government.
10.       No provision has been made for further deepening to 20.4m (67 ft)
(para 4.03), but for cash flow purposes, capital expenditure for the period
1981-1985 has been estimated at LE 310.0 million.
