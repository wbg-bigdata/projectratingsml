Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The main development objective will be the rapid increase of water supply and sanitation coverage in the rural areas.
Government's rural water supply strategy is based on community participation in planning, constructing, operating,
maintaining and assuming financial obligations for their water systems. The proposed project intensifies this approach by
decentralizing and strengthening the communities' routines in running their systems, through technological assistance from
other more experienced communities within their departmental regions. In addition, the new approach will reach more
communities, in more remote and poorer regions, than the previous ones and will help to substantially increase coverage of
water supply and sanitation services. The secondary development objective is to modify SENASA's role in the sector from
an implementer of projects to an efficiently managed promoter of activities through the shifting of its current activities to the
private sector and non-governmental organizations while still maintaining its regulatory functions. Achievement of the
primary objective would be evaluated based on the increase of provision of water services from the current 20% to 30% at
the end of the project. Achievement of the secondary objective would be indicated by the decrease in the number of staff per
system constructed per year and the strengthening of SENASA's regulatory functions.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

Total: 55.7                   100.0%
3. Benefits and target population:
The project will target the rural population of Paraguay. Since most of the communities in the vicinity of Asuncion and the
major urban centers have already benefited from previous projects, the proposed project will provide services to the smaller
impoverished commnunities throughout the country. The project will provide water supply services to about 330
communities and expand existing systems in 10 other commnunities. Moreover the project will provide water supply and
sanitation to a group of 35 indigenous communities which could be considered as the poorest of the poor. The project will
also finance the construction of sewerage systems in 10 communities. The project, through the extension of basic services,
wiD help contribute to the reduction of poverty through improved productivity and health particularly of women and
children, by reaching an estimated 340,000 inhabitants with water supply service; another 140,000 inhabitants wil benefit
from sewage disposal systems (40,000 inhabitants with sewer networks and the others with on-site systems). Water supply
coverage would increase from 20% of the rural population in 1997 to about 30% in 2003.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Six years
Executing agencies: SENASA, a government agency under the Ministry of Health responsible for the water and
sanitation services in the rural areas, will implement the project. SENASA has been successful in implementing rural water
projects and has been increasingly entrusted with additional programs by the Government and intemational agencies. The
Bank has made three loans executed by SENASA (1977, 1982, and 1992). This would be the fourth Bank project to be
executed by SENASA.

Country: Paraguay                                               Project Title: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Project coordination: Project management and coordination will be done by the existing Planning Department of the Water
and Sanitation Directorate of SENASA. The existing unit has been able to appropriately manage and coordinate the
execution of the on-going loan. However, since the proposed loans will finance a much larger program, SENASA has
initiated a structural reorganization which, after Bank review approval, will be put in place no later than July 31, 1998.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): Although SENASA is a specialized agency of the Ministry of Health, the
Office of the Technical Planning Secretary which is dependent of the Office of the Presidency provides the policy
framework for sector development and overall guidance to the project.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: SENASA follows a standard governmental accounting
system, mainly to account for its budget execution. It has developed with outside technical assistance a computerized
accounting system that allows preparation of accounting information for budget execution and for preparation of standard
financial statements. The system also permits SENASA to keep project accounts separate from other accounts, and to keep
separate accounts for each water supply system under construction. SENASA is audited by two different G}overnment
entities. The auditors of the Ministry of Health carry out periodic internal auditing during the year. The General
Controller's Office carries out an annual audit and reports its findings to the Minister of Health. In compliance with Bank
policies, independent external auditors carry out an annual audit based on generally accepted auditing principles and send
the reports to the Minister of Public Health. These reports are also submitted to the Bank for compliance with loan
agreement requirements. External audits have been satisfactory. Annual external audits will continue to be performed and
reports submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Monitoring and evaluation will be done by the Bank and qualified
consultants. The Planning Department in SENASA will prepare regular updates on the monitoring indicators listed in
Annex 2. SENASA will prepare and submit to the Bank semi-annual reports on the progress of project implementation.
The Bank will carry out at least two full supervision missions and one partial supervision mission per year. A mid-term
review will be carried out no later than 36 months after the effectiveness date. Moreover, it is expected that SENASA
officials will visit the Bank in Washington about twice a year to discuss project implementation. Given the large number of
contracts expected in this project, SENASA will submit to the Bank semiannual updates on procurement planning and
contract management.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the   Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report No. 16346-PA;
project                             March 6, 1997
The new CAS - discussed by Executive Directors on March 27, 1997 - identifies two development objectives for Paraguay.
The first is the need to reduce poverty through programs focused on rural and peri-urban areas and the second is the need to
redefine the role of the State to concentrate on core functions.
The design of the proposed project supports these two objectives. The project through its focus on the rural areas and
smaller communities will target mainly low income groups and will provide them with basic water supply and sanitation
services. This intervention, in addition to its direct effects on reducing poverty, is expected to create opportunities in rural
areas which in tum would help mitigate current migration to the urban areas. It is important to note that employment
generation through increased investment in infrastructure and social development through improved provision of basic
services are two priorities of the GoP as reported in the CAS. The proposed project will also modify SENASA's working
procedures from a physical implementer of projects to planner and promoter of projects, contracting-out gradually all
implementation activities - studies and engineering designs, (part of) drilling of wells, promotion and community
mobilization, etc. - to the private sector and the communities themselves.

Country: Paraguay                                                Project Title: Fourth Rural Water Supply and SanItation Project
The implementation model that will be adopted in thc proposcd projcct is the same model that has bccn used in the on-going
Third Rural Water Supply project which is singlcd out in the CAS as "an cxamplc of a successful community based
operational framework that should bc replicated in othcr scctors".
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
* Low coverage of water services. In 1996 Paraguay's population was an cstimatcd 4.7 million inhabitants, half of
them living in rural areas. Some 60% of the urban and 20% of thc rural population havc piped potable water supply
services, one of the lowest in Latin America where the averagc is 81% for urban areas and 39% for rural areas.
Provision of sewerage services is cven lower: only about 27% of thc urban population is connected to a sewcrage
service, compared to an average of 53% for the Latin America Rcgion. In the urban arcas, CORPOSANA is
responsible for serving communities with populations of more than 4,000 people, while SENASA is responsible for
water and sanitation services in rural communitics with less than 4,000 inhabitants. Govcrnment strategy is to expand
water services to the rural population by supporting SENASA's strategy of implementing sustainable projects through
community participation and continuing with the creation of succcssful water associations or "Juntas". The first Juntas
were created during the implementation of the first Bank Loan in 1977. Through a second and a third loan more than
300 Juntas have been created. All these Juntas continue to exist, and most of them have successfully expanded their
systems. Despite the success of the Juntas, past governments have not been able at times to follow this strategy and
continue with the creation of more Juntas. However, the present government has adopted a strategy of aggressively
expanding rural water services and continuing with the creation of new Juntas.
* The existence of private water suppliers (Aguaterias). The rapid growth of the population in the outlying areas of
the Greater Asuncion and the slow implementation of the expansion of the water supply system to these areas have led
to the emergence of private suppliers that operate systems ranging from a few connections to as many as 600
connections. Most of these systems consist of a well, submersible pump, an elevated tank and a distribution system.
There are an estimated 250 private suppliers serving a total of about 100,000 people. The aguaterias do no follow any
formal approval process and are not regulated by any government agency. Services are provided through a license
given by the corresponding municipality. Levels of services are low both in terms of quantity and quality and tariffs are
usually much higher than CORPOSANA's rates in adjacent areas. During project preparation an in-depth analysis of
the institutional economics, regulatory environment and the financial situation of a small sample of these operators has
been initiated and should be completed before August 31, 1998. Thereafter, based on the results of the study, a pilot
project will be carried out to test the interest and potential that these operators present in participating in the increase of
service coverage in the rural areas.
* Responsibility of water supply and sanitation services. Paraguay is in a political process of democratization and
decentralization in which political movements are participating in the improvement of public services such as the
provision of water supply. Given the present low provision of water services there is a strong political movement for
the municipalization of services. There are 217 municipalities in Paraguay with elected mayors. A bill of law is being
discussed at the government level assigning the responsibility of water services to the municipalities.  Most
municipalities are presently very weak and lack the administrative and financial capabilities to plan, organize,
implement or finance water systems. However, it is very unlikely that the decentralization movement and the transfer of
responsibility of water to the municipalities will take place. In addition to the municipalities, the next local political
power are the Regional Departments of recent creation. The Regional Departments are expected to participate in
projects for the development of their corresponding departments. The country is divided in 17 Departments with elected
Governors and councils. Like the municipalities, the Departments do not have experience nor the administrative and
financial capacities to execute development projects.
* SENASA's strategy of creating the Juntas has always involved the presence of the corresponding municipality.
Juntas have on their board of directors one director representing the municipality, the others are elected by the
community for a period of two years. The proposed project will strengthen the participation of the

Country: Paraguay                                               Project Title: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
municipalities and the Departmcnts through morc consultation and involvement in the decision making process.
Furthermore, through the proposed project SENASA plans to initiate and support the creation of associations
of Juntas within the corresponding departmcnts.
* SENASA will remain in its role of promoter, planner, and financier of the rural watcr supply services, as long
as there is need to create more Juntas. Howevcr, it will slowly change its role to that of a sector regulator for
the rural communities.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
*  Project Sustainability. The government through SENASA has been successful in creating the Juntas and expanding
water and sanitation services to the rural population. Therc are more than 300 Juntas providing services to about
500,000 people. However, SENASA has been able to provide only limited technical assistance to the existing Juntas.
With the proposed project the number of Juntas will more than double and will be geographically expanded at
increasing distances from Asunci6n. Consequently, SENASA will be unable to assist the Juntas to the same extent as
in earlier projects. SENASA plans to promote and support the creation of regional associations of Juntas with the
participation of municipalities and Regional Departments, where the Junta members can have access to technical
assistance from more experienced Juntas. The proposed project will assist the Associations by providing them with
technical assistance and training. These associations of Juntas will be private associations whose members would be the
existing Juntas in the Department. The objective of an association would be to assist the Juntas in administrative and
technological aspects for operation and maintenance of the systems. It will help the weak Juntas and may provide
specific services, like water metering, billing and collection programs, reduction of unaccounted water, laboratory
services, spare parts, etc. The associations will not play any direct role in the administration or responsibility of any
particular system. The Juntas will maintain their responsibility for the water systems in a given community. These
Associations of Juntas are expected to assist SENASA in providing technical assistance and support needed by the
Juntas, especially those of recent creation, helping them in making the projects more sustainable.
* SENASA's Implementation Capacity. The main issue facing this project is SENASA's institutional capacity to
implement this ambitious program, which doubles its present implementation capacity.
*  To implement the proposed project, SENASA plans to change the modality of doing all activities in-house, and
instead use the private sector. SENASA expects to hire private consultants, non-governmental organizations,
private contractors and suppliers, the private banking system and other external groups to implement the
project. The regional associations of Juntas will promote the creation of new Juntas and will be expected in the
future to be able to help initiate the implementation of new projects within their geographical areas. SENASA
will remain and strengthen its role as regulator, planner, promoter and financial agent for the Government.
*  SENASA will implement the proposed project in a more decentralized manner, giving more responsibilities to
its regional offices, by strengthening its human resources and physical facilities. The regional offices will
concentrate its work to assisting the regional associations ofjuntas.
*  Debt Repayment by Juntas. Juntas' repayment of its debt to the Government (SENASA) is not uniform. SENASA
has not been able to manage and reduce the accounts receivable from the Juntas. During project preparation it was
found that the lack of uniformity in the recovery of the loans from the Juntas was mainly due to an inefficient collection
system from SENASA. In order to improve the collection of debts from the Juntas, SENASA has already contracted a
private financial agent to manage and collect the Juntas' debt. SENASA is committed to maintain this arrangement for
the efficient collection of its loan portfolio and will present to the Bank, by no later than April 30, 1998, a detailed plan
for the improvement of its collection performance of its loans to the Juntas.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
To assign the responsibility of water services to the Municipalities. The municipalities would replace the Juntas in
their present role. While SENASA would still play its role as financier, advisor and regulator, the municipalities would be
responsible for the administration of the water systems and would replace the Juntas in the planning, construction,
operation and maintenance of all the water systems. The Juntas would not play any role and would disappear. This
alternative, provided that the municipalities would have the capacity to administer the rural water systems, might offer the
advantage of economies of scale, through the availability of more qualified personnel. Municipal personnel would be
responsible for the administration of water systems located in different geographical areas within the municipal political
domain. Personnel from the municipality would carry out the technical and administrative activities in the various water
systems; they would determine the water charges and the billing and collection for each water system. The main reasons
why this alternative was not chosen are:
*  municipalities are still very weak in Paraguay. Only recently have mayors been elected and municipalities lack
experience in the provision of public services. Municipal finances and administrative and technical capacity are
almost non-existent;
. water and sanitation services in a given community generate few externalities that necessitate assigning their provision
to a higher level of government;
*  loss of community participation in the various aspects of project implementation and in the responsibility of the water
system, which is the main determinant for the success and sustainability for this type of projects;
*  there is no legal framework and chances to set-up one are slim.
To assign the responsibility of water systems to SENASA
In this scenario SENASA, as a govermnent agency, would be fully responsible for the planning, financing, constructing
and administration of the rural water systems. The main advantage of this alternative is that projects could be more
rapidly implemented, and perhaps at a lower cost. The Juntas or municipalities would not play any role. The main
disadvantages of this alternative are:
* over centralization of decisions, SENASA would not have the capacity to cope with this responsibility;

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
* Strengthening of SENASA's Strategy to Further Develop Community Water and Sanitation Projects. Over the
course of three loans (1977, 1982, and 1992) about 300 Juntas were created in rural communities in which water
systems and sanitation facilities have been built. All these Juntas are active and most of them have expanded their
water systems and improved their administration. The success of this project has been the active participation of the
communities, through their elected Juntas, in the various phases of the implementation. The fact that communities
contribute up to 60% of the capital costs of their project and cover all maintenance and operation costs, has ensured
ownership and long-term sustainability. In the new project, the community participation, cost recovery and full
responsibility in the O&M will remain the main anchors of the design of the project.
* Coherent Framework Between Donors. The strategy followed by SENASA in the execution of rural water systems
is very successful and is much appreciated by the government. Besides the Bank, agencies such as FONPLATA,
USAID, GTZ, PAHO, IDB, JICA, and other local agencies are financing rural water supply programs executed by
SENASA. The presence of all these agencies and their financing projects, each with their own characteristics and
conditionalities complicates SENASA's administration of projects and is exceeding SENASA's capacity to execute
them. SENASA will establish, no later than July 30, 1998, a five-year national investment plan which will expand
services to the rural population. This plan -to be updated yearly- will specify the selection criteria (such as population
size, socio-economic criteria, poverty and health indicators, service levels, willingness to pay, affordability, financial
subsidies, etc.) with which the commnunities would be selected to have access to SENASA's financing program. Any
national or intemational lender willing to participate in rural water supply would then finance slices or subprogams of
SENASA's National Rural Water and Sanitation Program.
* Need to Execute Water Systems Within a Well Defined Time Table and Financed Program. Once a community is
approached and promises are made for the construction of a water system, SENASA has to be consistent and develop
all the necessary steps to have the water system completed. Experiences have shown that communities which were
approached in the past and later abandoned because of the lack of implementation capacity or financing on the part of
SENASA, are later reluctant to participate, necessitating increased efforts from SENASA to restore its credibility with
these communities. During the preparation of the proposed project it has been established to have a well defined
number of communities to be executed every year.
* Technical assistance to new and weak Juntas. Part of the activities of SENASA has been to provide assistance and
support to new and weak Juntas. However, SENASA's technical assistance to the Juntas has been at times weak
because of the inconsistent support to SENASA's programs from the Government. Adding 330 new Juntas to the
already 300 existing Juntas will be difficult for SENASA to provide technical assistance to all these Juntas, especially if
these Juntas are in remote areas of the country. To resolve this problem SENASA has agreed to promote the
establishment of an association of Juntas in each Regional Department with the purpose of providing support and self-
help assistance among the Juntas. SENASA will concentrate and channel its technical assistance through these
Associations of Juntas.
* Decentralization and Strengthening of SENASA's Activities. To carry out the proposed project in a much wider
geographical distribution than the previous projects, SENASA will need to substantially increase its capacity to
implement this project. To this end, SENASA has agreed to strengthen its organization, decentralizing its operations by
strengthening the implementation capacity of the regional offices (through training, equipment and new offices) and find
ways to effectively involve the private sector to achieve higher coverage both in terms of implementing projects as well
as for operation and maintenance activities.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
*High level government officials and sector authorities are very committed to continue expanding water supply to the
rural population. The successful execution of the on-going project has created an important momentum and self
assurance to increase activities and improvement in the execution of the proposed project. SENASA's personnel is
working on the identification of communities and collecting relevant data and planning the implementation of the
project.
* Project preparation was done by SENASA's staff, with the assistance of external consultants chosen by SENASA and
totally under their supervision. The Bank has been very careful not to interfere with Government authorities on the
ways to prepare the project or naming of consultants. This strategy is providing a strong sense of ownership and
commitment to the project.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The value added of Bank support for this project comes through the following contributions:
* The Bank has a relationship with the government and SENASA on rural water systems that goes back for about 20
years (three water projects supported by Bank loans). As a result, the Bank is very familiar with issues facing the
sector and is one of the institutions most trusted by the Government to assist it in facing the demand in this area.
Furthermore the Bank is the only donor to examine water supply issues from an integrated standpoint vis-a-vis the
country's primary economic sectors.
* The successful implementation of Bank projects has attracted other donors which are financing their own programs
executed by SENASA. These various programs are creating a very heavy workload in SENASA. Through the
proposed Bank project, SENASA will establish a National Rural Water and Sanitation Program with specific
objectives and goals for the next five years. Selection criteria will be established for the various subprograms in which
donors could participate.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment [XI Cost-Benefit Analysis:                  1]  Cost Effectiveness   []  Other
(see Annex 4):               NPV=US$10.9 million; ERR= 16%               Analysis:               lSpecify]
For the economic assessment, a survey of the previous three Rural Water Supply projects was conducted to estimate costs
and benefits to be expected from the current project. The calculations presented here are based on a sample of 8,000
households in communities with and without projects. In addition, preliminary engineering designs were done for a sample
of 30 representative communities in order to estimate system costs. Economic and financial analyses were carried out to
determine the incremental benefit for the three principal project components over a 20-year period: new water supply
systems; expansion of existing systems; and sewerage systems. The economic benefits were calculated for four different
scenarios: (i) cash benefit only; (ii) cash benefit plus institutional benefits; (iii) cash benefit plus institutional benefits plus
consumer surplus; (iv) time savings plus health benefits plus institutional benefits (water components only). Costs were held
constant in the four cases. The ERR is 9%, 16% and 94% for the entire project for the first scenarios, respectively. In case
(iv) the ERR for new systems is 69% and for expansion 59%.
The different scenarios in themselves constitute a sensitivity analysis, showing that the project would even be justifiable,
with an ERR of 9% in the base case which only considers the cash benefit. Given that institutional strengthening is an
important and well-proven component of the project, the ERR of the second scenario that takes into account also the

Country: Paraguay                                               Project Title: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
institutional benefits is the more realistic one. It would give an ERR of 16%. Further sensitivity analysis was carried out on
cost overruns and lower revenues as well as the impact of changes in institutional benefits, time savings and health benefits
(see Annex 4).
Fiscal impact (for all projects):
The fiscal impact of the project is negative since the Government will pay US$9.8 million in subsidies while receiving only
US$2.0 million in taxes. The reason is that both SENASA and the Juntas are exempt from a number of taxes, including
VAT on water tariffs and direct investments (If investments are made by a private contractor, VAT has to be paid. This was
taken into consideration in the calculations). The breakdown of the above figures, a more detailed explanation of the
methodology, and basic assumptions are presented in Annex 4.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)     NPV=US$10.5 million; FRR= 20%
SENASA's financial performance during the period 1992-96 has been adequate. It has been able to finance its current
operation and its construction programs without financial difficulty from the GoP's budget allocations. These allocations
were made up from: (a) General Treasury funds; (b) royalties paid by the bi-national Itaipu hydroelectric company; (c) by
transfer of proceeds from Bank and IDB loans; (d) transfer of grants from bilateral donors (KfW) and from other foreign
and local entities; and (e) SENASA's own resources from the sale of services and materials. The executed budget grew
from an equivalent of about US$2.1 million in 1992, to an equivalent of about US$15.5 million in 1996.
SENASA recovers a portion of the construction costs (30%) of water supply systems through loans repayable by the Juntas
over a long-term period. Proceeds from these repayments plus interest payments are deposited into an interest-bearing
account opened at Banco Nacional de Fomento (a semi-autonomous development bank). SENASA is authorized to use
these funds for its construction programs. In the first two Bank projects, about 50% of the Juntas were unable to keep their
debt service current with SENASA. SENASA has recently made a successful effort to clean up these arrears through an
active collection campaign. The issue of loan repayment is a collection problem rather than affordability issue from the
beneficiaries. An affordability study for 30 communities, likely candidates for the new project, indicates that the proposed
monthly payments will be less than 5% of average income, a generally accepted affordability limit for water and sanitation
services. SENASA has already agreed to contract out the management of its loan portfolio to a financial agency.
15. Technical Assessment:
The two main components of the project to which the assessment was relevant are the water supply and wastewater disposal
components. The technical assessment for the water supply component was based on the review of the design of 30 new
systems (10 of each of the following population ranges: less than 500 beneficiaries, between 500 and 1000 beneficiaries and
more than 1000 beneficiaries). The designs were based on design criteria aimed at further reducing the costs of the systems
built under the on-going Third Bank Project. Based on the data from this sample the cost per capita for the new systems is
estimated at US$87. The design criteria were arrived at based on surveys carried by consultants who reviewed the cost
structure and cost of other projects and technologies. In the case of the wastewater disposal component, SENASA reviewed
the experience of Brazilian low-cost technologies and prepared preliminary designs for two communities using the
condominial systems and stabilization ponds designs. The per capita unit cost for these systems has been estimated at
US$122 for systems in the 5,000-8,000 inhabitants range. During preparation, it was confirmed that cost estimates and
engineering data were based on accurate projections and cost estimates were found acceptable.
16. Institutional Assessment:
* Executing agencies: The capacity of SENASA to carry out a large program of this size has been carefully assessed. In
order to be able to implement a program which is about the double of its current load, SENASA has agreed to contract
out almost all of the activities to the private sector, leaving for itself the role of supervision of the implementation.

Unlike the Third Project, the following activities will be contracted out: a) the drilling of at least 40% of the wells, b) the
installation of the electro-mechanical equipment of the wells, c) the testing of the wells, d) the promotional work in the
beneficiary communities and hygiene education, e) the collection of the Junta debts. To enable SENASA to adequately
carry out its supervision work, a program will be financed by the loans to provide adequate training to its administrative
and field staff. Similarly, the project will finance the training of Junta members in administration and operation of the
systems that they will be in charge after construction.
*  Project management: The project management team in SENASA will be expanded and will receive broader authority to
coordinate the input of the various department of SENASA.
17. Social Assessment:
*  Given the focus of the project on the more dispersed and distant communities, it will reach the communities which are
mostly below the poverty level. The survey of 150 communities during project preparation indicates that the monthly
average income of these communities is about US$200.
* Women are the main users and suppliers of water in rural Paraguay. In many cases, women are the driving force
behind bringing the project to their community. However, once provision of water is fornalized, management is usually
taken over by men. In the earlier water supply and sewerage projects, most of the Junta boards have been constituted
by men although with only a token number of women on the boards. In order to enhance women's participation on the
junta boards care has to be taken in the initial stages of the project to automatically include at least one woman on each
new junta board that is created. Since these boards usually are convened by the responsible SENASA inspector, this
measure is simple to take and will open up possibilities for women to continuing their active participation in local water
supply management.
* Thirty five new water supply systems will be installed in the indigenous comnunities of the Chaco. Since SENASA's
experience in the indigenous conmmunities is limited, a study was carried out by a teamn of anthropologists in selected
communities focusing on socio-economic and anthropological aspects. The purpose of the study was to ensure that the
systems to be installed will be appropriate from a social, technical and cultural point of view and that the communities
will be provided with services that they have an interest to use and maintain. The study has recommended that water
systems are indeed very much a priority of the conununities and the location of the systems should be carefully studied
as not to disrupt the political and social balance among the communities. In its design of this sub-component, SENASA
will seek the input of anthropologists or an NGO working in the region to ensure that proper precautions are taken and
full consultation is carried out. It is to be noted that under the on-going third Bank project, a pilot program of 16
communities is under implementation and the lessons will be fed into the new project.
18. Environmental Assessment:        Environmental     [I  A      [XI B       []  C
Category
The proposed loans will finance mainly water supply projects and a limited number of sewerage projects. Although no
negative impact is expected from the water supply systems, the project has been rated B because of the potential limited
impact that the discharge of treated wastewater may have in some cases.
Environmental regulations governing water and sanitation operations in Paraguay are weak and somewhat overlapping
among various agencies. 'During project preparation, with consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), an
environmental screening procedure was developed as part of a sectoral plan. Moreover, an agreement was signed between
the MoA and SENASA on the procedures to follow for the clearance of water and sewerage projects.

20. Sustainability:
* Systems implemented under the previous loans have all continued to function and grow. Some juntas who have been
operating these systems for over two decades have grown to entities of up to 25 staff (in one case with about 5000
connections).  Community involvement through the Juntas is expected to continue and therefore help ensure
sustainability. However, since new actors are going to be involved (NGOs, private sector providers), SENASA will
have to exert adequate quality control.
. Juntas will have to improve on their repayment routines. They will also need more autonomy to set their own tariffs (at
present the tariffs are set only with the agreement of SENASA) in order to assure operation, maintenance and
replacement costs.

Annex 2
PARAGUAY - Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$32.8 million (59% of total costs)
Water Supplv
This component consists of three sub-components: new water systems, expansion of existing systems and new systems in
indigenous conununities.
New Systems: this sub-component is the largest of all sub-components with an estimated total costs of about US$29.5
million. Under this sub-component, 330 new systems will be constructed; it is estimated that, of this total, about 15% will
consist of communities of less than 500 inhabitants, about 55% of communities of a population between 500 and 1000 and
about 30% for conununities larger than 1000 inhabitants. The total number of new beneficiaries is estimated at 310,000
people. These new systems will basically consist of a deep well (between 100 and 150m); an elevated tank and a
distribution network (both primary and secondary networks). In the case of the smaller dispersed coummunities the project
will finance only the primary network.
Expansion of existing systems. The cost of this sub-component is about US$1.3 million. This sub-component will finance
the expansion of 10 existing systems which have reached capacity and are in pressing need to expand its production, storage
and distribution systems. The total number of beneficiaries is about 14,000 inhabitants.
Water systems for indigenous communities. This sub-component costs are estimated at US$2.0 million. Following the
experience of the third Bank loan to SENASA, from which 16 communities have benefited from the construction of new
systems, this sub-component will construct 35 new systems in the Department of Chaco to provide water supply to 19,000
indigenous people.
Project Component 2 - US$10.8 million (19% of total costs)
Wastewater disposal
This component will consist of two sub-components: sewerage systems and construction of on-site systems.
Sewerage systems: the cost of this sub-component is estimated at about US$6.2 million. The project will finance the
construction - on a pilot basis - of 10 systems where the communities have grown and environmental problems from the
lack of sanitation are serious. The number of beneficiaries is estimated at 40,000 inhabitants. The systems will be financed
as follows:
- 10% in cash contribution from the junta before the implementation of works
- 30% contribution from the Junta during the construction
- 20% contribution from the junta in the form of land and labor
- 30% long-term debt to be repaid by the junta over a 10-year period at commercial rates
- 10% grant subsidy
On-site systems: US$4.6 million. The project will finance the construction and distribution of concrete slabs for 21,500
latrines. Beneficiaries will pay for the cost of these slabs. SENASA will carry out community mobilization and the health
education activities and will supervise the construction of the latrines; the beneficiaries will provide the labor and materials
for the construction of the latrines.
Project Component 3 - US$5.0 million (9% of total costs)
Technical Assistance
This component includes the following four sub-components: institutional strengthening of SENASA and the newly formed
Juntas, pilot program for private providers (Aguaterias), promotion of associations of Juntas and National Rural Water and
Sanitation Program.

Country: Paraguay                                               Project Title: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
Institutional Strenathening: Under this sub-component the project will finance the training of SENASA staff and Juntas so
that they can manage the activities and supervise the work under the project. This training will be done at three levels; a)
professional (management and strategic), technical (engineering supervision, inspectors, educators), and c) community
level, members and staff of the Juntas and interchange between Juntas. This sub-component will also finance the
strengthening of the environmental management capability of SENASA through training of staff in environmental impact
assessment and provision of equipment. Moreover, given the need of SENASA to modernize its organizational
infrastructure to better deal with the large increase in workload, the project will also finance the physical improvement of
offices and the purchase of office equipment, computers, vehicles and laboratory equipment (for Headquarters and regional
offices).
Pilot Program for private providers: Based on the results of an on-going assessment of the private water providers around
Asuncion, a pilot project will be designed to investigate the potential role of these water suppliers in rapidly expanding the
coverage of water supply in Paraguay. This sub-component will finance further studies for the definition of the criteria for
private providers and also possible incentives for the private providers to build systems under a Build-Operate-Own model.
It is estimated that up to five systems could be constructed under this pilot program.
Promotion of Associations of Juntas: given the large number of Juntas that exist today and the even larger number of Juntas
that will be formed under the proposed project, SENASA ability to provide technical assistance to these Juntas will be
severely curtailed. A solution that could provide a viable alternative to SENASA has already emerged around Asuncion in
the establishment of an association of Juntas (or cooperative) whereby Juntas of a given region (or department ) are brought
together to provide assistance to each other. Under this sub-component, the project will assist in the formation of these
associations in the various departments of the country and provide technical assistance in the form of training, seminars,
and basic office equipment.
National Rural Water and Sanitation Program: under this sub-component, the project will finance the preparation of a 5-
year national investment plan that will define the institutional, financial and technical issues in the rural water sector in
Paraguay and an investment program. The purpose of the study is the definition of a national plan that would overcome the
large deficits in the coverage in rural areas and provide entry point to donors and financiers.
Project Component 4 - US$7.1 million (13% of total costs)
This component consists in four sub-components: a) engineering designs, b) promotion, c) supervision and d)
administration and monitoring. Unlike the previous three Bank-assisted projects, engineering designs of all the systems
will be contracted out to private consulting firms. Similarly, the conununity mobilization and promotion work will be
contracted out to private firms and/or non-governmental agencies. During project preparation contact was made with three
NGOs (Plan International, AlterVida and the US Peace Corps) that expressed interest and readiness to participate in the
project. The project wiUl also finance the supervision consultants for the various civil works that the project will generate
including the drilling of the wells, the installation of the electro-mechanical equipment, the testing of the wells, the
construction of the water tanks, etc... SENASA will continue to provide the administration of all these contracts and will
direct its staff to the monitoring and supervision of these contracts. Finally, this component will also finance the
environmental impact analyses required for the wastewater systems.

Box 1. Design criteria
For the construction of new systems a number of new design criteria and guidelines are introduced to reduce the costs of the
systems and the amount of financing for each system; these changes are as follows:
- diameters of lined wells will be between 4 and 6 in
- only one pump will be provided to the Juntas
- water tanks for the smaller communities will be prefabricated in fiberglass (10m3), one or two for population up to 1000
inhabitants.; for larger communities, metallic or concrete tanks will be specified for population above 1000 inhabitants.
- for the smaller conumunities, the tank and well will be located at the same location.
- in the smaller communities, the project will finance only the primary network pipes.
Sewerage systems:
- condominial system: pipe diameter of 100mm, PVC;
- pipe cover: 40 cm in the backyards and 60 cm in the sidewalk
- simplified prefabricated manholes (one per lot and maximum distance of 30m)
- design coefficients: Kl=l. I and K2=1.3 while the return coefficient is 0.8
- design period of 10 years for the network and 20 years for the treatment plant.

Box 3. Water Supply to Indigenous Communities
This project sub-component is a continuation of the current pilot program within the Third Rural Water and
Sanitation Project for the indigenous population in the Chaco. The sub-component will finance the construction of 35 new
water systems in the Chaco region. Based on preparatory technical and anthropological studies, the technology chosen will
consist of earthen reservoirs to collect rain water, with windmills to pump the water to the communities. While the choice
of technology, due to the extreme climatic and hydrological conditions in the Chaco region, is fairly limited and
straightforward, special emphasis has been given to the institutional arrangements of this component.
One lesson from the Third Project is that in order not to disrupt the political and social balance between villages,
the new project will seek to provide water supply to groups of villages/settlements which constitute a community.
Furthermore, a detailed training program has been elaborated by SENASA. In addition to SENASA's traditional
preparatory promotion of the project, a training course for three community members per village, including at least one
woman, will be conducted as soon as the construction part of the project is completed. SENASA will also have a permanent
inspector in the Chaco who will be responsible for the projects. The inspector will dispose of a motor vehicle, spare parts
and tools. In addition, each beneficiary village will receive their own toolkit for repairs. SENASA will also contract an
anthropologist or an NGO with an anthropological team that will assist them in tailoring SENASA's traditional promotion
activities and the training courses to the needs of the indigenous population. In addition, SENASA will collaborate with the
team of the Ministry of Agriculture/GTZ that has been carrying out similar projects in the region during the past two years.
Those projects, which also include a large hydrogeological research component, are due to end by mid-1998 and SENASA
is committed to collaborate with this program to learn from the accumulated experience and to ensure the sustainability of
the investments made.
A Indigenous Population Development Plan has been prepared and can be found in the Project File. This plan is also part
of the Operational Manual.

Box 4. SENASA Implementation Model for Water Supply Systems
*  Rural water supply projects are implemented through the creation of Local Sanitation Committees (Juntas) within the
communities. The Juntas own the systems, which once built, pay back their debts originated by the construction of the
systems. The systems are fully administered, operated, and maintained by the Juntas. SENASA's strategy for the
implementation of rural water projects follows six steps in the promotion and execution of rural water supply systems.
Total time to carry out all these steps takes about 18 months. These steps are:
Step 1 - Identification. Generally, a team of two, an engineer and a social promoter, visits the community. The team looks
for a community leader in order to get a first-hand impression of the conununity's predisposition towards a water system.
The team also looks into the existence of other community services (electricity, schools, churches, clubs, etc.) which provide
insight into the methods traditionally used by the community to pay for public services. During this step, the team makes a
quick survey of the area, counting the number of houses and recording some measurements and distances.
Step 2 - Promotion and Field Work. Once a community has expressed the desire to obtain a water system, a team from
SENASA visits the community. The team prepares a socio-economic-cultural profile of the community and assesses its
attitude toward water supply and sanitation and its willingness and financial capacity to commit itself to the construction of
a water system. Studies are made to define the water source, carrying out some preliminary studies on groundwater
availability. Step 2 ends with announcing to the community, the general feasibility of the project and detailing the
requirements and responsibilities the community must adhere to in order to receive a water system from SENASA. Under
the proposed Fourth Project, these activities will be contracted out to NGOs and private consulting firms.
Step 3 - Preparation of the Project. SENASA engineers at headquarters prepare studies and designs and establish a reliable
cost estimate of the project (under the new project, this activity will also be contracted out to the private sector). With
the estimated project cost, SENASA's financial department calculates the amounts to be paid by the community. These
amounts are defined by: (a) 5% of the investment cost, in cash before the initiation of the works; (b) 10% (5% in the case of
the poorer communities) in cash and 15% in labor and materials during the execution of the works and (c) 30 % (or 15% in
the case of the poorer communities) of the investment costs as a loan. The remainder of the costs (40 % or 60%, depending
on the poverty level of the community) is covered by SENASA. The monthly user fees, therefore, are estimated as the
aggregate of: (a) amortization of the debt (30 or 15%) of the investment costs, paid over ten years in real terms; (b) the
operational and maintenance costs of running the system; and (c) the amount necessary to support a fund to cover
replacement of equipment.
Step 4 - Participation. Motivation and Organization. Once the studies and designs are available, SENASA promoters seek
full community support for the project. There are meetings, open to all community members, in which the pros and cons of
the project and the requirement for self-help are discussed. The community creates the Junta (through a legal document
supported by a specific law) and through public vote nominates representatives for the duration of two years. One of the
five Junta members is nominated by the corresponding municipality. At the end of Step 4, the Junta is asked to sign a
contract with SENASA which defines:
(a)   the portion of total project cost which the community will contribute in the form of cash, labor, land and/or
materials, before and during execution of the works;
(b)   an estimate of the portion of funds provided by SENASA which must be repaid, and conditions for repayment;
(c)   the need to contribute to a fund for the replacement of equipment and instruments;
(d)   the responsibility of the community to take over maintenance and operation of the system once completed and
the estimated amount this will cost;
(e)   the obligation of the Junta to create an administration for the operation and maintenance of the system;
Step 5 - Construction. Construction of the project starts after the signature of the contract between SENASA and the Junta,
and after the first payment (5% of the total costs) has been made. After defining an appropriate location, SENASA's water
resource specialists drill and test the wells (at least 40% of this activity is proposed to be carried out through the
concessioning of SENASA's equipment to private operators). The wells are then equipped and the electrical works
completed. The community participates in the works by supplying some of the materials and providing labor (pipe laying)
under the guidance of a local foreman. The construction of other facilities (pumping houses, storage tanks, treatment
plants) is normally carried out by a local contractor hired by SENASA. SENASA keeps careful records of all community
contributions.
Step 6 - Maintenance and Operation. Once inaugurated, the system becomes the property of the community. The Junta has
full responsibility for its administration, operation, and maintenance. SENASA assists the Junta's administration in the
establishment of proper accounting systems and billing and collection procedures. The staff, named by the Junta, usually
consists of a secretary who collects tariffs and keeps the books, and a plumber who does all technical work. These
employees are paid by the Junta. It also decides on future system extensions and new connections. At the beginning of the
operation, SENASA's assistance is most important; it helps the Junta to get properly organized and the administrators of the
water system to set up adequate procedures.

1/ Excluding sub-projects in indigenous and dispersed rural areas
2/ SENASA and Juntas are exempt from a number of taxes, e.g. VAT and import taxes. Therefore the tax income
for the government as shown in the table is very low.
Main Assumptions:
1.     The economic and financial rates of return were calculated by comparing the costs and benefits of household
water and sanitation services. All costs and benefits used in the analysis are expressed in constant prices of May 1997.
The financial prices were converted into economic prices by adjusting them for the impact of taxes and subsidies. In
addition, shadow prices for unskilled labor were estimated at 43% of the legal minimum salary. No shadow prices for the
exchange rate were calculated. The discount rate used is 10 percent. Details of the economic and financial analysis are
found in the Project File.
2.     The first three Paraguay Rural Water and Sanitation projects financed by the Bank have been characterized by a
technological and institutional model, as described in other parts of this document. The proposed project will continue
implementing the same model. The technological model chosen consists of a deep well, water tank and yard connections.
Institutional support is provided by SENASA, with strong community/junta involvement. The other main investment
components of the project include expansion of the water supply systems and sewerage for the large rural communities.
3.     Two further small project components, water supply for dispersed rural and for indigenous populations in the
Chaco, 0.5% and 3.4 % of the total project cost respectively, are however not considered in the cost-benefit analysis. In
the case of dispersed populations, the Bank will only finance preparation, i.e. institutional strengthening and alternative
technical designs of the project, but no investments. In the case of the indigenous populations, the anthropological study
conducted during the preparation stage showed that the indigenous groups will not be able to contribute in financial terms
to their projects. They will contribute by way of labor, but due to high unemployment and very low rural wages in that
area, the shadow rate of their labor must be considered very low. For this reason an economic evaluation of this project
component in quantitative terms has not been conducted. The project component is, however, justified in humanitarian
terms due to the very difficult water resources situation in the Chaco. There are no surface waters and most groundwater
is brackish and therefore unusable. For this reason, the future beneficiaries of the project supply themselves from small
surface water ponds that are filled during the rainy season and last for about six months. After that period the source has
evaporated and water is scraped out of the mud from the water hole. It is estimated that due to the lack of water and long
distances to the water sources, the average amount of water used per capita per day is as low as 10 liters. In view of this
situation, the hygiene situation of these indigenous populations is very precarious, with all kinds of waterborne diseases

Country: Paraguay                                             Project Title: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
prevalent (diarrhea, parasites) and other diseases related to a very low standard of hygiene in general. The per capita cost
for this component is estimated at US$100 for overall 19,000 beneficiaries. The improved access to water, in combination
with the hygiene education component of the project, will provide substantial health-related benefits. Health benefits are
also expected with regard to improved food supply since the permanent water sources provided through the project will
permit the communities to secure and expand their food growing activities. Because of the precarious climatic and
employment situation, hunger is an important issue in these areas. Compared to other potential interventions, such as
education or transport, this project is more vital because it meets one of the most basic needs of the indigenous
population. Without basic water supply, food and hygiene, the effects of other interventions - although also needed -
would be sub-optimal.
4.     There is a substantial demand for sewerage services in the larger communities that in earlier years benefited
from the Bank-financed water supply projects. Different technological options were discussed during project preparation
and from a cost-point of view it appears that the condominial system would be the most feasible. Since the condominial
system heavily relies on community participation and since the communities to be benefited by such system have active
functioning Juntas, the approach - with local modifications - is expected to yield good results. In the calculations, only the
condominial system has been considered. It is assumed that the communities will pay 90% of the entire cost of the
project while the rest will be a subsidy.
Calculation of Project Benefits
5.     Economic and financial analyses were carried out to determine the incremental benefit of the project over a 20-
year period for the three principal project components: new water supply systems; expansion of existing systems; and
sewerage systems. The economic benefits were calculated for four different scenarios: (i) cash benefit only; (ii) cash
benefit plus institutional benefits; (iii) cash benefit plus institutional benefits plus consumer surplus; (iv) time savings
plus health benefits plus institutional benefits (water components only). Costs were held constant in the four cases. The
attached tables show that the ERR is 9%, 16% and 94% for the entire project, under the first three scenarios, respectively.
In case (iv) the ERR for new systems is 69% and for expansion 59%. The financial benefit was calculated based on cash
benefit only. The FRR is 15%. The numbers used are based on a survey of about 8,000 households conducted as part of
project preparation. The survey results will be used as a baseline for future monitoring and evaluation. The survey brings
together the experience accumulated by the three previous rural water and sanitation projects from 1977, 1982, and 1992
respectively, and the current situation of the beneficiaries for this new project.
6.     In addition, preparatory engineering designs were carried out for a sample of 30 representative communities in
order to estimate system costs. The investment costs of water supply and sanitation schemes include domestically and
internationally produced materials and equipment, unskilled and skilled labor, overhead cost and the cost of pre-
investment. The latter includes costs of technical designs and community mobilization. The investment costs vary
according to population density of the area in which the project will be implemented. In addition, the investment cost for
the institutional strengthening program has been included. Operation and maintenance costs have been based on
engineers' estimates. These costs include operational costs, administration costs and maintenance costs.
To reflect true costs and benefits, financial prices have been transformed into economic prices. Investment, operation and
maintenance costs are adjusted for the impact of subsidies and taxes.
7.     The implementation of the project will make safe water available more conveniently and closer to households.
Thus households can substantially reduce the time needed to draw water from distant water sources. These time savings
from improved water supplies are a major benefit in many communities. Distances to water sources vary considerably. Of
the stirvey sample, 91% of households have their own wells. The remaining households have to walk an average distance
of 300 m. Only 20% of the households with wells have electric pumps. Currently rural households spend on average one
hour per day fetching and drawing water. Through the project, each household will have a safe water supply in their own
yard. According to the survey results water consumption without the SENASA system averages about 50 lcd while water
consumption with the SENASA system averages about 100 lcd per household. The value of time savings for the economic
analysis is based on the assumption that beneficiaries can use the time saved by diverting their time to productive
activities. Given the restricted employment opportunities in rural areas, the shadow rural wage rate, in Paraguay called
social rural salary, is assumed to amount to 43% of the legal minimum salary. This takes also into account the survey
results that women and children under 18, i.e. a group with the most restricted employment opportunities, are responsible
for drawing water in 50% of households.

8.      Further benefits associated with improved water supply and sanitation relate to health. The major disease related
to inadequate water supplies and sanitation are diarrheas that primarily affect children under five years old. The health
benefits which have been calculated relate to diarrheas in general. They concentrate on the direct cost savings due to
fewer cases of diarrhea in the family. The survey data show that on average 10% of households without a SENASA
project experienced at least one case of diarrhea in the fortnight before the survey. In conmmunities with the SENASA
project only 5% of households experienced at least one case of diarrhea in the same time period. The average costs of a
diarrhea episode, treated either at a health care facility, with medication bought at a pharmacy, natural medicine, etc.
average about 13 US$. These costs can vary substantially because transport is included. For households close to a
healthpost or who use self-medication the price will be lower than for households that need to see a doctor. In Paraguay,
the Oral Rehydration Method which would constitute a cheaper alternative, is usually not used and therefore not
considered as a realistic alternative at this point. By reducing diarrhea episodes by half, the savings through the project
are substantial. The survey also covered the question how many days of work were lost due to diarrhea. The results of
these questions were not factored into the cost/benefit calculations, since the results should be taken as indications rather
than at face value'. They indicate that on average two work days are lost per episode. The additional benefits of reducing
the work days lost by half may thus be substantial.
9.      The survey did not confirm a significant increase of activities regarding e.g. horticulture or other productive uses
of water. Although there may be pockets of communities that use the increased water supplies for small-scale irrigation,
this effect seems to be so small on average that it was disregarded in the benefit calculations.
10.     The institutional strengthening activities will be related to strengthening SENASA on one hand, but primarily,
as in the earlier projects, to help create functioningjuntas. Every new water supply system creates two new jobs which are
generally remunerated at the rate of the rural social salary, i.e. 43% percent of the legal minimum salary. For the benefit
calculations it was assumed that each employee has a two-year learning curve and that s/he, in year 3, would have a
chance to earn a full minimum salary in the labor market. The difference between the full minimum salary and the social
minimum salary that s/he could earn before being trained through the project is considered the institutional benefit. This
benefit has to be considered as a lower-bound indication of institutional benefits derived from the project because no
attempt has been made to factor in similar effects for SENASA employees or for the voluntary Junta board members.
There are six positions on each junta board. Since half of the board members rotate every year, a considerable number of
community members acquire new and marketable skills over the twenty-period, even considering that some of these serve
on the board several times. The institutional benefits counted here thus represent a very conservative estimate of the
overall institutional benefits to be expected from the project.
11.     Further effects of institutional strengthening relate to the long-term institutional benefits as communities learn to
operate and maintain water and sanitation infrastructure and to act through the Juntas. A specific effect could be
established in relation to women's involvement. While few women constitutejunta presidents, on average there is at least
one woman on the junta board, usually in a secretary or treasurer position. The table below shows a stable share of
women's participation in the juntas. Women do thus benefit from the project in terms of acquirement of a number of
skills related to junta management and of self-esteem. A quantitative estimate of such benefits was not attempted
however.
Table 1. Share of Women's Participation in Juntas
Position in Juntas     1990          1993         1996
President              9%            9%           6%
Vice President         4%            7%           8%
Secretary              23%           28%          27%
Treasurer              24%           17%          17%
Auditor                7%            13%          14%
Fullmember             7%            11%          13%
Altemate               10%           S%           3%
Average                12%           13%          13%
There is reason for caution. In the first case, the consultancy firm that conducted the survey did not distinguish between cases of infant diarrhea and adults. Therefore it is not clear
who had to stay at home, the mother due to a sick child or the father who could not work. The lost income would vary due to the substantial differences in women's and men's
income and work opportunities. It may not be possible either to link this substantial amount of time lost to each diarrhea episode.

12.    Further benefits that remained non-quantifiable due to unavailability of reliable data relate to improved water
quality, benefits associated with the institutional strengthening of the communities' capacity to plan and manage their
water supply and sanitation services, increased reliability of water supply services and positive impacts on the
implementation of other rural development projects, as well as increase in property values due to water connections.
13.    While the above-mentioned aspects constitute an important part of the overall benefits, the most straightforward
way of measuring the value of improved water supply is to consider the users' willingness-to-pay. Experience in the first
three Bank-financed projects has shown that, while there are some difficulties in making the juntas repay their debts to
SENASA, there is almost universal payment of water bills by users to the junta. In the benefit estimates the average tariff
of US$0.42/m3 paid is therefore taken as an indication of the value that users place on their water. Due to availability of
data concerning the increase of water consumption to be expected due to project implementation (as compared to supply
through private wells or vendors) it was also possible to estimate the consumer surplus generated by the project.
Sewerage
14.    For benefit estimates concerning sewerage services, tariff calculations were used. Since it is assumed that due to
the community participation approach only such communities will benefit from the project that are willing to participate in
implementation and to pay for future service, the tariff is seen as an indication of the benefits. It is estimated at the same
price as water, i.e. US$0.42/m3. Marginal cost calculations (see attached table) show, however, that this tariff would not
cover either the financial or the economic marginal cost. Since this project component is a pilot, the cost estimates will be
reviewed during the project as well as the users' willingness to pay. Adequate sewerage is necessary to ensure public health
(the benefit of which is not included in the calculation) and therefore the component might warrant a higher subsidy.
The tariffs for water and sewerage will be charged separately. A further benefit is related to institutional strengthening,
which is calculated according to the same assumptions as for the water supply components.
Sensitivity analysis:
15.    The development of different scenarios has constituted a sensitivity analysis, showing that the project would even
be justifiable with an ERR of 9% in the base case which only considers the cash benefit. Given that institutional
strengthening is an important, and well-proven, component of the project, the second scenario, that takes into account also
the institutional benefits, is the more realistic one. It would give an ERR of 16%. Further sensitivity analysis was carried out
calculating switching values for cost overruns and reduction in revenues as well as the impact of changes in institutional
benefits, time savings and health benefits. See attached tables for results.
Long-run Marginal Cost
16.    The table below shows the long-run marginal costs (20 years) for the different sub-projects compared with the
proposed project tariff. The project tariff is in fact higher than the economic marginal costs. The costs cover all investment
costs, operation and maintenance over the 20-year-period as well as reposition. Concerning the water supply components,
the project can be expected to be sustainable. With respect to the pilot sewerage component, the tariff and willingness-to-
pay will have to be reviewed during project implementation.

Financial Summary
Finances of SENASA and of the Juntas
SENASA's Past Financial Performance
1.     SENASA's financial performance improved substantially during the period 1994-96, mainly as a result of improved
budget allocations. Annual budget allocations for capital expenditures during 1994-1996 increased significantly as a result of the
implementation of the Third Rural Water Project financed by the Bank. Annual budget allocations for operational expenditures
during the same period increased accordingly to cope with the increased volume of works. A portion of operational expenditures is
allocated to the cost of works and recovered by SENASA through the loans repaid by the juntas. Financial resources from the Bank's
loan, in addition to resources from other multilateral agencies (IDB and FONPLATA) made this substantial growth possible. The
GoP and SENASA supported to this growth adequately. SENASA's budget execution, is summarized in Table 1 below:
Table 1. SENASA's Budget Execution (US$ million equivalent)
1992   1993   1994   1995   1996
Operat. expenditures   2.0    2.1    2.3    3.8    3.3
Capital expenditures   0.1    0.4    5.7    7.1   12.1
Total                  2.1    2.5    8.0   10.4  15.5
At market rates effective as of Dec. 31 of each year.
2.     About 90% of SENASA's operating expenditures during the period 1992-96 were financed by the GoP with funds from the
General Treasury and from royalties collected from the bi-national hydroelectric company. SENASA financed the gap of its
operational expenditures with its own resources generated from the sale of sevices. About 3% of operational expenditures during
1996 were financed by a grant from the Government of Japan. The bulk of SENASA's capital expenditures during the period 1993-
96 was financed by the Bank, from about 50% during 1993, to about 70% during 1994-95, and about 50% in 1996. The GoP
financed about 80% of capital expenditures during 1992, and most of the financial gap from 1993 to 1996. SENASA's contribution
to its capital expenditures during the period 1992-96 was below 1%. About 14% of SENASA's capital expenditures during 1996
were financed by IDB and about 6% by FONPLATA.
3.     About 80% of SENASA's budget is devoted to water and sanitation activities, 5% is assigned to other activities such as
envirormental and pollution control, waste disposal, and the remaining 15% is used to cover expenditures of the public health
personnel supervised by the Ministry of Health.
4.     The main activity of SENASA is to build water supply systems for communities with less than 4,000 inhabitants, with funds
received from the GoP, either directly from its budget, or transferring loans from multilateral financial agencies as grants, and
community contributions in cash and or in-kind . Once the system is built, it is transferred to the community and the corresponding
assets are discharged from SENASA's books. At the time of the transfer of the system, SENASA provides to the Junta the amount to
be repaid (a portion of the total cost of the system) over a long-term period. In previous Bank financed projects, these loans
represented about 30% to 60% of the total cost of the system, and are repayable in monthly installments, over a period ranging from
10 to 20 years. Interest rates charged during the First and Second Projects financed by the Barik were highly subsidized (6% and

9.6%, respectively) during a long period (1991-95) with inflation rates ranging between 11% and 20%. Interest rates under the
Third Project financed by the Bank are variable and are set at 6 percentage points below average market rates. These market rates
have been fluctuating within 25% and 35% during the last two years, and were highly positive in real terms, since inflation rates
ranged within 9% and 17%.
5.     SENASA's loan portfolio is made up of about 48 loans made under the First project financed by the Bank, and about 52
additional loans made under the second project financed by the Bank. Under the Third Project financed by the Bank, another 170
loans are expected to be included . The number of loans will be further increased with new loans under the proposed project. The
volume of operations required to manage the loan portfolio is exceeding the capabilities of SENASA. The face value of this
portfolio as of December 31, 1996 amounted to an equivalent of US$ 1.1 million; therefore, it does not justify an increase of staff to
improve its management. SENASA has recently contracted a financial institution for the management of its loan portfolio.
SENASA's Financial Position
6.     SENASA's financial position as of December 31, 1996 was satisfactory. Since SENASA has no long-term liabilities, and
its current liabilities are small, its debt/equity and current ratios were adequate. SENASA's accounting records follow the
govemmental accounting system (budget execution). The external auditors have prepared a standard Balance Sheet as of December
31, 1996. A summary of this Balance Sheet is shown in Table 2, below:
Table 2. Summary of SENASA's Balance Sheet (as of December 31, 1996)

TOTAL                        51171           24080               100%

7.     Fixed Assets are underestimated because SENASA is not allowed to revalue its fixed assets nor to restate its financial
statements due to inflation. Cost accounting is non-existent. The need of an accurate cost accounting system was identified under
the Third Project financed by the Bank. A consulting firm is currently analyzing SENASA's administrative and accounting systems.
Specific recommendations are expected to be issued for an adequate cost allocation to water supply and sanitation systems built
under SENASA's programs.
Future financin2 of SENASA's water supply and sanitation oroerams
8.     The financing of the extensive program of construction of water supply and sanitation systems under this project will
require serious improvements in the absorptive capacity of SENASA. Since it is not a profit oriented entity, its performance relies
fully on the availability of resources and on its own absorptive capacity. In order to carry out this project successfully, the following
assumptions should be fulfilled: (a) the GoP would provide the resources from the ordinary budget in a timely fashion; (b) the Juntas
would contribute with their share of the capital expenditures; (c) SENASA loans to the Juntas will be at real interest rates; and (d)
SENASA will remain maintaining its revolving fund in an interest-bearing account.

Past Financial Performance of Juntas
9.     As per information available, some Juntas have faced difficulties to raise tariff to levels sufficient to service their debt to
SENASA. Many of these Juntas have renegotiated their debt to SENASA as a result of an aggressive campaign initiated by
SENASA during the second half of 1996. This on-the-field campaign is expected to reduce arrears of the Juntas to an acceptable
level (no more than three installments due and unpaid). Since the amounts in arrears of past loans have been largely eroded by
inflation, the amounts due and payable by the Juntas are so small (in some cases about US 2 equivalent per water connection) that
its payment in ful shouldn't be difficult.
10.    The accounting systems of many Juntas remain rudimentary but acceptable. An Internal Audit unit is expected to be created
to provide assistance to the Juntas, particularly on the adequacy of their accounting records.
Financial future of Juntas
11.    Future financial performance of Juntas would depend mostly on SENASA's efforts for an adequate supervision, and on an
adequate debt collection. Once a financial discipline is established, the Juntas will be able to self regulate their financial situation.
An agreement will be reached during negotiations, whereby all Juntas would be obliged to: (a) make their debt payments to
SENASA through a financial agency; (b) set their tariffs at levels sufficient to cover all their operating and maintenance expenses,
depreciation and debt service obligations; (c) set connections charges for the population to be benefited at the start up of the systems,
at levels sufficient to cover the Juntas initial contribution to capital expenditures, and (d) set connection charges for new connections
emerging from population growth, at levels sufficient to cover capital expenditures for the expansion of the systems.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
1.     All project components financed under the proposed Loan would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines for
Procurement (January 1995, Revised January and August 1996). The selection and appointment of consultants for studies and
technical assistance will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines for the selection and employment of
consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997).
2.     Given the scattered location of the communities and the relative simplicity of the works, procurement of the civil works will
be on the basis of local competitive bidding. These works will include: a) installation of the electro-mechanical equipment, b)
construction of the tank and ancillaries; in the case of sewerage, it includes the provision and installation of sewer network. Works
valued at US$2,000,000 and above will be procured through international competitive bidding and those valued at less than
US$2,000,000 will be procured through national competitive bidding. Contract values are expected to range between US$300,000
and US$2,000,000 depending on the packaging of the systems to take advantage of economies of scale.
3.     Goods valued at US$100,000 or above will be procured through international competitive bidding. These goods include: a)
drilling materials and pump equipment, b) distribution network piping and appurtenances. Goods valued at between US$20,000 and
US$100,000 will be procured through national competitive bidding while goods valued at less than US$20,000 will be procured on
the basis of comparison of price quotations from at least three eligible suppliers (national shopping).
4.     The selection of consulting firms for assignments valued at US$200,000 and above will be carried out according to the
quality and cost based selection procedures. For assigmnents valued at below US$200,000, the least cost selection will be the
method of choice for non-complex work. The assigmnents carried out by consulting firms will be subject to the prior review
procedures outlined in the Consultant Guidelines mentioned above. For individual consultants to be hired for assignments valued
between US$20,000 and US$50,000, all contracts are subject to prior review procedures; for assignments valued at less than
US$20,000, the Bank will limit its review to the terms of reference of the assignment.
Disbursement
5.     To accelerate disbursements under the two loans, a Special Account will be opened for each loan in the Central Bank. The
authorized allocation in each Special Account will be US$2.0 million equivalent to cover about four months of average
disbursement. These accounts will be audited by independent auditors. Closing date for disbursements will be December 31, 2003,
i.e. six months after the estimated completion date of project implementation.
6.     For goods contracts valued at less than US$100,000, contracts with consulting firms costing less than US$100,000 and
contracts with individual consultants costing less than US$50,000, disbursements would be made against statements of expenditures
(SOEs). Non contract expenditures such as training would also be made against SOEs.
