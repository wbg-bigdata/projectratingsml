               IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures
through the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25
percent of the Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is
given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country
evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those
that are likely to generate important lessons.
    To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the
borrower for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers'
comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an
assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
    Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome:
High, Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of
supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This comparative review consolidates findings and lessons from a set of recent Project
Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) on rural water supply and sanitation in Latin America.

The two projects that are the focus of the review are the Rural and Small Towns Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan 70350-EC) in Ecuador (PRAGUAS) and the 4th Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loans 42220-PA and 42230 -PA) in Paraguay (RWSS
IV). The Ecuador PRAGUAS project (US$45.57 million actual total cost) was approved by
the Bank‟s Board of directors on October 17, 2000 and closed on October 31, 2006, two
years later than planned. The Paraguay RWSS IV project (US$49.43 million actual total
cost) was approved by the Board on August 20, 1997 and closed June 30, 2007, three and a
half years later than planned.

Both projects aimed to adopt similar sector reforms and community-based approaches in
rural and small town water supply and sanitation services. The two projects were selected for
assessment together because within the similar sector and regional context, several service
delivery models were implemented, allowing a comparison of their likely financial and
institutional sustainability. This review will also serve as an input to IEG‟s ongoing
evaluation of infrastructure sustainability worldwide.

IEG prepared this report based on an examination of the relevant Project Appraisal
Documents, Implementation Completion and Results Reports, Legal Agreements, project
files and archives as well as other relevant reports, memoranda and working papers.
Discussions were also held with Bank staff in Washington, DC and in the resident missions.
An IEG field mission visited Ecuador in December 2010 and Paraguay in January 2011 to
review the results on the ground and to hold discussions with relevant government officials,
communities of beneficiaries, and other sector stakeholders. The mission appreciates all
support and attention given by the borrowers and all concerned parties in both countries as
well as in Washington, DC. The complete PPAR for the Paraguay project is presented in
Annex A; the PPAR for the Ecuador project has been issued separately,1 but is summarized
in Annex C.

Following IEG procedures, a draft of the main report and the respective PPARs were sent to
government officials and borrowing agencies in the two countries for their review. The
comments received from the government of Paraguay are included as Annex B.

Summary
This review compares the effectiveness, findings, and lessons of two rural water supply and
sanitation (WSS) projects supported by the World Bank in Latin America – the Rural and
Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan 70350-EC) in Ecuador
(PRAGUAS) and the Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loans 42220-PA
and 42230_A) in Paraguay (RWSS IV) – based on Project Performance Assessment Reports
of these two projects.

A COMMON APPROACH

The projects combined investment in water supply and sanitation infrastructure and technical
assistance to improve the performance of key water sector institutions. At the time of project
preparation, both countries had rural populations with low access to WSS services.
Improving rural access to WSS was identified as a government priority for both countries.

Ecuador devolved the WSS service mandate for small towns and rural areas to municipal
governments in the early 1990s. A pilot project under the Second Health and Nutrition
Project, supported by the Water and Sanitation Program, had tested the use of water
beneficiary associations (WBA) for the operation and maintenance of the water systems in
rural areas, and this model was scaled up under the PRAGUAS project. WBAs are legally-
registered non-profit community based organizations with a governing board whose members
are democratically-elected. Paraguay had already delegated the operation and maintenance
responsibility in the 1970s to WBAs through the National Environmental Health Service
(Servicio Nacional de Saneamiento Ambiental, SENASA), a central government agency
under the Ministry of Health. Both projects supported institutional models promoting WBAs
to operate and maintain the WSS infrastructure, beneficiary contributions to investments, and
cost recovery for operation and maintenance through user charges. Procurement and
contracts were managed by municipal governments in Ecuador and by SENASA in
Paraguay.

RESULTS

Ecuador: The first project development objective of the PRAGUAS project was to increase
WSS service coverage and quality for beneficiaries in small towns and rural municipalities
with the focus on the poor. This was substantially achieved. The number of municipalities
covered under the project (109), far exceeded the target (40), although only 82 percent of the
target number of beneficiaries were reached. Many of the municipalities were in poor
geographical areas. The effect on WSS service quality was difficult to assess, however, since
there was no baseline data of service quality at start up.

The project‟s second objective was to improve water sector performance through the
application of coherent policies and strengthening sector institutions at the central and local
levels. Though a new sector organization was put in place in the central government to
oversee investment sub-projects, limited progress was made in defining key policy areas that
affect the sustainability of the investments. By the end of the project, allocation of
responsibilities to undertake sector investments at the national and sub-national levels had
                                              vi


not been formalized, rules for asset ownership in the sector had not been defined, and there
was no consistent financing policy. These institutional and financial arrangements were, and
still are, set up on an ad hoc investment-by-investment basis.

The relevance of the project‟s objectives was substantial, but the relevance of the design was
modest. While the pilot project had tested the demand-responsive approach, policies related
to investment responsibilities were not defined by project appraisal, and the municipalities
were given the mandate to implement the investment sub-projects using an overly complex
project cycle that contributed to delays. With respect to the project‟s efficiency, while there
were delays in project effectiveness and implementation, the benefits in relation to costs are
likely to be substantial, given the high rate of return calculated at the end of the project.
Putting together the above elements on relevance, efficiency, and achievement of objectives,
the overall project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. Risk to development outcome is
rated as significant because of the risks associated with the communities‟ and municipalities‟
financial capacity to maintain their rural WSS systems over the longer term. In addition, the
political and government ownership risk increased significantly when the new administration
cancelled a large part of the follow-on second-phase Adaptable Program Loan. The Bank‟s
Performance was rated moderately satisfactory because the design of the project was overly
ambitious in a potentially politically sensitive time period, and monitoring and evaluation
were of poor quality. Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory, with shortcomings
on the government side due to the delays in sector policy formalization and implementation
of sector reforms.

Paraguay: The first objective of RWSS IV was to rapidly increase water supply and
sanitation coverage in the rural areas. The target coverage was substantially met for water
supply, which the main focus of the project, although the targets for sanitation were not
achieved. The second objective, modifying SENASA‟s role in the sector from an
implementer of projects to an efficiently managed promoter, was also substantially achieved.
SENASA successfully contracted out all its traditional activities to the private sector, NGOs,
and association of WBAs. The government‟s plan to establish a regulator shifted the scope of
SENASA‟s function to focus on planning and promotion of the sub-projects rather than on
sector regulation.

Both the relevance of the objectives and the relevance of design were substantial. The
objective have been in line with the country‟s and the Bank‟s strategies through the project
implementation period until the present. Efficiency was modest because of the significant
delays in project implementation. The project outcome was therefore rated as moderately
satisfactory. The risk to development outcome was moderate, as the WBAs are likely to
continue to finance, construct, and manage systems satisfactorily under SENASA's model.
Revenues from the tariffs for most of the schemes are sufficient to cover their operation and
maintenance costs. Borrower performance and the Bank‟s quality at entry performance were
moderately satisfactory, primarily due to the poor quality of the project‟s M&E. Bank
performance during supervision, on the other hand, was satisfactory because of its significant
efforts to minimize the impact of the implementation delays and its highly satisfactory
supervision of the pilot private sector participation program and institutional strengthening
components.

KEY LESSONS

     Sector reform and the related shift in institutional culture require political
      support and time: It is important to identify the potential risks up front, carry out
      proper stakeholder analysis, and make a realistic projection of the time it takes to
      change the roles of the Government agencies and to devolve the WSS investment and
      operation and maintenance responsibilities to the local government or the community
      level.

     Formalization of consistent policies is critical for reform: Sector policies and
      institutional responsibilities need to be formalized through legal decrees and approved
      by the Congress as a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for the enforcement of
      financial and investment policies, especially as the countries face political changes.

     WBA models show good financial sustainability: Long-term financial sustainability
      depends on whether the institutional arrangements for implementing cost recovery
      policies are sound and responsive to local conditions. Conventional WBA models in
      both Paraguay and Ecuador and the private sector operator models in Paraguay show
      stronger financial sustainability compared to the municipal models implemented in
      Ecuador where tariffs are approved by municipal authorities.

     Sanitation requires more attention: Because of the environmental and health
      externalities of the current low levels of sanitation coverage in both countries, it is
      important for the Government and the Bank teams to pay more attention to and
      effectively track the progress in the sanitation sub-sector both during project
      preparation and implementation.

     Post-investment technical support and capacity building enhance the
      sustainability of community participatory water supply services: For the water
      systems to be sustainable, there also needs to be an institutionalized arrangement for
      technical assistance and post-construction support for continuous capacity building of
      WBAs.

1. Introduction
1.1     In the late 1990s, the population in the rural areas and small towns of Ecuador and
Paraguay was suffering from limited access to water supply and sanitation (WSS) services. Both
countries had identified improving WSS services in rural areas as a government priority. Table
1-1 illustrates the status of rural WSS coverage in the two countries at three points in time, 1990,
2000, and 2008. Paraguay started at a very low rural WSS coverage level of 25 percent in water
supply and 15 percent in sanitation in 1990, but doubled these coverage levels in a decade to 51
percent in water supply and 31 percent in sanitation. Water supply coverage grew to 66 percent
and sanitation coverage grew to 40 percent by 2008. Ecuador, on the other hand, started at a
relatively high coverage level in 1990 of 62 percent and 48 percent for rural water supply and
sanitation respectively. Ecuador achieved 88 percent rural water supply and 84 percent rural
sanitation coverage by 2008.

1.2     In the case of Ecuador, pending reforms initiated in the early to mid-1990s were
identified. A three-phased Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was developed in the late-1990s to
support the implementation of these reforms in Ecuador. The APL program objective was to
increase the coverage and effective use of sustainable water and sanitation services in Ecuador,
with a focus on the poorer populations in rural communities and small towns. An associated
objective of the program was to support the Government of Ecuador in the implementation of an
overall WSS sector reform program, covering both urban and rural areas. This Project
Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) will assess the first phase of the APL, known as
PRAGUAS. In the case of Paraguay, the Bank had previously financed three projects supporting
improvements in access to WSS services in rural areas. The RWSS IV, which the PPAR will also
assess, was expected to consolidate achievements in the former projects. The objectives of
RWSS IV were the rapid increase of water supply and sanitation coverage in the rural areas. The
secondary objective was to modify SENESA‟s role in the sector from an implementer of projects
to an efficiently managed promoter of activities through the shifting of its current activities to the
private sector and non-governmental organizations while still maintaining its regulatory
functions.

1.3    Preparation of the two projects began during the period 1997-98, and the centerpiece of
both was the establishment of water beneficiary associations (WBA), locally called „Juntas? in
Spanish, to operate and maintain the drinking water supply systems in the rural areas. WBAs in
both countries are legally appointed non-profit organizations responsible for the operation and
maintenance (O&M) of the RWSS schemes using the revenues collected from the beneficiaries.
The governing body includes a President, a Treasurer, a Controller, and a Deputy Controller, all
                                                                2


elected democratically for two-year periods. It also includes a representative from the
Municipality appointed by the Mayor. All members of the governing body work as volunteers
with no rights to salaries or sitting allowances.

1.4    Both PRAGUAS and RWSS IV have objectives related to the improvements in coverage
of water services in rural areas and small towns, as well as institutional strengthening and sector
reforms. The Project Development Objective in the PRAGUAS loan agreement is to increase the
coverage and effective use of sustainable water and sanitation services with a focus on the poorer
populations in rural communities and small towns.

1.5     Financing of investments in both projects included a combination of central government
finance, and cash and labor contributions from beneficiaries intended to generate lasting
beneficiary ownership of projects. In the case of Ecuador, municipal governments were also
expected to contribute with financing. Project implementation in both cases involved intensive
outsourcing of all project activities, including contracts to identify the participating rural
communities, carry out engineering designs, and construct and supervise the infrastructure sub-
projects. To ensure financial sustainability of water supply service provision, both projects
proposed policies to ensure that tariff revenues cover at least O&M costs.

1.6    In both projects start-up and implementation of the project activities ran into a series of
delays due to political instability, and this ultimately led to the extension of the project closing
dates by two years in the case of Ecuador and three-and-a-half years in the case of Paraguay.

1.7    In Ecuador the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing/Subsecretariat for Water
Supply and Sanitation and Solid Waste (MIDUVI/SSA) and the municipal governments were the
implementing agencies. In Paraguay, the RWSS IV project was implemented by National
Environmental Health Service (Servicio Nacional de Saneamiento Ambiental) (SENASA)
according its mandates defined civil service law.

2. Improvements in Rural Access to Water and Sanitation
Services in Ecuador and Paraguay
2.1     Ecuador: PRAGUAS aimed at increasing the coverage of sustainable WSS services with
a focus on the poorer populations within in rural communities and small towns. Specifically, it
was to reach about 350,000 beneficiaries in about 40 rural municipalities as well as in about 6
municipal capitals. PRAGUAS‟s geographical target area was 152 rural municipalities, covering
about 22 percent of the country‟s population. At the time of appraisal, only 48 percent of the
urban and rural population of these small municipalities had access to adequate water supply and
only 35 percent benefited from appropriate sanitation facilities. The project targeted the
municipalities with low service coverage rates, high poverty indicators, and a high community
demand for improved services.

2.2      The total number of beneficiaries was 288,000 people. Of these, 145,000 received water
only, 129,000 received both water and sanitation, and 14,000 received sanitation only. As a
result, PRAGUAS achieved 82 percent of its intended target. While the project area level
coverage data at the end of the project could not be obtained, IEG estimates that the project‟s
beneficiaries represented about 87 percent of the rural population that gained water supply access
and 28 percent of those that gained access to sanitation over the period 2000-08.2

2.3     With regards to increasing the coverage of municipalities, PRAGUAS exceeded the
target of 40 by reaching 109 municipalities, many located in the poorest provinces. The quality
however is hard to assess as there were no baseline information and data were not systematically
collected. According to MIDUVI, three years after project completion, it is estimated that 80
percent of systems provide continuous (24 hours/day, seven days/week) water supply with good
pressure, but in the absence of baseline data it is unclear whether this shows an improvement or
not. Twenty percent of the sample twenty water systems visited by IEG were not functioning at
the time of the visit, but were reported to work on a limited schedule (some hours only during the
day).

2.4     According to the ex-post review carried out in 2006, about 88 percent of the population
with water connections supported by PRAGUAS had daily service except in Cotopaxi and
Manabi, where the service was once a week for 23 percent and 44 percent of the population in
the project areas, respectively. Based on the IEG mission in 2010, the situation had not changed
since the ex-post review took place. A large majority of the PRAGUAS-supported water
systems are still working five years after project closure, and this is due to the strong community
participation, commitment by users, and capacity building of the WBAs and sector players in the
key areas such as O&M.

2.5     Paraguay: RWSS IV aimed at rapidly increasing water supply coverage over a 5-year
period from 20 percent to 30 percent of the rural population in the project areas. At project
closure in 2007 – 9 years later – the coverage was 28 percent. In terms of population, about
293,750 people or 85 percent of the target gained access. Water supply systems were built for
WBAs in small towns, rural areas, and for indigenous communities. IEG estimates that the

2
    This assumes that all of the beneficiaries gained “new? access, however some may have gained “improved? access.
                                                         4


project‟s beneficiaries represented about 69 percent of the rural population that gained water
supply access and 55 percent of those that gained access to sanitation over the period 2000-08

2.6     Based on the findings from the IEG mission, the systems being operated by the WBAs
are more sustainable than those built for (and operated by) the indigenous communities.
SENASA reported 100 percent functionality of WBA systems, and all WBAs visited by the IEG
mission were in fact working although some of the schemes had interrupted services. In the case
of systems built for indigenous communities, one of the three systems visited by IEG was not
working and the other two were working only partially.3

2.7    As for access to sanitation services, 96 percent of the target was achieved through
construction of sewerage and waste water treatment plants in small towns (serving 25,000
people) and deployment of latrines in rural areas (for 116,000 people). With regards to the target
of making 10 sewerage systems operational, RWSS IV only achieved 30 percent of the target
because of insufficient demand for this activity.

3. Strengthening of Rural and Small Towns Water Supply
and Sanitation Institutional Framework and Sector Policies
3.1     At project preparation and start up, the RWSS sector in Ecuador was in disarray because
of weak institutions, institutional overlap at all levels, and a lack of sector policies, which
resulted in unsustainable investments. In Paraguay, the RWSS sector policies had been in place
for almost 30 years, and the rural water agency SENASA‟s role was being modernized. Table 3-
1 summarizes the main RWSS policies and the key achievements to date in the two countries.
Table 3-2 summarizes the sector policies and institutional framework supported under
PRAGUAS and RWSS IV.

3.2     Under both PRAGUAS and RWSS IV, water tariffs were expected to be set to at least
cover the O&M costs of the WSS services. In the small towns in Ecuador, the tariffs were
expected to cover O&M costs plus at least 30 percent of new investment costs. The actual cost
recovery performance for both countries is presented in the Chapter on Financial Sustainability.

 The IEG mission visited 3 out of 71 systems built for indigenous communities. While the systems visited were
chosen randomly, the sample size is not large enough to generalize the findings. Consolidated data on technical
sustainability of all indigenous community schemes were not available.

3.3     Ecuador: The Ecuadorian Institute for Water and Sanitation (IEOS), an autonomous
central government agency which had been in charge of all functions in the sector since 1965 had
gone through a series of reforms to transfer its responsibilities to other institutions. In 1992, a
few years before PRAGUAS, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Urban Development and Housing
(MIDUVI) and its Sub-Secretariat of Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid Waste (SSA) were both
created to take over the responsibility for strategic planning and policy making in the WSS
sector. Water supply service responsibility was transferred to the municipalities as part of the
decentralization reforms. Project implementation functions, had been left undefined, and de-facto
inherited by MIDUVI/SSA.

3.4    Since its creation, MIDUVI/SSA had spent its resources primarily on its implementation
functions at the expense of its strategic planning and policymaking mandates. At the same time,
municipalities ended up without any well-defined paradigm on how to implement their mandate
of water service provision in their urban and rural areas.

3.5     PRAGUAS supported the transfer of water supply service provision mandate to the
municipalities, as well as the Government‟s decentralized investment planning and
implementation policies. In the former PRAGUAS made some progress: municipal water utilities
in the form of corporations were established with some private sector participation and WBAs in
rural areas were formed to implement their investments. In the latter, PRAGUAS experienced
difficulties because during project implementation, amid political turmoil and frequent political
changes, the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Ecuador, and the Presidential Planning
Secretariat retained full authority to set priorities over investment and budget allocation in all
sectors for all government levels. There was a 15 percent budget transfer to municipalities, but
this was mostly used to cover their recurrent expenses.

3.6      As described above the new organizational structure MIDUVI/SSA was put in place to
oversee the sector, but reforms related to the regulatory framework, investment responsibilities,
asset ownership, and financing policies were not completed. There is still no consensus for
approving a new WSS law defining sector policies and institutional arrangements supported by
PRAGUAS. Therefore, the laws and norms that ruled the sector prior to decentralization
(initiated in the early 1990s) are still used to run the sector at present. Since the sector policies
are not formalized in the form of legal decrees or approvals by the congress, inconsistent
investment and financial arrangements are adopted in the RWSS systems. Only one third of the
investments had complied with PRAGUAS‟ financial policy at the end of the project. The
absence of unified policy has resulted in poor sustainability of the WSS investments; for example
the tariffs are set lower than the O&M costs in the case of small towns. Limited progress on the
reforms is also resulting in higher than expected risks for sustainability.

3.7     Challenges were faced to transfer the project implementation functions and related
financial resources from MIDUVI/SSA to participating municipalities as well. This is because
the municipalities didn‟t have the capacity to implement the projects, and this shift was accepted
only reluctantly by MIDUVI. According to the information collected during the IEG mission,
                                                         7


MIDUVI/SSA implemented parallel projects with softer financial conditions than PRAGUAS,4
creating confusion among the beneficiaries.

3.8     The key factor contributing to Ecuador‟s low adoption of sector reforms is its lack of
sector law and relevant regulations that legitimize the actions of all relevant water sector
agencies, especially those related to investment implementation responsibilities in rural water
and sanitation projects. Had the sector law been approved, municipal governments would have
gained in terms of investment budgets to implement water and sanitation projects in rural areas;
central government investment agencies would have correspondingly lost. Although
decentralization was –and is still today- the general government policy, municipal governments
continue to be regarded as institutionally weak investment implementing agencies and therefore
do not receive the investment budgets.

3.9     Paraguay: From 1972 to 2002 national WSS strategic planning, policy making,
infrastructure planning and investment implementation in small towns and rural areas with fewer
than 10,000 people were the responsibility of SENASA, at the Ministry of Public Health and
Social Services (Law 360/1972). WSS service provision has been the responsibility of the
WBAs, appointed by SENASA, since 1974 (Law 360/1972 and Decree 8910/1974). In 2002, the
Ministry of Public Works and Communications took over SENASA‟s national strategic planning
and policy making functions in the water and sanitation sector (Law 1614/2000, Decree
18,880/2002).

3.10 SENASA has retained its WSS investment planning and budgeting and project
implementation functions to the present time. During project implementation, in line with the
RWSS IV design, SENASA hired private consulting firms to help in promotion activities and
investment prioritization through participatory planning.

3.11 RWSS IV effectively consolidated the results achieved through the previous three RWSS
projects supported by the Bank and outsourced SENASA‟s traditional activities to the private
sector, NGOs, and association of WBAs. This has enabled scaling up of the RWSS investments
using the WBA service delivery model in a wider geographical area in more remote and poorer
regions. Specifically, SENASA contracted out 100 percent of the 591 final engineering designs,
588 promotion contracts, and 588 supervision contracts to the private sector. Construction of
water and sewerage systems was also outsourced to private contractors, including ten-year
design-build-operate contracts for eight systems. In addition, the technical assistance, capacity
building, and post construction support to the WBAs have been transferred to the associations of
WBAs. The project also developed SENASA‟s operational strategy, including a diagnosis of the
sector, SENASA‟s organization and role, and a tentative investment plan through 2010.

3.12 SENASA has generated confidence from its financiers. By 2010 it had an approved
investment portfolio in the amount of US$ 59 million financed by the World Bank, Central
American Monetary Stabilization Fund, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Inter-
American Development Bank (IADB), and it is being offered an additional US$ 83 million from

4
  While PRAGUAS required a 10 percent up-front contribution from beneficiaries and 20 percent from
municipalities to finance investments in rural areas, alternative MIDUVI/SSA projects required no contributions
from the beneficiaries.
                                                         8


IADB/Spain, the Fund for the Financial Development of the Plata Basin, and the Brazil-
Paraguay Bilateral Yacyreta Agency (Entidad Bilateral Yacyreta, EBY). However, SENASA‟s
parent Ministry and the Ministry of Finance are concerned about its capacity as it implemented
only 14 percent of its approved budget during 2010. SENASA has traditionally been supporting
10 to 90 WBAs per year, but at present it faces new challenges, such as adoption of investment
portfolio management skills and transformation of WBAs into sustainable and commercially
governed structures.

3.13 The regulatory and policy making functions were no longer within SENASA at project
closure because the Sanitary Services Regulation Agency (Ente Regulador de Servicios
Sanitarios, Paraguay, ERSSAN) had been established, and policymaking functions had been
transferred to the Ministry of Public Works. Within its mandate, SENASA has successfully
modified the investment financing policy, and made sure that WBAs assume the commitment of
100 percent O&M cost recovery (now monitored by the regulator, ERSSAN).

3.14 At the time of the PPAR mission in December 2010, further progress had been made in
Paraguay and the follow on project to RWSS IV, the Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization
Project, approved in April 2009 was under implementation. In Ecuador the second phase of the
RWSS program, PRAGUAS II had closed two years early in March 2009 with the cancellation
of a majority of the project funds in response to the new government. With a new constitution
approved in 2008, the National Secretary of Planning and Development (SENPLADES) along
with the Ministry of Finance are currently redefining investment planning, implementation and
budget allocation responsibilities, and the roles to be played by various sector ministries and at
all government levels. MIDUVI/SSA has proposed to decentralize its core functions to eight
regions.

WSS Service Delivery Models
3.15 In PRAGUAS and RWSS IV three types of WSS service delivery models were
implemented: (i) municipal company models in the small towns; (ii) WBAs in the rural areas;
and (iii) contracts with private sector operators in the rural areas.

3.16 Municipal company models in Ecuador – PRAGUAS used incentive packages5 to
entice municipal governments to delegate the management of their water service provision to
public or private companies. Out of the eight municipalities that received such incentive
packages, six chose autonomous municipality-owned companies, one a cooperative owned by
the beneficiaries and one a mixed shareholding company (49 percent of shares held by customers
and 51 percent by the municipality). The autonomous municipal company delivers the services
and carries out O&M using the combination of tariff revenues and recurrent transfers from
municipal governments. The municipal companies work based on annual operating plans and
report to their Boards of Directors who are appointed by the municipal councils. The mixed
shareholding company and the cooperative models, on the other hand, operate more
independently from the municipalities and follow commercial principles. They have 10-year

  The incentive package included feasibility study grants plus a 50 percent grant for eligible investment costs. The
other 50 percent of investment cost was expected to be financed 30 percent from tariff revenues and 20 percent from
the municipal budgets.

performance contracts with the municipal companies and report to a Board of Directors
appointed by the shareholders. Investments of all municipal company models are financed by a
combination of central government grant funding and limited municipal government
contribution.

3.17 Water beneficiary associations in Ecuador and Paraguay – Rural WBAs are
established as non-profit organizations to participate in the planning, construction, financing and
O&M of water supply infrastructure that is built for their communities. The articles of their
constitution are a legal document under relevant laws in both countries, and include rules of
governance and the WBA‟s obligation to operate and maintain the water supply system using the
tariff revenues collected from the beneficiaries. In both countries, the bulk of the financing for
the investments were provided as grants by the government.

3.18 Private Sector Operators in Paraguay – The RWSS IV supported the formation of
WBAs that procured private sector operators (PSOs) to build, operate, and maintain their water
supply infrastructure. Construction companies partnered with “aguateros? (small private sector
providers of WSS services and owners of very small piped systems) to get performance contracts
with the WBAs to build, operate, and maintain their water supply systems. Contract clauses
included, among others, specifications stating that the tariffs should cover O&M costs at all
times, plus the recovery of PSOs‟ investment costs. In all contracts, PSOs contributed a
substantive share of the investment costs. The first output-based-approach scheme of private
sector participation in rural water was tested in eight pilot communities. Under this approach, the
entrepreneurs competed on the amount of subsidy they would request from the government.

3.19 From a financial sustainability perspective, the IEG mission observed that the WBA
model tends to work well because the WBAs are accountable to the beneficiaries who are closely
monitoring the performance of the WBAs. The private sector operators often perform well
because of the contractual obligations for them to ensure proper O&M and meet the needs of the
consumers, but the fees paid to the private operators translate into higher operating costs that the
consumers need to bear. The municipal models in small towns in Ecuador are not working as
well because of the political influence on tariff and investment decisions faced by the
municipalities. The financial assessment of the three models in the two countries is carried out in
the next chapter under Financial Sustainability.

Financing Policies for Investments
3.20   The current RWSS financing policies in Ecuador and Paraguay are outlined in Table 3-3.

3.21 Ecuador: The WSS investments in the urban perimeter of the municipalities are funded
by a combination of central government grants and municipalities‟ recurrent budget
contributions. In rural areas, WSS financing policies are defined on an investment by investment
basis. PRAGUAS supported the government to establish a common financing policy which
included 10 percent cash contribution of the total investment costs from beneficiaries. This was
difficult to implement because affordability constraints.

3.22 According to the Ex-Post Evaluation of the PRAGUAS Project conducted to assess the
impact of the project in achieving its outcomes, the proportion of families that contributed cash
                                                                  10


to the financing of rural water supply projects varied across provinces from 8 percent to 90
percent of the total investment costs (Quinteros-Rojas-Duenas 2006). The amount of cash
contributed by family was also highly variable, from US$12/family (about 1.7 percent of the
US$700 investment cost per connection) to US$120/family. Based on sample information
collected during the IEG mission, only 20 percent of the households in the project communities
made any cash contributions to the investment, typically up to 5 percent of the total.

3.23 Paraguay: The RWSS IV financing arrangements became part of government policy as
the project and its implementation rules were approved by the Congress. The project‟s rules
therefore became the policy for wider adoption by all RWSS programs in the country. The policy
was slightly modified to reflect the affordability concerns of the poor in October 2004 (by
Presidential Decree 3617).

     a.This represents the policy adopted in 2004, after the RWSS IV was already under implementation.


3.24 According to ERSSAN, however, this financing policy promoted the proliferation of
smaller systems that required paying a lower share of the costs, even in cases where larger
systems were most suitable due to economies of scale, to satisfy beneficiaries‟ demand for water
at lower unit investment and operating costs.

3.25 Sanitation: PRAGUAS investment financing policy for sanitation in rural areas in
Ecuador was 70 percent contribution by the central government and the balance by beneficiaries,
including 10 percent up-front cash. In Paraguay, the financing policy for rural sewerage and
wastewater treatment plants was 60 percent contribution by the WBAs (i.e., beneficiaries), 30
percent by a long term loan from SENASA to WBAs, and 10 percent grant financing from
                                                11


SENASA to WBAs, both funded by the World Bank loan. Because of the high level of
beneficiary contribution required for the sewerage investments, the effective demand was lower
than expected. Only three out of the ten sewerage systems were constructed under the project.
This led to the reduced disbursements of this component for RWSS IV. Since lack of proper
treatment of wastewater could have health and environmental implications, it is common to see
significant subsidies allocated by the central government to this sub-sector, however in the case
of Paraguay it was not the case. Latrines and indigenous water projects were fully financed by
the World Bank loan in Paraguay. There was no special financing policy for indigenous
populations in Ecuador.

Tariff Setting and Cost Recovery Policies
3.26 Under both projects, water tariffs are expected to be set to at least cover the O&M costs
of the WSS services. In the small towns in Ecuador, the tariffs are expected to cover O&M costs
plus at least 30 percent of new investment costs. The actual cost recovery performance for both
countries is presented in Chapter 4 on Financial Sustainability.

3.27 With regards to tariff setting, in Paraguay until 2000, WBAs themselves were setting
their tariffs to cover O&M costs; from 2000 to the present under the guidance of SENASA,
ERSSAN has had a mandate to approve such tariffs based on economic and financial criteria.
ERSSAN is financed by a 1 percent fee on all water service providers, including WBAs. The
latter have been expected to cover O&M plus financing costs due to SENASA, provided they
have loans to finance their water supply infrastructure. ERSSAN regulates water companies that
service large urban areas as well as WBAs in small towns and rural areas. The large number of
WBAs (around 2,000) makes it difficult to monitor compliance. Under the PSO models piloted
under RWSS IV, the contract clauses state that the tariffs should cover O&M costs at all times,
plus the recovery of PSOs‟ investment costs. The tariff is therefore regulated by contract.

3.28 In Ecuador, there is no formal system in place to regulate the tariffs. The municipalities‟
tariffs are approved by their Board of Directors, and the RWSS tariffs are set by the WBAs
themselves.

3.29 The projects did not have a component that paid for or installed water meters, but lack of
metering often led to high consumption of water, including wastages and leakage. According to
the IEG mission, the implementing agencies realized the importance of using the meters as the
projects progressed, and adopted them in their sub-projects.

4. Financial Sustainability
4.1     The financial sustainability of the two projects was assessed three years after project
closure using the cost recovery indicator (tariff revenues as a percentage of O&M costs).
Average tariff, liters of water consumed per capita per day (lpcd), revenue per connection, and
collection efficiency were also reviewed to complement the assessment. The analysis is based on
the information collected from MIDUVI in Ecuador and SENASA in Paraguay, and verified by
IEG‟s visits to a sample of more than 20 project sites in each country.

4.2    In Ecuador the water supply systems in the rural communities operated by the WBAs are
in general more financially sustainable than those in the small towns. In Paraguay,tariffs are set
according to revenue requirement criteria for all WBAs in rural areas and small towns. For the
PSOs, the tariff revenues are expected to cover their O&M costs plus some returns on their
investments.

Water Systems run by Small towns in Ecuador
4.3      Most municipalities regard water as a public/social service rather than as an economic
good. As such, municipal authorities often offer their electorate water for free or at nominal
tariffs. Even in the case where municipalities have created autonomous water utilities, the
principles of commercial governance are often not applied. In the municipalities of Cayambe
(Pichincha Province) and Pujili (Cotopaxi province) visited by the IEG mission, politically-
motivated Boards of Directors rejected the tariff increases in the spirit of providing a public
service that they still think should be free.

4.4     Tariffs and cost recovery – Average 1999 tariffs for residential customers were below
US$0.03/rn3. In 2010, average tariff in small towns was about US$0.12/m3. Even this rate was
lower than what the WBAs were charging their rural communities. At this tariff level, an average
water utility can only cover about half of its O&M costs. The utilities expect to receive
operational subsidies to cover the deficit, but as this often does not happen, the utility managers
are forced to cut some vital operational costs and all maintenance costs. As a result, rationing of
service is very frequent and the system reliability is hampered.

4.5     Water consumption and Revenue per Connection – At a low average tariff of
US$0.12/m3, the estimated average water consumption is 217 lpcd. This is almost twice as much
as what an average household in a European country consumes. There was no incentive to
control the consumption because very few connections were metered, and as a result, there was a
lot of wastage and leakage. Accordingly, average revenue per connection is US$47 per year
which is too low for an average utility to be financially viable. To ensure equitable distribution
of water and to increase the revenue per connection, consumption started to be metered under
PRAGUAS, but average consumption levels cannot be controlled if the tariffs continue to be
low.
                                                13


Water Systems run by Water Beneficiary Associations in Ecuador
4.6     Tariffs and cost recovery. Tariffs were introduced into the formerly unserved rural areas
only when the project constructed the water supply infrastructure and extended the services to
these communities. Average tariff in the rural communities is about US$0.15/m3. With this tariff,
the average WBA can cover 100 percent of its O&M costs. Most communities visited by the IEG
mission operated their water systems continuously (24 hours/day, seven day/week) and the
beneficiaries were accustomed to pay for the water they consumed.

4.7     Water consumption and Revenue per Connection. At the above average tariff rate,
average water consumption in the rural communities is about 70 lpcd, just above the 60 lpcd
which is the minimum standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Accordingly,
average revenue per connection is US$21 per year or about US$1.75/month per household. This
is high enough to cover the O&M costs but too low for carrying out any future investments.

Water Systems Run by Water Beneficiary Associations in Paraguay
4.8     Tariffs and cost recovery. As in the case for the unserved rural areas in Ecuador, tariffs
were introduced when the project constructed the water supply infrastructure and extended the
services to the communities. The average tariff for water systems run by WBAs is about
US$0.19/m3. At this tariff level, the average Junta can cover 100 percent of its O&M costs. As
long as the communities have metering of their consumption, they are capable of running the
systems continuously.

4.9    Water consumption and Revenue per Connection. At an average tariff of US$0.19/m3
the average consumption is about 130 lpcd. This is about the same level as the average per capita
consumption in a European country. Accordingly, average revenue per connection is US$45 per
year which is high enough to achieve financial sustainability in Paraguay.

Water Systems Run by Private Sector Operators in Paraguay
4.10 Tariffs and cost recovery. The PSO model was a pilot in Paraguay. In Caaguazu, run by
a PSO, the water tariff was about US$0.40/m3. At this tariff level, the PSO is likely to achieve
190 percent O&M cost recovery. The PSO in this case, however, was running the water supply
systems with frequent interruptions and, as a result, people were paying a lot more for an
inferior/unreliable service.

4.11 Water consumption and Revenue per Connection. At an average tariff of US$0.40/m3
the average consumption in Caaguazu is about 87 lpcd, equivalent to the minimum consumption
of 13 m3 per month. At an 87 lpcd consumption and a US$0.40/m3 tariff level, average revenue
per connection is US$63 per year, or just above US$5/month. The PSO model has helped the
WBAs to set the tariffs at the levels to recover their O&M costs, but the concerns remain over
the affordability of these systems especially if they are serving poor rural communities.

4.12 Financial sustainability beyond O&M cost recovery. Some WBAs have generated a
surplus for the replacement of the water system and/or for its expansion to serve new customers
(see Annex B).
                                                 14


4.13 Collection Efficiency. According to ERSSAN, collection efficiency -defined as the ratio
of collected revenues over water billed- has been reported to be very high, at an average of 95
percent for the WBAs and the PSOs. Such high collection efficiency has been achieved because
disconnection policy has been included in the articles of constitution of WBAs and in the
Contract with PSO in Paraguay. However, application of this policy in the case of PSOs seems to
have resulted in an alarming high rate of disconnections (30 percent). The Collection efficiencies
are around 80 percent in municipal companies and around 95 percent in the rural communities in
Ecuador.

5. Lessons
Sector reform and the related shift in institutional culture require political support and time

5.1    It is important to identify the potential risks up front, and carry out proper stakeholder
analysis and to make a realistic projection of the time it takes to change the roles of the
Government agencies and to devolve the WSS investment and O&M responsibilities to the local
government or the community level.

5.2    Both Ecuador and Paraguay experienced delays in project effectiveness and
implementation due to political instability and social unrest. They also faced difficulties in
reforming the public sector agencies to be credible partners in facilitating the investments in the
RWSS sector.

5.3     In the case of Paraguay the central agency, SENASA had already been in operation for 25
years at the time of project approval since its establishment in 1972. Prior to RWSS IV, the Bank
had supported SENASA through three previous projects where practical rules for organizing and
building the capacities of the WBAs to operate and maintain their RWSS systems were tested
and mainstreamed. While the three preceding projects together created more than 400 WBAs
providing services to more than 400,000 beneficiaries, even with this track record and three and
a half years of project extension, RWSS IV struggled to reach its target number of beneficiaries,
primarily due to political instability. RWSS IV was successful in enabling SENASA to fully
transform its role from being an implementer to becoming a promoter of RWSS investments
through contracting out its core implementation and technical assistance functions to the private
sector, non-governmental organizations, and association of WBAs. Thirty years of continuous
Bank support for phased reforms may be a factor in explaining these good results in Paraguay.

5.4     In contrast, Ecuador attempted to achieve the difficult reform objective of shifting
investment responsibility from the central government level to the municipal government level
during the five-year first phase of the APL. The reforms in Ecuador were particularly difficult
because the institutional culture of the Ecuadorian Institute of Sanitary Works or Instituto
Ecuatoriano de Obras Sanitarias in Spanish (IEOS) , a central government agency that controlled
the water sector for almost 30 years, was still dominant at the time of the project, although IEOS‟
responsibilities had been transferred to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing
(Ministerio de Desarrollo Urbano y Vivienda, MIDUVI)/ Subsecretariat of Environmental
Sanitation (Sub-secretaría de Saneamiento Ambiental, SSA). The new organization under
MIDUVI/SSA was established only eight years before the project was approved, and the WBA
model under the jurisdiction of municipal governments was introduced by PRAGUAS for the
                                                 15


first time, during the first phase of its APL. While Paraguay created 48 WBAs in its first project
implemented during 1978-83, and only achieved the creation of 594 WBAs in its fourth project,
Ecuador aimed to establish 588 WBAs already in its first phase at the same time as building the
capacity of the municipalities to implement the investments.

Formalization of consistent policies is critical for reform

5.5     The comparison of the WSS sector‟s institutional framework in Ecuador and Paraguay
reveals the importance of formalizing sector policies through legal decrees and formal approvals
by the Congress to ensure that the financial and investment policies are enforced. While they
may not be sufficient, formalization of the policies and sector institutional responsibilities seem
to be necessary for the implementation of reforms especially as the countries face political
changes.

5.6      In Paraguay, rules for engaging various stakeholders were embedded in laws and decrees.
This facilitated the implementation of coherent and consistent financial and investment policies
across the sector regardless of who is funding the investments. In Ecuador, on the other hand, the
main elements of the institutional and financial policies were not formalized prior to project
initiation. Instead, arrangements were agreed on an investment by investment basis. While
PRAGUAS would require community contribution to investment financing, other projects led by
the government may provide new rural WSS systems for free. Lack of formal sector policies has
caused the ad hoc approaches to community participation in WSS investments and undermined
the importance of community ownership through beneficiary contributions. This has hampered
the sustainability of WSS sector investments in Ecuador.

WBA models show good financial sustainability

5.7     While the physical sustainability does not only depend on the level of O&M cost
recovery as there are other influencing factors such as the capacity and incentives of the service
providers to carry out proper maintenance, long-term financial sustainability depends on whether
the institutional arrangements for implementing cost recovery policies are sound and responsive
to local conditions. This assessment of the two RWSS projects have enabled a comparison of; (i)
independent regulation; (ii) regulation by contract, and (iii) social accountability as the means of
enforcing the cost recovery policies in rural areas and small towns.

   Independent Regulation: In the case of Paraguay, there is a Regulator (ERSSAN) whose
    mandate is to ensure that tariffs are set according to the cost recovery rules and in accordance
    with the affordability to the consumers. While there is a remaining challenge for ERSSAN to
    regulate the increasing number of WBAs, results so far show that the tariff revenues cover
    the O&M costs and often even part of the capital costs in Paraguay.

   Regulation by contract: In the case of Ecuador‟s municipal company models, in which the
    private sector operators (PSOs) are paid for their services out of tariff revenues cost recovery
    is self-enforced provided tariffs are set according to the cost recovery rules. This is because
    the contractual obligations with the PSOs include clauses related to tariff adjustments to
    compensate for cost increases.
                                                16


   Social accountability: In the rural areas where WBAs are accountable to their communities,
    they won‟t be able to operate and maintain their water supply schemes if they do not collect
    sufficient tariff revenues. Without other sources of funds to pay for operations and
    maintenance, the service would deteriorate. Knowing that cost recovery can help avoid
    service interruption, local rural communities in both countries seem to be disposed toward
    paying the necessary tariffs.

5.8     In contrast to the above three regulation models, the small towns of Ecuador have a
municipal regulatory arrangement. Water utilities in these small towns are experiencing
difficulties achieving their cost recovery as the tariffs are typically set below the O&M costs.
The municipalities‟ Boards of Directors include local politicians who see water supply as a
public service that ought to be free. They believe that general municipal revenues will be used to
cover any deficits resulting from low tariff revenues. As a result, the conventional WBA models
in both countries and the PSO models in Paraguay show stronger financial sustainability
compared to the municipal models implemented in Ecuador where tariffs are approve by
municipal authorities.

Sanitation requires more attention

5.9     Both projects included components to increase coverage of improved sanitation, but the
real outcomes achieved through the project activities have been generally poor or difficult to
assess due to lack of available data on outcomes. In the case of Ecuador, 14,000 people had
received sanitation facilities only (mostly flush toilets, hand washer sink and shower facilities),
and 129,000 people had received both water connections and sanitation facilities under
PRAGUAS, but no evidence of the usage of these facilities or the outcomes in the form of health
or environmental impacts were available. In the case of Paraguay, only three out of the planned
ten sewerage system pilots were constructed under RWSS IV because there was lack of demand
from the beneficiaries who already have other means of sanitation, and lack of experience in
promoting and financing sewerage projects in the country.

5.10 Because of the environmental and health externalities of the current low levels of
sanitation coverage in both countries, it is important for the Government and the Bank teams to
pay more attention to and effectively track the progress in the sanitation sub-sector both during
project preparation and implementation.

Post construction technical support and capacity building enhance the sustainability of
community participatory water supply services

5.11 The importance of demand-responsive, community participatory approach has been
identified to ensure successful implementation of the water supply and sanitation investments in
rural areas and small towns. For the water systems to be sustainable, there also needs to be an
institutionalized arrangement for technical assistance and post-construction support for
continuous capacity building of WBAs. In the case of Paraguay, initially SENASA and later the
Association of WBAs have provided such support in the form of training and seminars. As a
result, even if there are no subsidies allocated for the purpose of O&M, most of the rural WSS
systems managed by the WBAs in Paraguay are reported to be functioning three years after
completion. In contrast, the indigenous communities systems in Paraguay and WBAs in Ecuador

that do not have such institutionalized systems for support, are experiencing sustainability issues

themselves.

Background
1.      The late 1990s was a period of democratization and decentralization in Paraguay. The
country was politically stable, however there was a short period of political turmoil right as
implementation of the 4th Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSS IV) began, in
1998/1999. The situation stabilized by 2003-2004, with the election of a new president whose
campaign emphasized social and fiscal responsibility.6 In 1997, at the time of project
preparation, Paraguay's population was estimated at 4.7 million, of which half lived in rural
areas. Some 60 percent of the urban and 20 percent of the rural population had piped potable
water supply services. Provision of sewerage services was lower: only about 27 percent of the
urban population was connected to a sewerage service, compared to an average of 53 percent for
the Latin America Region.

 Presidents during project preparation and implementation: 1993-98 Juan Carlos Wasmosy; 1998-99 Raul Cubas;
1999-2003 Gonzales Machi; 2003-08 Nicanor Duarte.

2.      At the time of project start up, sweeping reforms took place in the water and sanitation
sector in Paraguay. The project was timely because it could support the reforms that the
Government had initiated. The public Corporation of Sanitary Works, CORPOSANA
(Corporacion de Obras Sanitarias) was re-structured to work according to private company law,
with equity shareholdings open to the private sector. The new re-structured company, Empresa de
Servicios Sanitarios del Paraguay (ESSAP S.A.), started its functions in April 2002.7 At the same
time, the Water and Sanitation Sector Regulatory Agency (Ente Regulador de Servicios Sanitarios,
ERSSAN)8 was created to work as an independent regulatory agency with the members of its
Board of Directors appointed by the National Congress for five year terms. ESSAP SA, had the
mandate to provide water and sanitation services in all urban areas, with populations larger than
10,000 people. The creation of ERSSAN made one of the project development objectives of
RWSS IV irrelevant; namely, the role of SENASA as a regulator in rural WSS could not be
achieved as ERSSAN was allocated that role.

3.      The National Service of Environmental Health, Servicio Nacional de Saneamiento
Ambiental (SENASA), created in 1972,9 was allocated the responsibility for implementing water
and sanitation projects in small towns and rural areas with fewer than 4,000 people. For
implementing such projects, SENASA was expected to create Water Beneficiary Associations
(WBAs) that would be the asset holders of the water supply infrastructure and be responsible for
the service provision. The concept of the WBAs was introduced in 1974 in Paraguay,10 and the
Bank had its first project to support them in 1978. WBAs are non-profit organizations with a legal
charter of constitution including a governing board with democratically-elected members. They
participate as main stakeholder during investment planning of their WBA water infrastructure and
thereafter they operate and maintain it.

4.      Prior to RWSS IV, the Bank had supported three previous projects where practical rules for
organizing and building the capacities of the WBAs to participate in investment planning and
operate their RWSS systems were tested and mainstreamed. The three preceding projects together
created more than 400 WBAs providing services to more than 400,000 people. RWSS IV
envisaged to scale up the WBA model in other rural areas not yet covered under the first three
projects, test the private sector operator model, and to fully transform the role of SENASA from
being an implementer to becoming a promoter of RWSS investments through contracting out its
core implementation and technical assistance functions to the private sector, non-governmental
organizations, and association of WBAs.

5.      A development peculiar to Paraguay at the time of project preparation was the widespread
existence of very small private sector providers of water services, who owned small private
networks serving small number of households mostly in the peri-urban areas of the capital city,
Asuncion. Based on this experience, the RWSS IV included a pilot to test contracts with them to
operate and maintain water supply systems for WBAs.

Project Design
DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

6.      The project development objective, as stated in the project appraisal document (PAD), was:
“The rapid increase of water supply and sanitation coverage in the rural areas.? The secondary
development objective was “to modify SENASA's role in the sector from an implementer of
projects to an efficiently managed promoter of activities through the shifting of its current activities
to the private sector and non-governmental organizations while still maintaining its regulatory
functions.?

7.      The objectives in the Loan Agreement were to “(a) increase the coverage of water supply
and sanitation and sewerage services in the rural areas within the Borrower‟s territory; and (b)
strengthen SENASA‟s institutional capacity to assist the Borrower in achieving the objective
mentioned in (a) herein.? The two articulations are consistent, with the two main outcomes of
increased WSS coverage in rural areas and institutional strengthening of SENASA. The PPAR will
take the objectives as stated in the PAD because they are more detailed, specific and monitorable.

COMPONENTS

8.      The project had three components. (1) Water Supply, which consisted of three sub-
components including new water systems, expansion of existing systems, and new systems in
indigenous communities; (2) Wastewater Disposal, which consisted of two sub-components
including sewerage systems and construction of on-site systems; (3) Technical Assistance, which
consisted of four sub-components including institutional strengthening of SENASA and the newly
formed WBAs, pilot program for private providers, promotion of association of WBAs and
National Rural Water and Sanitation Program (Table A-1).

9.       Water supply infrastructure facilities built for rural communities organized as WBAs were
expected to be financed by SENASA grants (40 percent) and loans from SENASA to WBAs (30
percent), and the balance by cash contributions from WBAs‟ beneficiaries (15 percent) and labor
contributions (15 percent); in the case of water systems for indigenous communities, financing was
expected to be 100 percent grants from SENASA. Waste water disposal infrastructure in small
towns was expected to be financed by WBA beneficiaries (60 percent), a loan from SENASA to
the WBA (30 percent) and a grant from SENASA in favor of WBA (10 percent); in the case of
rural pit latrines, beneficiaries were expected to contribute cash and labor (30 percent) and the
balance by a grant from SENASA. The Pilot testing participation of Private Sector Operators
(PSOs) was expected to undertake competitive bidding for ten-year concession contracts to attract
partial private finance (undetermined during project appraisal) and the balance was going to be
financed by SENASA (undetermined) and beneficiaries (5 percent cash).

10.    The Bank funded three previous sequential loans supporting the creation of WBAs. Such
loans gradually built the capacity in SENASA to start up WBA financing in the first two projects
at about 10 WBAs per year, then 60 per year in the third project, and 90 per year in the RWSS
IV project (Table A-2).

11.      RWSS IV incorporated lessons learned from the previous Bank engagement in the RWSS
sector and emphasized: (i) the importance of community participation prior to creating WBAs;
(ii) the need to establish associations of "WBAs" to serve as institutionalized means for
documenting and sharing lessons from experience and to provide technical assistance to newly
establish WBAs at low costs; and (iii) importance of strengthening SENASA's capacities for
project implementation.

12.      Project design adopted a demand-driven approach tested in previous projects by
SENASA. The RWSS IV introduced a new feature which was to implement all phases of the
project cycle using the private consulting companies. Private consulting companies would
handle the activities that were previously carried out by SENESA, including the promotion
activities to organize WBAs, and preliminary and final designs of the water supply schemes.
Infrastructure construction and supervision were also outsourced, but SENASA retained
supervisory functions, to ensure that the outputs were produced according to the contractual
specifications. Involving private consulting companies was appropriate, given that the number of
projects per year was increasing as the SENESA model was scaled up.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

13.      Project implementation was agreed to be under SENASA, using the existing capacities of
its various departments who among other things were in charge of procurement of all civil works
and consulting services. However, unlike previous Bank projects that allowed SENASA to do most
of the studies and engineering designs internally with its own personnel, under RWSS IV all
engineering designs and supervision of construction contracts were expected to be contracted out
to private consulting firms; equally, community mobilization and promotion work for the
formation of WBAs were expected to be contracted out to private firms or NGOs.

15.     Actual project cost was US$49.43 million, or 89 percent of the planned US$55.70
million. Bank financing (US$40 million) was all disbursed. About US$3 million, however, was
reallocated, mainly from the water supply and sanitation components to the Project Management
component and the Institutional Development component (Table B-3). Reasons for reallocation
include:

    An increase in project administration costs by US$3 million due to the implementation of a
     larger-than-expected number of water systems (496 actual compared with 330 at appraisal)
     and water for indigenous communities projects (71 actual compared with 35 at appraisal). As
     a result, a larger-than-anticipated allocation for project promotion, final designs, and
     supervision costs was required.
    Lower allocation to the water component due to smaller size sub-projects (108 connections
     per water system) than anticipated at appraisal (188 connections per water system) and the
     corresponding lower construction cost. The increased allocation to a larger-than-anticipated
     number of indigenous water supply projects was more than compensated by the lower
     allocation to other water supply projects.
    Less-than-expected spending in sewerage and wastewater treatment projects because of high
     expected contributions from beneficiaries which attracted lower demand from the WBAs.

million). Actual counterpart contributions for project financing were US$9.43 million (60
percent of planned) due to the following factors:

   Lower-than-expected financing was required for the investments in components one, which
    supported water supply systems (85 percent of planned) and two, which supported
    wastewater disposal systems (48 percent of planned);
   Beneficiaries contributed US$0.49 million, much less than the planned US$11.6 million,
    mainly due to change of project financing policy by a presidential decree (Decree 3617,
    2004) issued in October 2004 mandating that beneficiaries of projects with fewer than 150
    connections contribute only 3 percent cash contribution compared to the original 15 percent.
    Out of 496 investment projects, 427 had fewer than 150 connections and therefore had
    smaller cash contribution from beneficiaries. As a result, Government contribution increased
    (from US$4.1 million to US$8.94 million).

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

17.     RWSS IV was approved on August 28, 1997 and was effective on September 11, 1998.
The project was delayed due to the 1998 presidential elections and the subsequent resignation of
a newly-elected president in March 1999. The project‟s slow startup was also attributed to the
beneficiaries‟ low willingness to contribute to subproject financing while projects financed by
other donors (e.g., Inter American Development Bank) were offering financing to WBAs on
softer conditions. By mid 2000, almost two years after effectiveness, the project had disbursed
only US$2.7 million (or 6.8 percent of the total project cost of US$40 million) which is
significantly less than the disbursement projection of US$7.3 million by the end of the second
year.

18.     The project implementation delays were partly due to the suspension of Bank
disbursements to Paraguay between December 2002 and April 2003. The project implementation
finally picked up in 2003 and the reforms were implemented according to project design.
Although the original closing date was December 31, 2003, the actual closing date became June
30, 2007, due to three extensions. By June 2003, six months before the original closing date,
disbursements reached about 25 percent of the US$40 million and a two-year extension was
requested setting a new closing date to December 2005. The second one-year extension was
granted at the end of 2005 and the third extension was done subsequently, moving the closing
date to June 2007. The total length of the project was almost nine years.

SAFEGUARDS

19.     Although no negative impact was expected from the water supply systems built under the
project, the project was rated as category B because of the potential limited impact that the
discharge of treated wastewater may have in some cases. No adverse impacts on the environment
were reported during project implementation. A new environmental agency was created in the
early 2000s, and SENASA had to comply with stricter than anticipated environmental standards.
                                                25


The regional safeguards adviser commended the Bank‟s supervision team for its incorporation of
social and indigenous issues into project design and implementation.

20.     The social aspects of the project were handled well as well, as the project focused on
community participation in its rural WSS investments, inclusion of a sub-component covering
the indigenous communities, and encouraging the participation of women, who are the main
users and suppliers of water in rural Paraguay.

FIDUCIARY

21.    There were no significant deviations or waivers from Bank fiduciary policies and
procedures. Financial management and procurement were handled using government structures
and procedures, and financial auditing of project implementation were done by international
auditors.

M&E Design, Implementation, and Utilization
M&E DESIGN

22.      The first objective has two dimensions, which are the rapid increase in (i) water and in
(ii) sanitation coverage. However, the PAD proposed to track achievement of the first objective
with only one, namely “water coverage in rural areas indicator;? the national baseline for this
indicator was 20 percent, and the project aimed at a 30 percent target. Sanitation coverage or
other appropriate indicators should also have been used to track achievement of the objective‟s
second dimension. No specific M&E arrangements to evaluate outcome of pilot activities were
proposed in the PAD.

23.     The PAD proposed to track achievement of the second objective using the “number of
staff per system constructed per year? indicator. This indicator is clear and can be monitored
with independent criteria, yet it is not always appropriate because number of systems can grow
quicker by each system having fewer connections as was the case during project implementation.
The indicator does not provide sufficient basis to assess SENASA‟s efficiency. Number of
connection per staff member, for example could have been a more appropriate indicator for
monitoring the efficiency.

24.     At appraisal, it was agreed that the M&E system would be established by qualified
consultants while the relevant data would be collected by the planning department at SENASA,
as part of its normal activities.

IMPLEMENTATION OF M&E

25.     An M&E system to produce information for monitoring and evaluation of project
outcomes was not developed as proposed. Data collection during project implementation was
limited to the indicators for project outputs and was done by the planning department at
SENASA. The surveys required for establishing the baseline and to follow up on service
coverage levels and the incidence of water-related diseases were not carried out. The information
on outputs was used as evidence of achievement of the objectives in the absence of adequate
indicators to measure the development outcomes.
                                                26


UTILIZATION OF M&E

26.     The Planning Department did not develop the M&E as expected at project design, and
therefore its utilization cannot be assessed.

27.    The quality of M&E is therefore rated Negligible.

Relevance
28.     Relevance of project objectives was substantial. The main development objective of
the project, “to increase water supply and sanitation coverage in rural areas?, was in line with
both the 1997 CAS (time of the appraisal) and the 2004-2007 CAS (most recent) priority to
deliver basic social services and reduce poverty. It is also in line with the priority of the
government to promote social development. The secondary project objective, “to convert
SENASA from implementer to promoter while keeping its regulatory functions by extensively
using the private sector and NGOs for project implementation,? was also in line with both the
government‟s sector strategy and the CAS regarding private sector participation in project
implementation. Continued relevance of both objectives is evidenced by the approval of the
follow-on Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project I in 2009, with an objective to
increase the efficiency, coverage, and sustainability of water supply and sanitation (WSS)
services in Paraguay. SENASA‟s regulatory functions for small towns and rural areas have been
transferred to ERSSAN.

29.      Relevance of project design was substantial. The components and activities were well
chosen for achieving the project objectives. The project‟s implementation arrangements were
appropriate as it had been tested and mainstreamed in the previous projects. In addition to scaling
up the investments in the RWSS sector, the project created associations of the WBAs to follow
up with post-construction support to the WBAs to ensure sustainability of the investments. In
order for SENASA to become a promoter rather than an implementer of investments, appropriate
capacity building activities were carried out under the project to strengthen the private sector,
NGOs, and the WBAs. Project outputs were appropriately chosen to produce intended outcomes.
However, “the number of systems built per SENASA‟s staff? to measure the achievement of the
first objective related to improving SENESA‟s performance was not the most appropriate
indicator, as it could induce a perverse incentive for the SENASA staff to build smaller systems
in cases where larger systems would be optimal

INCREASE IN WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION COVERAGE IN RURAL AREAS

32.     The project aimed at increasing water supply coverage in the project areas which include
about 340 communities, WSS in 35 indigenous communities, and sewerage service in ten
communities. While the objective related to sanitation service coverage was not achieved, the
objective related to water supply coverage was substantially achieved. Since the project design
and activities focused more on the water component than on sanitation, IEG assesses that this
objective has substantially been met. The key achievements are summarized below.
                                                         28


      Coverage of water supply services attributable to the implementation of the RWSS IV rose
       from 20 percent in 1998 to 28 percent by the year 2007 against the target set at 30 percent.
       During the RWSS IV implementation period (1998-2007) the total number of new water
       systems built with the assistance of all donors11 was about 1,200, of which RWSS IV
       contributed 496. With the number of systems built during the last years, water supply
       coverage through piped water connection in rural areas and small towns increased to about
       50 percent by 2010.12

      In absolute terms, the RWSS IV project increased the water supply access to an additional
       294,000 people in rural areas, small towns, and areas populated by indigenous communities.
       This corresponds to an achievement of 85 percent of the 343,000 target set at appraisal.
       While SENASA reported100 percent functionality of the WSS systems constructed under
       RWSS IV, the IEG mission observed that some systems, especially in the indigenous
       communities, were not functioning (Box A1).

      Quality of water was not selected as a project performance indicator, and the data on quality
       was not available. Assuming that the coverage level was low at the beginning of the project
       (20 percent), it is implied that the beneficiaries that gained new access through the project
       have improved water supply service through access to the distribution networks of treated
       water. However, intermittent water supply may force the beneficiaries to resort back to the
       old untreated water.

      The project contributed to providing sanitation access to about 141,000 people, which
       represents 96 percent of the 147,000-person target set at appraisal. However, only three out
       of the ten planned sewerage and wastewater treatment subprojects were implemented due to
       the low demand from the beneficiaries. These beneficiaries were reluctant to provide cash
       contributions because they were used to receiving government investment subsidies. Also,
       beneficiaries in the service area had septic tanks and saw no reason to switch to sewerage
       services.

 Box A-1. IEG Field Visits in Paraguay
 Indigenous Communities, illustrating the importance of O&M Capacity Building
 The IEG mission randomly selected and visited three (of 71) water systems built for the indigenous
 communities, and found that the “Tajamares? (windmills equipped with slow sand filters systems) had
 stopped functioning. It is likely that this technology was new to the indigenous communities and that
 there was limited capacity to carry out proper maintenance. In two of the visited sites the Italian
 Cooperation had financed replacement of windmills for water treatment facilities to produce potable
 water using manual processes of flocculation and chlorination. The system was therefore working again
 and the indigenous people were operating the system well.
 Rural Communities, illustrating the importance of metering consumption
 The IEG mission visited 20 WBAs whose water systems were built by the RWSS IV project. In 5 of
 these systems, the beneficiaries located in lower parts of the distribution area overused the water while
 the beneficiaries in the upper parts experienced water shortages during extended hours of the day. The
 people in the lowland had no incentives to conserve the water and fed their cattle using the water from
 the WBA‟s system because they were charged a flat fee regardless of their consumption. Beneficiaries
 in WBAs with water flow meters reported no complaints.
 Rural Communities with ventilated latrines
 The IEG mission visited rural communities benefiting from improved ventilated latrines financed by
 the RWSS IV project in Caaguazu. Some of the beneficiaries have been replacing their latrines with
 flush toilets financed either by themselves or by projects of other donors (e.g., Plan International).
 SENASA was not aware of this and had no information about the functionality of the latrines.


MODIFYING SENASA’S ROLE IN THE SECTOR FROM AN IMPLEMENTER OF PROJECTS TO AN
EFFICIENTLY MANAGED PROMOTER OF ACTIVITIES

33.     RWSS IV effectively consolidated the results achieved through the previous three RWSS
projects supported by the Bank and outsourced SENASA‟s traditional activities to the private
sector, NGOs, and association of WBAs. This has enabled scaling up of the RWSS investments
using the WBA service delivery model in a wider geographical area. The second objective, “to
modify SENASA's role in the sector from an implementer of projects to an efficiently managed
promoter of activities through the shifting of its current activities to the private sector and non-
governmental organizations while still maintaining its regulatory functions? has therefore been
substantially achieved:

   SENASA contracted out 100 percent of the 591 final engineering designs, 588 promotion
    contracts, and 588 supervision contracts to the private sector. Construction of water and
    sewerage systems was also outsourced to private contractors, including ten-year design-
    build-operate contracts for eight systems. In addition, the technical assistance, capacity
    building, and post construction support to the WBAs have been transferred to the
    associations of WBAs (see below).

   The project accomplished to define and implement an institutional arrangement to provide
    technical support to WBAs through the establishment of the associations of WBAs. In total
    ten regional associations of WBAs have been established with participation of municipalities
    and regional governments to provide technical assistance to the new WBAs with weak
                                                                30


     capacities. Three of the ten associations of WBAs received office equipment, including
     computers, photocopiers, telephone, and fax, along with seed funding from the project, and
     the remaining seven are developing their capacities. This model has been instrumental in
     ensuring that continuous technical support is provided to the WBAs after construction of the
     water supply schemes without SENASA‟s involvement, and in reaching more remote and
     poorer regions.

    The number of employees per water system built was used by the project to monitor the
     achievement of this objective. This number went down from 6 in 1997 to 2.9 in 2007. Hence,
     the 2003 target of 3.1 has been exceeded. To attain this result SENESA reduced its staff from
     568 in 1997 to 445 by 2007. IEG assesses that this indicator does not represent the efficiency
     of the sector well as explained earlier in the relevance section.

    The project implemented the first output-based-approach scheme of private sector
     participation in rural water services in eight pilot communities. These eight communities
     piloted design-build-operate contracts to improve service provision at the WBA level. This
     exceeded the original target of five. IEG‟s observations of some schemes built under this
     pilot are summarized in Box A-2.

    SENASA improved its financial management using a unified information system and
     revision of managerial and administrative structure.

    According to ERSSAN, the current financing policy for RWSS systems, which was revised
     in 2004, gives perverse incentive to communities to favor the formation of small water
     supply systems (Table A6). Decree 3617, issued in 2004, ruled that systems with fewer than
     150 connections can be built with only 3 percent beneficiary cash contribution (as opposed to
     15 percent for systems with 150 or more connections). While many of the small and remote
     villages that had no technical means of joining larger schemes benefited from this change in
     the financing policy, it has also promoted the proliferation of WBAs with fewer connections.
     This trend is uneconomical, especially in areas where conveyance pipes from water source to
     reservoirs overlap, because the WBA could have enjoyed the economies of scale that can in
     turn reduce the construction, operation, and maintenance costs. At present there are about
     2,067 water systems administered by WBAs, of which 1,189 were built during the last ten
     years; 496 of these systems were financed by the RWSS IV, of which only 70 are systems
     have more than 150 connections. SENASA is exploring the possibility of changing its
     financing policy and promote the consolidation of WBAs without necessarily increasing their
     obligation to finance capital expenditures.

Box A-2. IEG Visits to Design-Build-Operatea Systems
The IEG mission visited four WBAs that have awarded the design-build-operate/maintain contracts to
private sector operators (PSO) and found that the schemes had low pressures and in need of frequent
rationing. It is likely that WBAs need to strengthen their capacity to carry out proper supervision of the
PSOs so that they comply with the contractual obligations.
a. In a design-build-operate contract, the public sector owns and finances the construction of new assets. The private sector
designs, builds and operates the assets to meet certain agreed outputs.

34.     ERSSAN is working on a revenue requirement methodology to set tariffs for WBAs.
SENASA plans to encourage each WBA to set its tariff according to the O&M cost recovery
principles (and in the case of loans, financial obligations would be included in the costs), with
the technical assistance from SENASA.

Efficiency
35.     The ex-ante economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated at appraisal based on a survey
of 8,000 households, in 30 communities. It was estimated for cash benefits and costs from sub-
project investments plus institutional benefits to be 18 percent. The ex-post ERR reported in the
ICR was calculated based on a random sample of 18 sub-projects in the original 30 communities
at appraisal and was estimated at 34 percent for cash and institutional benefits. Based on this
estimate, the ICR concludes that the efficiency is substantial.

36.     However, the efficiency of the project seems to have been hampered by the current
financing policy (described under Efficacy above) for RWSS systems, as it has promoted the
proliferation of smaller WBAs, resulting in higher unit costs per beneficiary. In addition, the
project took three and a half years longer to be completed as the closing date was extended three
times from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2007. The lower-than-expected functionality
rates of indigenous community systems and those under the pilot with private operators are likely
to have adversely affected the benefits accruing to beneficiaries. Taking into account these
factors, IEG assesses that efficiency is lower than what was expected at appraisal and therefore it
is rated as Modest.

Outcome
37.      Outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The project objective and design have
remained substantially relevant to the Bank and Government's priorities throughout the life of the
project, and remain relevant at the time of this evaluation. Efficiency is rated as Modest. Both the
first objective that relates to the increase of WSS coverage and the second objective which
relates to the sector reform activities were achieved substantially.

Risk to Development Outcome
38.    The risk to development outcome is Moderate. Critical risks were identified and
associated risk mitigating measures were proposed in the PAD. In this PPAR, financial,
technical, political, and social risks were identified as the main risks to development outcomes.

39.     Financial risk – There is a tendency for the WBAs to charge minimum tariffs to the
customers without meters. Accordingly, there are some concerns over the funding needs for
future repair and replacement of system parts. However, this is minimized because the project
beneficiaries are realizing the importance of metering and taking initiatives to install the meters,
and the Sanitary Services Regulation Agency (Ente Regulador de Servicios Sanitarios, Paraguay)
(ERSSAN) has been established, with the mandate to approve the water tariffs for WBAs
according to their cost recovery and consumers‟ affordability principles. Rather than
automatically charging minimum tariffs, they have a mechanism to charge according to the
estimated consumption. Therefore the financial risk is rated as moderate. ERSSAN is, however,
facing the challenge to regulate the increasing number of WBAs.

40.     Risk related to low capacity – WBAs that received financing for sewerage and
wastewater treatment plants face the challenge to learn the O&M for new technologies. This
challenge also applies to indigenous communities as they need to enhance their capacities to
operate and maintain their windmills and rain harvesting water systems. Since the capacity was
built through the project, this risk is rated moderate.

41.      Political risks – SENASA has been able to withstand political and economic shocks over
the last several decades, contributing to a low likelihood of risk events negatively impacting its
portfolio of WSS projects.

42.      Social risks related to indigenous populations – There are risks associated with
sustainability of the systems built for indigenous communities since they are in isolated location
where it is hard for SENESA to provide support. Their institutional arrangements (suitable to
their culture) are not yet proven to generate resources to operate and maintain the systems. This
risk is therefore rated substantial.

43.     Technical sustainability risk – The project proposed the formation of ten associations of
WBA to provide post construction support to their members in case of difficulties operating and
maintaining their water supply infrastructure. The RWSS IV set up only three functional
associations (and seven partially functional), but SENASA is expected to supplement activities
of the associations. Technical sustainability risk is therefore rated moderate for WBAs, but high
for indigenous communities systems where there are no such post construction support
arrangements.

Bank Performance
44.    The overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

45.    Quality at entry: Moderately Satisfactory. The project design took into account the
lessons learned from three previous Bank funded projects and the project objectives were
                                                 33


consistent with the country priorities in the water sector and with those in the 1997 CAS. The
design also took into account the potential challenges involved in recruiting private sector
operators, especially for small towns, and introduced this activity as a pilot. A pilot approach was
also proposed for introducing sewerage and waste water treatment technologies in small towns.
The project design assumed that monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes would be done
using SENASA‟s internal capabilities, but the Bank did not ensure that an appropriate M&E
system design was put in place, with indicators adequate to demonstrate achievement of the two
objectives and with baseline values for the key indicators.

46.     Supervision: Satisfactory. Supervision teams included the members with relevant skills
and missions were carried out in a timely manner. The Bank‟s task team leadership was changed
three times during the period of significant political instability but this did not adversely affect
the project‟s implementation performance. During the difficult time period with the interim
presidency in Paraguay (1999-2003), the Bank team put extra effort in scrutinizing the
procurement reviews. With the new government that took over in 2003, communications
between the Bank and SENASA improved markedly, with trust and a highly cooperative
approach to project implementation. This lasted for the remainder of the project implementation
period.

47.     Supervision of the pilot program for the private provision of water services was highly
satisfactory, as the Bank allocated substantial supervision resources to assist SENASA in the
learning process. The Bank was also highly satisfactory in supervising SENASA‟s institutional
strengthening component, which substantially achieved its objectives. The Bank recognized the
limited capacity of SENASA in promoting, contracting out, and financing sewerage systems, and
therefore helped bring in experts to help supervise the sub-projects and to provide advice to
SENASA. The Bank was exemplary at promoting knowledge management through sharing
Paraguay‟s experience and lessons with practitioners in other countries through presentations in
international conferences and learning events. However, it failed to ensure that the project was
adequately monitored and evaluated.

Borrower Performance
48.    Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Government performance
and implementation performance have been assessed below.

49.     Government performance was Moderately Satisfactory in maintaining its
commitment to implement new institutional approaches for water supply service provision in
rural areas. The Government passed the legislation needed to expedite project implementation,
and approved the budget in a timely manner to support project implementation. However, its
decision to replace SENASA's management team shortly after loan approval had a serious
negative impact on project implementation. Because of this and the significant delays in project
implementation which delayed the benefits for the rural population contributes the Government‟s
performance being rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

50.     Implementing Agency Performance was Moderately Satisfactory. Working as part of
the government structure under public service law, SENASA has faced serious challenges during
the period of political instability. It was particularly difficult during the 1998/1999 crisis and the
                                               34


subsequent years, leading up to 2003 thus compromising SENASA‟s performance. Once the
newly elected government took over in 2003, SENASA was able to make the project its top
priority again, and implemented project activities successfully during the remaining time period.
However, SENASA failed to collect adequate information to monitor the effective
implementation and the outcomes of the new investments, or to use that information to improve
performance. While SENASA data indicated that all systems were functional, IEG found
evidence in its field visits that this was not the case.

Epilogue
51.     Two years after the RWSS IV project closed, a new loan in the amount of US$64 million
was approved by the Bank on April 14, 2009 to finance the US$83.5 million Water and
Sanitation Sector Modernization Project. This project includes a component to strengthen
SENESA‟s institutional capacity and to fund water supply services in indigenous communities.
The key elements of the project objectives were thus still relevant at the time of this PPAR.

Annex C. Summary of Ecuador Rural and Small Towns
Water Supply and Sanitation Project Performance
Assessment13
1.     Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan 70350-EC) in
Ecuador (PRAGUAS) was the first phase of a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL).
PRAGUAS was approved in 2001 and closed in 2006. The total project costs of PRAGUAS
were estimated to be US$45 million and the project combined investment in water supply
and sanitation infrastructure and technical assistance to improve the performance of key
water sector institutions. At the time of project preparation, Ecuador had rural populations
with low access to WSS services. Improving rural access to WSS was identified as a
government priority for the country.

2.      Ecuador devolved the WSS service mandate for small towns and rural areas to
municipal governments in the early 1990s. Prior to PRAGUAS, the pilot project under
Second Health and Nutrition Project, supported by WSP tested the use of water beneficiary
associations (WBA) for the operation and maintenance of the water systems in rural areas,
and this model was scaled up under PRAGUAS. WBAs are non-profit organizations with a
legal charter of constitution including a governing board with democratically-elected
members. PRAGUAS supported the institutional models promoting WBAs to operate and
maintain the WSS infrastructure, and the policies of beneficiary contribution to investments
and achievement of operation and maintenance cost recovery through user charges.
Procurement of the investment contracts were managed by municipal governments.

3.       The project development objective for PRAGUAS was increased WSS service
coverage and quality for beneficiaries in small towns and rural municipalities with the focus
on the poor. In addition, PRAGUAS aimed to improve water sector performance through the
application of coherent policies and the strengthening of sector institutions at the central and
local levels. The first objective of increasing WSS service coverage and quality for
beneficiaries with focus on the poor was substantially achieved. The number of
municipalities covered under the project was 109, far exceeding the target of 40 although
only 82 percent of the target set for the number of beneficiaries was achieved. Many of the
municipalities were in poor geographical areas. The achievement on WSS service quality
was difficult to assess since there was no baseline data of service quality at startup.
PRAGUAS‟s second objective of reforming the sector through overhauling the sector
institutions achieved limited results. Though a new sector organization was put in place in
the central government to oversee the sub-projects, limited progress has been made in
defining key policy areas that affect the sustainability of the investments. By the end of the
project allocation of responsibilities to undertake sector investments at the national and sub-
national levels had not been formalized, rules for asset ownership in the sector had not been

defined, and there was no consistent financing policy. They were, and still are at the present
time, set up on an ad hoc project-by-project basis.

4.      Relevance of objectives was substantial, but the relevance of design was modest.
While a pilot project tested the demand-responsive approach, policies related to investment
responsibilities were not defined by appraisal, and the municipalities were given the mandate
to implement the investment sub-projects using an overly complex project cycle that
contributed to delays in project implementation. The project development objective related to
increasing WSS access was achieved, while the key objective relating to the sector reform
was achieved only modestly. While there were delays in project effectiveness and
implementation, the benefits in relation to cost are likely to be substantial, given the high rate
of return calculated at the end of the project. Putting together the above elements on
relevance, efficiency, and achievement of objectives, the overall outcome is rated moderately
satisfactory. Risk to development outcome is rated as significant because the risks associated
with the communities and municipalities‟ financial capacity to maintain their RWSS systems
over the longer term is not certain. In addition, the political and government ownership risk
increased significantly when the new administration cancelled a large part of the follow-on
second-phase APL. As for the Bank Performance, the overall rating is moderately
satisfactory because the project design was over-ambitious given the potentially politically
sensitive time period in which the project was being prepared, and poor quality of the M&E.
Borrower performance‟ overall rating was moderately satisfactory with shortcoming on
government side due to the delays in sector policy formalization and implementation of
sector reforms.
