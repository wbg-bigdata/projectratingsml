STRUCTURAL ADJUSTHMNT LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrowers        Republic of Honduras
Amount:          US$50.0 million equivalent
Terms:           20 years, including 5 years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Description:     The proposed loan would support the Government's
structural adjustment program. The main areas covered by
the Government's program include: public sector reform,
public investment program, balance of payment management,
credit and monetary policies and financial sector reform.
Benefits:        The adjustment program would support the country's
stabilization process while laying the basis for
addressing major macroeconomic constraints affecting long-
term recovery and growth. In addition, by supporting
productive employment it would enhance living conditions
of the majority of the population.
Risks:           The principal risk relates to the Government's ability to
achieve the political consensus necessary to carry the
adjustment process through the medium term. In the short
term, the main risks concern the consolidation of the
stabilization process to establish the basis for medium-
term adjustment: generation of the needed public savings,
achievement of the monetary targets, and mobilization of
the needed external resources to maintain capital flows at
an adequate level.
Estimated
Disbursements:   The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in two equal
tranches: US$25 million upon loan effectiveness and US$25
million after a satisfactory performance review in January
1989.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
0" THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
IN AN AMOUMIT EQUIVALENT TO US$50 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) to the Republic of Honduras for the
equivalent of US$50.0 million. The proposed loan would have a term of 20
years, including 5 years grace, with interest at the standard variable
rate.
2.       A Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 6332-HO) was circulated
to the Executive Directors in April 1987. In February 1988, the Government
requested the Bank's support to develop a plan to confront both the
financial crisis that began to emerge in 1987 and the underlying structural
problems constraining growth of the economy. On April 12, 1988, the
Executive Directors approved the modification of Loan 2703-HO, in support
of the emergency measures taken by the Government of Honduras under what is
expected to be a three-year adjustment program supported by the Bank.   The
measures focused on emergency actions required to maintain the short-term
stability of the economy (President's Yemorandum R88-76 to the Executive
Directors of March 31, 1988). Disbursement of the quick-disbursing portion
of the modified loan occurred on April 19, 1988. Besides providing the
basis for the short-term stabilization of the economy, implementation of
the emergency actions created the conditions for the medium-term adjustment
effort. The Government formally requested a SAL in March 1988. Bank
missions visited the country in May and June 1988, to prepare the program.
The Government's adjustment program was appraised in August 1988. The
conclusions of these missions are reflected in this report. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
A. Background
3.       Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western
Hemisphere. In the last two decades, it has made slow economic progress,
with per capita income reaching only US$760 in 1987 for a population of 4.3
million that is growing at 2.82 a year. Malnutrition is severe (about one
third of the population cannot afford a diet satisfying minimum caloric
requirements) and infant mortality of about 8Z of live births is very high.
About half of the population is without safe water, 252 has no access to
health services, and 752 of the households are without access to sanitary
waste disposal. Adult illiteracy is 422, and about two thirds of the
population is inadequately housed, with an accumulated deficit of about
500,000 units as of end 1986.



- 2 -
4.       Agriculture is Honduras' most important sector, employing over
half of the labor force, accounting for about one fourth of GDP, and
generating two thirds of merchandise exports. Productivity is low,
however, and there is considerable scope for increasing output by improving
yields. The industrial sector, which is still at an embryonic stage,
employs about 182 of the labor force, accounts for about 23t of GDP, and
generates about 20X of exports. The service sectors--including public
administration--employ about 28S of the labor force and account for about
48? of GDP.
5.       During 1965-75, GDP growth averaging 3.8? a year barely exceeded
population growth of 2.9? a year, and high dependence on a few export crops
hindered the modernization of the economy. In 1975-80, GDP growth
accelerated to 7.6? per annum, but the populatica also grew at a faster
pace (over 3? a year) as mortality rates declined and high fertility rates
persisted. The economic upturn during this period was aided by relatively
easy access to external borrowing, which fueled rapid growth in
expenditures. The infant manufacturing sector also began to emerge during
this period, under high protective barriers. Export performance improved
in the latter half of the 1970s, reflecting recovery of banana production
after a devastating hurricane in 1974 and expansion of coffee production in
response to high international prices. However, imports grew much faster,
averaging 9? throughout the decade. As a consequence, balance of payments
troubles began %:o emerge by the late 19708.
6.       Strong economic performance in the late 1970s was followed by
stagnation in t.'e early 1980s. The world recession, deteriorating terms of
trade, a drying up of commercial bank lending, and the adverse political
climate in Central America all contributed to the slowdown, which had a
particularly strong effect on private investment--it fell by 50X as a share
of GDP between 1980-83. A surge in public investment, linked mainly to a
large hydroelectric project, El Caj6n, cushioned the impact of the drop in
private economic activity on the economy as a whole. Nevertheless, the
recession, combined with mounting population pressure, led to a 10 drop in
per capita output during the period and a doubling of unemployment to over
20? of the libor force. Moreover, economic management deteriorated, as the
Government's effort to resume growth through expansionary policies
aggravated both fiscal and external imbalances and did not contribute to
solve the economy's long-term structural problems.
7.       In 1983, the overall deficit of the consolidated public sector
reached 12.62 of GDP (compared with 9.1? in 1980), reflecting a sharp
deterioration in Central Government savings, which dropped to -3.2S of GDP
(compared with 0.5? in 1980). Furthermore, recourse to domestic financing
more than doubled over the period to 5.4? in 1982, tapering to 5.6? in
1983. Financial management also weakened, with several public institutions
experiencing problems of insolvency and even bankruptcy.
8.       In 1984 and 1985, increasing transfers from abroad and continued
$igh expenditures for El Caj6n fueled a modest recovery. Banana production
also recovered from serious wind damage suffered in 1983, but private
investment continued to be depressed. The overall deficit of the public



- 3 -
sector dropped from 11.2Z to 6.62 of GDP from 1984 to 1986. According to
official estimates, inflation slowed down from a high of 182 in 1980 to an
average of 4Z in 1984-86. Wages behaved moderately throughout the 1980-86
period.
9.       The external sector remained weak during 1980-86.  Export
performance reflectedt, on the one hand, slack international demand and
production setbacks for some crops and, on the other, a deterioration in
export competitiveness. Imports declined in the early 1980s, but later
recovered owing to the relaxation of import restrictions and large foreign
government grants, which grew from negligible levels in the late 19708 to
US$109 million in 1986, or about 3Z of GDP. The current account deficit of
the balance of payments after grants declined from 12.5? of GDP in 1980 to
2.8? in 1986; grant receipts accounted for slightly less than half of this
improvement. In addition to significant levels of transfers, Honduras
received substantial capital inflows in 1980-85, averaging 6.1Z of GDP on a
net basis.
B. Recent Economic Performance and Prospects
10.      During 1987, a series of external shocks unmasked the long-term
structural problems affecting the Honduran economy. First, the price of
coffee, Honduras' most important export, dropped 412. Second, net
voluntary external financing to the public sector--which amounted to $227
million in 1985 and $94 million in 1986--plummeted to -$23 million. The
combined drop in foreign inflows cut the supply of foreign currency to the
economy by about 7.9? of GDP, precipitating a balance of payments crisis.
The Government was able to avert a massive financial disequilibrium in 1987
through a number of unorthodox, ad hoc measures: (a) a large increase in
arrears was allowed to accumulate; (b) the spread between the official and
free market exchange rates was permitted to expand, encouraging increased
underinvoicing of exports; and (c) a strong increase in the money supply
was used to finance the public sector deficit.
11.      The financial crisis has continued to deepen through 1988; in
fact, throughout the year, the country has been unable to fully service its
external debt obligations.   Moreover, as the excess supply of money issued
in 1987 has not yet been totally eliminated, the spread between the
official and free market exchange rates widened further, reachin6 50?
(L3.OIUS$1.0) in July. Eventually, unless corrective actions are taken, a
large nominal devaluation of the Lempira would have to occur.
12.      Honduras' medium-term prospects are bleal   Although inflation has
remained low (2.5? in 1987), if action is not taken soon the monetary
expansion of 1987 could translate into a return to the high levels of 1980.
The projected level of the current account deficit of the balance of
payments is unsustainable in the face of the reduction in voluntary capital
inflows, and unless public sector savings are increased and the relation
between prices of tradeable and non-tradeable goods is brought in line, a
path of stability with growth cannot be expected. Action is therefore
needed to improve the management of the balance of payments, public
finances, monetary program, and the financial sector, if the country is to
avoid a profound stagflation process in the years to come.



- 4 -
13.      Recognizing the serious nature of the disequilibria affecting the
economy, the Government has defined, in cooperation with the Bank, a three-
year adjustment program to address both short-term macroeconomic issues and
medium-term strucLural issues. The objectives of the three-year program
are to achieve: (a) growth of exports and efficient import substitution
through: (i) a more competitive real exchange rate and (ii) trade policy
reform aimed at reducing the anti-export bias of the trade regime;
(b) increases in public savings to levels consistent with a sound public
expenditure program and available external financing; and (c) increases in
private savings and greater efficiency of financial intermediation through
liberalization of interest rate policies and institutional measures. The
proposed loan would support actions to be taken during 1988 and early 1989.
It is expected that follow-up operations would support the Government's
three-year economic program (paras. 79-83).
Rationale for Bank Support
14.      Although short-term macroeconomic adjustment would ordinarily be
supported by the IMF, the slow progress in the fiscal and exchange rate
actions together with the existence of arrears to the IMF impeded an
agreement on the use of IMF resources. However, negotiations continued and
an IMF mission will visit Honduras in early September 1988. Provided the
Government is able to clear its arrears with the IMF, a Stand-By
Arrangement is possible for 1989.
15.      The leading role adopted by the Bank in the face of the ongoing
financial crisis has permitted progress to be made in several important
areas. First, it has allowed the Bank to work with the Government on a
multi-year adjustment program, in spite of the fact that the current
administration's term of office is nearing its final year. The Government
has encouraged discussions with opposition leaders and leading presidential
candidates, smoothing the way for continuation of the process through the
transfer of dower to a new administration ain 1990. Similarly, it permits
the Bank to help assure coordination of short- and medium-term adjustment
objectives.
16.      Second, the adjustment program supported by the Bank has become
the focal point for other lenders and donors. The Bank has been able to
coordinate closely with other international and bilateral agencies, which
will permit a more rational planning of the timing and level of financial
flows to Honduras in the next couple of years. In the short term, this
coordination will be important in timing the release of balance of payments
support, to assure the viability of the external financing plan while
avoiding over-financing. In the medium-term, the request of the Government
for Bank support in carrying out a review of public expenditures and
investment programming, which has arisen from close collaboration in the
course of developing the adjustmen' program, will provide the Bank the
opportunity to help mobilize the needed external financing for the
investment program and to assure the economic viability of the program
itself. To this end, the Bank is organizing a consultative group of donors
which is expected to hold an initial formal meeting to discuss Honduras'
financing needs in October 1988.

PART II - THE GOVFRNMENTS ADJUSTMENT PROG&AH
17.      The first phase of the three-year program consists of an action
plan for 1988 and early 1989 aimed at stabilizing the economy. The action
plan provides for carry-over into 1989; a full action plan for 1989 would
be defined in early 1989. The main goals of the 1988-89 action plan as
agreed with the Bank, are to: (a) increase publtc sector savings to 1.1?
of GDP (vs. 0.6X in 1987); (b) reduce the overal... fiscal deficit by 0.7
percentage poir.ts of GDP on a cash basis, compared with 1987 performance;
(c) promote external balance and increase transparency in the foreign
exch3nge market by permitting a greater proportion of transactions to take
place at market-determined rates; (d) sterilize the excess money supply and
avoid its inflationary impact; and (e) begin the process of liberalization
of interest rate policies by elimination of distortions among rediscounted
credit lines.
18.      The second phase of the program, which will begin in 1989, will
follow up the stabilization measures and deepen the process of structura'l
adjustment. The main goals of this phase of the program would be to:
(a) increase public sector savings to 2.5? of GDP; (b) reduce the overall
fiscal deficit by 1.8 percentage points of GDP on a cash basis, compared
with 1988; (cj continue movement of external transactions toward market-
determined rates; (d) continue the program of monetary restraint begun in
1988; (e) continue the process of liberalization of interest rate policies;
(f) carry out a program of reform for decentralized institutions; (g) carry
out an action plan for divestiture of publicly held firms; 'h) design and
begin implementation of an action plan to reduce effective protection
through tariff reduction and elimination of quantitative restrictions;
ii) carry out an action plan to reform the regulations with a view to
strengtheax capital requirements for finaucial institutions, ceilings on
credit granted to related parties, requirements for publication of
information, and definition of the Superintendency of Banks' role and
authority to monitor and regulate financial institutions.
19.      The third phase of the program, beginning in 1990, sould intensify
structural adjustment efforts in the public sector and key sectors.
Adjustment programs for the financial and agriculture sectors, to be
prepared during 1989, would be carried out.
20.      The first phase of the program was initiated with an emergency
action plan carried out in February/March 1988 in accordance with
conditions established for consideration of the modification of the Third
Industrial Credit Project (para. 2). Under this emergency plan, the
Government took the following actionst (a) a freeze on all public sector
salaries and the number of public sector jobs at the levels established as
of February 15, 1988; (b) a freeze ox. all current expenditures for goods
and services at their 1987 level; (c) reduction of Central Government
transfers to autonomous institutions and proposal to Congress of
legislation to reduce city governments' share of port revenues;
(d) extension of eligibility to receive CETRA benefits (a mechanism to
permit trading of foreign exchange at market prices)(see para. 35 below),



- 6 -
from 11 to 28 non-traditional export products; (e' r-u;.. tion of excess
liquidity in the system through reestablishment of a 1UO2 reserve
requirement on deposits held in commercial banks pending availability of
foreign exchange; and (f) elimination of payment in cash by the Central
Bank for all converted external debt for which purchase is approved by the
Government after February 15, 1988.
21.      The above actions achieved important gains toward fiscal and
monetary restraint and improving flexibility of the exchange rate regime.
More action was needed, however, to achieve the targets for 1988 in public
finance, balance of payments, and monetary policy. A complete program of
actions for the remainder of 1988 was defined during May/June, with a
timetable for implementation through the end of the year. The proposed
loan is intended to support this program. The following paragraphs discuss
the issues to be addressed under the program, progress achieved to date,
and actions planned for future phases of the three-year adjustment program.
The policy matrix in Annex IV provides a summary of the issues and actions
to be taken under the program in 1988-89 (SAL I).
A. Public Sector Finances
22.      Public savings (excluding transfers), which were more than 52 of
GDP in the late 19709, dropped to less than 12 in 1987 (Table 1). Fixed
public investment, which represented close to 102 of GDP in 1978, and 11.6?
at the peak of the construction of the El Caj6n dam, accounted for only 52
of GDP in 1987. In contrast, current expenditures grew faster than current
revenues from 1980-81. Thus, the recent reductions in the public sector
drficit from a peak of over 12Z of GDP in 1983 to slightly more than 62 in
1987, have taken place at the expense of public investment.

23.      Increases in public revenues require improvements in tax
collection and reform of the country's tax structure. Although Honduras'
tax ratio is high, (close to 182 of GDP if the oil price differential and
local taxes are considered) the structure of tax revenues is inadequate and
heavily dependent on external trade taxes. Revenues from income, property,
and value-added taxes represent only about 37X of total non-export tax
revenues; these taxes should account for at least half of non-export tax
revenues.
24.      Alteration of the tax structure will require improvements in tax
administration as well as possible modification of tax rates. The Ministry
of Finance estimates that actual tax revenues from income and sales taxes
are only 30X of potential revenues.   Although the maximum marginal income
tax rate is 402, income-tax revenues account for less than 4? of GDP.
Despite a value-added tax rate of 5?, revenues from its collection are
less than 2? of GDP.   An administrative reform to reduce evasion and allow
cross reference of information between the sales and income taxes would
likely produce strong increases in revenues without resorting to drastic
increases in tax rates.
25.      The Government has taken initial action in this regard.   Tax
revenues relative to GDP rose in 1987 following measures to improve
il1ection of valued-added, excise and import taxes.  Strong increases in
ncr.-tax revenues were obtained in 1U7, mainly the result of improvements
in oil-related revenues stemming from the differential between domestic and
international prices of oil.   This differential, which was insignificant
before 1985, rose to more than one percent of GDP in 1986 and 1987.
Although the drop in international oil prices helped, the increase in
public revenues came primarily from improvements in the administration of
revenue collection. As a combined consequence of these measures, the tax
system hp- become less dependent on export taxes; export tax revenue, which
represented close to three percentage points of GDP in the late 1970s, has
fallen to about one percentage point since 1983. The Government's program
includes measures for further improvement of tax administration and it has
begun a study, with assistance from consultants, to identify specific
measures needed. Agreement with the Bank on an action plan for improving
tax administration during 1989 is a condition for release of the second
tranche of the proposed loan (see para. 51, below).
26.      Led by higher interest payments, current expenditures have
increased faster than GDP since the late 1970s. Current expenditures
represented 17X of GDP in the late 1970's and 272 in 1987. The rapid rise
in current outlays was mainly the result of a massive rise in the public
sector's wage bill (explaining almost half of the increase in the ratio)
and the increasing interest payments (explaining 20? of the rise). The
large increase in the wage bill is more a consequence of expanding public
employment than of higher public wages as the latter deteriorated in real
terms during the period, except those of special sectors (teachers and
health related personnel). The wage bill alone increased 15? during 1987,
reflecting increases in both public employment and wage adjustments
benefiting mainly teachers and health sector workers. However, the



- 8 -
Government is committed to reducing public expenditures, especially in the
current account. It has defined spending cuts for the last half of 1988
equivalent to at least L40 million (about 0.5Z of GDP) and would continue
the program of spending restraint through 1989.
27.      At a time tihen critical foreign exchange shortages and
debilitating debt service obligations exist, the role of the public
enterprises in Honduras needs to be carefully examined to obtain greater
fiscal discipline and efficiency of resource use. The public enterprise
sector grew at an extraordinary rate in the 1960s and 1970s in an attempt
to spearhead economic development, create employment, and promote the
growth of underdeveloped areas. However, the sector has performed
erratically and has not contributed to the national economy proportionately
to the resources it has absorbed. Some public enterprises have developed
an excessive and unsustainable dependence on public financing.   At the
same time, a rapid build-up of Government arrears to some public utilities
threatens their financial stability.
28.      The Government's adjustment program includes actions to address
these problems. Under SAL I, provision has been made to assure the
consistency of the 1989 budgets of the autonomous public sector
institutions with the targets for reduction of the overall non-financial
public sector deficit. A public expenditure review to be carried out
before the end of 1988 will include a careful examination of the entire
public sector investment program, and agreement on the investment program
for 1989 is a condition of second tranche release (see para. 51, below).
Action plans for improvement of the management and efficiency of each
public enterprise will be prepared prior to second tranche release (see
para. 52, below). The action plans will provide the basis for a program of
public enterprise adjustment to be prepared for Bank financing (see para.
79, below). Finally, a few public enterprises (notably the National
Investment Corporation (CONADI) and the National Forestry Development
Corporation (COHDEFOR) have assumed ownership of a number of (originally
private sector) firms. The Government approved legislation in 1985 to
permit resale of these firms to the private sector and is committed to
carrying out this process, though progress has been slow. Preparation of
action plans with monthly targets for execution of the privatization
programs for COHDEFOR and CONADI would be completed prior to release of the
second tranche (see para. 52, below).
29.      A case of special concern is that of the power company, ENEE.
With the commissioning of El Caj6n Hydroelectric Project (partially
financed under Loan 1805-HO and Credit 989-HO) in 1985, Honduras entered
into a period of excess generation capacity, which is expected to continue
at least until 1993. The expected benefits from the construction of El
Caj6n have not yet been realized.   With low revenues, ENEE's cash flow has
been insufficient to meet its financial obligations. In particular, the
financial requirements derived from the construction of El Caj6n and from
the recent weakening of the US dollar (69? of ENEE's external debt is
denominated in currencies other than the US dollar) have forced the company
to incur arrears with some of its lenders. (They may reach $100 million by
the end of 1988).

30.      The Government has requested the Bank's assistance to define a
program of reform and financial restructuring for ENEE to restore the
enterprise's solvency and eliminate the burden it has imposed on public
finances. The program is currently under preparation and is expected to be
initiated during 1989. The Bank plans to support implementation of the
program through an adjustment operation for ENEE (see para. 79, below).
B. Balance of Payments
31.      As a result of huge eurrent account deficits incurred, Honduras'
external debt increased from $200 million in 1973 (212 of GDP), to $2.4
billion in 1987 (60? of GDP).  Service payments in the last few years
absorbed more than 902 of national savings, 40? for interest payments
alone. Savings must increase to sustain GDP growth. In view of the fact
that massive foreign savings are unlikely to materialize, domestic savings
will have to rise substantially.

32.      Exports of coffee and bananas represented 50? of the total foreign
exchange earnings of the country in the early 1980s, and more than 60S in
the last couple of years (Table 3).  The concentration of foreign exchange
earnings in two products with unstable international prices has generated
wide swings in Honduras' export earnings. The country's capacity to
diversify and expand its exports is critical to the reduction in the
current account deficit of the balance of payments. This capacity has
recently been demonstrated by the increase of shrimp, vegetables and
cardamon exports reflecting Honduras potential to diversify its export
base. This can only be achieved however, by adoptitg a more flexible
exchange rate regime and by reducing the anti-export bias of the trade
regime.

33.      Exchange Rate Manatement.  Honduras' official exchange rate has
remained unchanged at L2/US$1 since 1920.   A flexible exchange rate
policy, however, has been implemented since 1985 to partially correct price
distortions between tradeable and non-tradeable goods in the economy.
.4.      Initial steps to adapt the exchange rate system were taken in
1985. The Central Bank authorized specific exporters to sell or use a
portion of their foreign exchange proceeds in a quasi-free market
arrangement by permitting them to select the purchaser of their foreign
exchange. In this way, the actual receipts from sales of foreign exchange
exceeded its value at the official rate.
35.      In early 1988, increased flexibility in the exchange rate regime
was introduced with the creation of tradeable documents (CETRAs) issued by
commercial banks to exporters, which enable their holders to buy their face
value in foreign exchange at the official rate. Exporters of eligible
products (initially specified in a positive list of 11 products) receive a
CETRA for the equivalent of a proportion (in;itially 302) of the value of
their exports and may then freely sell the document during the first 30
days after its issuance. The CETRA is sold to importers at a premium over
its face value, reflecting the free market foreign exchange rate. The
document can be traded only once and has to be used within seven months to
purchase foreign exchange. The importer who presents CETRAs with his
application for his import license has his request approved immediately
after verification of the legality of the imports. Because the price of
the CETRA is freely determined, the transactions involving CETRAs are
equivalent to trading the corresponding foreign exchange in a free market.
Therefore, an expansion in the coverage of the CETRA would increase
transparency in the foreign exchange market and provide added incentives to
export expansion.



- 11 -
36.      To accomplish this, the Government has approved under the proposed
SAL I extension of CETRA coverage to all products (except bananas and
minerals, which are subject to separate regimes permitting exporters to
retain some of their earnings in foreign exchange) and an increase in the
proportion of export earnings covered by CETRAs (see para. 54, below).
These measures provide the added flexibility needed in the system at this
stage.
37.      Trade Regime.  On December 27, 1987, Honduras enac  I new tariff
legislation adopting the modified Brussels nomenclature and replacing
specific duties with ad valorem rates.   The new tariff structure and
nomenclature are similar to those recently idopted by the Central American
Common Market (CACM) countries; while Honduras is not a member of the CACM,
it has maintained close ties with it under bilateral agreements. Although
the new tariff system, together with the new import valuation and customs
laws that accompanied it, represents an improvement over the previous
system, the existence of numerous exemptions and import surcharges affect
the transparency and dispersion of the trade regime. The Ministry of
Finance estimates that of the total value of merchandise imports, close to
50? enter under some form of tariff exemption. By 1985, the basic tariff
only accounted for 26.5Z of all import duty revenues collected, with the
other 73.5X accruing from tariff surcharges. Correction of the distortions
caused by the exemptions and import surcharges is essential. Accordingly,
the Government has presented to Congress legislation which would eliminate
exemptions and surcharges. Approval of this legislation by Congress is a
condition of second tranche release of the proposed SAL (see para. 55,
below).
38.      Quantitative import restrictions were introduced in mid-1982.
All imports required a foreign exchange license, issued by the External
Finance Regulatory Department (DERFE) of the Central Bank. Imports were
classified into five categories of descending essentiality:
(1) essential consumer goods (e.g. foods, medicines); (2) fuels and
lubricants; (3) inputs for agriculture and industry; (4) capital goods; and
(5) all other goods. If no foreign exchange at the official rate was
requested by the importer, the license was issued immediately (para. 35).
Otherwise, the importer waited until foreign exchange became available, the
waiting period depending on the category in which the goods to be imported
were classified. Importers requesting foreign exchange at the official
rate were required to deposit an equivalent amount in Lempiras. The size
of the deposits made by importers as advance payments for foreign exchange
was an index of the availability of foreign exchange at the official rate,
and therefore of the importance of import restrictions; such deposits were
high in 1984 and 1985, dropped in 1986, but grew again in 1987-88.
39.      Under the proposed operation, the Government has agreed to reduce
the above classifications to twos those products for which importers are
entitled to foreign exchange at the official rate and those excluded from
access (see para. 54, below). This change effectively eliminates
quantitative restrictions for products in the second category.



- 12 -
40.      The Government's medium-term adjustment program includes a full
reform of the trade regime. Preparation of the reform measures would begin
in 1989.
C. Savings and Investment
41.      Savings and investment declined substantially since 1978
(Table 4). Public investment fell by about three percentage points of GDP
in 1978-87. Discouraged by poor macroeconomic policies, private investment
also declined. In a misguided effort to promote investment, the Government
resorted to special tax and credit incentives, which have not only failed
to reverse the downward trend, but have now further complicated the
implementation of sound policies to improve the country's incentive system
for export-oriented investments, and have cut public savings further.
Credit allocation has become increasingly arbitrary, as similar kinds of
loans carry differing interest rates and other charges, depending on the
special privileges granted by the financing source.

42.      The low level of savings and investment has been the consequence
of: (a) an extraordinary inflow of foreign resources (from both lending and
grants), which stimulated expenditures; (b) distortions in the system of
incentives, which encouraged investors to seek privileges rather than
economically profitable investment opportunities; (c) high levels and wide
dispersion in nominal import tariffs, which discouraged exports, the most
promising source of growth; (d) inadequate interest rate policies and
(a) lack of confidence, stemming from the political conflict in Central
America. As the availability of foreign resources drops, the country will
need to provide appropriate incentives to increase private savings, in
order to maintain a level of investment to assure future economic growth.



- 13 -
43.      The proposed SAL will support the Government's program to reduce
distortions in the system of investment and savings incentives. Actions to
carry out measures under the program has already begun. Legislation
eliminating import duty exemptions and surcharges was presented to Congress
in June 1988. The process of unification of the Central Bank's rediscount
rates for its lines of credit was begun with the increase of the minimum
rate to 9? in June 1988 (see para. 57, below). A further increase of the
minimum rate to 10? is a condition of second tranche release of the
proposed loan (see para. 57, below). Finally, several laws providing tax
exemptions and credits have been repealed.
D. Monetary Policy
44.      During 1987, the money supply rose almost 20? in one year, against
an average annual rate of 5? during 1985-1986. This increase was due in
part to the need to finance domestically the public sector deficit.
Despite the accumulation of arrears to reduce the cash deficit, domestic
credit to the public sector increased a full percentage point of GDP in
1987. Second, the conversion of external public debt also added to growth
of the money supply in 1987. The Government bought the converted external
debt with bonds, which were fully cashed by the Central Bank through
monetary expansion. If not corrected, this monetary expansion will result
in an acceleration of inflation, leading to a destabilization process of
the Honduran economy, which would make the adoption of adjustment measures
a more difficult task in the future. A monetary program that limits both
sources of money expansion is therefore required.
45.      The proposed SAL includes a monetary program (with monthly
targets) consistent with the other macroeconomic objectives of the
adjustment program (see para. 56, below). Achievement of the targets for
September-December 1988 will be a condition for release of the second
tranche.
E.  Financial Sector Issues
46.      The allocation of credit is far from satisfactory from an economic
point of view. Credit is too dependent on rediscount lines from the
Central Bank (funded mainly with foreign resources) often lent at interest
rates well below the market. Moreover, the diversity of rediscount rates
on different Central Bank lines of credit leads to distortion in market
signals. Although the ceiling on interest rates (now at 17Z) is high in
real terms, it still introduces serious distortions in the determination of
free market interest rates. Moreover, based on special mechanisms and
privileges (bonds with a guarantee of redemption, bonds that can be used as
reserve requirements, tax-exempt bonds, etc), the public sector squeezes
out the private sector, absorbing an increasing share of the available
credit. The proposed loan will support the start of a program to eliminate
interest rate subsidies (see para. 57, below).
47.      Finally, it is important to strengthen monitoring capacity and
authority of the Superintendency of Banks to supervise the financial system
in order to make it more efficient in mobilizing and channeling private



- 14 -
savings. In this connection, and as part of the adjustment program
supported by the proposed loan, the Government vill undertake immediately
the technical assistance to the Superintendency of Banks financed under
Loan 2704-HO. Consultants have been selected and agreement on an action
program based on the recommendations of the study is a condition for the
release of the second tranche of the proposed loan (see para. 58, below).
PART III - THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. General
48.      The proposed Structural Adjustment Loan would support the
Government's 1988-89 program of economic adjustment. The loan was prepared
with the Government between May and July 1988. Negotiations took place in
Washington, D.C. on August 23, 1988. The Honduran delegation was led by Ms.
Marta Julia Cox, representing the Minister of Finance and Public Credit.
The components of the SAL program are summarized below; further details are
provided in Annexes III and IV.
49.      The program backed by the proposed operation is expected to be
supported also by international institutions, USAID, and may be supported
by cofinancing from other bilaterals. A full financing package for 1988
has been defined. Further debt relief may be required in the form of debt
rescheduling by the Paris Club.
B. The Adiustment Program
50.      The Bank has agreed with the Authorities on the policy elements of
the first stage of a three-year adjustment program (a summary is presented
in Annex IV in matrix form), consisting of an action plan for 1988-89 aimed
at stabilizing the economy. The main goals of the action plan are to:
(a) increase public sector savings to 2.52 of GDP in 1989, vs. 0.62 in 1987
(the target for 1988 is 1.1? of GDP); (b) reduce the overall fiscal deficit
in 1989 by 2.5 percentage points of GDP on a cash basis, compared with 1987
performance (the target for 1988 is a reduction of 0.7 percentage points of
GDP); (c) promote external balance and increase transparency in the foreign
exchange market by permitting a greater proportion of transactions to take
place at market-determined rates; (d) sterilize the excess money supply and
avoid its inflationary impact; and (e) begin the process of liberalization
of interest rate policies by elimination of distortions among rediscounted
credit lines.
Management of the Public Sector
51.      As noted in the preceding paragraph, a goal of the SAL program is
to reduce the overall public sector deficit by at least 2.5 percentage
points of GDP on a cash basis and raise public savings by a corresponding
amount in 1988-89. The public investment program will be reviewed in late
1988 to verify that its size and composition are consistent with the
adjustment program's goals and constraints. This work will be carried out



- 15 -
in the context of a comprehensive review of public expenditure. Agreement
on a 1989 public expenditure program will be a condition of the release of
the SAL's second tranche. Following submission to the Honduran Congress of
a tax bill that should increase revenues by about L20 million, the
Government has extended the freeze on new hirings, and instructed the
public sector to reduce current expenditures by limiting salary increases
and expenses on non-essential expenditures such as travel, acquisition of
new equipment, etc. The measures contemplated for 1988189 are expected to
increase annual revenues by L125 million and reduce annual current
expenditures by L75 million on a sustainable basis. The Government has
agreed with these targets. It has presented an action plan for the
remainder of 1988 that will: (a) reduce consolidated public sector
expenditures by at least L40 million (about 0.5S of GDP); (b) reduce the
consolidated public sector deficit by at least L65 million (0.72 of GDP) on
a cash basis; (c) reduce Central Government current expenditures, excluding
increases in interest payments, to no more than 17.62 of GDP in 1989; and
(d) limit investment expenditures in 1988 and 1989 to no more than 5? of
GDP. Achievement of these targets, approval by Congress of a budget for
1989 consistent with the goal of reducing the public sector deficit by 1.8
percentage points of GDP with respect to 1987, and agreement with the Bank
on an action plan for improvement of tax administration (para. 25) would be
conditions for release of the second tranche.
52.      The program also aims to strengthen public sector management
through laying the basis for structural adjustment of public enterprises
and institutions in the medium term. To this end, action plans will be
prepared under the proposed SAL that will provide the basis for adjustment
programs to be carried out during the next several years. Conditions of
second tranche release are preparation of: (a) an action plan with monthly
targets for the implementation of the divestiture programs for CONADI and
CORDEFOR; (b) an action plan for institutional adjustment and streamlining
of major public enterprises; and (c) an action plan for the
institutionallfinancial restructuring of ENEE (paras. 29-30).
Balance of Payments
53.      The three-year adjustment program will be oriented tot  (a) reduce
the dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of coffee and
bananas; (b) reduce the current account deficit to levels that can be
financed with net voluntary inflows from bilateral and multilateral
sources; and (c) increase the transparency of the foreign exchange market.
Under SAL I, the Government will adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime
and start reducing the anti-export bias of the trade regime.
54.      Exchange Rate Management.  The objective of the program is to
gradually move to a free exchange rate market. On June 30, 1988, the
Government announced that all exporters will have access to the CETRA
system, but limited the foreign exchange earnings that exporters can change
through the CETRA system to 30? and 152 for non-traditional and traditional
exports, respectively. Further actions were needed to increase the
transparency of the foreign exchange market. During appraisal, the
Government agreed to increase the coverage of CETRA benefits to 40? of



- 16 -
export earnings for all eligible products except coffee and timber.
Exporters of coffee and timber receive CETRAs equal to 1S? of their
earnings. Excluded from the CETRA system are exporters of bananas and
minerals, which are already covered by special arrangements permitting
exporters to retain 50-55Z of their earnings in foreign exchange.
Complementing the above measures, the Government has agreed to exclude
imports equivalent in value to at least 402 of total imports from access to
foreign exchange at the official rate. Verification that these agreements
have been implemented will be a condition of second tranche release.
Further actions toward the complete liberalization of the foreign exchange
market will be pursued through a second SAL operation currently planned for
late 1989.
55.      Trade Reform.  Reductions in the maximum tariff rates to levels
comparable to those being considered by Central American countries will be
the goal of the three-year adjustment program. The elimination of the
present system of import duty exemptions and surcharges will be carried out
under SAL I. On June 30, 1988, the Government initiated the process by
sending to Congress a package of measures that would eliminate the
exemptions and surcharges, thus reducing the average level of effective
protection in the trade regime. Congressional approval of the legislation
will be a condition of second tranche release.
Monetary and Financial Sector Measures
56.      The goals of the agreed 1988 monetary program are to reduce the
excess supply of money that developed in 1987 and to allow interest rates
to reach levels consistent with the credit expansion and fiscal targets.
Ceilings have been set for total credit at end-1988 as follows: (a) total
domestic credit, L2,292 million; (b) total credit to the public sector,
L1,278 million; and (c) total Central Bank credit to the Central
Government, L739 million.  In addition, net international reserves would
increase by US$17 million. Meeting these targets would be condition for
release of the second tranche.
57.      As the short-term emergency is resolved and long-term investment
needs become urgent, larger proportions of GDP will have to be generated as
savings to finance such investment. Thus, measures to increase domestic
savings and to improve their allocation in the economy will become crucial
to the long-term success of the adjustment program. To this end, the
Government and Central Bank have agreed to undertake gradual unification of
rediscount rates charged to financial intermediaries under its lines of
credit. The first step, raising the minimum rediscount rate to 9?, was
agreed during appraisal. Raising all rediscount rates to at least 101
would be a condition for release of the second tranche.
58.      As a first step toward a long-term solution to these problems, the
Government agreed during appraisal to carry out a study under the ongoing
Third Industrial Credit Project which would focus on (a) measures to
improve banking supervision and control procedures; (b) improve information
systems; and (c) needed changes in the Banking Law regarding regulations on



- 17 -
capital requirements, ceilings on credit granted to related parties,
information that must be published, and strengthening and better defining
the role and authority of the Superintendency of Banks and its interaction
with the country's financial institutions. Consultants have been selected
to carry out the study and agreement on an action plan based on the
recommendations of the study would be a condition for second tranche
release. Implementation of the action plan would be a condition of a
future financial sector adjustment loan (see para. 82, below).
C. Imnact of the Adiustment Program and Financial Reauirements
59.      The projections presented in Annex I show the magnitude of the
adjustment effort required. The main assumptions ares (a) an increasing
share of external transactions to the CETRA market gradually occurs during
1988/1989 and the real effective exchange rate increases by more than 20?
between 1987 and 1990; (b) imports will be progressively traded in the
CETRA market, and tariff rates will be brought down along with the increase
in the real exchange rate; (c) foreign transfers decline 10? per year
starting in 1989, thus making the country increasingly independent of
foreign grants; (d) tax revenuea increase about 0.5Z of GDP in 1989;
(e) current expenditures share in GDP declines 2.6 percentage points
between 1987 and 4990 as a result of a rationalization of operations in the
main public enterprises; (f) the money supply (M1) will be reduced to 12?
of GDP in 1989, thus the excess supply that developed in 1987 is eliminated
in 1988/89; and (g) domestic interest rates are liberalized allowing an
increase in the GDP share of quasi-money savings.
60.      After a temporary setback in 1988, GDP growth averages 3.3? per
year between 1989 and 1992 (Table 5). The accelerated growth would come
from new investments in export-oriented activities, higher investment
productivity resulting from related actions contemplated in the program,
and the expansion of non-traditional exports. Domestic inflation would
remain close to international inflation, and the public sector deficit
(including foreign transfers as revenues) would decline on a cash basis
from 4.8? of GDP in 1987 to 2? in 1990. The current account deficit
(including foreign transfers as revenue) is reduced to 2? of GDP in the
outer years of the projection.

61.      However. gross requirements of foreign funds remain high for 1988.
They are estimated at about $500 million (Table 6). USAID ESF funds, and
the refinancing of bilateral and commercial arrears should satisfy the bulk
of these gross requirements. The World Bank would contribute with $65
million, including the first tranche of this operation. Despite the
ambitious program proposed, World Bank net disbursements would become only
moderately positive after 1988. Cofinancing from bilateral sources for
Bank-assisted projects should provide the res: of the foreign flows
required.

62.      If the actions of the program are carried out in the three year
period as assumed, non-traditional exports would increase at a rate faster
than traditional ones reducing, albeit slowly, Honduras' dependence on
traditional exports from 642 in 1987 to 602 by 1990. The resource balance
would be in equilibrium by 1990 and would show surpluses from 1990 onwards.
The current account deficit (excluding transfers as revenues) would drop
from 8.2? of GDP in 1987 to 42 in the 90s and the country's dependency on
foreign transfers would be steadily reduced from 3.6Z of GDP in 1987 to
less than 22 in 1993.
63.      Domestic resource mobilization also needs to improve.  National
savings (including foreign transfers) would increase from 10.7Z of GDP in
1987 to 17.1? in 1992 (Table 7). Both public savings and private sector
savings would increase. That is the reason why actions to improve
incentives for new investmenta and a more efficient and stronger financial
sector are an essential fea-ure of the program.

64.      iublic finances is another critical element for the success of the
program.  The public sector deficit (including foreign transfers as
revenue) needs to drop on a cash basis from 4.8? of GDP in 1987 to 2.3S in
1989 and afterwards.  External financing would provide about half of the
financial requirements; the other half would have to come from non-
inflationary domestic sources. If these actions materialize, public
savings, which were 22 of GDP in 1987, would increase to more than 4?
after 1990.
D. Loan Amount and Tranchina
65.      The proposed loan of US$50 million would meet about 10? of
Honduras' annual gross financing capital requirements for 1988-89. It is
equivalent to about 5? of merchandise imports during the period. The loan
would be disbursed in two equal tranches. The first would be released for
disbursement upon loan effectiveness. The second would be made available
in early 1989, after compliance with the second tranche conditions. The
proposed tranching would allow the Bank to ensure that the entire
adjustment program for 1988 is carried out and that the necessary pre-
conditions for continuation and extension of the program in 1989 are
established.
66.      Release of the second tranche (expected to take place early in
1989) would be conditional on satisfactory progress toward setting the
basis for an improvement, beyond the program, of the macroeconomic policy
framework and a satisfactory plan showing how the estimated foreign
exchange requirements during 1989 would be met and on:
(a)  Achievement of target for reduction of the consolidated
public sector deficit by at least L65 million on a cash basis
during July-December 1988.
(b)  Approval by Congress of the 1989 Central Government budget.
Approval by Executive Branch of 1989 budget for autonomous
institutions. Verification that both budgets together would
achieve reduction of consolidated public sector deficit by at
least 1.8? of GDP on a cash basis in 1989, compared with 1988
level, and that the Central Government budget would reduce
Central Government current expenditures (excluding increase
in interest payments) to 17.6? in 1989, compared with 18.3?
in 1987.



- 20 -
(c) Agreement on a public investment program for 1989 that would
limit public investment expenditures to no more than 52 of
GDP.
(d) Agreement on an administrative reform program to improve tax
collections in 1989.
(e) Agreement on an action plan with monthly targets for 1989 for
esecuting CONADI's program for enterprise divestiture, as
defined in Decretos Nos. 161/85 and 197/85.
(f) Preparation of a program of reforms for autonomous
institutions to be initiated in 1989. Preparation of a plan
of action to rationalize expenditures, investment, and
management of ENEE and to restructure its financial debt
during 1989.
(g) Verification that the import list defined for purchase
exclusively with foreign exchange procured at free market
rate (i.e. to be excluded from access to foreign exchange at
the official rate) and the system for control and
registration of CETRAs are in effect.
(h) Approval by Congress of legislation eliminating tariff
exemptions and surcharges.
(i) Verification of compliance with monetary targets for December
1988, as follows:
(') Total domestic credit, L2,292 million;
(2) Total credit to the public sector, L1,278 million;
(3) Total Central Bank credit to the Central Government, L739
million.
(j) Increase of the rediscount rate on Central Bank lines of
credit to 102 on January 1, 1989, except for basic grains.
(k) Presentation to Bank of an action plan to be based on the
conclusions and recommendations of consultants selected to
carry out a study to identify measures for strengthening the
Superintendency of Banks.
B. Creditworthiness
67.      If the proposed adjustment program is implemented, Honduras' long-
term creditworthiness would be strengthened. Three major factors
contribute to this result. First, Honduras' external debt would remain
manageable, growing slowly through 1992, and declining as a proportion of
GDP from about 632 in 1987 to about 512 in 1992. Second, a significant



- 21 -
fraction of the debt would remain on concessional terms. Third, non-
traditional exports would grow at an accelerated rate, leading a stronger
growth of exports in general. As a result, all debt indicators would
improve. The debt-service would decline from 39Z in 1987 to less than 251
in the same period. IBRD debt-service ratios would increase from 19.4 in
1987 to 21 in 1990 as the result of the Bank's support to the Government's
three-year economic program. The ratio of debt to exports would drop from
2.5 in 1987 to 1.9 in 1990. The ratio of interest payments to exports
would drop from 17Z to 122.
F. Poverty Impact
68.      About half of Honduras' population of 4.3 million lives in
poverty. About 82? of the rural population and 44? of the urban population
earn less than L1500/year (US$750/year). Unemployment levels exacerbate
the poverty condition. Though reliable statistics scarce are they indicate
that over half of the labor force (over 12 years of age) is unemployed or
underemployed. Moreover, the demand for employment will increase as a
result of the rapid rate of population growth experienced in the last two
decades. It is estiiated that the combined effect of population growth and
migration will lead to a doubling of the labor force in urban areas by
1995, and that the rural labor force will increase by 39?. Thus, unless
productive jobs are created, unemployment in Honduras will increase, adding
large numbers of persons to the population currently living in poverty.
69.      The condition of the poor is not alleviated significantly by
health and nutrition programs, owing to inadequate access of the poor to
such programs. Indeed, most of the beneficiaries of public sector services
are civil servants, professionals (teachers, banking personnel), and middle
class urban workers, the great majority of them living in Tegucigalpa and
San Pedro Sula, Honduras' two largest cities. The total number of
beneficiaries receiving nutrition or health services from the public sector
in 1987 was about 206,000, compared with about 2.1 million people living in
poverty.
70.      The challenge, then, lies in defining an economic program which
would provide for the creation of productive employment and better delivery
of social services to the poor in Honduras. The initial stages of the
Government's adjustment program may temporarily deepen poverty in Honduras;
expenditures will have to be cut, increasing unemployment in the short
term. However, poverty would increase more without the proposed program:
under recent policies, an inflation-cum-devaluation cycle would develop
that would deepen poverty. The Government's adjustment program will
incorporate measures to ameliorate the adverse impact on the poor: cuts to
public services directed to the poor would be minimized, and the Bank's
review of the 1989 public expenditures program will facilitate minimization
of the negative consequences of cuts in expenditures. Under the second
phase of the program, which the Bank proposes to support with a second SAL,
measures will be defined to better target public social expenditures to the
truly needy. Finally, the opening of the economy should help improve
productivity and therefore increase real wages and employment.



- 22 -
G. Risks
71.      The difficult political situation in Honduras highlights the
substantial risk associated with the proposed adjustment and lending
strategy. The likely initial increase in unemployment could disturb the
relatively peaceful equilibrium that Honduras has enjoyed, adding to the
Government's own perception of the political risk of adjustment. Further,
the Government is nearing its last year in office, and the political
campaign to replace this administration has already started, increasing the
difficulties of reaching consensus for the adjustment policies--a difficult
and time-consuming process.
72.      On the positive side, the financial crisis facing the country has
become apparent both to political leaders and to the private sector,
raising their awareness of the need to undertake the agreed reforms
quickly. Their concern has led to increased willingness to accept measures
they would otherwise resist, providing the Government (and the Bank) with a
window of opportunity to enact the adjustment measures in the next few
months. Provided the proposed financial support from external donors
materializes according to the proposed schedule, the support of important
groups can be consolidated, giving continuation of the adjustment program
through 1989 and beyond a good chance of success. Therefore, we believe
the risks are manageable.
R. Procurement. Disbursement. Administration and Auditing
73.      International competitive bidding would be required for all
eligible purchases exceeding US$5.0 million. The purchasers' normal
procedures would be followed for purchases of lesser value. Private firms
would follow normal commercial practice. Public sector imports would be
purchased in accordance with standard Government practices, which assure
reasonable prices.
74.      The loan would finance the CIP cost of eligible imports for which
payment is made after loan signing. Retroactive financing will be
permitted for up to US$10 million for imports for which payment was made
after May 15, 1988, but before loan signing. Public and private sector
imports would be eligible, except for military equipment and luxury
consumer goods. The Central Bank would be responsible for the coordination
and collection of relevant documentation and preparing withdrawal
applications under the loan. Applications would be submitted to the Bank
using statements of expenditure; the Central Bank would retain all detailed
documentation for review by the Bank as required.
Collaboration with the IM?
75.      Close contact has been maintained between Bank and IMF staff
throughout preparation of the program. However, IMF staff have been unable
to participate actively in the Bank's policy discussions with the
Government regarding the program. The Government has indicated its
willingness to clear all arrears with the Fund in the near term and its



- 23 -
interest in initiating conversations on a Stand-By Arrangement as soon as
payment is completed. Provided arrears can be cleared, the Governnent
expects that formal negotiations of a Stand-By Arrangement for 1989 could
take place in late 1988. Agreement on such an Arrangement would reinforce
the stabilization efforts made during 1988, and help strengthen the
foundation for structural adjustment in the medium term. Therefore, the
Bank has and will continue to strongly encourage the Government to take the
necessary steps toward a successful conclusion of negotiations with the
IMF.
PART IV - BANK OPERATIONS STRATEGY
76.      Since 1955, Honduras has received 33 Bank loans totalling US$543.5
million and 12 IDA credits totalling US$85.0 million, both net of
cancellations. Of the Bank Group's total lending to Honduras, 39t has been
for the energy sector, 24Z for transportation infrastructure, 172 for
agricultural credit and regional development, 152 for industrial credit and
tourism, 2Z for education, 32 for water supply and drainage, and 1S for
municipal development.  Bank Group lending initially concentrated on
developing basic infrastructure in transport and power, where inadequate
facilities hampered the development of the country. In the last decade, it
has diversified to support expansion of productive capacity in agriculture,
industry, and tourism, and to address major needs in education and water
supply.
77.      The Bank's strategy for Honduras emphasizes medium-term structural
adjustment. In view of the urgent need to address the macroeconomic issues
in order to lay the basis for adjustment in the medium term, however, the
Bank's strategy is also focussed on short-term macroeconomic adjustment, an
effort which has been fully discussed with the rMF. The reallocation of
US$20 million under the Third Industrial Credit Project, approved by the
Executive Directors in March 1988, to finance general imports supported the
first steps of this short-term adjustment. The proposed structural
adjustment loan would support the complete 1988 action plan for adjustment.
78.      In 1989, the Government has agreed to continue and to deepen the
process of adjustment by following through the macroeconomic adjustment
effort begun in 1988 and focussing increasingly on the structural issues
thwarting development. Bank support for the Government's effort could
continue through a second SAL operation next year. In preparation for this
operation, the Bank will be carrying out a complete public sector
expenditure review before the end of 1988. The purpose of the review will
be to identify areas of potential reduction in current expenditures and to
help the Government to rationalize its investment planning process through
application of economic criteria for project selection. Such operation
would also support the Government's work toward the design of an overall
tax reform, advance reforms in other areas, such as the trade regime and
financial sector management, and continue institutional improvements in
public sector management, particularly in tax administration.



- 24 -
79.      To achieve and sustain the increases in public savings necessary
for medium-term stability and growth, strong actions are needed in the
management of the public enterDrise sector. The Government plans to
undertake a major overhaul of the management of the public enterprises,
with a view to increase their operational and financial efficiency as well
as the discipline governing their financial relationship with the Central
Government. The Bank could support this effort through a public enterprise
loan, focused on 10-15 of the largest enterprises. The severe adverse
impact that the deficits of ENEE, the electric power company, have had on
the Central Government's fiscal accounts in recent years warrant special
attention to this enterprise. A separgte operation will therefore be
proposed to address ENEE's problems. The programs designed as the basis
for these loans would be carefully linked with the objectives and
constraints imposed by SAL I and II, to assure consistency with the
macroeconomic adjustment process.
80.      The key factors constraining export growth include the overvalued
currency, the generally high level of protection in the trade regime, and
the wide dispersion of protection resulting from both the range of nominal
tariffs and from the complex structure of exemptions and surcharges in
place. The distortions resulting from the last problem will be partially
corrected under SAL I, from the elimination of the exemptions and phasing
out of surcharges. SAL I will also begin the process of adjustment of
exchange rate management, to be followed up in 1989. Once sufficient
adjustment in the real exchange rate is achieved, a program of trade
liberalization will be important to improve the competitiveness of exports.
In preparation for the design of a reform of the trade regime aimed at the
reduction of the level and dispersion of effective protection, a study
would be carried out in 1989. The Bank could support this process under
SAL It and through an export development loan.
81.      Key issues to be addressed in the agriculture sector include
elimination of restrictions and government intervention in basic grains
markets, reduction of public sector participation in production and
distribution of improved seeds and rental of agricultural machinery,
elimination of public sector participation in export marketing of forest
products and establishment of improved mechanisms for efficient management
and protection of forest resources, and improvement of credit distribution
systems. An agricultural credit loan, scheduled for Board consideration
after SAL I, would address the last issue. The others would be addressed
under SAL II and would be the focus of an agriculture sector loan planned
for Board consideration in FY90.
82.      Financial intermediation is a major source of inefficiency in the
economy, contributing to low domestic savings; intermediation costs are
high, and real interest rates remain highly positive, in spite of excess
liquidity in the banking system and relatively low inflation. Both the
policy framework for the sector and the mechanisms and capacity for
supervision of banks by the Central Bank need to be strengthened. The
process has begun, with the help of technical assistance provided under the
Third Industrial Credit Project. A financial sector loan could support
further actions for the sector.



- 25 -
83.      The above strategy is conditional on the continued willingness and
ability of the Government to carry out the adjustment effortt it will
require constant close monitoring and may require interim adjustments to
the strategy as events develop. Proceeding with each successive step would
be contingent on satisfactory implementation of agreed actions. The first
timetable oi such actions will be incorporated into the SAL agreement.
Each sector adjustment loan would be coordinated with and tied to the SAL,
as well as to relevant elements of other sector loans, where appropriate.
The tranching of disbursements under all adjustment loans would be matched
to Government performance in meeting agreed conditions, thus assuring that
the risks attached to increases in Bank exposure are managed through
improvements in the country's medium-term prospects and creditworthiness.
84.      As the process of adjustment advances and creditworthiness is
strengthened, the Bank would gradually increase project lending. The
sectors and projects to be supported by such lending would be identified in
the course of the examination of the public investment program included In
the public expenditure review planned for late 1988, to be carried out with
the Bank's collaboration (para. 50).
Collaboration with Other Agencies
85.      Even with the strong Bank support envisaged, the success of
Honduras' economic adjustment program still faces clear risks unless strong
financial support is obtained from other bilateral and multilateral sources
(para. 61). The improvement of Honduras' creditworthiness strongly depends
on its access to external financing that would remain largely on
concessional terms. Some of the financing would be provided by USAID and
the IDB. USAID has approved a US$75 million ESF for 1988-89. IDB has a
major investment program which is essential for the satisfaction of the
country's infrastructure requirements. Preliminary discussions with
officials from other bilateral agencies are scheduled in October 1938, when
a Consultative Group meeting hosted by the Bank takes place in Paris.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
86.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
