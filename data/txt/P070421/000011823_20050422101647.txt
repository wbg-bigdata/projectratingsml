EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
General
The project involves 2 laning of 6.7 km of by-pass for Bijapur Town from Km. 126.2 on
Bijapur - Tikota Road (link 2A) to Km.103.0 on Kushtagi Road (NH 13), mainly within an
acquired 30m right-of-way (ROW). The Public Works Department (PWD), Karnataka is the
executing agency of the project. As per Environmental Screening studies this project road has
been categorized as B Category Project. This means limited environmental impacts may
occur due to the project work and will be mitigated. Detailed reports have been prepared and
presented:

PART I - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA)
1.    Introduction
The Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) is an initiative by the Public
Works Department (PWD) of the Government of Karnataka (GoK), under the financial
assistance of World Bank, to undertake improvement of 2490 km of roads consisting of State
Highways and Major District Roads.
The KSHIP envisaged construction of by-passes for important Towns coming under project
cormdors keeping in view the increase in traffic along the Project Road following the
improvement and to avoid future bottlenecks in the town area. These by-passes are being
viewed as additional corridors to the existing roads passing through the settlements to
facilitate smooth traffic dispersal. Bijapur town has been considered for by-pass.
Methodology
The Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA) study started with a detailed reconnaissance
survey for the p urpose o f recording the features along roadside and i n the a djoining area.
Areas impacted due to anthropogenic activities and the manifest expressions of the natural
environmental processes were also recorded. The need for traffic management was
considered in relation to the road geometry as well as for observed traffic congestion.
The above survey was followed by collation of data pertaining to the physical attributes of
the region in general and the proposed road in particular covering 6.7-km length. Detailed
information on physical, biological and human resources, cultural heritage and human
impacts were recorded and analysed. Subsequently, primary data on the ambient quality of
noise, water, air and soil was collected as per procedures prescribed by the MoEF.
As part of the assessment, the rules and regulations governing environmental assessment and
their application to the project and the institutions responsible for providing the clearances
and for discharging those functions were charted. Thus from the regulatory perspective, the
legal procedures on land acquisition, tree felling, compensatory afforestation, preparation of
rehabilitation & resettlement action plan and environmental monitoring and reporting were
identified as key issues.
To identify and assess the probable impacts upon the environment from road design,
construction and operation phases, close interaction was established with the design
engineers.

Imnprovement Project                                Bijapur By-pass
Public consultations were carried out during the environmental reconnaissance surveys. The
public consultations were well attended by the Project affected Persons, Students,
Academicians, Local NGOs and other stakeholders.
Based on the impact analysis and the public consultations, a comprehensive Environment
Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared for sound environment management during the
design, construction and operation phases of the project.
2.    Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
i.    Environmental Policy and Administrative Framework
Environmental Policy and Administrative framework involves the Ministry of Environment
and Forests (MOEF), Government of India, Divisional Forest Department, and Kamataka
State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). Environmental Clearance is required for the
developmental work of this project road.
ii.   Legal Context
The I egal r esponsibility for creation, maintenance, up-gradation or abandonment of public
road rests with the PWD, Karnataka and other authorities like State Pollution Control Board
and State Forest Department.
Other major elements of the Indian legal context for Environmental Management are:
The Constitution provides for protection and improvement of the environment and states that
it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the national environment,
includingforest, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures.
Various legal enactments to protect environment are as follows:
i.    Water (Prevention and Control of pollution) Act of 1974 and Cess Act of 1977.
ii.   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
iii.  Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
iv.   Forest (Conservation) Act, as amended in 1988.
v.    Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
vi.   Policy Statement on Abatement of Pollution, 1992 affirning the government's
intention to integrate environmental and economic aspects in development planning
with stress on preventive aspects of pollution abatement and the Polluter pays
principle.
vii.  The Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 1994 (by MOEF) S.0.60(E)
under c lause (a) o f s ub-rule (3) o f rule 5 of the Environmental (Protection) Rules,
1986 invites objections from the public within sixty days from the date of publication
of the said notification, against the intention of the Central Govt. to impose
restrictions and prohibitions on the expansion and m odemisation o f any activity or
new projects being undertaken in any part of India unless environmental clearance has
been accorded by the Central Govenmment or the State Govenmment in accordance
with t he p rocedure specified i n n otification No. S.O. N o. 80(E) dated 28th January
1993 (MOEF, 1994; CPCB, 1998).
3.    Project Description
The total length of the proposed By-pass alignment is about 6.7Km. The proposed alignment
begins from Bijapur - Tikota road (SH - 12) at PWD Km 126.2, west of Bijapur town on link
2A and continues towards south-east on a plain terrain at an elevation of 620m above MSL,
along the existing cart track and curves gradually. This stretch is of about 2.46 Kms length
and further it intersects the project road Bijapur - Jamkhandi road on link 3A (Chainage 2.46

Kmn). Then, the alignment continues to follow the same direction and crosses 'South
Western Railway' broad gauge line (originally a meter gauge railway track, but now being
converted to a broad gauge) at Ch.4.6 and traverses further and intersects Bijapur-Bagalkot
road (Chainage-4.71 Kni). Further, the alignment curves easterly direction for about 2 Kms
before t erminating at Chainage 1 03 Km on s outh-link of NH - 13, south of Bijapur. The
proposed By-pass alignment passes through lands of Navaraspur, Kalebagh, Mahal bagayath
and Kasaba Bijapur revenue villages.
The intersection with the existing railway line is proposed to be maintained 'at-grade' only at
this stage as the number of train passings in a day doesn't warrant a grade separator. Also as
part of the road safety measures, the approaches of the railway line intersection are proposed
to be improved geometrically. Additional advance waming road signs, rumble strips are also
proposed. The railway department has to install 'wicket gates' alongwith gate closure
arrangements a t b oth t he a pproaches o f t he b ypass r oad. A t ypical i mprovement sketch is
presented in Figurel.1.
Vehicles operating on this section carry mainly agnrcultural produce like Jowar, wheat,
Maize, sugarcane, cotton, milk and medicines, industrial goods, machinery, etc. Traffic is
increasing in this section due to general economic growth.
The entire proj ect road traverses through undulating and flat terrain of dry and agricultural
land. The soil in this area is shallow black soil and there is no wetland and marshy land. The
geology of the project comrdor consists of rocks belonging to Deccan traps.
The existing road of the project is a cart track nmning for a length of 2.46 Km fornm Bijapur -
Tikota Road to meet Bijapur - Jamakhandi Road on Link 3A. There is no existing road/cart
track between Ch. 2.46 to Ch. 6.7 and the proposed alignment between Ch.2.46 and Ch.4.71
traverses agriculture land and connects Link 3A and NH-2 18 (Bagalkot Road) and crosses an
existing railway line at Ch. 4.600. Further the alignment moves towards East, at Ch. 6.700
joins NH-13. South-East of Bijapur Town project area is having increased level of SPM
(Suspended Particulate Matter). Additional culverts are required to save the road from
erosion due to run-off, as the existing numbers are not sufficient.
4.   \ Analysis of Alternatives
Project alternatives
Three project altematives were evaluated, They are:
Alternative I: No Project
The option does not involve any action. The highways will remain in the existing state. No
construction activity takes place.
Alternative II:    Road through the town
Involves widening t o 4 - I ane d ivided carriageway i n p lace of the existing 2-lane highway
through the settlement of Bijapur.
Alternative III:   Construction of a by-pass
Involves improvement of existing State Highways and construction of a new 2-laneby-pass
for Bijapur settlement on the western side of the settlement. The construction activity requires
a minimum period of 12 months for completion.

Improvement Project                                Boiapur By-pass
Alternative I
The section of State Highway 12 (link-2A), State Highway 65 (link-3A), National Highway
218 and National Highway 13 in Bijapur town limit will not be altered. The carriageway will
not be widened. Therefore no construction activity is to take place. Impacts will be based on
increase in the traffic volumes on the existing alignment. It is assumed that there would be no
project.
Alternative II
The option involves widening of the existing carriageway in Bijapur Town limit. The cross-
section through the settlement would be 4 lane divided carriageway. In addition to this there
would be a median and sidewalks on both sides. If possible, a parking lane/space would also
be provided. To establish this cross-section in Bijapur, man structures would have to be
displaced. At the same time the traffic speeds and hence the journey time would decrease.
Alternative III
This option would entail construction of a n ew road a round t he s ettlement. T he n ew r oad
would act as a by-pass for the Bijapur town. The existing road within town limit would be
retained in its present state also. The alignment originates well beyond the town limits.
Implementation of this option would lead to the through traffic plying on the by-pass and
only the destined traffic, for Bijapur, using the existing road through the town. The hindrance
caused by the traffic movement, plying through the settlement, would be offset. At the same
time there would be a substantial land acquisition for construction of the by-pass.
Evaluation of Alternative II (By-pass alternative)
During the reconnaissance survey, team consisting of highway engineers and enviromnental
specialists observed that the extent o f town development was more on the eastern part of
Bijapur. To overcome the traffic congestion and to restrict the commercial vehicular
movement through the town, national H ighways D epartment has constructed a b y-pass on
eastern side connecting south-link with north-link of NH-13. The NH-13 by-pass occupies
about half the length of the total ring road network. The remaining halve is divided into two
sections. First section of the road connects north-link of NH-13 with link-2A (Bijapur to
Tikota) on northwest of Bijapur and the second section connects south-link of NH-13 with
link-2A (Bijapur to Tikota).
The main reason for proposing this by-pass i.e. South Link of NH-13 with Link -2A in
KSHIP is to decongest the town sections and to provide connectivity to project roads
considered under improvement programme. The Bijapur urban Development Authority
(BUDA) has proposed by-pass alignment for Bijapur in the form of a ring road, which
signifies both the sections of road (north-west part and south-west part) explained earlier. It
was observed during the field visit, WBM (earthen) road is in very bad condition on the
north-west part of the town and it is not on the defined alignment. This alignment intersects
MDR (to 'Ittangihal' village) before it meets NH- 13 and carries very low commercial
vehicles traffic. Since this alignment is partially improved by BUDA, whose inclusion for
improvement under this programme is ignored. The second section of the by-pass alignment
on the south-west of Bijapur town connecting link-2A with south-link of NH - 13 is thus
proposed for by-pass. The total length of the proposed by-pass here is 6.7Km.
Considerable volume of through traffic is benefited from saving an additional travel length of
2.42km in by-passing the town compared to existing alignment through town. Delay due to
traffic congestion is very much reduced. According to the opinion survey most of the

commercial vehicles prefer to use this alignment. Connectivity to industrial and commercial
areas along the link is very good.
The extent of land acquisition for by-pass (with 30m COI) in west is approximately 38 acres.
It was also understood that, the rnd acquisition forppotion ffr-passallgnent fom 1N-
218 to NH-13 (1.70Km) is initiated by BUDA and revenue departments have handed over the
relevant records to the authority.
Sensitivity of Alternative III (By-pass alternative)
Altemative III has the lowest environmental sensitivity. This indicates that the alignment is
likely to cause minimum impacts to-ehnatuasoaand cultural environment in the study
area. The salient feature of this alignment is that it is unlikely to cause damage to any cultural
property. In addition to this there is no likelihood of displacement of persons. All losses will
be compensated and assisted through an Entitlement framework developed by the GoK. This
option will help to reduce the congestion through Bijapur town and traffic through the town
will be reduced considerably. Only the traffic destined for the town will use that road. At
present, the ambient air quality levels as well as the noise levels, within the settlement, are
slightly higher than the stipulated standards. The construction of the by-pass, in all likelihood,
will decrease the noise levels and increase the ambient air quality in Bijapur settlement. Also
the by-pass will benefit the vehicular movement. The traffic movement to be smooth-faced.
To have shortest possible connectivity to two major project links, link-2A (Bijapur to Tikota
on SH 12) and link-3A (Bijapur to Jarnakhandi on SH 65) and also to two National
Highways, NH - 218 (Bijapur - Bagalakote Road) and NH - 13 (Kushtagi Road) the
aligrunent on the west part of Bijapur was found to be most favourable for by-pass from
geographical, engineering, environmental and social aspects.
5.    Baseline Environmental Setup
Primary Data
Baseline conditions of the project areas have been compiled after a walk over environmental
survey of the project area and as p er i nformation available from v arious D epartments and
literature and through Topographical Survey maps.
There is natural decline weather quality. Climatic condition in the project area indicates that
there is reduced atmospheric temperature with increased relative humidity.
Within the ROW, there is no municipal supply tap or open wells or hand pumps or tube wells
along the project area. People are mostly dependent on hand pumps for requirement of water
for drinking and domestic purposes.
No plantation is seen along the project area except a few trees (4 trees of > 30 cm girth size)
which were noticed on Bijapur - Bagalkot Road (NH 218). The project needs plantation
along its route to enhance the aesthetic value of the project and also to protect running
vehicles by providing cool atmosphere
Within 30m on either side of the project road there is no rare and endangered animal and
plant species. Wildlife/Bird Sanctuaries, National Parks, Zoos, Wetlands, Marshy land,
Breeding and Nesting sites were not at all found within 7-10 Kms. There is no
archaeologically important monument, art and cultural sites.

There is no specified site for dumping of solid and liquid wastes along the project road.
However, at few p laces garbage dumps, solid w aste and domestic effluent d ischarge have
been observed.
Places of Tourist and Archaeological interest
The world famous Gol Gumbaz, Ibrahim Rauza and Baarah Kamaan are of major tourist
attraction a nd a re I ocated c lose t o t he p roject a rea. T hese m onuments are at a d istance o f
about 2 kms from the project route. None of these monuments /sites will be directly impacted
up on due to the proposed project. On the whole, developing this by-pass road will greatly
benefit the tourist circuits in Kamataka, as the by-pass serves as a good connecting link to
important tourist spots and places of cultural and historical interest.
Generated Data
Baseline data for air, water, noise and existing trees was not available. So, analysis was
undertaken for different parameters of ambient air, water and ambient noise quality
(important parameters) by Sneha Test House, Bangalore recognised by Kamataka State
Pollution Control Board, Bangalore and for routine tree inventory was carried out by the
Environmental Consultant of PCC.
Generated ambient air and noise data were compared with the standards prescribed by CPCB
and it was found that ambient air quality in the project area is good except SPM (Suspended
Particulate Matter) which is more than the prescribed limit. This will perhaps increase during
construction phase of the project road but will be restored in operation phase.
Ambient noise quality test result indicates that noise levels exceed the limit prescribed for
sensitive, residential and commercial zones. It appeared to be within the limit only durntg
night.
Water Quality was not tested because none of the water sources were found along the project
alignment.
Only 4 plants have to be removed for the upgradation work they belong to species of Acacia
and Azadirachta.
Borrow pit soils will be tested. Only soil of un-erodible ype and suitable for embankment will
be used. Chance of soil erosion will be limited and will be mitigated by turfing of the
embankment slopes. Quarries and borrow soil will be purchased from the approved owners
for construction work.
Accident rate is being increased these days at major links and is expected to increase further
due to increase in number of vehicles. Proper mitigative measures in the form of traffic
management will be provided.
Key Environmental Issues
There are no water resources or sensitive areas like reserve forests or wildlife sanctuaries or
archaeological sites or cultural sites or religious sites within or outside the ROW of the
project area. The project corridor passes through only dry lands.

Improvement Project                                  Byjapur By-pass
6.    Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) & Mitigation Measures
Impact Assessment/Evaluation
Impact potential of the project road was estimated keeping in view the series of impacts that
will usually be triggered by the project activities according to Matrix Method. Impact
assessment matrix reveals that overall impact score for project without mitigation measures
was -111. With mitigation measure the impact matrix was evaluated and overall impact score
calculated was + 106. Thus, the project may be accepted for developmental work.
Mitigation /Enhancement Measures
Several enhancement measures have been proposed for the developmental work of the project
road based on standard design guidelines. Enhancement measures are given concerning civil
engineering work, activities and facilities provided for the construction work. These
enhancement measures will not only strengthen the existing road but will also improve the
environment of the project area after completion.
7.    Public Consultation
Public consultations/interviews were carried out by directly approaching the stakeholders
(above 19 years old age group) to know their views/reactions about the negative and positive
impacts of construction work in their area. The suggestions given by them for the
developmental work are briefed as follows:
* Plantation along the project road will reduce the pollution load (air and noise level).
*  Upgradation of the road would increase cleanliness in the project area and will redu__ the
number of accidents and pollution load.
*  Periodical checking of vehicles would reduce air and noise level in the project area.
*  Strict implementation of rules and regulations of pollution check will reduce the pollution
load in the project area.
According to NGOs, the Social Forestry Scheme should be applied as environment
enhancement measures and permission should be given to nearby landowners to take care of
trees and to own trees.
Overall opinion of the public is that the upgradation of the project road should be camred out
at the earliest, but with mitigation measures to save the life as well as to increase the quality
of life of the people.
All the above suggestions given by the public and NGOs have been taken into account in the
EMP.

PART II - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
1.    Introduction
Environmental Management Plan has been prepared for the KSHIP for the project road for
the construction and operation phase which will be implemented through the existing
environmental set up in the KSHIP.
2.    Environmental impacts and Mitigation Measures
The environmental impacts due to location, engineering design, impacts during construction
and operation phases have been discussed in detail in Chapter 6 of the Phase II EIA Report
and is also presented in tabular form as Appendix-l of the EMP. The primary impacts due to
the implementation of Phase II upgradation of by-pass roads and the associated mitigation
measures are discussed. As the project alignment is the new pavement and passes through the
dry land the impacts anticipated are moderate and can be mitigated through proper measures.
This section summarises the environmental impacts of the project and presents ,ricasures,
which will be implemented to mitigate the adverse impacts of the project and to enhance the
positive outcome of the project. The environmental impacts due to location, engineering
design, impacts during construction and operation phases and the mitigation measures have
been discussed.
Based on the proposed construction activities envisaged for road maintenance, no adverse
environmental impacts are anticipated, if the specifications given for road improvement are
adhered to. However, some minor construction related impacts are expected. Applying the
EMP with the same diligence to the works involving rehabilitation contracts can mitigate
these impacts.
3. Integration of EMP with the Project
The EMP is an integral part of the Project and an important component, which will be
implemented simultaneously as the project proceeds. The project has to be executed and
supervised for effective and efficient environmental management and timely completion of
the project. The budgetary allocations for EMP implementation would be a part of the project
costs so that the EMPIU will receive funding to supervise and monitor the various
components and train the staff and develop capacity and expertise within the Department.
The EMP has been made specific to the project requirements taking into account the
environmental impacts and their respective mitigation measures. Although the conditions in
the Bid Documents are specified, the entire document on EMP shall be made a part of the
contracts for implementation of the project. The PWD of the GOK has to discharge
responsibilities by:

Making the implementation of the EMP an integral part of the project;
Providing strong support and commitment to the development of the staff; and
Assisting and facilitating the EMPIU to liase with the relevant interface institutions.
All the relevant issues concerning the protection of the environment have been discussed in
the Phase II - Bijapur By-pass EIA report prepared as per the Operational Policy (OP 4.01)
of the World Bank. For all practical purpose, the mitigation measures outlined in the EMP
apply to the Upgradation of the by-pass component.
Conditions in Bid Document for Protection of Environment
The Contractors' responsibilities in matters related to protection of environment will be a part
of the Bid Documents. The Consulting Supervisors will be held accountable for any deviation
and non-compliance caused by the Contractor. These conditions have been included as part of
the Bid Documents and are reproduced below for illustration. The conditions are derived
from General Conditions, Sections 111 (Precautions for Safeguarding the Environment), 112
(Arrangement for Traffic During Construction), and others of the "Specifications for Road
and Bridge Works" by Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST), 1997. The contract clauses
have been modified as appropriate and additional clauses have been added where necessary.
4.    Environmental Management Plan Implementation Unit
The PIU (PWD) will be responsible for implementation of the environmental management
plan to mitigate the potential impacts of the project. Implementation of mitigation measures
would be the responsibility of the Environment Management Plan Implementation Unit
(EMPIU) which will be set up as part of institutional strengthening plan. Following
discussions between the PCC, PIU and PWD, the EMPIU framework was finalised and the
appropriate expertise required during the implementation of the E MP were i dentified. The
EMPIU may be further modified and strengthened, as the project is implemented.
The following Organisations and their representatives will assist the PIU:
Supervising Engineering Consultant
Final Design Consultant
World Bank
Civil Engineers
Environmental Consultant and
Public Participation (Stakeholders and NGOs).
Actions Taken by the PIU
Following the approval of the Phase I EMP of KSHIP by the Government of Kamataka and
the World Bank, the PIU has adopted a proactive approach leading to the formation of the
EMPIU in the PIU set-up.
The EMPIU formation has been initiated by the appointment of a Senior Environmental
Engineer of the rank of an Assistant Executive Engineer of the Government of Kamataka in
May 2001. The PIU has appointed totally 5 Assistant Environmental Engineers of Assistant
Engineer rank and four of them are already in place in the divisional offices and one in

officers (DFO) have been advised to supervise the seedlings being raised in the nurseries.
5.    Environmental Monitoring
The monitoring locations, frequency of monitoring, length of time, monitoring stations and
record keeping procedures in given format during construction and operation phase have been
defined. Air, noise and water quality standards have also been provided for comparison. If
any parameter will exceed the standard, suitably will be further monitored and mitigated.
6.    Capacity Development through Training for Environmental Management
The PIU (PWD) and the Contractor staff will need to be trained at various levels. An
Environmental Management Unit setup is functioning in P WD with specialized p ersonnel.
The PIU (PWD) has arranged appropriate training of the staff.
The mitigation plan has been proposed separately for the construction and operation phases.
The contractor in accordance with appropriate clauses included in the contract specifications
will meet the requirements during c onstruction. After construction is completed, the P WD
will maintain safety installation and monitor air and noise pollution in the normal course and
take action as needed. The Forest Department will look after the plantation.
7.    Budget for EMP Implementation
The cost of environmental mitigation measures has been estimated and provided in Table - 7
of Section - Budget I mplementation of Phase I I Environmental M anagement P lan (EMNP).
The present EMP consists of cost estimate for aesthetics and enhancement measures for the
project area. The cost estimated is Rs. 6,70,000. The costs may be m odified b ased o n t he
implementation of the project.
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN (RAP)
The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) of Phase II Bijapur By-pass has been prepared on the
basis of provisions contained in the document approved by Government of Kamataka (GOK)
entitled: Resettlement and Rehabilitation: Principles and Policy Framework for the
Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project.
Socioeconomic surveys along w ith p ublic c onsultation w ere conducted o n t he u pgradation
roads, for a Corridor of Impact of 30 m keeping in view the design requirements. These
surveys were conducted during April 2003.
There was a concerted effort to reduce impact on the number of families being affected. The
total number of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) is 632 and the total number of Project
Affected Families (PAFs) is 55. The total number of settlements to be affected is 2. The
extent of land acquisition from private owners necessary for road widening and other
improvements is 38 acres.
RAP provides a detailed and updated implementation schedule for Phase II Bijapur by-pass.

CHAPTER- 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1   PWD - KSHIP - Background
The Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) is an initiative by the Public
Works Department (PWD) of the Government of Karnataka (GoK), under the financial
assistance of World Bank, to undertake improvement of 2490 Km of roads consisting of State
Highways and Major District Roads. The whole project has been divided into two phases -
Phase I and Phase II. In both Phases roads have been selected for upgradation and
rehabilitation. In Phase I, roads selected for upgradation include about 394 Kms. in Gulbarga,
Raichur, Koppal, Bijapur and Bidar districts. Upgradation is widening and strengthening of
the existing carriageway. The width of the existing carriageway - 3.5ms, 4.5 ms and 5.5ms
will be increased to the width of 7 ms. This involves cutting of trees, if any. And for major
maintenance (i.e. rehabilitation) in Phase I, total roads round up to 1027 Kms. Major
maintenance d oes n ot i nvolve c utting o f any t ree. P hase I p roject i s under implementation
stage. In Phase II, roads selected for upgradation total up to 548 Kms. and they come under
Belgaum, Gokak, Bagalkot, Bijapur, Gadag, Chitradurga and Bellary districts. In addition,
around 491 Kms of roads have been selected for Rehabilitation in Dharwad, Uttara Kannada,
Belgaum, Raichur and Mysore. Figure - 1.1 shows Phase II upgradation and rehabilitation
corridors considered by KSHIP.
1.2   By-passes as integral part of KSHIP
Two by-passes are recognised by KSHIP as a part of Phase I keeping in view the increase in
traffic along the project roads following the improvement and to avoid future bottle necks in
the town area. The Phase II Project includes by-passes for 2 Towns - Raichur and Bijapur.
These by-passes are considered as additional corridors to the existing roads passing through
the settlements to facilitate smooth traffic flow. By-passes explored by KSHIP with towns are
listed in Table 1.1.

1.3   Scope
Environmental Assessment study plays an important role in Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) of developmental project by determining the baseline conditions, potential
environmental impacts, consideration of alternatives, preventive mitigative and compensatory
measures. Besides, detailed environmental designing for monitoring of evaluation of future
environmental aspects, plans and documentation will be given importance.
1.4   Objectives
The main objective of the present study is to conduct a detailed feasibility study of the project
corridor along with thorough evaluation under economic, environmental and social criteria, to
qualify for proposed improvement. To achieve this objective, Environmental Assessment is

required. The study focuses on probable environmental impacts and to suggest feasible and
cost effective engineering measures to minimise the adverse environmental impacts.
1.5   Environmental Assessment (EA) Study
The EA study has been carried out as per the Guidelines of the Ministry of Environment and
Forests (MoEF) of the Government of I ndia (Gol) as a lso t o m eet t he requirements o f t he
World Bank as per its Operational Policy OP 4.01.
This Environmental Assessment Report is concerned with environmental aspects of the
Bijapur by-pass and is formulated as per MoEF and World Bank guidelines as outlined in OP
4.04 on Natural Habitats.
This report enlightens environmental aspects of Bijapur By-pass of Phase II KSHIP.
1.2   Approach and Methodology
1.2.1 Essential Steps
Environmental Assessment (EA) requires the following essential steps as per World Bank
guidelines (1998):
i.    Understanding of existing environmental baseline Conditions;

1.2.2.2 Collection of Primary Data
The Environmental Assessment Source Book (update 1999), World Bank Guidelines (1999),
Environmental Procedures and Guidelines (MoEF, 1994) were important sources of guidance
for collection of the baseline data from the field.
The Environmental Assessment Source Book (update 1999), World Bank Guidelines (1999),
Environmental Procedures and Guidelines (MoEF, 1994) were important sources of guidance
for collection of the baseline data from the field.
The primary environmental survey was conducted in the month of January 2003. Field
reconnaissance survey was followed by detailed environmental survey. Environmental
monitoring locations were identified for air and noise quality and testing of samples were
carried out. Water bodies or bore well sources were not found within or outside 30m of ROW.
The data provides the background of air and noise quality status of the project area. Biological
components were not observed except two trees. Local fauna was listed. Impacts of the
project on environmental components and social components were recognised.
A number of persons were contacted for collection of baseline data and their opinion
regarding environmental features of the by-pass and also feasibility of the project. For
conducting environmental survey necessary tools and Proforma have been developed keeping
in view of the Questionnaires for Environmental Clearance (MOEF and CII, 1999).
Questionnaires for Public opinion and other Proforma have also been developed to facilitate
environmental assessment.
1.2.2.3 Collection of Secondary Data
Baseline data have been collected from many sources and by contacting a number of persons.
Meteorological data and demographic data for the Social environment were obtained from the
District Statistical Centre, Bijapur. Social components considered were total area, land use,
population density, occupational structure/pattern, work force ratio, literacy rate, crop pattem
and amenities. Geological data (rocks and soils) was collected from Agricultural College,
Hittanahalli Farm, Bijapur. Tourism and archaeological data were collected from
Archaeological Department, Gumbaz Campus, Bijapur. Data on available local species of
plants was collected from Regional and Social Forestry Divisions, Bijapur.
Detailed information on the following features were recorded and analysed.
Physical Resources: Geology, Topography, Tectonics, Climate, Soil and Drainage system,
Biological Resources: Ecology, Vegetation, Flora and Fauna
Human Resources: Demography, Land Use and Occupation pattern
Quality of life values: Educational institutions, Medical facilities, basic amenities like water
supply, electricity and communication and transport
Aesthetics
Cultural heritage and Tourism
The reconnaissance survey enabled the consultants to identify the various c ritical locations
where primary data on Air, Noise, Water and Soil quality were to be generated for impact
assessment and prediction. These data were generated.
In addition to the above surveys, infornal and formal discussions and consultation were held
with the local populace with reference to the pertinent projects and their views and

suggestions were sought on issues of road widening, land acquisition, environmental pollution
and degradation, sanitary facilities and safety.
1.2.2.4 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
All the data pertaining to the physical attributes of the region in general and road in particular
on a 10-km wide swath have been collated and processed to provide the baseline condition
and to estimate detailed potential (key) environmental issues. The potential impacts on
environmental components like air, water, noise, land, biological - flora and fauna, and
socioeconomic and cultural aspects were predicted and evaluated based on the field
observations a nd s econdary d ata. S imple m atrix m ethod w as a dopted for the evaluation of
impacts.
As part of the assessment, the rules and regulations governing environmental assessment and
their application to the project and the institutions responsible for providing the clearances
and for discharging those functions were charted. Thus from the regulatory perspective, the
legal procedures on land acquisition, tree felling, compensatory afforestation, preparation of
rehabilitation & resettlement a ction p lan and e nvironmental m onitoring a nd r eporting w ere
identified as key issues. The issues related to land acquisition, displacement and rehabilitation
are covered separately in the report on Resettlement Action Plan.
The legal provisions for carrying out this study is given in the January 27, 1994 EIA
notification and subsequent amendments dated 4th May 1994, 10th April 1997 and 15th
October 1999 under the Enviromnent (Protection) Act, 1986.
To identify and assess the probable environmental impacts during design phase, construction
and operation phase, close interaction was established with the design engineers and feasible
engineering solutions were arrived at. In addition aligmnent shifts were considered in
sensitive areas involving community, religious structure, drainage constraints and stretches
were social forestry plantations were encountered. The corridor of impact varies between 20-
30 m depending upon the proposed road embankment height, terrain and geographical
location of these roads. The social section (RAP) of Bijapur Bypass separately covers the
impacts due to land acquisition, displacement and rehabilitation.
1.2.2.5 Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
Cost effective and feasible designed mitigation measures were identified. The detailed plan
for the management of environmental components during construction and operation phase of
the project will be provided to overcome the potential environmental impacts.
The impact analysis and mitigation measures arrived at, help in formulating the Environment
Management Plan (EMP). The EMP looks into the environmental impacts and mitigation
measures, identifying the implementing organisation for environmental management, the
current composition of the PIU, level of expertise of the personnel, external consultants
required for monitoring and implementation. The training needs of the personnel were also
considered for formulating the EMP and calculating the budgetary allocations. These aspects
are covered in Phase II - Environmental Management Plan. The present EMP covers the
procedure to be followed for implementation of the mitigation measures, monitoring of the
various activities and the responsibilities of the project proponent, supervisory consultant and
the contractors. The overall budget for environmental mitigation measures and monitoring
was prepared. All these issues are discussed in the Part II - Environmental Management Plan
(EMP).

CHAPTER -2
POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
2.1   Highlights of the Indian System & Major Organisations
Development of environmental protection and enhancement measures in India has been
determined to a considerable extent by the central legislation. The Ministry of Enviromnent
and Forests (MoEF), set up in 1980, is the controlling institution in this regard. The MoEF has
two wings as Environment and Forests. Clearance of new developmental projects is necessary
from both the wings.
2.1.1 Department of Environment & Forests
Every state in India has now their respective Departments of Environment & Forests. In
Karnataka, this department is known as the Department of Forests, Ecology and Environment.
This Department was established in March 1981 to have an integrated approach to deal with,
prevention and control of air and water pollution, preservation and development of forest
wealth and other natural resources in the state. This department co-ordinates and controls the
activities sponsored by the Union Ministry of Environment within the State. It also co-
ordinates and controls the activities of the State Pollution Control Board.
2.1.2 The PolHution Control Board (PCB)
2.1.2.1 The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is another technical wing of the MoEF entrusted
with t he responsibilities for detection and abatement of pollution. Every state of India has
their respective pollution control boards, which act in unison with the policies of the CPCB.
The State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB), in turn, are the empowered institution to issue
licenses to the industries. These licenses are issued on the condition of total compliance with
the standards o f p ermissible p ollution as prescribed from time to time by the CPCB or as
modified (usually in more stringent terms) norms depending on local conditions. Every
licensed industry is required to carry out environmental auditing and submit such reports to
the license issuing authority. The State Pollution Control Boards can repeal such licenses on
the observed violation of the norms.
2.1.2.2 Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB)
The functions of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board include advising the State
Government on water pollution issues, enforcement and monitoring as per the Air Act, co-
ordinating the activities of the regional offices of the pollution control board. It also issues
"No Objection" Certificates (NOC) for establishment of new projects, environmental
clearance of projects and conducting public hearing with respect to developmental projects. It
also issues consent letters and NOC for projects involving expansion. The KSHIP would
come under its purview.
The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is the nodal body involved in monitoring the
various industries and infrastructure related development projects from the angle of pollution
control. It also formulates and stipulates the various standards for the various emissions,
discharge of effluents, by-products and pollutants into the environment.

2.2   Guidelines for EIA of Highway Projects, IRC: 104-1988
The Indian Roads Congress published the guidelines for EIA of road projects in 1988. It
outlines the procedure for carrying out the EIA and the requirements to be met under it. It also
lists the various environmental components to be examined in relation to road projects. It also
recommends that the project authorities should have close interaction with the Department of
Environment and Forests. It is pertinent to mention that the Guidelines of the Ministry of
Environment and Forests for EIA are much exhaustive than that outlined in the IRC
guidelines.
2.3   Responsibilities of the Project Promoter & Interfaces with Other Agencies
The r esponsibility o f i nitiating actions I eading t o i ssuance o f e nvironmental c learance o f a
proposed project vests with the project promoter. In the present instance, the Public Works
Department (PWD) of the GoK would be carrying the legal responsibilities of the project
promoter.
The basic responsibility of the project promoter is to prepare, submit a comprehensive
document, complete in all respect. It shall be obliged to provide clarification, with or without
additional documentation, when intimated by the designated authority. It must carry the
commitment that no deviation from designed project would be made during implementation
without prior and explicit permission of the designated authority to do so.
2.3.1 Interface with the Ministry of Environment & Forests
The basic document required for obtaining environmental clearance is the Environmental
Assessment (EA) report presented in the prescribed format and supported by detailed and
accurate description of the project. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report when
prepared and where necessary, would follow the format prescribed by the MoEF in this
regard. In addition to the EIA report, the project proponent are to furmish information on the
rehabilitation of the displaced people if more than 1000 people are likely to be displaced. In
case it is less than 1000 persons a summary plan would be adequate.
While following the prescribed format of the EA report, it would be seen that the project
promoter has to establish and utilise strong interfaces with several other Departments of the
State Govemment and other State Agencies. It is useful to understand the contexts of this
need.
2.3.2 Interface with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board
The Amendment dated 4th May, 1994 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 requires
every promoter of major infrastructure projects, including road development, to prepare and
submit Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report for clearance before the project can be
implemented. However, the Ministry declared through a notification dated April 10, 1997 that
projects conceming upgradation of existing roads which involve marginal land acquisition
would be exempted from the prescribed clearance procedure except where sensitive areas like
sanctuaries, national park, reserved forests etc, are involved.
In schedule IV of the above referred notification, the MoEF has prescribed that the
Environmental Assessment report on road up-gradation project should be disclosed for public
hearing through a notified meeting to be headed by the nominee of the State Pollution Control
Board and t he D istrict C ollector o f t he c oncerned d istrict. T he r eport o f t his m eeting with

observations would be sent by the SPCB to the MoEF. This report would contain a copy of
the No Objection Certificate (NOC), if issued to the concerned project promoter.
Following the amendment (dated April 10, 1997), the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
Govermment of India issued a circular on 15th October 1999 (No.21012/26-99-IA-III). In the
circular, it is clarified that "Marginal land acquisition means that the land acquisition does not
exceed a total width of 20 meters on either side of the existing alignment put together. Further
it is also clarified that by-passes would be treated as stand alone projects and would require
environmental clearance only if the cost of the projects exceed Rs.50 crores each". Figure -

2.3.3 Interface with the Department of Land & Land Revenue of the GoK
However marginal may be the amount of land required, for its acquisition the project
promoter has to proceed by following the laid procedures in this regard. The District Land
Acquisition officer of the Department of Revenue is the designated authority to conduct the
business of land acquisition within his jurisdiction. The Collector of the District in the
Controlling Officer and would receive requisitions for land acquisition required in public
interest. All costs in this regard are to be borne by the project promoter. The given Office of
the District Collector would carry out disbursement of the amounts of compensation,
adjudicated in conformity with the declared state policy on entitlement.
Persistence of public grievance in such matters complicates the schedule of implementation of
the proj'ect on ground. Therefore, it is recommended that no construction work should start

before completing land acquisition process ending with payment of compensation and/or
rehabilitation.
2.3.4 Interface with the Offices of the District Magistrate & City Municipalities
This would be critical at the time of removal of encroachment and congestion. The Magistrate
of the District would take all actions on clearance of these. Rehabilitation of the displaced
persons would need the assistance of both the District Magistrate and the City Municipality.
These offices should be approached while formulating the Resettlement & Rehabilitation
(R&R) Plan. However, in the context of environmental management, no construction work
should start before the displaced persons are resettled and rehabilitated.
2.3.5 Interface with the Department of Forests of the GoK
When road development projects require acquisition of forestland and/or involve felling o f
trees, Consent of the F orest Department of the State as well as that of t he M inistry o f t he
Government of India is then required. Although the designated authority to permit felling of
trees is the District Collector, decisions are inviolably taken with the consent of the State
Forest Department.
On receipt of the permission to fell trees, the State Forest Department has to arrange to obtain
concurrence of the Forest Wing of the MoEF of the Gol to the plan. The Ministry, before
concurring, may wish to verify the facts through their own agencies. If no diversion of land
from the designated forest areas is involved, then the Ministry may accept the proposal
without ground verification. Under that circumstance, the project promoter is not required to
transfer acquired land to the State Forest Department to carry out compensatory afforestation.
This can happen when felling is limited only to the avenue trees planted earlier on the unused
part o f the right of way belonging to the project promoter. However, raising of new trees
twice the number of felled trees on the unused part of the right of way persists as a condition
for obtaining clearance of the project by the appropriate authority. Assistance of the State
Forest Department for meeting this task facilitates preparation of compliance reports. Figure
- 2.2 shows the procedure to be followed for obtaining forestry clearance.
2.3.6 Interface with the Department of Mines of the GoK
It is generally expected that the project promoter would obtain supplies of stone aggregates
from the existing licensed quarries. If for any reason new quarries have to be opened up, then
the permission of the State Department of Mines would be required. Such new quarries of
sizes more than 5-hectares would require environmental clearance based on EA reports.
2.3.7 Strength of the Public Works Department of GoK for Interface Management
The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under KSHIP and formation of a dedicated
Environment Management Plan Implementation Unit (EMPIU) under it consisting of
Highway Engineers, Environmental Engineers and Forest officers are functioning for over a
year now and are well acquainted with the procedural requirements. The PIU and the EMPIU
are adequately aware of the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach being adopted for
Highway Construction and Management. Such multifaceted units that can adopt a holistic
approach should also be deployed for future road projects.
2.4   Statutes and Operations Policy Related to Environment

2.4.1     Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (with subsequent amendments)
This statute would apply on KSHIP as and when land is to be acquired in the case of changes
in alignment and widening where there is not enough right-of-way (ROW) with the State
Govemrnment.
The Land Acquisition Act under Section 4(l) is enforced to acquire land in public interest.
The maximum time allowed, from the date of notification for the acquisition is two years,
after which the notification lapses. For the project land acquisition will be required The
compensation for land is fixed under section 23 (2), where the amount to be paid is the market

value + 30% solatium (compulsory). If this amount is paid within one year then an additional
interest of 9% is paid to the beneficiary; if it exceeds one year then an additional interest of
15% is paid.
2.4.2 The Mysore Highways Act, 1964
The Mysore Highways Act, 1964 and the Mysore Highways Rules, 1965 are in force in the
State of Karnataka. This enactment provides, among other things, for the restriction of ribbon
development and removal of encroachments. They are applicable to highways of the State, but
not to the National Highways. These have also provisions for enforcing restrictions on
building activity along highways and control of access to their land.
2.4.3 The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972
This Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds and plants and for matters
connected therewith or ancillary or incidental to. It appoints the wildlife wardens and
constitution of the wildlife advisory board, etc.
2.4.4 Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
The basic objective of this Act is to maintain and restore the wholesomeness of the country's
aquatic resources by prevention and control of pollution. Water is a state subject under the
constitution. Consequently, the Water Act, a Central law, was enacted under Article 252(1) of
the Constitution, which empowers the Union Government to legislate in a field reserved for
the States. All the States have approved implementation of the water Act.
2.4.5 The Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976
This act prvides for the preservation of trees in the State by regulating the felling of the trees
and for the planting of adequate number of trees to restore ecological balance and for matters
connected therewith.
The Act also elaborates the restriction on felling of trees and liability for preservation of trees.
Section 8(2) of the Act specifies that "Any person desiring to fell a tree, shall apply in writing
to the concerned Tree Officer for permission in that behalf. The application shall be
accompanied by a site plan or survey sketch specifying clearly the site or survey number, the
number, kind and girth of tree sought to be cut and the reasons therefore along with the
consent of the owner or occupant".
2.4.6 Town and Country Planning Act, 1976
Like the act on prevention of water pollution, the original structure of this act was drafted in
the Union Govemment and later adopted by the constituent States. Under this the States were
to set up Boards to plan land use for both towns and country. Any promoter of project has to
obtain a certificate from this Board stating whether the proposed land use is compatible with
the laid plan. (It should be mentioned here that The State of Karnataka had its own Town and
Country Planning Act since 1961 which has undergone several Amendments and presently is
known as The Kamataka Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act, 1993).
2.4.7 Forest Conservation Act, 1980
This Act provides for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or
ancillary or incidental to. This Act restricts the de-reservation of forests or use of forestland
for non-forestry purposes without the prior approval of the Union Govemment.

Inmprovement Project                                 Bijapur By-pass
The Rules and Guidelines under this Act as amended on October 25,1992 have elaborately
outlined and defined the application of the Act, procedure to be followed for acquisition of
forestland for non-forest purposes, submission of proposals, compensatory afforestation and
certain clarifications about the procedural requirements.
Under Para 2.5, the rules and their applicability is elaborated regarding rail, roads and
irrigation p rojects. K eeping i n v iew the r equirement o f v arious d epartments like Railways,
Irrigation and PWD for specific purposes like laying of roads for widening or expansion or re-
alignment, rail links etc., the Ministry under Para 2.5 stated that vacant land already in
possession with the government agencies which have not been notified as protected forests,
will not attract the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. However, the c oncerned
agency will seek permission under local laws, if any, from appropriate authority.
Under section 3.2(vi) (e), land for compensatory afforestation requires diversion of linear or
strip plantation declared as protected forest along the road sides for widening or expansion of
road and compensatory afforestation may be raised over degraded forest land twice in extent
of the forest area being diverted/de-reserved in respect of the above proposal.
2.4.8 The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
The Union Govermment under Article 253 of the Constitution passed this Statute. This Act
provides for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution and confers powers to the
Central and State Pollution Control Board with a view to carry out the aforesaid purposes.
2.4.9 Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
The Union Government under Article 253 of the Constitution passed this Statute. The
Enviromnent (Protection) Act, 1986 seeks to achieve the objective of protection and
improvement of environment and for matters connected therewith. This legislation enables the
co-ordination of activities of the various regulatory agencies, setting up of an authority or
authorities with advocate powers for environmental protection etc.
2.4.10 Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989
In 1989, the Central Motor Vehicles Rules introduced nation wide emission levels for both
petrol and diesel driven vehicles. Rule 115(1) requires that every motor vehicle be
manufactured and maintained so that smoke, visible vapours, grits, sparks, ashes, cinders are
not emitted when the vehicle is driven. Emission standards for petrol and diesel vehicles have
been specified by the motor vehicles rules.
2.4.11 The Hazardous Wastes (Management And Handling) Rules, 1989
The Central Government formulated these rules under the Environment (Protection) Act,
1986. Under section 7 of these rules, it is required that the operator or occupier of a facility
dealing with hazardous waste ensures that the hazardous waste is packaged in a suitable
manner for storage and transport and the labeling and packaging shall be easily visible and be
able to withstand physical conditions and climatic factors. Packaging, labeling and transport
of hazardous wastes shall be in accordance with the provisions of the rules issued by the
Central Government under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and other guidelines issued from
time to time. Section 9 of these Rules also requires that in case of an accident during
transportation of hazardous wastes, the operator or occupier of a facility shall immediately
report to the State Pollution Control Board in the prescribed form.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.1   Location and Description of Project Area
Project area selected for by-pass is in Bijapur. The geographical area of Bijapur is 75.36 sq.
Km. The district is situated in the Northern part of the Kamataka State at 585m -595m above
sea level at 160 42' to 160 49' Latitude and 740 40' to 74 50' Longitude. The district is
under Belgaum division. The project area is described in the following paragraph:
The proposed alignment begins from Bijapur - Tikota road (SH - 12) at PWD Km Stone
126.2, west of Bijapur town on link 2A and continues towards southeast on a plain terrain at
an elevation of 620m above MSL, along the existing cart track and curves gradually. This
stretch is of about 2.8 Kms length and further it intersects the project road Bijapur -
Jamkhandi road on link 3A (Chainage 2.8 Km). Then, the alignment continues to follow the
same direction and crosses 'Central Railway' broad gauge line at a distance of 1.9 Km and
traverses for a distance of 300m (1.9 + 0.3 = 2.20 Km) and intersects Bijapur-Bagalkot road -
NH-218 (Chainage-5 Km). Further, the alignment curves easterly direction for about 1.70
Km before terminating at Chainage 103 Km on south-link of NH - 13, south of Bijapur
(Chainage- 6.7 Kni). The total length of the proposed By-pass alignment is about 6.7 Krns
(Map 3.1 and Sketch 3.1). The proposed By-pass alignment passes through lands of Mahal
bagayath and Kasaba Bijapur revenue villages Villages in the project area with their project
chainage are presented in the following table (Table - 3.1).

3.2   Existing Road Condition
The existing road is narrow with poor vision, varying undulations and improper drainage.
Figure - 3.1 shows the present condition of the existing road with starting point, confluence
points and ending point of the proposed by-pass.
3.3   Projected Traffic
A traffic survey conducted during 1999 revealed that around 600 vehicles per day is through
traffic, which will use bypass if constructed. The anticipated traffic growth in the by-pass
route for ten years (2001-2010) is given in Table - 3.1

It is difficult to predict the pollution level from vehicles, since it is not known how the
adoption of new technology vehicles would proceed. It is, however, possible to assess the
future pollution load on the assumption that the old technology vehicle would persist and the
volume of traffic will increase as predicted. The unit load of pollutants from different types
of vehicles have been estimated under the same assumption by the Indian Institute of
Petroleum, which is presented in Table -3.2.
3.4    Design Standards
The adopted Pavement Design standards are according to the current Indian Roads Congress
guidelines (IRC-37:2001). A design life of 20 years has been considered. Paved shoulders are
proposed as per the IRC guidelines.
3.5    Proposed Treatment Alternatives and Elements of Construction
As the proposed by-pass is entirely a new road formation, the new pavement need to be
constructed on a suitable sub-grade. The formation level is fixed based on the field
investigations and on soil properties.
The elements of construction are as follows:
i)   Grub out bushes (some trees may get removed);
ii)  Road formation to 1 2-m width;
pavement layers as per new cross section.
Figure 3.3 shows the typical cross section.

3.5.4 Cross Drainage Structures Construction
New cross drainage structures are proposed based on the project area requirements. The
conventional revetments in the form of pitched grouting and embankment slope stabilisation
methods are being considered where necessary and required based on the height of the new
road embankment.
3.6    Options on Road Construction Materials
3.6.1 Road Construction Materials - Sources
Details of the existing local quarries/borrow pits used for the extraction of rock for crushing,
natural gravel (Moorum), sand and water sources are furnished in Table-3.3.
If the rock is properly selected adequate quality and quantity would be available for all
purposes requiring broken or crushed rock. The reddish brown natural gravel (Moorum) that
has been identified in various sources has a suitable CBR for embanlcnent and subgrade
construction. Sufficient moorum of good quality is easily available for all purposes as filling
materials. Clean river sand sources were identified having fines less than 2.0%, which are
available in good quality, and sufficient quantity for all construction purposes.

Natural Gravel
Moorum and residual gravel are useful for application for sub-base, subgrade and shoulder
material. The bearing strengths of the available materials have been tested.
Sand
Most rivers in Kamataka, especially those with dry beds during the greater part of the year
have spreads of sand, which are collected for making concrete and lime plaster. These sands
get replenished each monsoon and there is little shortage in their availability.
Embankment Fill
Appropriate materials will be drawn from the nearest available location to the construction
site. However, highly plastic black cotton soil (if found) will not be used.
3.6.2 Pavement Design Materials
Materials required and their thickness are presented in the Table - 3.4.

3.8    Options on Intersections on Roads for Upgradation
Two intersections on the project road selected for upgradation were studied. Although there
are two other major intersections with NTHs, they were not proposed to be improved under the
Project. The list is shown in Table - 3.7. Improvement would entail establishment of smooth
gradient into the feeder road from the given main road and widening the paved surface to
allow easy turn for vehicles.

CHAPTER - 4
ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
4.1   Introduction
The constituent road-links of the KSHIP were selected after considering various options
as the work of project fonnulation progressed. The objective of this Chapter is to
highlight some of the salient issues considered for exercising options. The work of
ascertaining feasibility was assigned to the PCC.
4.2   Design Alternatives
The recommended designs are based on the assumption that the available road
construction materials would have a CBR value of 10. Various design altematives
explored are described below.
4.2.1 Route Alternatives
The proposed route in shortest route connects the project roads and does not encounter
any environmental sensitive issues.
4.2.2 Alignment Alternatives
A section of the bypass road follows an existing track which was developed by the local
authorities as part of a Ring Road project. The balance portion of the proposed bypass
road also is identified and hence no other cost effective engineering solution other than
embanknent raising and provision of cross drainage structures could be envisaged.
4.2.3 By-pass Alternatives
By-passes were proposed under KSHIP for some urban settlements to offer better
connectivity and to run smooth traffic.These by-passes are related to two urban
settlements, namely Bijapur (on Links 3A and 2A) and Raichur (on Links IA and IB).
The environmental assessments of these bypasses are covered in separate sections in
respective reports.
4.4   Project alternatives
Three project alternatives were evaluated, They are:
Alternative I: No Project
The option does not involve any action. The highways will remain in the existing state.
No construction activity takes place.
Alternative II:    Road though the town
Involves widening to 4- lane divided carriageway in place of the existing 2-lane highway
through the settlement of Bijapur.

hKarnataka State Highways                           Environniental Assessnment Report -
Improvement Project                                  Bijapur By-pass
Alternative III:   Construction of a by-pass
Involves improvements to the connecting State Highways (Contracts U4 & U7-A), and
construction of a new 2 -laneby-pass for Bijapur settlement on the westem side of the
settlement. The construction activity requires a minimum period of 12 months for
completion.
Alternative I
The section of State Highway 12 (link-2A), State Highway 65 (link-3A), National
Highway 218 and National Highway 13 passing through Bijapur will not be altered. The
carriageway will not be widened. Therefore no construction activity is to take place.
Impacts will be based on increase in the traffic volumes on the existing alignment. It is
assumed that there would be no project.
Alternative II
The option involves widening of the existing carriageway. The cross-section through the
settlement would be 4 lane divided carriageway. In addition to this there would be a
median and sidewalks on both sides. If possible, a parking lane/space would also be
provided. To establish this cross-section in Bijapur, many structures would have to be
displaced. At the same time the traffic speeds and hence the journey time would decrease.
Alternative m
This option would entail construction of a new road around the settlement. The new road
would act as a by-pass for the Bijapur town. The alignment originates well beyond the
town lirits. The by-pass will take off at chainage 126.200Km on the western side of
Bijapur town on link-2A (SH-12, Bijapur - Tikota). It moves in a southeasterly direction
on a plain terrain at an elevation of 620m above MSL, intersect project road link-3A of
corridor 3 (Chainage 1.50Km) at a distance of approximately 2.8Km. It continues to
follow the same direction and crosses 'Central Railway' broad-gauge line at a distance of
1.9Km and traverses for a d istance o f 3 OOm t ill i t m eets NH-218 (Bagalkote road) at
chainage 83.30Km. Alignment further continues to follow plain terrain in easterly
direction for a length of 1.7Km before it terminates at chainage 103.000Km on south-link
of NH- 13 south of B ijapur town. The total I ength o f t he b y-pass alignment i s 6.7Km.
Implementation of this option would lead to the through traffic plying on the by-pass and
only the destined traffic, for Bijapur, using the existing road through the town. The
hindrance caused by the traffic movement, plying through the settlement, would be
offset. At the same time there would be a substantial land acquisition for construction of
the by-pass.
4.5   Detailed Evaluation of Alternative III (By-pass alternative)
During the reconnaissance survey, team consisting of highway engineers and
environmental specialists observed that the extent of town development was more on the
eastem part of Bijapur. To overcome the traffic congestion and to restrict the commercial
vehicular movement through the town, national Highways Department has constructed a
by-pass on eastem side connecting south-link with north-link of NH-13. The NH-13 by-
pass occupies about half the length of the total ring road network. The remaining halve is
divided into two sections. First section of the road connects north-link of NH-13 with

hKarnataka State Highways                           Environmental Assessment Report -
Improvement Project                                  Biyapur By-pass
link-2A (Bijapur to Tikota) on northwest of Bijapur and the second section connects
south-link of NH-13 with link-2A (Bijapur to Tikota).
The main reason for proposing this by-pass in KSHIP is to decongest the town sections
and to provide connectivity to project roads considered under improvement programme.
The Bijapur urban Development Authority (BUDA) has proposed by-pass alignment for
Bijapur in the form of a ring road, which signifies both the sections of road (north-west
part and south-west part) explained earlier. It was observed during the field visit, WBM
(earthen) road is in very bad condition on the north-west part of the town and it is not on
the defined alignment. This alignment intersects MDR (to 'Ittangihal' village) before it
meets NH- 13 and carries very low commercial vehicles traffic. Since this alignment is
partially improved by BUDA, whose inclusion for improvement under this programme is
ignored. The second section of the by-pass alignment on the south-west of Bijapur town
connecting link-2A with south-link of NH - 13 is thus proposed for by-pass. The total
length of the proposed by-pass here is 6.7Km.
Considerable volume of through traffic is benefited from saving an additional travel
length of 2.42km in by-passing the town compared to existing alignment through town.
Delay due to traffic congestion is very much reduced. According to the opinion survey
most of the commercial vehicles prefer to use this alignment. Connectivity to industrial
and commercial areas along the link is very good.
The extent of land acquisition for by-pass (with 30m COI) in west is approximately 38
acres. It was also understood that, the land acquisition for portion of by-pass alignment
from NH-218 to NH-13 (1.70Km) is initiated by BUDA and revenue departments have
handed over the relevant records to the authority.
4.5.1 Natural Environment
The land surrounding the proposed by-pass is agricultural. Any increase in pollution due
to increase in traffic volumes (and resulting impacts on human health) will be offset by
dispersion of pollutants over distance. The pollution levels within the town would
therefore be reduced. The ambient noise levels, based on the same levels of traffic
volume would also reduce in the town.
4.5.2 Social Environment
No residential or business property is being affected by the proposed by-pass alignment.
The by-pass is towards west of the town and passes through dry and irrigated lands. A
few landowners would actually lose their entire parcel of land, and a liberal Entitlement
framework approved by the GoK would compensate them. Implementation of this option
will also help to reduce congestion in the settlement.
4.5.3 Cultural Environment
The by-pass alignment is more than 5-10 km away from the important cultural properties
in Bijapur town and would not have any direct or indirect impact on them. Moreover, it
would redirect all the heavy vehicles away from the dargah, tombs, and temples. Thus,
safety of people as well as the protection of sensitive cultural properties will be ensured.

4.5.4 Critical Areas
This alternative would decrease the probability of accidents. As a 2-lane, congestion-free
highway, vehicular speeds would be high and therefore emissions would be less. The
construction of a by-pass would result in improvement in ambient air quality in the town
and a reduction in noise levels. At the same time, however, the air quality and noise
levels would detenrorate in the area where the by-pass is proposed. The levels of both
these parameters would increase due to traffic travelling through open land.
4.5.5 Sensitivity of Alternative III (By-pass alternative)
Alternative III has the lowest environmental sensitivity. This indicates that the alignment
is likely to cause minimum impacts to the natural, social and cultural environment in the
study area. The salient feature of this alignment is that it is unlikely to cause damage to
any cultural property. In addition to this there is no likelihood of displacement of persons.
All losses will be compensated and assisted through an Entitlement framework developed
by the GoK. This option will help to reduce the congestion through Bijapur town and
traffic through the town will be reduced considerably. Only the traffic destined for the
town will use that road. At present, the ambient air quality levels as well as the noise
levels, within the settlement, are slightly higher than the stipulated standards. The
construction of the by-pass, in all likelihood, will decrease the noise levels and increase
the ambient air quality levels in Bijapur settlement. Also the by-pass will benefit the
vehicular movement. Journey speeds are expected to increase and the traffic movement to
be smooth-faced.
To h ave shortest possible connectivity to two major project links, link-2A (Bijapur to
Tikota on SH 12) and link-3A (Bijapur to Jamakhandi on SH 65) and also to two
National Highways, NH - 218 (Bijapur - Bagalakot Road) and NH - 13 (Kushtagi Road)
the alignment on the west part of Bijapur was found to be most favourable for by-pass
from geographical, engineering, enviromnental and social aspects.

CHAPTER - 5
BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL SET UP
5.1   Physical Features
5.1.1 Geographical Location
The geographical area of Bijapur is 75.36 sq. Km. The district is situated in the Northern
part of the Karnataka State at 585m -595m above sea level at 160 42' to 160 49' Latitude
and 740 40' to 740 50' Longitude. The district is under Belgaum division. The project
road traverses lands of Mahal bagayath and Kasaba Bijapur revenue villages under
Bijapur district.
5.1.2 Physical Resources
The physical resources comprise of the physiography, geology, climate, drainage and soil
characteristics of the study area. These characteristics are described as below:
5.1.2.1 Physiography
The proposed by-pass is located in the northem part of the Karnataka plateau and is also
called northem maidan. The project coridor passes over slightly undulating plain terrain.
5.1.2.2 Geology
The proposed alignments fall under geological formation - Deccan traps with rock type -
basalt and lime stone.
5.1.2.3 Seismicity
The project area falls in zone III. The region is not prone to frequent earthquakes of high
intensity. The zone is normally affected by mild tremors, not causing damage to life or
property.
5.1.2.4 Climate
The project area falls under North interior Karnataka climatic zone. This region
experiences semi-arid, tropical steppe type of climate. The project area is characterised
by hot summers and normal winters. Temperature, Rainfall and Wind Direction for the
project area are given below:
i) Temperature: In the project area, the temperature is hot with a peak of 450C in
summers and low of 10 -15 C in winters. The mean maximum temperature is 32.90 C
and the mean minimum temperature is 20.60 C.
ii) Rainfall: The project area receives maximum rainfall during the southwest monsoon
in the month of July and August. The annual rainfall range is about 542 - 565 mm and
24 - Hour maximum rainfall is with a range of 240 - 280 mm.
iii) Wind Direction: The prevailing wind direction is from south-west. Local topography
and slope largely influence the wind direction. The wind direction shifts to north-east
during evening hours. The nearest IMD station is at Bijapur.

5.1.2.5 Drainage System
The project area is located near the Krishna river basin. The Krishna River would be
source of water for construction. Presently cross drainage structures are provided along
the existing road. But they are found to be insufficient in number and need to be properly
designed. Agricultural and dry lands through which the proposed bypass alignment
passes are not provided with any drainage system.
5.1.2.6 Soil Characteristics
In the project corridor the alignments pass mainly through shallow black soil. The soil is
shallow, well-drained clay loam, severely susceptible to erosion. The clay content varies
from 40 - 60 %. The silt content varies from 10 - 16 %. The sand content varies from 21
- 27 %. The higher propensity of expanding clay fraction, propensity for developing
cracks horizontally or vertically and moisture retentive character makes it unsuitable for
road construction. Therefore, raising of embankments is required almost for entire
stretches. Moorum from approved quarry sites in the region will have to be obtained.
Table - 5.1: Characteristics of the soil in the study area
Soil Type                              Description
Shallow Black Soil                 Shallow, well drained, grey to dark grey and
brown, clay loam to silty clay loam soils, severely
eroded.
5.2    Environmental Monitoring
5.2.1 Ambient Air Quality
Ambient Air Quality Standards: The Central Pollution Control Board has specified the
Parameters to be monitored and their permissible limits in the ambient air depending
upon the location of the proposed project. The various parameters considered for ambient
air quality monitoring are Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Respirable Particulate
Matter (RPM), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Sulphur Dioxide (S02), Carbon Monoxide
(CO), Hydrocarbon (HC) and Lead (Pb) in air. Table - 5.2 lists the standards prescribed
for Ambient Air Quality. Limits have not been prescribed for hydrocarbons in the
ambient atmosphere. These have been used as datum for ascertaining the quality of
ambient air in the project area.

5.2.1.1 Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Locations
The arnbient air quality tests were carried out at selected locations in the project route in
the month of January - February 2003. While selecting the sampling stations due
consideration was given to the traffic density in the area and the commercial activity in
the region. The sampling stations were selected to cover the densely populated semi-
urban and rural areas. Ambient air quality monitoring locations were identified for the
project area. Tests were conducted for ambient air quality - AQ 1 and AQ 2. Details of
the air monitoring locations are given below (Table - 53 and Figure 5.1).

Sampling and Testing Methods: The measurement techniques employed for carrying
out the ambient air quality measurements are outlined below in brief.
Suspended Particulate matter (SPM) and Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM) were
measured using High Volume sampler and Respirable Dust Sampler respectively by
collecting 8 hourly samples for 72 hours. The RPM was collected on EPM 2000 Filter
paper.
Sulphur Dioxide was measured by employing the method prescribed in IS: 5182 Part II,
Method II (Improved West and Gaeke method) and 8 Hourly samples were collected for
72 hours. SO2 is absorbed in Sodium tetrachloromercurate. The absorbed SO2 is
estimated by colour produced when pararosaniline-HCL is added to the solution.
Absorption is measured in a spectrophotometer and compared with calibration curve.
Oxides of Nitrogen were measured by employing the method prescribed in IS: 5182
(Jacob and Hochheiser modified method). 8 hourly samples were collected for 72 hours.
Ambient air is bubbled through NaOH solution to form stable Sodium nitrite. Nitrite
produced is determined colorimetrically with phosphoric acid, sulphanilamide and NEDA
reagent.
Carbon Monoxide was measured as per IS: 5182 Part X. Ambient air sample was
collected in a sealed rubber bladder fitted with an air valve. Subsequent analysis is done
at laboratory using Gas Chromatography technique.
Lead in air was analysed by collecting the sample in EPM 2000 Filter paper. The filter
paper containing particulate is leached in nitric acid and filtered. The solution is made to
a known volume and aspirated in to the air/acetylene flame. The standard solution is
prepared in a similar manner and readings are taken at 217 nm.
Hydrocarbon was analysed as per IS:5182 Part X. Ambient air sample was collected in a
sealed rubber bladder fitted with an air valve. Subsequent analysis was done in the
laboratory using Gas Chromatography Technique.
5.2.1.2 Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Result
The ambient air quality results of monitoring locations are listed in the Table - 5.4 given
below. The major findings are briefly noted as follows.
Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM): The SPM level in all the monitoring locations is
well beyond the limits specified for residential, rural and other areas i.e. 200 gg/m3. Slow
movement of traffic and pedestrian traffic dust entrainment due to the damaged condition
of the carriageway and broken a nd degraded e arthen s houlders a lso c ontribute t o h igh
SPM concentration. Localised wind pattem and velocity and drifting nature of the soil
also contribute to the high levels of SPM in the area.
Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM): The data shows that the level is within the
prescribed limits of 100 gg/m3.

All parameters are well within the standard limit except suspended particulate matter.
The suspended particulate matter exceeds the prescribed limit. This is because of narrow
road condition with broken shoulders and vehicular movement on these roads expels dust
particles into the atmosphere.

5.2.2 Ambient Noise Quality
To determine the existing Ambient Noise level in the study area extensive noise level
measurement were carried out as per the guidelines of the CPCB and the requirements of
the MoEF. The methodology adopted for the sampling and monitoring and various other
parameters in selection of the monitoring stations are discussed in the subsequent
sections. The discussion begins with an introduction to the prescribed standards of the
CPCB with respect to Ambient Noise level measurement.
Ambient Noise level Standards: The measurements should yield hourly averages during
day-time (0600 to 2100 hrs.) and night-time (2100 to 0600 hrs.) over 24-hours on two
days interspersed by a two-day interval in a given week. These are shown in Table - 5.5.
These were used as datum to ascertain the quality of ambient noise in the project area.

abovw-mentioned categories by the competent authority and the corresponding standards shall apply
5.2.2.1 Ambient Noise Quality Monitoring Locations
The Noise level measurements were carried out at select locations in the routes in the
month of January 2003. The sampling stations were selected considering the location of
sensitive areas and receptors like residential areas and educational institutions. Due
consideration was given to the traffic density in the area and the commercial activity in
the region. The Sampling Stations w ere s elected t o c over t he d ensely p opulated s emi-
urban and rural areas. Identified noise quality monitoring locations (NQ 1 and NQ 2) for
the project area are described in Table - 5.3. Figure - 5.2 shows noise monitoring
locations.
Measurement Technique: Portable sound level meters with a built in capacitance
microphone were utilised for measuring the ambient noise level in the location. The
measurements were recorded every 5 minute interval and the equivalent sound pressure
level were calculated for 8 hour cycles for 72 hours. The eight-hour cycles were devised
based upon the day and nighttime duration and the movement of traffic during the course
of the day. The three cycles considered are from 0600-1400 Hours, 1400-2200 Hours and
2200-0600 H ours. T hree c ycles w ere m erged i nto t wo p eriods - daytime (6 a.m. to 9
p.m.) and nighttime (9 p.m. to 6 a.m.). The results are shown in dB (A) Leq i.e. indicating
the equivalent sound pressure level in the area.

5.2.2.2 Ambient Noise Quality Results
Higher noise levels were recorded during day time and evening hours. Lower noise levels
were recorded during night-time. The ambient noise level was found to be high during
daytime due to the commercial activities and the traffic with vehicles blaring their homs.
Lack of land use control, poor town planning and lax implementation of noise nuisance
control laws, by the enforcing agencies, have also resulted in congestion and unwanted
noise nuisance. The results of the noise quality tests are concentrated in the following
table (Table - 5.6).

5.2.3 Water Quality
Water bodies or any other water sources were not found along the proposed by-pass
alignment. No settlements were observed during the survey. Only a new layout is coming
in the area but hand pumps or tube wells or water supply connection is not yet provided.
5.3   Ecological Resources
5.3.1 Flora
The e cological d iversity/ b io-diversity i s v ery p oor a s t he p roposed b y-pass a lignment
passes through mainly dry land and agricultural land. Only a few trees (3 small trees > 30
cms and 1 tree > 60 cms) w ere recorded along the proposed by-pass alignment. They
belong to the species of Acacia and Azadirachta.
5.3.2 Fauna
In the project area the fauna represented is mainly by domestic mammals like cattle,
goats, sheep and dogs. A nimals like sparrows, owls, crows, kites and parakeets under
avian population and rats, snakes, cobras and land monitors under reptiles constitute other
fauna. No wild life is seen in project area. The project road does not pass through any
sensitive area or wildlife sanctuaries.
5.4   Key Environmental Issues of Bijapur By-pass
The following are the key environmental issues of Bijapur By-pass alignment:
*  Air quality in the project area is within the standard limits except SPM (Suspended
Particulate Matter). Air pollutants and noise levels are high only at road junctions.
* No open wells or tube wells are found along the alignment.
* Few cross drainage structures - culverts are identified.
*  The alignment passes through only dry land and agricultural lands.  .
*  No settlements ar-found along the. alignment except two new layouts forthcoming.
* One temple is located about 200-300ms from the alignment but outside ROW.

*  Two rehabilitation centres are found one each on either side of the alignment away
from ROW (more than 500m) at chainage Km 1.8.
*  Municipal water supply, hand pumps and bore wells are common sources of drinking
water supply. But water bodies, hand pumps or bore wells are not found along the
corridor.
*  No tree plantation is observed along the project road except two avenue trees. S o,
proper landscaping with arboricultural plans will be adopted.
* No natural forest area is involved in this project. No significant impact on ecological
resources is foreseen.
*  There are no rare and endangered animal or plant species on either side of the project
road within or outside ROW.
*  There are no Wildlife/Bird Sanctuaries, National Parks, Zoos, Wetlands, Marshy
land, and Breeding/Nesting sites on either side of the project road within or outside
ROW.
*  There are no archaeologically important monuments, art and cultural sites on either
side of the project road within or outside ROW. But the great tourist attraction point
is the famous Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur.
* _-There are no commercial/industrial units existing along the road alignment.
* There are no specified dumpsites along the project road. Least mitigation measures
may be required in enviromnental engineering design.

5.6   Social Environment
Many of the major changes in the environmental set up have been induced by society.
Some of these have arrested deterioration in the ecological systems. Some made the
system increasingly vulnerable. All impulses in this regard originated from within the
emerging social systems. This has been true as much in Karnataka as in all other places
of the world.
Propensities in this regard have, however, been different between the societies, governed
as these are by their respective demography, literacy economic occupations and basic
amenities. All these features of the social environment of the study area have been
described in the following sections.
5.6.1 Demographic Profile
No settlements were found along the project area. The demographic features of Bijapur
are depicted in the following paragraphs.
5.6.1.1 Population Study

5.6.1.4 Amenities
Bijapur town is adequately served by the basic amenities like educational institutions.
The number and hierarchy of the amenities are in consonance with the size of the
settlement in the study area. The town is provided with all essential facilities like
education, medical facilities, Post and Telegraphic Centres, public telephone booths,
police station, fire station, bus stops and drinking water sources. But ground water quality
is not suitable for drinking purpose. Therefore, people are dependent on public water
supplies and hand pumps for the drinking water. At present water problem exists in the
town because of insufficient supply municipal water. The town in the study area is
accessible by bus. Amenities available for people in Bijapur area are listed in the

5.7    Economic Profile of the Region
Urban outgrowths are projecting higher as there is linear extension of existing area along
the route. The people are transfonning themselves by using the urban facilities and by
participating in the urbanising social process.
5.7.1 Major Functions of the district - Bijapur
The district plays a major role in the development of the region. It acts as a collection
point of diverse commodities raised in different parts of the surrounding tracts and the
taluks. Processing of the same materials take place in this district and the finished goods
are exported to different centres of consumption. The point to note is that the functions of
this district are intimately related to, but not exclusively determined by the economy of
the immediate neighbourhood. The Table - 5.14 lists the major functions of the towns in
the route.

Agriculture being the major occupation in most of the roads, it is useful to know about
the crop arrivals in these towns. Various crop arrival in the district is presented in Table -
5. 15. This is an indicative of the economy of the service area of the district.

5.7.2 Places of Tourist and Archaeological interest
The world famous Gol Gumbaz, Ibrahim Rauza and Baarah Kamaan are of major tourist
attraction and are located very near to the project area. These monuments are at a distance
of 2 Km from the project route. None of these monuments /sites will be directly impacted
up on due to the proposed project. On the whole, developing this by-pass road will
greatly benefit the tourist circuits in Kamataka, as the by-pass serves as connector to
important tourist spots and places of cultural and historical interest (Table - 5.16).
Tourist strength is given in the following Table - 5.17.

5.8   Utilities and Structures along the Project Area
5.8.1 Regional and Local Utilities along the Project Routes
A variety of regional utilities like Telephone poles, Optical F ibre C ables, and E lectric
Poles, Telephone boxes transformers etc fall within the ROW. Except water lines none of
the utilities serving local needs like lampposts, hand pumps, water taps and bore wells do
not fall within the ROW. Road widening will involve removal and relocation of very few
of these utilities. The total number of such utilities falling within the Project Corridor of
Impact (COI) is listed in the Tables - 5.18.

5.8.2 Religious and other Sensitive Structures along the Project Routes
Religious and other sensitive structures were not at all met along the project route.
5.9   Public Health
No major diseases in the form of pulmonary and respiratory trouble due to vehicular
pollution and traffic movement have been observed. The common diseases seen in the
area are cases of common cold, influenza, diarrhea, typhoid, dysentery and other gastro-
intestinal disorders. Nutrition related problems and ailments due to old age and infirmity
are also observed in the study area. It should be emphasised that sanitary facility is
partially provided in the district.
5.10 Accident Hazards and Safety
In the area of intersection of by-pass with link 2A, 3A, NH 218 and NH 13, the existing
road is only a single lane and moreover congestion has resulted in reducing the
carriageway width. Acute-angle intersections, lack of proper road signage and dumping
of leftover construction material are common sights on the roads. Improper storage o f
construction material also poses a major threat to the road users and cause accidentt-
Lack of proper bus-bays and parking facilities also pose a major obstacle to the smooth
flow of traffic in urban and rural areas. The existing bus stops are also not properly
constructed at proper locations keeping in mind the terrain and curve of the road.
5.11  Aesthetics
The project by-pass lacks the aesthetic quality at present. The avenue plantation would be
provided which adds to the aesthetic wealth of the project road.

CHAPTER- 6
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) AND MITIGATION
MEASURES
6.1   Introduction
Roads may cause negative impacts upon environment in many different ways. The
objective of this chapter is to discern those negative impacts that are contextually
possible in the project under consideration and to suggest the required mitigation
measures. Care has been taken also to identify the prospects of positive impacts and of
the measures that are likely to enhance the quality of the given environment.
Road development projects generally cause impacts in four specific situations. These are
Impacts from Location,
Impacts from Project Design,
Impacts during Construction Phase and
Impacts during Operation Phase.
6.2   Impacts from Location
The objective of KSHIP is to improve several existing road links, which are distributed
across the State of Kamnataka The major features of social action influencing the
alterations in the hydrological regimes appear to suggest the following specific processes:
Improper practices in the command areas of gravity flow irrigation,
Large Reservoirs behind dams,
Extensive deforestation,
Improper road drainage systems and
Effects of growing Mining Economy
6.2.1 Impacts of Gravity Flow Irrigation Systems
All major command areas of Kamataka, as in many other places of India, function
through uncontrolled delivery of water without laying proper drainage facilities. This
leads to the rise of ground water table above the level of the sub-grades that was assumed
in the original road design. In some extreme cases, the excess water from the nearby
agricultural fields overflows across the roads. Both these situations cause damage to the
road-pavements on account of damaged sub-grades.
The present project alignment has no such problems because the new alignment passes
through dry land.
6.2.2 Large Reservoirs behind Dams
No reservoirs were found near the project alignment. Therefore there would be no
overflow of backwater of the reservoir and no effect on cross drainage structures in
future.

Improvement Project                                 Byapur By-pass
6.2.3 Consequences of deforestation
The project alignment passes through dry land wherein very few trees (only 4 in number)
were noticed. These trees belong to local species such as Acacia and Azadirachtha.
Therefore the impact on trees will be negligible. However, the PWD has envisaged a
comprehensive tree plantation programme along the road and has also made budgetary
allocation for taking up afforestation programme in the degraded area in the vicinity of
the project corridor in due consultation and participation of the State Forest Department.
The present tree afforestation programme involves planting 200 trees per km. 100 trees
are to be planted per km on each side of the road with a spacing of 10 m between each
tree. Local and indigenous tree species like Azadirachta indica, Tamarindus indica,
Mangifera indica, Acacia nilotica, Acacia auriculiformis, Albizia lebek, Ficus spp., are
grown in the Forest Department Nurseries. Fast growing species like Gliricidia sepium,
Dalbergia sissoo, etc., are also being raised in the Forest nurseries. Indigenous and
endemic species like Prosopis juliflora, Euphorbia tirucalli, Justica adhadota,
Caesalpinia bonduc and Bougainvillea sp. can be planted adjacent to the tree line.
Adequate budgetary allocation has been made for the plantation and subsequent
maintenance of the plantations in the EMP budget. Plantations of tall flowery trees in the
rotary of major intersections will also be undertaken for increasing the aesthetics of the
surrounding area.
6.2.4 Improper Road Drainage System
A portion of the project alignment is the existing one with a few (8 in number) cross-
drainage structures. Further the proposed project alignment passes through dry land. The
present cross-drainage structures require minor maintenance. Based on the requirement
proper drainage structures will be proposed at required places along the alignment.
It is important to note that nearly all parts of Karnataka are windy and suffer from aeolian
erosion, especially during dry weather months. Regular grubbing and dressing of earthen
shoulders of the new pavement to establish and maintain a gentle slope away from the
carriageway can be an effective mitigation measure.
6.2.5 Effects of Growing Mining Economy
The project alignment is away from mining areas. Hence, dispersal of suspended
particulate matter from loaded vehicles is less. The carriage vehicles often transport
materials other than mining materials.
Specific mitigation measures in terms of road fumiture have also been proposed in the
engineering design. The PWD could interact with the Police department and carry out
random checks during the operation phase to prevent over loaded vehicles from plying on
the roads.
6.3   Impacts from Road Designs
The design criteria for roads under upgradation have been noted in Chapter-3 of this
report. Diverse types of impacts that can arise on account of implementing the proposed
design are as follows:

Impact on people due to land acquisition and displacement
Impacts on Regional and Local Utilities
Impacts on Local Religious Structures
Impacts on Other Community Assets
Impacts on Avenue Trees
Impacts from the Choice of Construction Materials
Accidents and Road Safety
Detailed explanations on all such impacts are noted below.
6.3.1 Impacts from Altered Design
Various types of alterations of the road designs and improvements upon many
components of the existing road have been suggested in the Final Design of the project
routes. The magnitude of alteration with reference to Road Over-Bridge (ROB) was
considered. No other alterations are required. But instead of Over Bridge level crossing
may be provided at the juncture of by-pass alignment with the railway line. The required
mitigation measure is to implement it in the design with utmost care during construction
phase.
6.3.2 Impacts from Diversion from Current Use of Land
In order to implement the altered road design, some land is to be acquired. This will
cause diversion of land from current use. The required mitigation measure is to follow the
land acquisition procedure as per land acquisition Act (1894) detailed out in Chapter 2
and to implement the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) according to the State's policy on
entitlement. The details on both these issues have been presented in a separate report on
Resettlement Action Plan.
The land acquisition involved is about 38 acres of land belong to private owners,
requiring acquisition. The details of land acquisition, ownership and land use are covered
,in-he Phase II addendum to the Resettlement Action Plan.
\\6.33  mpact on people due to land acquisition and displacement
l'brchconstruction of new road private lands in the forn of agricultural lands are getting
affected and will be acquired as per the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. A comprehensive
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R & R) policy has been formulated, presented in a
separate v olume, d etailing t he b enefits t o b e e xtended t o t he P roject Affected Persons

6.3.4 Impacts on Regional and Local utilities
A variety of regional utilities serving the local populace needs are currently placed within
the ROW. The details of these utilities that are falling in the Corridor of Impact are
presented in Table - 5.21.
The required mitigation measure would be to instruct the relevant authorities of local
utilities in advance to shift those before construction starts to avoid disruption of regional
services. It is the responsibility of the PWD to make the required land available to the
contractor free of all encumbrances before construction begins.
6.3.5 Impacts on Local Religious Structures
There are no religious structures located within the ROW.
6.3.6 Impacts on Other Community Assets
No community assets like parts of land of Colleges or Schools or Bus Stands were found
within or outside the ROW of the project alignment.
6.3.7 Impacts on Avenue Trees
On account of the developmental some trees existing within ROW (30m) would
unavoidably be felled. The magnitude of such unpacts is discernible fiom Table - 6.1. It
appears that totally 4 trees are to be felled. The trees that are located in the Corridor of
Impact (COI) are the only ones that are to be felled. The felling of these trees is
inevitable.
Table - 6.1: Magnitude of impact on Trees along the by-pass alignment
(Magnitude indicated in Numbers)

>30-60    >60- 90   >90-120 I >120-150 I >150             cut
3         1         0           0        0              4
Note: For cutting (including removal of stumps and roots) of trees the girth above 30 cm have been considered and
measured in terms of number according to size given below:
i) Above 30 cm to 60 cm; ii) Above 60 cm to 90 cm; iii) Above 90 cm to 120 cm; iv) Above 120 cm to 150 cm; v) Above
150 cm. The girth of the tree has been measured at a height of I m above the ground level.
In the stretch along the by-pass road trees were in sparse distribution. A few trees
recorded along the project area belong to the species of Acacia ferruginea and
Azadirachta indica.
No cost effective engineering solution other than embankment raising and cross drainage
structures could be envisaged as this option has been suggested in low lying area that are
often prone to inundation during monsoons and due to uncontrolled discharge of
lmgation waters.
The required mitigation measures are many indeed. The permission to fell trees would
have to be obtained from the designated authority. Then nurseries will have to be
established with the help of the Department of Forest. Simultaneously appropriate
institutions will have to be entrusted with the job of replanting of avenue trees as per the
rules of the MoEF and for their subsequent maintenance. The procedure has been fully

Improvement Project                                 Byapur By-pass
stated in Chapter 2. The views expressed by the local people during Public Consultation
(see Chapter 7) should be noted in this regard. The involvement of the village populace
and the village panchayats in the plantation programme will be an added advantage.
As recommended by the MoEF, the most effective species to absorb the various elements
of traffic related pollutants are, Azadirachta indica (Bevu or Neem), Tamarindus indica
(Hunsemara or Tamarind), Ficus benghalensis (Aladamara or Banyan), Terminalia
chebula (Hallalemara or Arjun) and Dalbergia sissoo (White Beete or Shisham). All
these species were found to be the major constituents of the existing avenue plantations.
These are also the preferred species in the avenue-plantations by the Kamataka Forest
Department. The Forest Department is also planting Acacia auriculiformis (prevents soil
erosion & provides fuel-wood), Albizia lebek & Albizia amara (shade giving ornamental
trees) and Mangifera indica (fruit bearing tree) along the roadsides.
The PWD is also considering planting Justica Adhadota (Adasala or Adusoge), Jatropha
tanjorensis (Gavadal or Bettada haralu), Caesalpinia bonduc (Gajaga), Prosopis juliflora,
Euphorbia tirucalli and Bougainvillaea sp. as the second tier. All these species are used
as live hedges in the villages and are well adapted to dry conditions.
The programme of planting avenue trees will be taken up imnmediately after the
Construction phase with the participation of the State Forest Department.
6.3.8 Impacts from the Choice of Construction Materials
The thickness of the different components of the road-formation would under go
modifications in tune with the bearing strengths of the available materials. Since the
nature of available materials would vary between regions, the total thickness of the
formations is likely to vary between the locations of the project roads. However, careful
supervision is warranted while using the diverse materials. In this regard, three
observations noted below may appear pertinent. All related to the choice of materials.
Gravel & Borrow Pit
In the first instance, one should note that soil with gravel (moorum) occur extensively
over nearly all parts of Kamataka, but is generally associated with rather high clay
fractions. Proper homogenisation with sand would add to the stability of the road
embankments. Connected to this situation is the location of borrow-materials. Borrow
pits are generally located along the road corridors. Water accumulates in these pits during
the rainy season, which in tum can act as disease vectors. Proper reclamation of the pits
would be environmentally desirable. The locations of the borrow material, gravel and
sand are listed in Table-3.5 of Chapter 3.
Use of Altemative Materials
The use of excavated materials from the damaged roads is a good idea. But it would not
be p ossible t o r e-use t he b itumen-contaminated m aterials from excavation. Bitumen is
known to release phenol. Dumping of such material anywhere and every where i s not
permissible under the CPCB Rules. Hence their disposal should be made in clay-lined
pits of abandoned stone quarries or can be re-used in rural areas.

Mines
All the mines and quarries to be used for obtaining construction materials for the project
roads are licensed units. Due to increased production, some negative impacts can be
apprehended. However, it would be appropriate to inform the Kamataka State Pollution
Control Board (KSPCB) about the specific mines used for obtaining construction
materials, since these are in their purview. Decision should also be taken in consultation
with t he K SPCB o n t he p roposed I ocation o f s tone c rushers. If the stone crushers get
located near the construction site, then adequate measures must be taken to control dust
pollution and noise level. The contractors should also purchase the construction materials
from licensed quarries only. In case new mines are to be utilised by the contractor proper
clearance and licenses should be obtained from the Karnataka State Pollution Control
Board and the Department of Mines and Geology respectively. The quarries and mines
are listed in Table 3-5 of Chapter 3 of this Report.
6.3.9 Accidents and Road Safety
The traffic studies have identified areas with heavy traffic intensity and acute-angle
intersections, which require junction improvements and widening of roads in congested
stretches. The road improvement plan has suggested improvement of junction points and
improvements in the vertical profile. Sound construction management practices and
traffic management plans have been fornulated for implementation during the
construction phase. Road markers, safety appurtenances and safety signage in
construction area and advance warning signs have been included in the construction
management aspects. For smooth traffic movement and safety during operation phase, the
provision o f speed breakers and raised reflective pavement markers (RPM) have been
included in the designs.
6.4   Impacts during Construction
Several types of negative impacts upon environment may happen during construction of
roads, primarily due to negligent practices. Responsible supervision is needed to
avoid/minimise and to mitigate such adversities. The contexts of such impacts are as
listed below. Each of these requires specific mitigation measures.
Impact on Land Resources
Impact on Soil Quality
Impact on Water Resources
Impact on Water Quality
Impact on Air Quality
Impact on Noise Level
Impact on Biological Environment
Impacts from Sanitation and Waste disposal, and other impacts
6.4.1 Impact on Land Resources
Land requirement to establish site office, construction-labour camp and also for borrow
pits is covered in Phase II EIA. Here, use of the instruments of land acquisition would be
unavoidable. Complete reinstatement of the original condition after removal of borrow
materials will not be possible. However, dressing the sides of the borrow pit to create a

slope consistent with the level of the adjoining land would be better than leaving the
hollow altogether unattended. The ground water level being high in the project route the
utilisation of these pits for water harvesting and ground water recharge is very much
limited. As a supplementary action, the local villagers may be encouraged, through public
consultation, to use these pits for compost making.
6.4.2 Impact on Soil Quality
Soils of eastern and northem Kamataka plateau are prone to erosion due to their
characteristics. Periodic maintenance of the drains is the required mitigation measure. In
the areas prone to soil erosion, clearing and grubbing, excavation, borrow and fill
operations shall be limited to the extent practicable.
The mitigation measures to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation include:
Designated storage sites for fill material and adequate stockpiling to prevent erosion and
runoff related problems.
Construction of temporary sediment basins, slope drains and use of temporary mulches,
fabrics or other control devices or methods necessary to control erosion and
sedimentation.
Cut and fill slopes shall be seeded and turfed as required depending upon the site
condition and design requirements.
Embankment stabilisation will be undertaken as specified in the contract clause by
prudent selection of fill material to prevent erosion.
The embankment slopes will be vegetated with native seed mix to prevent soil erosion.
Good construction practices coupled with responsible supervision and with the
implementation of mitigation measures explained above will reduce soil erosion and run
off during monsoon and unexpected showers.
Construction activities for culverts and bridges should be limited to dry seasons.
6.4.3 Impact on Water Resources
There are no water bodies or hand pumps along the project alignment. However, during
construction/rehabilitation o f c ross d rainage s tructures care s hould b e t aken to prevent
ground water pollution. Proper management of excavation materials, construction debris,
site wastes and run off is required to protect the environment.
6.4.4 Impact on Water Quality
No permanent impact is anticipated on ground water quality due to the project. Some of
the important measures to be considered include:
All water and other liquid wastes arising from construction activities will be properly
disposed off.
Littering or unauthorised discharge will not be permitted.
Permission of the engineer and the concemed regulatory authorities will be obtained for
disposal of the wastes at the designated disposal point.
The drains will be kept free from any dumping of solid wastes and earth material.
Details of temporary drainage system (including all surface channels, sediment traps,
washing basins and discharge pits) will be submitted for approval prior to commencing of
construction works.

Karnataka State Highways                           Environmental Assessment Report -
Improvement Project                                Bijapur By-pass
6.4.5 Impact on Air Quality
Moderate air quality impacts during the construction phase of the project can be
anticipated due to the uses of construction machinery and fugitive dust generation in and
around the construction site due to vehicular movement and handling of materials. It has
been noted in that the SPM and RPM levels are generally high in Karnataka and well
beyond the prescribed limits in the project area. Unauthorised entry of vehicles into the
construction site is of particular concern in the urban areas during construction. The
required mitigation measures are given below.
Asphalt and hot mix plants and stone crusher plants should be located at least 500-metres
away from inhabited urban and rural settlements. These units should be located in
downwind direction to the nearby settlements. Guidelines issued by the State Pollution
Control Board on establishment of Stone Crusher Units would be adhered to.
Trucks carrying earth, sand or stone should be covered with tarpaulin or canvas sheets to
avoid spilling,
Fugitive dust should be controlled by sprinkling water, and
Regular maintenance of machinery and equipment should be carried out.
Designated storage area for construction material like gravel, blue metal, earth and sand
should be demarcated to ensure safe and accident free utilisation of raw material.
Diligent supervision by the PIU and the Supervision consultant should be carried out to
ensure implementation of suggested measures and rectify lapses of the contractor.
A green belt would be developed around the Plant site.
6.4.6 Impact on Noise Level
Temporary impacts in the inmiediate vicinity of the project may occur due to
constnuction. The magnitude of impact will depend upon the specific types of equipment
used and on the construction methods employed. Care should be taken to reduce such
impacts.
Based upon previous studies and measurements, the construction equipment appears as a
point source of such negative impacts. With source strength of 95 dB (A) at a reference
distance of 2m, the noise produced should not exceed 45 dB (A) beyond a distance of
250m, the drop off rate being 6 dB (A) for doubling the receptor distance from a point
source. In view of this, the construction equipment will be located at least 250m away
from inhabited areas. These units would be located in downwind direction to the nearby
settlements. Guidelines issued by the State Pollution Control Board on establishment of
Stone Crusher Units would be adhered to. This would be the essential mitigation
measure.
In addition, one should note that the workers near construction equipment are likely to be
exposed to an equivalent noise level of 80 to 95 dB (A) in an 8-hour shift. The generated
noise may affect workers. They would require protection devices like earplugs.
Other ancillary mitigation measures are source-control and scheduling of construction
activities. Source-control means that all equipment will be maintained in good condition,
properly designed engine enclosures and intake silencers will be employed. Scheduling of

project activities means that all operations will be scheduled to coincide with periods
when people would be least affected. Construction activities will be strictly prohibited
between 10 P.M and 6 A.M. near the residential areas.
6.4.7 Impact on Biological Environment
No i mpacts t o t hreatened o r e ndangered p lant and animal s pecies are anticipated. The
temporary impact may be in the visual appearance of the trees and shrubs as construction
activity may lead to deposition of dust over the leaves and foliage. This is limited to the
construction period and gets washed away with the first monsoon showers. In addition
regular watering will arrest entrainment of dust during construction period in the
construction site and crusher plants. Nevertheless, actions specified under Sub-section
6.4.5 and 6.4.6 above must be strictly followed.
6.4.8 Impacts from Sanitation and Waste disposal
Sewage and domestic solid waste generated at the construction workers colony shall be
properly disposed off. Improper management of these solid wastes may lead to health and
hygiene related problems. The applicable PWD specifications for labour camp
development for type A (shown in Part II Annexures) construction will ensure that
adequate sanitation at the workers' colony is maintained. The basic mitigation measures
are:
The contractor shall install adequate lavatories at the construction camp to cater to the
requirements of the workers.
The contractor at the campsites shall build Septic Tanks.
Proper collection system for domestic refuse from the campsite and its segregation and
disposal will be ensured.
Periodic health check-ups of construction workers will be undertaken.
Other impacts
Some short-term impacts may happen during the construction phase. The locations and
contexts of such impacts are:
Site office and labour camps - Temporary impacts may occur due to the construction of
site offices and labour camps.
The following impacts are envisaged:
Land acquisition and
Destruction of vegetation
These impacts are likely to be marginal
6.4.9 Equipment Storage and machinery maintenance
The site area should have a proper maintenance shed for the regular maintenance of the
construction vehicles and the waste emanating from the maintenance shed should not be
allowed into any water body. The oil and Grease change of the equipment and vehicles
should be carried out in the service area designed for the vehicles and the wastes should
be collected in containers and bins before selling them off. Proper sand beds should be
developed to prevent the flow of oily wastes. The tar-coated drums should be properly
stored in the site area and can be used for demarcating the diversions during construction

phase with proper fluorescent markers. The drums can be used for storing water for
construction purposes. Under no circumstances uncleaned drums should be used for
storing drinking water.
6.4.10 Traffic Management and Safety aspects
Suitable traffic management system will be devised and finalised with the concurrence of
the Police Department. Assistance of the Police Department would be necessary to
regulate traffic. Road markers, safety appurtenances and safety signage will be displayed
along the construction area and advance warning signs will be established to forewarn the
traffic about the construction site. The traffic management includes sufficient safety
measures in terms of advance warning to the road-users, clear demarcation for movement
of vehicles and traffic control devices to guide the drivers and improve their behaviour
through construction and maintenance zones. The details of Traffic Management Plan
during construction are covered in Chapter 3, Section 3.13 of the Detailed Engineering
Design Report.
6.4.11 Employment Opportunities
The construction activity can provide opportunities to the residents of the neighbouring
area to earn. They may come to provide labour or to service the construction camps. It is
necessary to ensure that the persons after completion of construction works return back to
their homes and not set up squatter colonies.
6.5   Impacts during Operation Phase
The operation phase impacts mainly arise due to vehicular movements. These can be
grouped as follows
Impact on Land Use,
hnpact on Air Quality,
Impact on Noise level,
Impact on Biological Resources,
Accident Hazards and Safety and
Aesthetics
6.5.1 Impact on Land Use
The land use pattern may experience some changes on the roadside like the coming of
commercial ostablishments and other road induced developments. The local statutory
bodies will strictly enforce land use control measures to regulate development of
commercial, residential and industrial infrastructure. Development of squatter settlements
on the slopes of the embankments and on vacant areas of the acquired ROW will be
prevented and monitored.
6.5.2 Impact on Air Quality
Road upgradation/improvement will lead to better road surface and wider area for traffic
movement. This would ensure smooth flow of traffic. However, increase in vehicular
traffic is assumed in the very design for road upgrading. Consequent rise in the level of
vehicular emission as well as of noise is only to be expected on this road segments in
future. Creating a vegetation screen along the roadside having a two-tier arrangement will

absorb pollutants and arrest dust entrainment. The details of Avenue Plantations have
been presented in Sub-section 6.3.7 above. At the operation phase maintenance of avenue
plantation would be necessary. In addition to this, periodic air quality monitoring is also
to be carried out in the Operation Phase to identify the locations where air quality may be
getting affected for causes due to road improvement and others extemal to it.
Other measures on reducing impacts on air quality would be
Phasing out of old vehicles,
Promote increasing use of fuel-efficient engines,
Promote use of catalytic converters for petrol vehicles,
Promote use of Natural Gas in cars,
Promote use of smoke traps for diesel vehicles and
Prevent Debris and Municipal Waste Disposal and burning by roadside
It may be noted that increased traffic speed will reduce localised concentration of
pollutants and result in faster dispersion of the pollutants.

Based on these factors, the current loads of vehicular pollution as well as those expected
in 2008 have been estimated in Table - 6.3. Though there is an observable increase in the
pollution load in 2008 when compared to 2000 figures yet it is very low and below the
prescribed limits.

6.5.3 Impact on Noise level
Increase in noise level is anticipated due to increase in traffic movement. The impacted
areas are basically the towns and the other places having a semi-urban profile and which
function as major market centres and where inter-modal transfer of commodities is

involved. Proper traffic management and legal measures can easily control the unwanted
increase in the noise level.
Avenue plantations would dampen traffic-related noise. Intermix of vegetation consisting
of local shrubs and trees will be raised along the project alignment.
6.5.4 Impact on Ecological Resources
The roadside plantation, once undertaken, will greatly enhance the aesthetics of the road
and also function as a pollution arrester and prevent surface runoff in stretches prone to
soil erosion. It needs mention that no negative impact is anticipated on forest vegetation
and the fauna during operation phase.
The villagers can be involved in maintaining the shrubs that has been suggested as the
second tier plantation and in turn they can source their fuel wood from these plantations
by pruning the branches of the shrubs. The only precaution that has to be exercised is that
the shrubs are not uprooted to meet the fuel wood needs. This is one way of preventing
the villagers from indiscriminate felling of the trees and other vegetation for fuel.
6.5.5 Accident Hazards and Safety
Dunng the operation phase, accident hazards will be greatly reduced and the new road
will ensure smooth and fast flow of traffic. The event that could pose potential
environmental risk is the accident of vehicles carrying hazardous cargo. At present most
of the ve-nicles carrying such cargo use the Nationtal Highways. With better connectivity,
some of the vehicles may use the state highways.
Spillage of hazardous chemicals and subsequent run off into a water body may have
adverse environmental impact. To handle such problems, the area of spillage should be
immediately cordoned off and be made off limits to the public. Run off of the chemical
into any water body shall be prevented. Side drainage channels and collection sumps at
the landfall points need to be provided for collection and safe removal of hazardous
materials. Emergency response mechanism should be evolved to tackle accidents and
spillage of hazardous nature. Effective collaboration will be established with the PWD
National Highway Division's wing dealing with emergency response to evolve a spill
management capability.
In addition, to reduce accidents and enhance safety, PIU has carried out safety audits on
all project roads. The results of the safety audits will be incorporated in the road design
and in placing road furniture. As part of the Institutional Development Strategy, the
project also plans to carry out:
Black spot improvement study on the project and other non-project roads;
Extend the computerised accident analysis system (currently in use in Bangalore and
other cities) to the rest of the State roads and
Train the PWD, Police and other safety staff on accident investigation and analysis
techniques. The outcome would be incorporated in the implementation of the project and
form the basis of on-going institutional and capacity development component.

6.5.6 Aesthetics
The roadside plantation, in addition to functioning as pollution screens, will add to the
aesthetics of the road. Road fumiture, if properly designed, can also contribute towards
attractiveness of the road to the users.
6.6   Social Environment
6.6.1 Positive Attributes
6.6.1.1 Proper Road Connectivity
It provides good connectivity to different towns. There will be a boost to transportation of
agricultural goods or locally manufactured products from/to nearby market places or
distant places. It enhances business activities.
6.6.1.2 Employment Opportunities
Local people are in majority illiterates and are agricultural labourers dependent on any
type of labour work in the neighbouring towns. The project will create new employment
in local areas and help in providing more opportunities to labourers and businessmen.
6.6.1.3 Education
This project area improvement provides an easy access to children and College going
students to obtain higher education. It reduces the time of travelling and avoids accident
hazards.
6.6.1.4 Public Health
Public and Road Users complained of respiratory problems because of heavy dust
pollution generated due to vehicular exhausts. In operation phase the proposed by-pass
may reduce health problems to certain extent and medical care centres will be increased,
so that public health will be given due importance.
6.6.2 Negative Attributes
Industries, agricultural produce, education, medical care, business, tourism, etc. may
increase due to the developmental work. This would lead to higher traffic flow, induced
development and urbanization. This further results in congestion, health problems and
other problems of social and cultural natures. However, these need to be tackled as and
when they occur.
6.7   Evaluation of potential impacts
There are several techniques available for the assessment of the impacts of developmental
work. Each of the technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. The selection of
any of these techniques for any particular project depends largely upon the choice and
judgment of the analyst. The technique chosen should be comprehensive, easy to
understand, systematic and flexible. By considering these criteria, the matrix method is
proposed for the evaluation and assessment of impacts in detail.
Impact potential of the project road was estimated keeping in view the series of impacts
that will usually be triggered by the project activities according to the Scaling-Weightage

Checklist and Matrix methods. The environmental impact weightage value was allotted to
different environmental components for impact evaluation. The impact evaluation is
based on the judgement made by the Consultant after the field visit and studying the
available baseline/generated data in the scaling-weightage form and in environmental
impact matrix. The weightage given for each environmental component in pre-project
(without mitigation measures) and post-project (with applied mitigation measures during
construction phase) discloses the net expected positive change in result.
An attempt has been made to assess and compare the quality of environment in the Study
Area under three assumed scenarios as
No Project Scenario
Project Scenario without Mitigation Measures
Project Scenario with Mitigation Measures
A summary of the impact evaluated for the project with and project without mitigation
measures is presented in Table 6.3.
Based on the severity criteria of impacts, positive (beneficial) and negative (adverse)
impact scores were drawn for each project activity by Matrix method. A matrix was
formulated by combining environmental components and project activity for both without
and with mitigation measures. The values are depicted in Table - 6.3.
A matrix has been developed taking into account twelve impact areas. The twelve impact
areas have been considered keeping in view the main resources that will get affected due
to road development. In this context, a weighted scheme approach has been adopted. This
approach i s b ased o n t he d esire t o a ssess q uantitatively t he i mpact a nd weight of that
value by its significance or importance. The idea is to require environmental impact
analyses to define two aspects of each action that may have an impact on the
environment. The first aspect is "magnitude" (M) of the impact upon specific
environmental factors. The term magnitude is used in the sense of extensiveness or scale.
The second is the weighting of the degree of "importance" (W) i.e. significance of the
particular action on the environmental factor in the specific instance under analysis. A
scale of 1-5 has been used for the magnitude and importance. A (+) in front of the
magnitude number indicates the impact is beneficial and (-) indicates an adverse impact.
The product of the magnitude "M" and importance "W" value gives the net impact of the
action on the environmental resource i.e. the impact magnitude. The total impact score of
a project altemative can be obtained by the sum of the impact magnitudes on the
environmental resource in a given scenario. Based on this approach the maximum impact
score that can be achieved is +300 i.e. a maximum impact magnitude of (+) 25 for each
parameter and summation for 12 environmental parameters gives a maximum impact
score of (+) 300 indicating positive and beneficial impact. Similarly the minimum score
that can be achieved is (-) 300 indicating negative and adverse impact. To distinguish
between the three scenarios and to give it a qualitative aspect, the following classification
has been adopted.

It is very clear from the scores obtained for the 'No Project Scenario' and 'Project
without Mitigation Measures Scenario' that both situations will certainly have negative
impacts upon the environment. It i s evident from the table that i mplementation o f the
mitigation measures will have a positive impact upon the environment and assist towards
better uses of the natural resources.
Total negative impact score was -111 for the project without mitigation measures while
positive impact score was 106. The overall negative impact score of -Ill indicated that
the project would cause significant impacts on surrounding environment and needs
proper mitigation. However, the impact matrix was evaluated keeping in view the project
work with mitigation measures and overall positive impact score calculated was 106
(positive). Moderate and beneficial impacts are anticipated from the project. Hence, the
project may be accepted for upgradation work.
6.8   Preparation of EMP
Based on the assessment of the above potential impacts, the EMP has been designed.
Environmental Mitigation Measures and Monitoring Plan with Cost Estimate will be
dealt in the Part II- Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

CHAPTER - 7
PUBLIC CONSULTATION
7.1   General
Asper the World Bank Operational Policies/Directives (OD - 4.01 for Environmental
Assessment (World Bank, 1991)) and its successor documents (OP/BP/GP 4.01 (World
Bank, 1 999a,b&c)), public consultation is an essential part of the environmental
assessment of those projects and particularly those with potentially significant impacts.
7.2   Objectives
The primary objective of this public consultation is to protect the wild life and affected
communities. Experience has shown a strong link between project sustainability and
effective public consultation.
Task team leaders are required to use the EA process to build consultations into project
planning, so that information exchanged with stakeholder groups can influence each key
stage of the project cycle. Strategic planning is required to reconcile this aim with the
inevitable constraints on time and financial resources.
73    Public Consultation - community representatives, local residents and NGOs
To meet the requirement of the public consultation of World Bank, the Consultant
undertook extensive field visits and held detailed discussions with public, academiciars,
Research Scientists and NGOs. Public interviews have been conducted as per the MoEF
Guidelines, with the help of the questionnaire i.e., Public Opinion about Environment in
Project Area depicted in Appendix -5.
The baseline data was also collected by consulting the public to ascertain their opinion
about significant environmental conditions/features in their area and merits and demerits
of the implementation of the project road.
The questionnaire consists of the following features
i)    Sources of drinking water,
ii)   Causes and impacts of air and noise pollution by the automobile exhausts,
iii)  Water pollution problems,
iv)   Sanitation,
v)    Medical care,
vi)   Education,
vii)  Archaeologicalthistorical sites,
viii)  Employment opportunities,
ix)   Improvement in quality of life by facilitating transport facilities and
x)    Negative and positive impacts by the proposed project road in their area.
Records have been maintained of public meetings and other activities, communications
and comments/suggestions (Annexure-I to 3).

Improvement Project                                  Bijapur By-pass
During field visit, the questionnaire has been completed by consulting public at their
premises, commercial places and agricultural fields and by seeking their opinion about
the developmental work. During this assessment, most stakeholders (age of consulted
person: above18 years) have shown their willingness to get developmental work of the
proposed project road started at an early stage, so that, traffic problems may reduce. Poor
road geometry and congestion at certain places have deteriorated the environmental
quality of their surroundings and each day brings increase in ambient air quality level and
also reducing the quality of public health. During public consultation, they also learnt a
lot about their environment (negative and positive impacts) from the enviromnental
consultant. The list of persons contacted for public consultation programme is given in
Annexure- 3. The details of public consultation is presented in the Table - 7.1.

7.4   Outcome of public consultations/interviews
The outcome of the questionnaires filled by the local people for different aspects of the
environmental assessment is as follows:
i)    Ambient Air Quality
70% people said that the air quality of project area is healthy and clean but 30% people
said that air quality in the project area is polluted or likely to pollute during construction
work. Vehicular smoke and dust caused due to poor road condition are the main reasons
for the degradation of air quality. People suggested for the improvement of the project
road condition to be implied immediately with public health protection.
ii)   Water Quality
In the project area the drinking water source is mainly hand pump, municipal supply and
river. The water quality in the project area is satisfactory as per the public view.
iii)  Noise Level
In the project area noise level is slightly high as disclosed by 30% of the interviewed
people. The increase in noise level in the project area is due to poor road geometry and
narrow road. It may also further increase during construction work if proper care is not
taken. Noise level can be decreased, if the upgradation of the project road is undertaken.
iv)   Archaeological/Religious Sites
According to the public view, neither archaeologically important structure nor any
cultural site is located in the project area.

v)    Natural Disasters
As per the public opinion, there is no record of any natural disaster in the project area.
vi)   Existence of Major Structures
As per the public analysis, there are no major or minor structures within or outside the
ROW of the project road.
7.5   Merits/Demerits of Upgradation of the Project Road
The following are the merits and demerits of upgradation of the project road, as viewed
by the interviewed people:
7.6   Public Suggestions to improve the environment in the project area
The following are suggestions given by the interviewed people:
*     Plantation along the project road will reduce the pollution load (air and noise
level).
*     upgradation of the road would increase cleanliness in the p roject area and w ill
reduce the number of accidents and pollution load.
*     Periodical checking of vehicles would reduce air and noise level in the project
area
*     Strict implementation of rules and regulations of pollution check will reduce the
pollution load in the project area.
According to NGOs, the Social Forestry Scheme should be applied as environment
enhancement measures and permission should be given to nearby landowners to take care
of trees and to own trees.
Overall opinion of the public is that the upgradation of the project road should be carried
out at the earliest, but with mitigation measures to save the life as well as to increase the
quality of life of the people.
All the above suggestions given by the public and NGOs have been taken into account in
the EMP.

ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN
1.    Introduction
The Kamataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) is an initiative by the Public
Works Department (PWD) of the Government of Karnataka (GOK), under the proposed
World Bank loan, to undertake improvement of 2490 km of roads consisting of State
Highways and Major District Roads. These roads were selected on the basis of a Strategic
Option Study (SOS) carried out in 1996, the objective of which was to formulate a policy for
developing an effective network of regional roads. The road improvement program of the
GOK entails upgradation of 942 km of roads and Rehabilitation of the rest of the roads
(about 1339 km) based on Feasibility Study.
To facilitate realisation of this objective, the Government of Karnataka appointed M/s Scott
Wilson K irkpatrick o f U K a nd India t o w ork i n a ssociation w ith Consulting Engineering
Services (I) Ltd., New Delhi and IIIE, Bangalore to constitute the Project Co-ordinating
Consultants (PCC). This PCC was assigned to carry out the Feasibility study for the road
upgradation and Rehabilitation. The GOK also constituted a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), which was formed of experts drawn from different Departments of the Government.
The members of the PIU were professionals with experience in all aspects of road
engineering and also in ecology. The PIU was assigned the task of working in tandem with
the PCC.
1.1   By-passes as integral part of KSHIP
Two by-passes are recognised by KSHIP as a part of Phase II keeping in view the increase
in traffic along the project roads following the improvement and to avoid future bottle necks
in the town/village areas. The Phase II Project includes by-passes for 2 Towns - Raichur and
Bijapur. These by-passes are considered as additional corridors to the existing roads passing
through the settlements to facilitate smooth traffic flow. By-passes explored by KSHIP with
towns and village are listed in Table 1.1.

1.2   Bijapur by-pass - Project Description
Project area selected for by-pass is in Bijapur. The geographical area of Bijapur is 75.36 sq.
Km. The district is situated in the Northem part of the Karnataka State at 585m -595m
above sea level at 160 42' to 160 49' Latitude and 740 40' to 740 50' Longitude. The district
is under Belgaum division. The project area is described in the following paragraph:
The proposed alignment begins from Bijapur - Tikota road (SH - 12) at PWD Km Stone
126.2, west of Bijapur town on link 2A and continues towards southeast on a plain terrain at
an elevation of 620m above MSL, along the existing cart track and curves gradually. This
stretch is of about 2.8 Kms length and further it intersects the project road Bijapur -
Jamkhandi road on link 3A (Chainage 2.8 K1m). Then, the alignment continues to follow the
same direction and crosses 'Central Railway' broad gauge line at a distance of 1.9 Km and
traverses for a distance of 300m (1.9 + 0.3 = 2.20 Km) and intersects Bijapur-Bagalkot road

Km before terminating at Chainage 1 03 Km o n s outh-link o f N H - 1 3, s outh o f B ijapur
(Chainage- 6.7 Km). The total length of the proposed By-pass alignment is about 6.7 Kms.
The proposed By-pass alignment passes through lands of Mahal bagayath and Kasaba
Bijapur revenue villages.
Individual monthly contract will be approx. 635-640 ms. To make the road stable and
environment friendly, major construction work will commence and be completed in the dry
season by labour based construction. During rainy season minor road works like
transportation of materials for future use, maintenance of roads etc. will be considered. The
project description has been given in detail in CHAPTER - 3 of Part I - EIA report. For a
COI width of 30m, total land requirement is 38 acres. Generated data and Baseline
environmental conditions have been described in detail in CHAPTER - 5 of Part I - EIA
report.
1.3   EIA Report and EMP
The scope of the feasibility study included preparation of an Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) Report on by-pass roads selected for upgradation. The EIA Report was
prepared as per the Guidelines of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) of the
Government of India (GOI) and to meet the requirements of the World Bank as per OP 4.01.
An Enviromnent Management Plan (EMP) has already been formulated for the Phase I and
Phase II components. This EMP for Phase I and Phase II of the project has been accepted
and approved by the World Bank and is under implementation by the Project
Implementation Unit of the PWD. The EMP for Phase II was targeted at further
strengthening the Wing formed under the PIU to Monitor and implement the EMP as
formulated in Phase T. The EMP presented below addresses those stipulations fully and
comprehensibly for upgradation of by-pass roads in Phase-Il.
1.4   Objective
The EMP is the vehicle used to communicate the mitigation measures to the Government.
The objective of the EMP is to formulate an effective mechanism to monitor and implement
the proposed mitigation measures and procedure to be adopted for sound environmental
management of the Project corridors. The capacity building and training needs of the
personnel are also addressed in the EMP. Keeping in mind the project requirements, the
Phase I I EMP covers all the components c omprehensively. T he E MP h as b een d iscussed
between the World B ank, the PIU, PWD and the PCC. The EMP has been accepted and
endorsed by the PWD, Government of Karnataka.
Before implementation, every road development and improvement project in India has to
obtain environmental clearance from the appropriate quarters of the Government, the
procedures of which have been discussed in detail in Chapter-2 of the EIA report for Phase
II - Bijapur By-pass. The letter of environmental clearance is to be seen as a conditional
agreement between the project proponent and the Government, wherein the project
proponent declares that all care will be taken to avoid causing unnecessary damage to the
ambient environment and to mitigate the impacts while implementing the given project.
PWD has adopted a pro-active course of actions for environment management of the roads
and play a major role in environmental protection and enhancement of the State's road
network. Table below lists the laws under which clearances will have to be acquired at the

state/central level for Phase II of KSHIP. The PIU has applied for clearances and approval to
these regulatory agencies.
This EMP has been prepared for the PrU (PWD) to set out the effective Environmental
Management requirements for the road works during construction and operation phase of the
project corridor to result in an environment friendly and stable Highway project.
1.5   Clearances to be obtained
The mitigation measures required for the project will be communicated to the Govt. only
through EMP. Based on the EMP, the environmental clearances will be issued by the
Government and further, road work will be implemented based on the feasibility design.
Clearances will have to be obtained at the state/central level for Phase II KSHIP b y-pass
component and it is given in the following table (Table 1.2). The PIU has applied for
clearances and approval to these regulatory agencies. The cost of the project is less than Rs.
50 Crores and therefore, clearance from MoEF may not be required. Only two trees need to
be removed for the developmental work. Therefore, permission from the state may be
obtained.

1.6   Components of EMP
This EMP report has been designed comprehensively, considering all the essential
components required for the project. The Environment Management Plan summarises the
environmental impacts of the project and presents measures, which will be implemented to
mitigate the adverse impacts of the project and to enhance the positive outcome of the
project. More specifically the EMP includes the following components:
Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Integration of EMP with the project
Environment Management Plan Implementation Unit (EMPIU)
Environmental Monitoring and
Capacity Development through Training
The contents under each of the above are discussed in details in the rest of this chapter.
2.    Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures
The environmental impacts due to location, engineering design, impacts during construction
and operation phases have been discussed in detail in Chapter 6 of the Phase II EIA Report
and is also presented in tabular form as Appendix-I of the EMP. The primary impacts due to
the implementation of Phase II upgradation of by-pass roads and the associated mitigation
measures are discussed below under specific headings:

Improvement Project                                    Bijapur By-pass
2.1   Prevention of erosion
Initially, the freshly consolidated fill areas will be prone to erosion. The mitigation aspects
of the erosion prevention is included in the design through specification on stabilization of
fill areas, selection of less eroding material, good compaction and consolidation and
eventual covering of exposed surface with turf.
2.2   Gravel and Borrow Pit Restoration
Soil with gravel (moorum) occurs extensively over nearly all parts of Karnataka, but is
generally associated with high clay fractions. Sand will be added to increase the suitability
of moorum for its use in the construction of road embankments. The moorum borrow pits
are generally located along the road corridors. Improper extraction of borrow materials from
the pits, inadequate rehabilitation leading to accumulation of water during rainy season and
disease vectors, potential loss of productive land, increase in erosion, etc. are impacts which
require to be mitigated.
The proposed mitigation measures, which will be implemented as part of the project design,
are:
Pits will be properly reclamated;
Cut faces will be merged with the slope of the adjoining terrain;
Bottom of the pits will be graded towards natural out-falls to prevent water accumulation;
The reclaimed area will be seeded to provide grass coverage.
2.3   Use and Disposal of Excavated Material
Some of the excess excavated materials will be utilised in the embankment construction of
the new road formation. The proposed mitigation measures include re-use of unsuitable
material as backfill in the reclamation of borrow pits. The lead and lift distances have been
included in the BOQ costs and are incidental to the Civil Works.
2.4   Land Acquisition
The Phase II by-pass upgradation component of the project will require acquisition of
private lands. This includes agricultural land as well. The legal procedures applicable in this
regard have been described in Chapter 2 of the EIA report.
The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), prepared separately for this project, addresses the land
acquisition and the related compensation aspects of this project. Active public consultation
and dissemination of information was undertaken to formulate this plan.
2.5   Avenue Plantation
The procedures for obtaining permission to raise compensatory forest have been described
in detail in Chapters 2 and 6 of the EIA. Only 4 trees within ROW will be felled and about
1,340 trees will be planted.
The measures included in the project are:
Avenue plantation -
Mix of local species of trees and shrubs will be selected.
Saplings will be raised in nurseries and three-year-old plants will be transplanted.
Adequate protection in the form of low cost fencing, regular maintenance and supervision
will be undertaken.
The plantation programme will be undertaken with public consultation and active
participation of the State Forest Department and supervised by the EMPIU.

2.6   Accidents and Road safety
Design Phase
Traffic studies have identified intersection areas with heavy traffic intensity and acute-angle
intersections, which require junction improvements. The locations of these intersections
have been noted in the following Table (Table - 1.3).

Note: SH-State Highway; MDR- Major District Road; ODR- Other District Roads
The proposed mitigation measures include:
Improvement of junction points.
Placement of appropriate road-signage and symbols to forewarn the road users.
Construction Phase
Short-term impacts associated with this phase will be traffic diversion and management and
construction management. A comprehensive Traffic Management Plan has been formulated
and included in Chapter 3 of the Detailed Engineering Report. The contractors during the
construction of the project will adopt this plan.
The required mitigation measure adopted include:
Establishing suitable traffic management system, with the concurrence of the Police
Department.
Assistance of the Police Department, to regulate traffic.
Appropriate signage, flag men, temporary diversion, etc.
Operation phase
Accident hazards will be greatly reduced and the widened road will ensure smooth and fast
flow of traffic. The event that could pose potential environmental risk is the accident
involving vehicles carrying hazardous cargo. At present, most of the vehicles carrying such
cargo use National Highways. With better connectivity, some of the vehicles may use the
State Highways.
The required mitigation measures are:
i.    Establishment of emergency response facilities to deal with accidental spillage of
hazardous chemicals and
ii.   Prevention of contamination of adjacent water-body through immediate cordoning of
the area of spillage.
Establishment of effective collaboration with the PWD Division responsible for handling of
the
i.    Emergency Response on National Highways.
ii.   Extension of the emergency response facility to the State Highways.

Improvement Project                                    Bijapur By-pass
2.7   Impact on Air quality
Impacts on air quality happen in two situations and each requires specific mitigation
measure(s).
Construction Phase
Moderate air quality impacts during the construction phase of the project can be anticipated
due to the uses of construction machinery and formation of fugitive dust in and around the
construction sites due to vehicular movement and handling of materials. The SPM and RPM
levels are generally high in parts of Kamataka because of arid climate and well beyond the
prescribed limits in urban areas. Regulation of traffic and pedestrian movement is of
particular concern in the urban areas during construction.
The required mitigation measures are as follows:
Asphalt and hot mix plants, Stone Crusher units should be located at least 500-metres away
from inhabited urban and rural settlements. These units should be located in downwind
direction to the nearby settlements. Guidelines issued by the State Pollution Control Board
on establishment of Stone Crusher Units would be adhered to.
Trucks carrying earth, sand or stone would be covered with "traps" to prevent spilling,
Fugitive dust would be controlled by sprinkling water, and
Regular maintenance of machinery and equipment would be carried out.
Develop a green belt around the Plant site.
Operation Phase
There will be an increase in vehicular traffic following the implementation of the project.
Consequent rise in the level of vehicular emission is only to be expected on all road
segments in future.
The required mitigation measures included in the project are:
Creation of vegetation screen along the roadside having a two-tier planting arrangement to
absorb pollutants and arrest dust entrainment.
Maintenance of avenue plantation
As part of the Institutional Development Strategy, the project also plans to carry out:
i) Conducting black spot improvement study on the project road;
ii) Extension of the computerized accident analysis system (currently in use in Bangalore
and other cities) to the rest of the State roads and
iii) Providing training to the PWD, Police and other safety staff on accident investigation
and analysis techniques.
The outcome would be incorporated in the implementation of the project and form the basis
of on-going institutional and capacity development component.
Additional mitigation measures that the State may consider in the future include:
Phasing out of old vehicles,
Promotion of increased use of fuel-efficient engines,
Promotion of increased use of catalytic converters for petrol vehicles, and
Promotion of increased use of smoke traps for diesel vehicles.
It may be noted that the increase in traffic speed will reduce localized concentration of
pollutants and result of reduced congestion and idling.

Improvement Project                                   Bijapur By-pass
2.8   Impact on Noise level
Construction Phase
Temporary impacts in the immediate vicinity of the project may occur during construction.
The magnitude of impact will depend upon the types of equipment used and on the
construction methods employed. Care would be taken to reduce such impacts by:
Asphalt and hot mix plants, Stone Crusher units should be located at least 500-metres away
from inhabited urban and rural settlements. These units would be located in downwind
direction to the nearby settlements. Guidelines issued by the State Pollution Control Board
on establishment of Stone Crusher Units would be adhered to.
Source-control through proper maintenance of all equipment.
Use of properly designed engine enclosures and intake silencers.
Where possible, locating construction equipment at least 250m away from inhabited areas.
Providing protection devices like earplugs to all workers near construction equipment.
Scheduling of project activities to minimise impacts.
Strict prohibition of construction activities between 10 P.M and 6 A.M. in residential areas.
Operation Phase
Increase in noise level is anticipated due to increase in traffic movement. The impacted areas
are basically the towns and the other places having a semi-urban profile and which function
as major market centres and where inter-modal transfer of commodities occur.
The required mitigation measures are
Proper management of traffic by the Police Department of the State Government
Enforcement of legal measures on unwanted increase in the noise level by the Police
Department.
Maintenance of avenue plantation to dampen traffic-related noise.
Adoption of special measures such as prohibition of hooting to control noise near sensitive
receptors like hospital, schools and administrative offices.
2.9   Impact on Soil quality
Soils of eastern and northem  Kamataka plateau are prone to erosion due to their
characteristics. Periodic maintenance of the drains is the required mitigation measure. In the
areas prone to soil erosion, clearing and grubbing, excavation, borrow and fill operations
shall be limited to the extent practicable.
The mitigation measures to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation include:
Designated storage sites for fill material and adequate stockpiling to prevent erosion and
runoff related problems.
Construction of sediment basins, slope drains and use of temporary mulches, fabrics or other
control devices or methods necessary to control erosion and sedimentation.
Cut and fill slopes shall be seeded and turfed as required depending upon the site condition
and design requirements.
Embankment Stabilisation will be undertaken by prudent selection of fill material to prevent
erosion. Placement of stone pitching as per the design requirement and as specified in the
contract clause will be carried out.
The embankment slopes will be vegetated with native seed mix to prevent soil erosion.
Good construction practices coupled with responsible supervision and with the
implementation of mitigation measures explained above will reduce soil erosion and run off
during monsoon and unexpected showers.

Karnataka State Highways                               Environmental Assessment Report -
Improvement Project                                    Bijapur By-pass
Construction areas near culverts and bridges are likely to be prone to erosion, particularly
during monsoon season. Hence, construction activities for culverts and b ridges should be
limited to dry seasons.
2.10 Impact on Ground Water Sources and Water Quality
Impact on Water Sources
As such no bore wells or hand pumps were noticed along the alignment. Impacts may arise
under different circumstances (percolation of wastewater into the ground water table), each
requiring specific mitigation measure(s).
The required mitigation measures to be adopted are:
Where possible, undertake construction adequate number of bridges and culverts during dry
weather conditions and regular maintenance of all drainage structures.
Proper management of excavation materials, construction debris, site wastes and runoffs (by
proper disposal, for example), to protect the aquatic ecosystems.
Impact on water quality
No permanent impact is anticipated on water quality due to the project. These impacts are of
temporary nature and will be handled through the proposed mitigation measures:
All water and other liquid wastes arising from construction activities will be properly
disposed off and will not be discharged into any water body without adequate treatment.
Permission of the engineer and the concemed regulatory authorities will be obtained for
disposal of the wastes at the designated disposal points.
Details of temporary drainage system (including all surface channels, sediment traps,
washing basins and discharge pits) will be submitted to Site Engineer for approval prior to
commencing of construction works.
2.11 Sanitation and Waste Disposal
Sewage and domestic solid waste generated at the construction workers colony shall be
properly disposed off. Improper management of these solid wastes may lead to health and
hygiene related problems.
The applicable PWD specifications for labour camp development for type A construction
will be adopted to ensure that adequate sanitation at the workers' colony is maintained. The
basic mitigation measures are:
The contractor shall install adequate lavatories at the construction camp to cater to the
requirements of the workers.
The contractor at the campsites shall build Septic Tanks.
Proper collection system for domestic refuse and its segregation and disposal will be
ensured.
Periodic health check-ups of construction workers will be undertaken.
Develop a green belt around the Construction Workers Camp site.
2.12  Aesthetics
The project envisages plantation of about 1,340 trees and shrubs. The roadside plantation, in
addition to functioning as pollution screens, will add to the aesthetics of the road. Properly
designed road furniture will also contribute towards the attractiveness of the road to the
users.

3.    Integration of EMP with the Project
The EMP is an integral part of the Project and an important component, which will be
implemented simultaneously as the project proceeds. The project has to be executed and
supervised for effective and efficient environmental management and timely completion of
the project. The budgetary allocations for EMP implementation would be a part of the
project costs so that the EMPIU will receive funding to supervise and monitor the various
components and train the staff and develop capacity and expertise within the Department.
The EMP has been made specific to the project requirements taking into account the
environmental impacts and their respective mitigation measures. Although the conditions in
the Bid Documents are specified, the entire document on EMP shall be made a part of the
contracts for implementation of the project. The PWD of the GOK has to discharge
responsibilities by:
Making the implementation of the EMP an integral part of the project;
Providing strong support and commitment to the development of the staff; and
Assisting and facilitating the EMPIU to liase with the relevant interface institutions.
All the relevant issues concerning the protection of the environment have been discussed in
the Phase II - Bijapur By-pass EIA report prepared as per the Operational Policy (OP 4.01)
of the World Bank. For all practical purpose, the mitigation measures outlined in the EMP
apply to the Upgradation of the by-pass component.
Conditions in Bid Document for Protection of Environment
The Contractors' responsibilities in matters related to protection of environment will be a
part of the B id Documents. The Consulting Supervisors will be held accountable for any
deviation and non-compliance caused by the Contractor. These conditions have been
included as part of the Bid Documents and are reproduced below for illustration. The
conditions are derived from General Conditions, Sections 111 (Precautions for Safeguarding
the Environment), 112 (Arrangement for Traffic During Construction), and as per Technical
Specification Clause 301 and Annex-A to Clause 501 of the "Specifications for Road and
Bridge Works" by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRT&H), 2001. The
Contract clauses have been modified as appropriate and additional clauses have been added
where necessary.
(a) General
The contractor shall take all necessary measures and precautions and otherwise ensure that
the execution of the works and all associated operations on-site or of-site are carried out in
conformity with statutory and regulatory environmental requirements including those
prescribed elsewhere in this document.
The Contractor shall take all the measures and precautions to avoid any nuisance or
disturbance arising from the execution of the works. This shall wherever possible be
achieved by suppression of the nuisance at source rather than abatement of the nuisance
once generated. The provisions of this sub-clause shall however, be disregarded in respect of
emergency work required for saving life or the safety of the works.
In the event of any spoil or debris or silt from the sites being deposited on adjacent land, the
Contractor shall immediately remove such spoils, debris or silt and restore the affected area
to its original state to the satisfaction of the Supervisor Engineer.

4.    Environment Management Plan Implementation Unit
Implementation of mitigation measures would be the responsibility of the Environment
Management Plan Implementation Unit (EMPRJ) which will be set up as part of institutional
strengthening plan. Earlier, the Project Co-ordinating Consultants (PCC) had noted that the
PWD did not have an established EMPIU. Under the circumstances, the PCC proposed that
the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), set up for working with the PCC, would be the best
organization to supervise the implementation of the Environment Management Plan. Staff of
the PIU, with appropriate training and exposure, should become competent to act as the
EMP Implementation Unit (EMPIU). Following discussions between the PCC, PIUJ and
PWD, the EMPIU framework was finalised and the appropriate expertise required during the
implementation of the EMP were identified. The EMPIU may be further modified and
strengthened, as the project is implemented.
The EMPIU will be assigned with specific responsibilities with regard to:
Monitoring progress of the project as per planned schedule of activities.
Exercising oversight over the implementation of environmental mitigation measures by the
contractors.
Assisting the Site Engineers by providing appropriate environmental advise and solutions to
changes in engineering design and developing appropriate mitigation measures.
Documenting the experience in the implementation of the environmental process.
In collaboration with the Supervising Consultant's Environment Engineer preparing and
implementing training materials for the Public Works Department by incorporating the
experience of implementation processes and other issues conceming protection of the
environment.
Maintaining ongoing interfaces with the other relevant institutions in the context of the
works.
Staff of the EMPIU will ensure that all the approved mitigation measures would be
implemented in their spirit and by letters and that it (EMPIU) will prepare regular progress
reports for transmission to the regulatory authority by certifying that the relevant
environmental measures have been complied with during project implementation. The

Improvement Project                                    Byapur By-pass
EMPIU will be empowered to adequately discharge the above responsibilities in a manner
not detrimental to the given project.
The EMPIU shall be a specific functional unit under the Project Director of the PIJ and will
be headed by a Senior Environmental Engineer (of equivalent level to an Executive
Engineer of the GOK) and have three wings, the functions of which are stated below:
Environment Mitigation & Monitoring Wing - This will be headed by the Senior
Environment Engineer in-charge of the EMPIU and supported by five Assistant
Environmental Engineers;
Forestry & Environment Enhancement Wing - to be headed by an Assistant Conservator of
Forest and Range Forest Officers in the divisions to assist the Executive Engineers on
forestry aspects of the project.
Monitoring & Training Wing - to be headed by a Training Manager. This wing will be
under the Senior Environmental Engineer (Environment Mitigation & Monitoring Wing).
The three wings of the EMPIU shall maintain close interaction and co-ordination amongst
themselves as well as with the other Divisions of the PIU.
The EMPIU would have the following authority:
Have access to all relevant project related documents;
Have access to all Government Orders issued for the appointment of and the conditions
stipulated therein for all Contractors and the Supervision Consultants;
Have access to the records maintained by the Contractors, including that of the Consulting
Supervisors;
Freedom to inspect the works under execution,
Record the circumstances requiring application of alternative cost-effective mitigation
measures;
Appoint specialists to monitor unanticipated social and environmental problems and to
obtain from them the appropriate solutions thereof;
Prepare and submit environment monitoring reports on works under execution at regular
intervals; and
Undertake any other tasks arising from and related to the implementation of the EMP.
It was proposed in the Phase I EMP that the EMPIU be staffed by a Senior Environmental
Engineer of Executive Engineer grade and supported by Assistant Environmental Engineers
to be staffed on an as required basis. During implementation of Phase I EMP, the EMPIU
will have 2 Assistant Environmental Engineers. Either the Kamataka State Forest
Department or private contractor will carry out the afforestation programme. Again, the
staffing will be carried out progressively in keeping with the extent of the afforestation
programme.
In addition to the staffing of the EMPIU by local environmental staff, it is proposed that the
Construction Supervision Consultant (an external entity engaged to supervise the p roject)
would provide an experienced Environmental Engineer who will assist in the staffing,
training and setting up of the EMPIU. This Engineer will also assist the EMPIU to develop
training material, develop supervision records and report preparation, assist in developing
monitoring contracts and reports, etc. It is anticipated that this would be a part time position
spanning over 4-6 months in the first year and 3 months in the second and third years of the
Consulting Supervision Contract.

The Contractors and the Consulting Supervisors are to be seen as the arms of the EMPIU.
Therefore, to appreciate their co-operation and to stimulate them to execute the works
should be seen as a major objective of management.
The PIU based on the suggestions of the World Bank and PCC Consultants have decided to
appoint an Extemal Agency to assist EMPIU in implementing the Phase I EMP for a
stipulated period. The PIU would appoint an External Consultant for Phase II EMP
implementation depending upon Phase II project requirements and capacity building aspects
of the EMPIU.
On receiving the approved EMP together with the documents appended thereto, the EMPIU
should note down all tasks and sub-tasks derivable thereof and to sequence its own activities
in consonance with the schedule of construction activities. The EMPIU should also require
the Supervisory Consultants' Environmental Engineer to prepare similar schedules of works.
Failure to achieve such concordance would impair progress and, ultimately, weaken the
EMPIU. In the long-term, EMPIU will have to develop capacity and expertise to liase with
other agencies to handle issues and tasks that affect the efficient functioning of the PWD.

Actions Taken by the PIU
Following the approval of the Phase I EMP of KSHIP by the Government of Kamataka and
the World Bank, the PIU has adopted a proactive approach leading to the formation of the
EMPIU in the PIU set-up.
The EMPIU formation has been initiated by the appointment of a Senior Environmental
Engineer of the rank of an Assistant Executive Engineer of the Government of Karnataka in
May 2001. The PIU has appointed totally 5 Assistant Environmental Engineers of Assistant
Engineer rank and four oft hem are already in place in the divisional offices and one in
EMPIU. Four Range Forest Officers have been deputed to the PIU. The Divisional Forest
officers (DFO) have been advised to supervise the seedlings being raised in the nursenres.
The Phase I EMP had devised the EMPIU Organisation structure in order to facilitate
smooth implementation of the EMP  At that juncture, the PIU had expressed its own
apprehension about going ahead all by themselves with the suggested set-up. Therefore, the
PCC in consultation with the PIU and the World Bank had advised for the appointment of a
local private Consulting Firm to perform the functions of the EMPIU in tandem and, in the
process, train the persons deputed to the EMPIU. This task to be performed by the Private
consultant was time bound and dependant upon the quality of services rendered and the
ability of the EMPIU to function in its full capacity. The newly formed EMPIU has taken
many pro-active steps to ensure smooth implementation of the Phase I and Phase II EMP,
and in the process are getting self-educated to solve problems encountered during EMP
implementation.
The PIU and the EMPIU have understood the holistic approach to be followed for ensuring
sound environmental management. The tasks completed till date are listed below:
The State Forest department has consented to undertake the programme of Avenue
Plantation, Afforestation and Maintenance component of the plantation programme.
Annual budgets have been formulated in consultation with the Forest department for the
Avenue Plantation and Afforestation Programme for the Period 2001-2006.
The EMPIU has appointed Environmental Monitoring Consultants to carry out monitoring
of Environmental parameters like Ambient Air Quality, Noise level monitoring and Water
quality monitoring in the Phase I Upgradation and rehabilitation corridors.
Four Project Divisions and fifteen Projects sub-divisions have been sanctioned by the
Government for contract Administration and Management and positioning of the required
staff is under progress. Two Assistant Executive Engineers have been appointed and posted
at the site offices.
Training and awareness programme has been initiated for the EMPIU and associated field
staff.

Karnataka State Highways                             Environmental Assessment Report -
Improvement Project                                  Bijapur By-pass
The EMPIU is appointing a Consultancy firm for assisting them in implementation of the
Phase I EMP in rehabilitation roads under PIU supervision.
The EMPIU has already conducted an orientation programme on Environmental
Management for Civil Contractors and its staff by engaging the Environmental Training
Institute of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.
The Role of the Functionaries
The major functionaries, extemal to the EMPIU, are the Contractors and the Consulting
Supervisors. As mentioned earlier it is proposed that the team of Supervisory Consultants
include an Environmental Engineer. This Supervising Environmental Engineer shall be a
civil engineer with post-graduate specialisation in environmental engineering. He should
have at least five years of working experience related to integration of environmental and
social issues in the design, c onstruction and operation of transport projects (preferably in
intemational projects). Experience in construction management and operational maintenance
of highways would be preferred.
The major duties of the Supervising Environmental Engineer would be as follows:
Provide training to the staff of the EMPIU and others.
Review the implementation plan of the Contractor(s)
Assist EMPIU to supervise implementation of the EMP by the contractor
Develop good practice-construction-guidelines to assist the contractors in implementing the
EMP
Assist EMPIU to carry out periodic monitoring of air, noise and water quality to ensure
compliance with the requirements of the State and the EMP
Hold regular consultative meetings with the EMPRU and Social Development and
Resettlement Cell to exchange information on the e merging scenario while implementing
the EMP
In collaboration with the EMPIU, organising periodic environmental training programmes
and workshops for the contractors and the other members of the Consulting Supervisors
Assist EMPIU to prepare and submit regular environmental monitoring and implementation
progress reports.
5.    Environmental Monitoring
Monitoring will be carried out as part of the project implementation to record the actions
taken to check the environmental status of the project at pre-defined time. The monitoring
records will indicate whether progress is being achieved as planned and could form the basis
for any modifications to achieve compliance with the regulations. It is anticipated that the
monitoring records would yield data for comparison of the status of the environment at a
later time point. The monitoring will be carried out to meet the quarterly reporting
requirements as per the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board regulations and to ensure
compliance with the EMP.
In the context of environment management, the project would be monitored for:
Ambient Air Quality,
Ambient Noise Level and
Avenue Plantations

Karnataka State Highways                              Environmental Assessment Report -
Improvement Project                                   Bijapur By-pass
Monitoring should be carried out during:
Pre-construction Phase, (Included in the base line setup report)
Construction Phase, and
Operation Phase.
Adequate capacity to review the implementation of mitigation measures incorporated in the
project will be needed to meet administrative and legal responsibilities. Environmental
Monitoring Questionnaire is depicted in Appendix - A and Appendix - B.
Responsibilities for oversight will rest with the resident engineer staff including an
environmentalist or may be supplemented by some specialist consultant input, reporting to
the PWD - PIU (Environmental Unit). Parameters for monitoring of ambient air quality (as
per Appendix - 1) and noise level (Appendix - 2) are to be followed and may be analysed
by the environmental team of PWD Environmental Unit. All monitored data is to be
compared with standards of ambient air and noise level (CPCB, 1999, 2000) presented in
Appendix - 3 and Appendix - 4. Monitoring (Table - 1.5) will primarily involve ensuring
those actions taken are in accordance with contract and specification clauses and specified
mitigation measures. In this regard, if essential, environmental awareness training as
described in previous Section - 4, will be provided to the PIU (PWD) and Contractors
personnel to ensure this takes place effectively. The Project Director will visually assess the
Environmental Unit/Contractors practices and if high pollutant levels are suspected, further
monitoring by a laboratory recognised by KSPCB/CPCB, will be carried out to verify the
increased or decreased emission level and pollutants along the project road.
Along with generated data of environmental features, photographic records of site/locations
will provide a useful Envirommental Monitoring tool. A full record will be kept as part of
normal contract monitoring.
Under the Environment (Protection) Second Amendment Rules 1993, water quality
discharge standards have b een established for surface water for its suitability for various
uses. It is a legal obligation of the Contractor that any discharge from the work site meets
the standard guideline. Regular monitoring of noise level and ambient air quality parameters
will also be carried out and described in the contract.
Record Maintenance
Enviromnental monitoring forms will be used for recording of environmental data. The
recorded data in these forms and requisite standards focus attention on environmental issues
and provide feedback for further monitoring. Mitigation and enhancement measures adopted
in final design will be explicitly identified under the Bill of Quantities (BOQ), so that
performance and completion is readily documented. Daily project diaries would record
environmental problems (spills, dust, noise, etc.) as well as safety incidents and will be
retained as part of accepted modem contract management and summarized in Environmental
Reports provided to the World Bank. All such monitored data are required to be preserved
for at least one year after completion of construction work and should be produced as and
when required for verification.
Based on the Phase II - Bijapur EIA Report, 2 locations have been proposed for air quality
and noise monitoring in the upgradation route. The 1 ocations w here a ir and n oise q uality
monitoring were carried out during the phase-II EIA study are given in Chapter 5 of the EIA
Report and Table - 1.5. However, the locations may be shifted during construction phase.

and 6 a.m.; (3) Silence zone is defined as area upto lOOm around such premises as hospitals, educational
institutions and law-courts. The silence zones are to be declared by the competent Authority. Use of vehicular
horns, loud speaker and bursting of crackers shall be banned in these zones. (4) Mixed categories of areas
should be declared as one of the four above-mentioned categories by the competent authority and the
corresponding standards shall apply.
In addition to the above monitoring, additional checks and monitoring would be initiated at
the asphalt mix plants, cement concrete mix plants and at the effluent discharge points at the
construction camps. These sites would be monitored at the locations where they are
established and for the duration of their operation (mostly during construction). The plants
and construction camps would be monitored for: air quality: limited to concentration of
Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM) measured
over 24-hours;
Noise level: limited to 24-hours of observation and data being presented in dB (Leq); and
Water quality: limited to analysis of one sample measuring BOD5, TSS, pH, Total
Dissolved solids, Turbidity, Colour, Phenolic compounds, Mineral oil, Alkalinity and Total
& Faecal Coliform.
As mentioned earlier, monitoring during the Operation Phase will be carried out for ambient
air quality and ambient noise level at many of the monitoring stations used during the
construction phase. However, depending on the experience gained during the construction

monitoring, the monitoring locations may be changed, reduced or increased. Monitoring will
be discontinued at the sites of asphalt and cement/concrete mix plants and machinery and
campsites once these sites are abandoned.
It is anticipated that environmental monitoring will be contracted out to competent private
sector firms with capacity, capability and experience in carrying out such monitoring.
However, it is recommended that the EMPIU should seek information and advice from the
State Pollution Control Board in identifying the firms capable of carrying out such task.
The EMPIU would be the competent authority to appoint, monitor and supervise such
external agencies and to prepare the TOR for carrying out the monitoring. The budget for
carrying out the monitoring during the construction and operation will be included as part of
the EMP.
The data collected through during monitoring and onsite supervision would be used for
preparing monitoring reports for submission to the regulatory agencies, the World Bank and
the PWD. The information would be stored electronically for use in training, in developing
long-term trends, for future planning and for other uses. Regular monthly reports will be
prepared for internal use and dissemination and quarterly reports will be prepared for
submission to the Bank, Regulatory Agencies and the PWD management. A consolidated
annual report will be prepared every calendar year and disseminated to the Bank, PWD and
the Regulatory Agencies.
Draft Guidelines for the Preparation of Environmental Supervision and Monitoring Report is
given in Appendix - A. Enviromnental Supervision and Monitoring Formats for the various
components like Site selection, Borrow Area Management, Air and Noise level Monitoring
and prevention of water pollution and soil erosion etc. have been enclosed as Appendix - B.
6.    Capacity Development through Training for Environment Management
The environmental training aspects of the EMPIU staff will encompass the following:
* Understanding of the relevant environmental regulations and their application to the project.
* Main impacts of the project on the environment.
* Mitigation measures as given in the EMP and their implementation through incorporation in the
design, construction supervision and monitoring.
. Duties and responsibilities of the Contractors, Supervisor Engineers, Supervising Consultants,
PIU and EMPIU.
 Public/community consultation and it's role during the implementation of the project.
* Liaison with other departments and relevant agencies (such as Forestry).
* Supervision of the implementation of the EMP and social issues during construction and
operation. Resolution of environmental and social issues and their reporting.
* Monitoring during construction and operation.
Weekly, monthly and quarterly report preparations and submission.
Preparation of dissemination notes, holding of workshops, and training of other staff in
PWD.
Draft Terms of Reference for Training are given in Appendix - 5. The TOR will be refined
during the implementation of the project.

7.    Budget for EMP Implementation
The budgets for project construction and implementation of the RAP components have been
computed separately by the PCC. The design and construction of the project involve a
number items such as erosion prevention, rehabilitation of borrow areas, safety, signage,
provision of temporary drains, etc. costs for which are included in the contract costs.
Therefore, these items of costs will not be seen as parts of the EMP budget.
The cost of environmental mitigation measures has been estimated and is presented in Table
1.8.
Cost of restoration, erosion control and other work related activities are included as part of
good engineering practice and no major additional costs are expected to apply.
The budget includes cost estimates for the environmental enhancement and protection
measures.
The cost estimates arrived at are based on the type of impacts envisaged and the mitigation
measures required for the same and the related monitoring and training of personnel to be
undertaken. The costs may be modified based on the implementation of the project.
Fund allocation for Environment Protection and Enhancement
The proposed tree plantation programme involves plantation of about 200 trees per km at an
interval of about 10 m (about 100 trees per kilometre on each side of the road). Adequate
land is available for undertaking the plantation of the trees. The cost of Rs. 3 26 p er t ree
sapling is inclusive of the cost of tree guards/fences and the maintenance component for the
next three years. The money will be made available to the State Forest Department or to
private/community to undertake the plantation programme with the active involvement of
the EMPIU and the PWD. Healthy saplings will be selected for the purpose of the plantation
programme and adequate tree guards will be provided. The entities responsible for the
plantation in their stretches will also be responsible for regular watering and maintenance of
the plantations. The budget also provides for additional planting on public and community
lands, school boundaries, etc. where such land and opportunities are available.
Tamarind, Neem (Bevu), Dalbergia sissoo (White Beete) are the preferred tree species.
Prosopis juliflora (Bellary jali), Justica adhadota (Adasala), Caesalpinia bonduc (Gajaga)
and Euphorbia tirucalli (Kalli) shrubs may be developed as second tier plantation. The
Prosopis juliflora shrubs will involve periodic maintenance in the form of pruning the
branches and collection of the same to be utilised as firewood.
The present cost estimate includes only aesthetics and environmental enhancement of
Bijapur by-pass (Table - 1.8). The cost estimated is Rs. 6,70,000. The costs may be
modified based on the implementation of the project.

RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN (RAP)
The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) of Phase II Bijapur By-pass has been prepared on the
basis of provisions contained in the document approved by Government of Karnataka
(GOK) entitled: Resettlement and Rehabilitation: Principles and Policy Framework for the
Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project.
Socioeconomic surveys were conducted on the upgradation roads, for a Corridor of Impact
of 30 m keeping in view the design requirements. These surveys were conducted during
April 2003.
There was a concerted effort to redu'; impact on the number of families being affected. The
total number of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) is 632 and the total number of Project
Affected Families (PAFs) is 55. The total number of settlements to be affected is 2. The
extent of land acquisition from private owners necessary for road widening and other
improvements is 38 acres.
Local level public consultations were conducted. The institutional and organisational
mechanisms required for the resettlement program has been outlined in Phase I RAP Report
and t he P hase II R AP i mplementation m echanism has been further refined by the Social
Development Resettlement Cell set up by Karnataka PWD-PIU with support from other
government agencies, non-governmental organisations/community-based organisations
based on their experience gained during Phase I RAP implementation. The RAP provides a
detailed and updated implementation schedule for Phase II Bijapur by-pass.

Guidelines for Preparation of Environmental Supervision
And Monitoring Report
The main purpose of the Environmental Supervision and Monitoring Report is to document the
implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) during the construction of the KSHIP.
The secondary purpose is to report on ongoing concerns, issues which may have arisen during the
implementation of the EMP and mitigation measures applied, training carried out, community
consultations carried out during the construction and documentation of the results of environmental
monitoring carried out onsite.
The report should be prepared and submitted on a quarterly basis. Major elements of the reports are
given below. However, not all elements may apply during the reporting period.
The report should include:
*  For the overall project a brief description of the ongoing activities, completed and planned during
the next quarter;
*  Environmental training undertaken and planned giving the dates, duration, and locations of the
training, number of PWD and Contractors' staff trained, general contents of the training, etc.
*  Maps showing the locations of construction camps, haul roads, borrow areas, q uarries, mixing
plants, environmental monitoring points, construction schedule, civil contract sections, etc.;
* Environmental management at the construction camps and equipment maintenance and servicing
camps (water, sewage, garbage, health, living conditions, facilities for children and faniilies,
Tecreation facilities, waste disposal, fuel and oil storage facilities, waste material storage,
environmental awareness training programs, etc.);
* Location of sensitive buildings, villages and areas (schools, hospitals, libraries, residences,
retirement homes, etc.) and how these areas are being protected during the constTuction;
*  Safety during construction (signage, diversions, traffic management, accident records, night time
protection etc.)
*   Supervision and control of construction material storage and transport (dust control, traffic,
congestion, safety noise, etc.) along the haul roads; number of watering trucks per contractor and
the record of their usage;
  Handling of borrow areas, top soil, reclamation of borrow pits;
*  Handling of the temporary drainage during the construction period;
*  Monitoring results of dust, noise, construction equipment emissions, etc. at the construction sites
and along the material transport roads; night time noise monitoring during the periods of night
construction and material transport;
*  Setting up of complaints handling system; records of complaints and how these are being
resolved; records of on going public consultation and how conflict issues are dealt with;
*  Monitoring data of the selected parameters (dust, noise, air emissions, water quality, etc.);
*  Photographic record of key elements.
