Karnataka Stale Highways              Environrmental Assessment Reporrifor the Segment of CorridorlOA
Improvement Project                   which passes lhrough Rajiv Gatndhi Nattonal Park Nagarahole
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.     General
Corridor I OA also known as State 1-I ighway 17 D (SH-I 7D), commences at Mysore City and ends
at the Kerala Border, near Bawali village of Hecgadadevanakote Taluk of Mysore district. The
total length of this corridor is about 90 Km and its most important features are that it offers direct
conilectivity to thc coastal areas of Northerin Kerala and also passes througIl the Rajiv Gandhi
National Park, Nagarholc. All of Corridor IOA has been selected for rehabilitationi under the
Karnataka State Fligiwvays Improvemenit Project (KSHIP).
2.     Project Description
A 30 km section of Corridor I OA (fi-om PWD 62 kiml stone to the Kerala border), passes througi
Rajiv Gandhii National Park, Nagarhole. For its entire length, the corridor traverses unldulating and
flat terrain which include core zone, restoration zone, tourism zone and habitat manipulationi zone.
The width of the existing carriageway varies from 3.75m to 5.5 mn. The section passing througi
the National Park is in poor condition due to inadequate maintenance and the absence of an
overlay.
3.     Baseline Environmental Situation
The significant dust emission within the park is mainly due to the poor road condition. Day-time
noise levels exceed the limit prescribed for sensitive and residential zones. The quality of the
three water bodies tested indicate that they were withinl the drinking water standard limits.
The major Park water source during dry seasons is the Kabini reservoir whicih is located southieast
of the corridor. Park fauna has to cross the corridor to gain access to Kabilni reservoir.
4.     Public Consultations
Forest Officials including the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), NGOs and local
community leaders, stakeliolders and residents were consulted for their opinions on the present
environment problems and on potential rehabilitation of the project road with mitigation
measures. PCCF (Wildlife) subsequently issued a LOU giving conditional approval for
rehabi litation of Corridor I OA through the' Park (Appendix A refers).
5.     Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Mitigation Measures
The main impacts assessed were those of air pollution, noise levels and watcr quality on wild
animals that cross the project road. To overcome the adverse effects on the Park environment
(luring project impiciemitation. the following measures mist be considered:
*Ag-ricultural land will not be utilized for construction purposes othler ilian existing topsoil
within tile Right of Way (ROW).
W'Withinl the ROW. care mtist be takeni to excavate or fill only those areas wlhicih are to be
relhabilitated.
*   Tested and approved borrow pits and quarries only muslt be used for constrictioni purposes
and muist be located outside the Nalionial Park.
*Quarries and borrow pits Imust be acceptably rehabilitated after completioni of the construction
work.
*   Static Constructioni Equipmilent/Machinery such as Asphalt and Hot Mix Plants, Stone
Crushers. etc. must be located outside the lPark.
*   No excavation or earthxvork involvillng air pollution will be carried out inside the Park.
*   All debris or waste materials miust be disposed ofl'outside thc Park.
*   All materials for use in construction of tile works must be stored outside the Park.

Improvement Project                 wvhich passes through Rajiv Gandhi National Park Nagaraho/e
*  Construction working schedules must be implemented in a manner that gives least impact to
the Park's fatuna.
*  Traffic calming measures have been included in the road design to enhance the protection of
wild life.
*  Construction workers camps must be located outside the Park.
6.     Environniental Management Plan
Activities to be executed both inside and outside the Park have been fully emphasised. All
necessary care must be given to wildlife protection and the project implemelntatioll will be
controlled by the Environmental Management Plan.
7.     Institutional Set-up, Environmental Monitoring and Training
The KSHIP Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has established an Environmncital Management
Plan Implemnenitation Unit (EMPIU), which has been approved by both the World Bank and the
MOEF, to ensure that all the KSHIP road improvements comply with the several Environmental
Management Plans (EMP). The EMIPIU is supported by M/s Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick & Co Ltd.
who are the Project Co-ordinating Consultants (PCC) for KSHIP.
The frequency and duration of monitoring, the necessary monitoring stations and required record
keeping procedures to be followed during project implementation have been defined. If any
procedure does not confonn to the required standard, it will be further monitored and corrected.
Training in basic road construction techniques and strengthening of enviromnental awareness may
be required to assist Forest Officers and Park Rangers liase with the PW1:D during future
maintenance of the corridor and environmental monitoring.
8.     Budget for EMP Implementation
The cost estimate for EMP implementation for the section of Corridor IOA which passes through
the Park is Rs. 29 lakhs.
9.     Conclusion
The State will benefit from the improvement of Corridor 10 A through the Park as there
will be no adverse affect on fauna or flora and the linkage between the States plus tourist
development will be enhanced.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR THE SEGMENT OF CORRIDOR
1OA WHICH PASSES THROUGH RAJIV GANHiI NATIONAL PARK, NAGARAHOLE
1.     General
The Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) is an initiative of the Public Works
Department (PWD) of the Government of Karnataka (GoK), under finanicial assistance from thle
World Bank, to improve 2300 km of State Highways and Major District Roads. (Figure 1)
Corridor IOA, also known as State Highway 17D, runs from the City of Mysore to tlle State
border with North Kerala. Its length is 90kms. The southernl section of the corridor passes throughl
30km of the Rajiv Gandhii National Park, Nagarahole. This Environmental Assessmenit (EA)
report covers the 30 Km section of the corridor thlouglh the Park and has been prepared in
conformiiationi with MOEF and World Bank guidelines. (Figures 2 and 3)
2.     Project Description
2.1    Description of the Project Corridor
Corridor 10A passes througlh Heggadadevanakote Taluk, Mysore District, Karnataka State. The
latitudinal range is from  11°51'20"N to 12015' 37"N and the longitudinal range is from
76°00'02"E to 76°17'13"E. Within the National Park, the corridor passes through the following
Park zones:
a)     Core Zone
The final I lkms of the corridor to the Kerala border pass through the Dodda Byranna Kuppe
Range that constitutes the major portion of this zone.
b)     Restoration Zone
This is an area on the fringe of the Park which has been degraded over the years by illegal tree
felling, smiiugglinig and destruction of the Park flora. About 8 Kms of the corridor pass througl
this zone In the Metikuppe and Antharasantlhe Ranges.
c)     Tourist Zone
10 kimls of the corridor pass througL1 the SuLnkadakatte Tourist Zone, the corridor being the only
access to this zone.
d)     Habitat Manipulation Zonc
This zone includes all the plantationis within thle Park, areas with heavy weed growth and areas
nlot inlucIded in any othcr zonles. The corridor traverses about 3 km in this zone of wliclh lies in
thc Dodda Byranniia Kuppe Range.

width varies from 3.75m to 5.5 m. Except for a few sections, the corridor passing through the
National Park is damaged due to lack of maintenance and absence of an overlay. Cracking,
potholes and ravelling occur throughout the entire length. The deterioration of the pavement and
edge failures is mainly due to raised earthen shoulders. The presence of water in the pavement
structure has also weakened the sub-grade and pavement deformation has taken place (Figure 5).
2.2    Projected Traffic
Traffic surveys conducted during 1999 revealed that around 50 vehicles (Buses-37%, LCVs-23%
and 2Axle Trucks40%) per day were using the corridor. Table 2 below shows the anticipated
growth of traffic in Corridor IOA from 1999 to 2004.

Along the entire corridor, the existing pollution load is very small although the condition of the
carriageway is poor and the shoulders are damaged. However, improvement of the road xvill help
to further reduce vehicular pollution.
2.3    Legal Clearance Requirements
Environmental Clearance for Phase I and Phase II of KSHIP (excluding bypasses and corridors
passing through National Parks) have already been obtained from MoEF (Gol), Karnataka State
Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and Kaniataka State Forest Department. Corridor IOA requires
clearance from these Authorities because it passes through the Rajiv Gandhi National Park,
Nagarahole.
The EMPrU/PCC held discussions with the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife)
(PCCF WL) of the Forest Department to obtain environmental clearance for the corridor.
Subsequently a Letter of Understanding (LOU) was issued by the PCCF WL (see Appendices
AI/A2) granting conditional clearance for road improvement works within the National Park,
Nagarahole. The conditions are the fulfilment of various measures to protect the ecological
resources and wildlife, the exploration of feasible designs and implementation of mitigation
measures to ensure road safety and avoidance of accidents with adequate safeguards during the
phases of construction and operation.
An application dated 17/05/03 was filed by EMPIPU with the KSPCB for obtaining clearance for
Corridor IOA improvement under the Air and Water Act. The KSPCB has commnented in their
reply dated 11/07/03 that KSPCB approval was given for the Phase II roads, including Corridor
IOA, on 07/05/02 and no fuirther clearance is required. (See Appendix A3)
3.     Baseline Environmental Situation
The characteristic environmental featurcs of Corridor I OA are as followvs:
3.1    Physical Resources
The physical resources -ithin the corridor are physiography, geology, climate, drainage-systems
and soil characteristics. These characteristics are described in the following paragraphs:

The results indicate that the corridor experiences increasing dust formation. Apart from dust, all
other parameters are within the prescribed limits. The increased level of dust is due to the poor
road conditions with exposed aggregates and damaged shoulders.

The results indicate that the corridor water quality is withiin the drinking water standard limits
except for the parameters of iron and total coliformis. However, these parameters do not affect the
wildlife in the corridor.
3.3     Drainiage Systems
Cross drainage structures (bridges) at Km. Stones 68+410, 76+250, 77+300 and 80+4 10 along the
corridor require minor repairs.
3.4     Ecological Resources of the National Park
The Park bio-diversity along the corridor is wide, rich and well represented.
3.4.1   Flora
A mixture of moist deciduous and dry deciduous forest types characterizes the flora. According to
Landsat Satellite Images, the Park consists entirely of closed forest with a crown density of 40%
and above (Landsat, 1986). The moist deciduous forest consists of a tree layer with an open
canopy. A number of good timber trees are native hiere. Lagerstroenlia mlicrocarpa, Teclona
granclis and Terminalia alala represent the dominiated flora of the Park area. The dry seasonis are
characterised by the flowering of Raclertnaclhera xylocaitpa, Erythliina ilidica and PlerocalPuls
rnaursupiuln. The comilpositioil and frequenlc)y of canopy trees vary depending on soil and rainfall.
Thler-e are modificationis due to soil factors and seral stages caused by pressure from  local
inilabitanits. Acacia laftionlumii , Acacia peli(ala, Alhizia amncara represent the har-dy species of these
forests. Clumps of Dendrocalall7lfs SX/liCIS occur in open areas. Several average sized trees sucih
as the silk cottoin trCe (Coch/losypermun rel/giosuln), GiVoija roltler,form is, .Srecuhta uren.s,
Term-iinalia sp., Sanvtal/ur  albun;7 aind Bitlea mn7onosp_)ern7a are comimiioin. Lan7tan7a Sp. alnd
Eupatoriurn C'hrolrnlolcdaenct olarala weeds also proliferate in tihe Park. A list of flora is given in
Appendix B.
3.4.2   Fauna
In the National Park, the very rich and diversified faunae population is unique. Tle elephiant
population of Nagaralhole is one of the largest in India and estimated about at 1500. TIhe gaur (1Bos

represent othler large hierbivore mammals. Other animiials include sloth bears, macaqucs and
langur. Giant and flying squirrels are also seen in the forests. The main carnivores in the Park are
tigers, leopards and wild dogs. Other species found are jungle cat, civet cat, mongoose, etc. TIhe
Reptiles foulid in the Park include several species of cobra, vipers, crocodiles and monitor lizards.
Avian faulia is represenlted by pied hornbills, drongoes, parakeets, kingfishers, peafowl, jungle
fowl, partridges and eagles. A detailed list of the Park fauna is given in Appendix C.
3.4.3  Animal Movements/ Crossings and Corridors
The major water source in the Park is the Kabini reservoir. Elephants and other hel-bivores come
to the reservoir for drinkinig water and mud bathis in the early mornings and evenings. The
reservoir is located Southeast of Corridor IOA and some animals have to cross the corridor to
gain access to the reservoir. Animal concentration in the Park near the corridor is shown in Table
11 below.
Table- I1: Details of Aninial Concentration around Corridor IOA

The EMPIU/PCC, with the help of the Park staff, have identified 59 locations between Km 64
and Km 90 whiere animal crossings are observed along the project corridor. 27 crossing locations
are in the Core Zone and 32 in the Tourist zone. These crossings are on well-defined animal
tracks where frequent movements of animals, especially herds of elephants, gaur and spotted deer
are seen. However, the animals do not restrict themselves to these tracks. Solitary animals such as
bull elephants, male gaurs, sambhars, barking deer and spotted deer, are sighted by the roadside
and are seen randomly crossing the road during late evening and early morning. Appendix D lists
the locations of animal movements/crossings along the Project Corridor. As the corridor is a
sensitive zone for the safety of wildlife it is important that adequate protective/safety measures
are adopted to protect their movements across the corridor (Figure 6).
3.5     Human Use Values
3.5.1   Land Use
The land in the Park is fertile and used for farming and settlements. Total areas of land utilisation
are given in Table 12 below.

Pilgrima,e Centres
The Masthiguidi Masthiyanmiia Temple located near the project corridor at Balle but outside the
ROW is the only pilgrimage centre in the project area. The original temple was submerged by the
Kabini Reservoir project and a new one has been constructed at Balle. It is known as the T'ree
Goddess to the villagers and tribal people in particular. In earlier days, before venturing into the
forest, local people, tribal people and forest officials used to worship the Tree Goddess for
protection against wild animals and othier hazards. Even the Khedda operations (the capture of
wild elephanits), started only after worshiippinig the Goddess. Between 4000 - 5000 people
participate in the annual festival whiclh is held in February - March.
3.6.4  Illegal Activities
The Park is very rich in flora and fauna. Illegal activities such as poaciling of wildlife, smugglinlgl
of forest wealth, etc. occur in remote parts of the Park not near to the project area. According to
available data and also to the Park authority, poaching is minimal and occurs in the D.B. Kuppe
Range (on the Kerala border) and the Antharasanithie Range. The Park administration     is
responsible for controlling all illegal activities.
4.     Public Consultation
To achieve the public consultation requirements of the World Bank, the EMPIU/PCC undertook
extensive field visits and held detailed discussions withi the Public, forest officials and
conservation NGOs. Public interviews were conducted as per the MoEF Guidelines.
Baseline data was collected by public consultation to ascertain opinions on significalit
environmental conditions/features along the corridor and the merit or otherwise of its
rehabilitation. Records  of public  meetings  and  othier activities, communications  and
comments/suggestions were made (Appendix J refers).
During field visits, Forest officials including the Chief Wildlife Warden, local people and
conservationists (NGOs) were consulted to evaluate the present situation of the Park environmenit
and to establish necessary mitigation measures for the protection of wildlife and the Park
environimenit. These conisultations gave insight into the concerns and requirements of Forest
Department officials with relation to relhabilitation of the corridor within the National Park. Their
commenits / suggestionis hiave been recorded (Appendix J refers). Table 17 below gives details of
the Public Consuliatiolis.

Imnprovenment Project                    wl'hich passes through Rajiv Gandhi Nalional Park-, Nagarahole
5.     Environrmental Impact Assessment and Mitigation Measures
5.1    Environmental Impact Assessment during the Construction Phase
5.1.1  Air Environment
Air quality will be affected by dust (suspended particulate matter) generated by vehicular
movements during construction activities such as eardtworks, haulilng and tipping of
materials. The impact is expected to be localized, temporary and confined to the construction
area. The monitored data of ambient air quality indicates that, in the present situation, (pre-
project) the concentration of dust is greater than the standard limits and it will inevitably
increase during project implementation.
5.1.2  Water Environment
Existing rivers, streams, dams and ponds along the corridor could be affected by dust, spillage
of oil and construction materials and polluted water during construction operations.
5.1.3  Noise Environment
During the period of road construction works, noise pollution will inevitably increase
along the corridor.
5.1.4  Biology Environment - Flora and Fauna
The Park flora should not be significantly impacted by construction activities along the
corridor as no tree cutting or felling is required.
The movements of Park fauna over the corridor are always greater at night-time. Hence
most accidents to wildlife occur at night.
5.1.5  Soil Environment
The existing soil enviroment along Corridor 1OA could be damaged and polluted if
borrow pits and quarries are established adjacent to the ROW to obtain construction
materials.
5.1.6  Social Environment
The road rehabilitation does not involve any resettlement of people and road
improvement is limited to the existing conridor fonnation xwithin the ROW.
Thle rnmajor social impacts during the constructioni phase along the con-idor wvill be the
safety of road users and the welfare of constr-uctioi wvorkers and their families.
The safety' hazards wvill be caused by traffic conjestion, poorly conceived / uncontrolled
temporary diversions, unconitrolled movemiient of construction plant and vehicles,
misleading or non-existent traffic signs / wvarning boards / temporary lights, etc. TFle
welfare of constructioni wvorkers will be impacted by the quality of their construction
camps.
Local settlements should not be affccted by either impact, as they are located I to 2krm
from the corridor.

5.2    Enviroiiinental Mitigation Mcasures during the Construction Phase
.5.2.1  Mitigation of Impacts on the Environments of Air/Water/Noise/Biology/ Soil
To mitigate the construction phase impacts on the subject Environimilenlts, all borrow pits,
quarrys, stone crushing plants, hot mix plants, construction materials bulk storage areas,
construction workers camps, etc. must be located outside the National Park and at least
500 m from existing settlements.
5.2.1.1 Availability of Road Cotstruction Maiteriils close to the National P(rk, Na(glrahole
Details of existing local quarries/borrow pits used for the extraction of rock for crushilng,
natural gravel (moorum), sand and water sources are furnished in Table 18 below. The
local rock is granite and if properly selccted adequate quality and quantity is available for
all purposes requiring broken or crushed rock. The reddish brown natural gravel
(moorum) that has been identified in various sources has a CBR varying from 9.60% to
14.50%. Sufficient moorum of good quality is easily available for all purposes as filliig
materials. Clean river and nalla sand sources were identified having fines less thani 2.0%,
which are available in good quality, and sufficient quantity for all construction purposes.
Table - 18: Details of potential Road Building Materials for Corridor 10A
Doddakatur granite Quarry is at a distance of 8.0 Km from Link Ch: 16.0Km
l-lirekati Quarry is at a distance of 40.0Km from Link Ch: O.OOKm

Mattakere River Sand Source is at a distance of 3.0 Km from Link Ch: 44.0 Kin
5.2.1.2 Coonstruction Working Hours
Construction working hours during day-time must be controlled/limited. No night-timile
working will be permitted.
5.2.1.3 Dust
Dust formiationi along the corridor during construction must be contiolled by spraying
water from bowsers on the road pavement and other exposed construction areas. Care
must be taken during the spraying, process to ensure that excessive amoulits of water are
not used and that contaminiiationi of adjacent river systems/canials/ponids and groUnd water
does not occur.
-5.2.2  Mitigation of Impacts on the Social Environmncilt
5.2.2.1  Road S/fely of Project Rotad users
During the Constrctioll Plhase, temporary diversionis must be properl designed, surfaced
and coiitrolled to cnsure safe movement of all traffic.
Adequate road signs, warninigl boards, temporary lightino, balTicades, etc, must be
installed. The movemilents of constructioni plant, equipmncit and vehlicles must be
controlled at all times.

5.2.2.2  Construction Workers Welfaire
Constructioni camps must be located at least I 00m from crushers, asphialt plants, material
stockpiles. Adequate washinig facilities, toilets, drainage and waste disposal systemiis must
be provided. Medical care, environimT-enltal and healthi awareness programimii1es and
education of the workers children must be arranged.
5.3     Environmental Impact Asscssnient during the Operation Phase
5.3.1   Air Environment
Increased traffic following road improvemilenit will inevitably lead to greater air pollution
along Corridor I OA.
5.3.2   Water Environment
There should be no negative impact on the Park's water bodies and river systems
following completion of construction works. In fact, the improved drainage systems of
the rehabilitated road should reduce soil erosion along the corridor. This in turn would
significantly decrease contaminationi or siltation of extant water bodies.
5.3.3   Noise Environment
Increase in vehicular traffic numbers in the Operation Phase will cause greater ambient
noise levels along the corridor.
5.3.4   Biology Environment - Fauna / Flora
The increase in vehicular traffic along the corridor will lead to greater road kill of the
Park's wildlife.
5.3.5   Soil Environnient
The topsoil of arable land adjacent to the corridor ROW should not be affected.
5.3.6   Social Environment
During the Operation Phase, the major social impact will be on the safety of road users.
5.4     Environmnital Mitigationi Measures during the Operation Plhase
5.4.1   Air Environnicnt
ITraffic contiol measures suclh as ruLible strips, chicanies and speed breakers hiave becil
included in the detailed project design to iellp to reduce ambienlt air pollutanlt levels in the
project area. Periodical air ImloInitorinig \'will be carried out. Necessary action will be taken
by routinicly checking loaded/unloadcd trucks and other vehicles.
5.4.2  Water Environimient
None required.

5.4.3  Noise Environment
Rehabilitation of the existing road surface plus tile provision of adequate road signs and
road markinig wvill facilitate the traffic flow which should also reduce the use of horins by
overtaking vehicies. These new measures would all lead to a reduction in traffic noise
levels in the Operation Phase and hence less disturbanlce of the Park's wildlife.
5.4.4  Biology Environment - Fauna / Flora
T'he increased road kill of Park wildlife during, the Operations Phase can be miigated by
traffic calminig measures at recognised wildlife crossings. These would include rumble
strips, chicanies, speed breakers and adequate warinig signs. Effective patrolling by forest
officials would also be essential. (Appendix D and Figures 8.1/8.2 refer)
5.4.5  Soil Environment
None required.
5.4.6  Social Environment
The main impact on the social environment durinig the Operation Phase will be that of
road safety oin the rehabilitated corridor. Mitigation of the impact on road safety will be
achieved by the provisions of road lane and median markings, clear road signs, speed
breakers/rumble strips (Figures 8.1/8.2).
5.4.6.1 Proposed Traffic Safety Mitigation Measures for Corridor IOA
Traffic Safety impact mitigation measures suggested for Corridor IOA include:
*      Profile correction at the existing surface camber to the rehabilitation design
camber using Bituminous Macadam.
*      Overlay consisting of 50 mm Bituminious Macadam followed by 20 mm MSS.
*      Earthen shoulders to the new road level with adequate cross-fall to drain surface
water.
*      Grading of land between shoulders and ditches (Fire line trench) to allow surface
run off.
A typical cross section of the proposed rehabilitation road design is shown in Figure 7 below.

5.4.6.2 Sqfeil, P(araimeters includled ii the Design
Raised platforms, chicailes and traffic calminig measures in the formi of rumble strips have
been included in the design at locations wlhere animal crossings have becn observed.
Traffic calming measures can help drivers adjust their speeds to be appropriate to local
conditions.
There are several types of traffic calming techiliques available. They include:
*       -inch points
*      Build outs
*      Rumble Devices and/or
*      Chlicanes
*      Combinations of all the abovc.
In order to reduce vehicular speeds at specific animiial crossings in the National Park, a chicane
design prescribed by the Traffic Advisory Unit, Department of Transport, UK, is proposed.
A chicane is a narrowing formed by locating build outs alternately on each side of the
carriageway. Each chicane will consist of two or more build outs. Close spacing of build outs
forming the chicane, say 1Om to 15m apart, can.be extremely effective in constraining traffic
speeds.
A typical chiicane design (Traffic Calming Measure) is given in Figure 9. It consists of two build
outs spaced alternately at lSm spacing. This provides space (effective 3.75m carriageway) only
for one vehicle to manoeuvre at a time. Rumble strips are provided 50m ahead of build outs at
both ends to reduce the speed of the vehicle for safe manoeuvring. A storage lane is provided for
the vehicles to stop and give way to oncominig vehicles. Adequate sign boards, chevronl direction
sign boards and lane markings are provided to warn the drivers in advance. Adequate drainage
facilities are included. This chicane design is very effective in reducing vehicular speeds to 20
Km/h. The locations and chainages of proposed traffic calming measures are given in Appendix
E. Totally, 5 no. chicanes, 10 no. rumble strips in chicane locations, 6 no. road humps and 128 no.
RPMs at road humps and rumble strips are provided in the design.

5.5     Environmental Impact Evaluation
The potential environmental impact on the corridor due to project activities xvas estimated
according to the Scaling-Weightage Checklist (Battelle's Environmenltal Evaluation System)
and thc Environmental Impact Matrix metihod. Based on Battelle's systemii, an environimilental
impact weeightage value was allocated to different environmental componenits for impact
evaluation. The impact evaluation was based on judgements made by the PCC during field visits
and W1hile studying the available baseline data generated by Battelle's system. SuLmm111aries of the
impacts evaluated Pre-project (A) ('without project) and Post-project (B) ('wi/li project) are
given in Table 19 below.

ITlhe positive impact score produced by the Battelle's System has also been re-checked by the
Matrix method witl/out and witlh mitigation measures. Based oni the severity criteria of impacts,
positive (beneficial) and negative (adverse), impact scores were establishied for each project
activity by the Matrix metlhod. A    matrix  was formlulated by combining environimeiltal
components on a y-axis and project activities oni an x-axis for both without and with mnitigation
nieasuies as depicted in Table 20 and Table 21. Assigined Weightage values are giveIl in Table 22.

Total negative impacts scored -2,400 and positive impacts scored +815 for project without
mitigation mcasures. As a result, the overall impact score of -1,585 indicated that the project
would cause sigilficanit inpacts on the surroundinig,.enivironimenit and required proper mitigation.
However, the impact matrix evaluated for the project with mitigation measures gave a total
negative iilpact score of -785, while the positive impact score was +1,440, henice, the overall
impact score was +655. Therefore, the rehabilitationi of Corridor ]OA is environmentally
acceptable.
6.     Eco-Development Plan for the Rajiv Gandhi National Park, Nagarahole and
Augmentation of Infrastructure Development
6.1    Eco-Dcvelopment Plan for Rajiv Gandhi National Park, Nagarahole
The World Banki funded India Eco-Developmenlt Plan of MOEF / GOI is being implemented as a
major project in the Rajiv Gandhi National Park, Nagarahole, by the Forestry Department of
GOK. A comprehensive Management Plan was prepared for the period 2000-201 0 (Appayya
M.K., 2001) and has adopted an holistic approach to forestry management, wildlife managemenlt,
forest commilunlities and a participatory role in the relocation and resettlement of tribal people to
new sites outside the National Park. The initial Phase of the Eco-development project was
schieduled to end in 2002 but has been extended one further year to 2003.
The Forest Department is currently practising certain management activities for the Park. These
include habitat management, forest protection measures, control of poaching and illicit felling of
trees, fire control, control of illegal removal of timber, fuel wood and non-wood forest produce
(NWFP), immunisation and reduction of cattle within the Park, annual census of wild animals,
eco-tourism development and mitigation of local problems.
6.2    Augmentation of Forest Wealth and Conservation of Wildlife with funding from
KSHIP
Using the Eco-Development Management Plan (2000-20 10) as a basis, the EMPIU/PCC has
explored various options where additional capital funding under KSHIP could be used to augment
forest and wildlife conservation and protection measures with the objective to adopt a broad
approach to road rehabilitation and traffic managemeint within tile Park area. The items related to
road developmenit and forest conservationi selected for KSHIP fundinig are described below.
6.2.1 Habitat Conservation
While the F7orest Department has appreciated the initiative taken by GOK to improve State roads
under KSSIIP it has reservations over the rehiabilitationi of the 30kmin section of Corridor IOA
which passes througil the Rajiv Gandli National lPark, Nagaralhole. I-lowever, following,
discussions between the EMPIU and the Chief Wildlife Warden of the Karnataka Forest
Departmeint, the office of the l'CCF (Wilcllife) has granted conditional clearance for the
impi-ovemilenit of State l-lighway Corr-idor ]OA through the Park, subject to thc fulfilment of
various measures by KSI-11i1 (see Appendix A).
6.2.2  Prevention of Accidental Deaths of l'ark Wildlife
In order to fuilfil the various conditionis required by the PCCF (wildlife) beforc full clearance is
granited for the reliabilitationi of Corridor I OA throughI the Park, the EMPlU/I'CC has developed a
compromilise design whicih is not as extensive as that norimially used for KSHIlP road rehabilitationi.
This compromise design is restricted to the existing forimation of the road and provides a good

Imiprovemncnt Project                     wthich passes througlh Rajiv Gandhi ANationial Park, ANagaralhole
riding surface witlh adequate camber augmiienlted withi shoulders and drainage to prevenit road
damagnc and soil erosion. The corridor relhabilitation will facilitate the use of road ftriliture and
other road safety requirements. A cross-section of the road design proposed for the corridor is
given in Figure 7 (see page 20 above).
This design will allow for implementation of the mitigationi measures adopted for traffic
manlagemienlt, such as road furniture, safety barriers, etc. The road thius improved wvill require
annual maintenianlce limited to pothole filling and minlor repairs. Details of the design proposed
for Corridor I OA are given in Section 5.4.6 above.
6.2.3  lilegal activities
The Eco-Development management plan refers to the man/flora/fauna conflicts. Poachinig and
smuggling of timber/forest wealth are important among them. It is incorrect to presume that good
roads will contribute to increases in poaching or the smuggling of timber. Road improvemenit
activities are not limited to the corridor. Under the holistic approach adopted for road
improvemilenit, capital investments are also being provided for forest and game roads to ensure
better patrolling, funds for purchiase of communication sets such as mobile wireless sets, two way
radios, protective clothing and security measures. (check posts, gates and cabins) It is expected
that implemilenitation of these measures together with effective patrolling by the Forest Departmenlt
will reduce the threat of poachinig and timber smuggling.
6.2.4  Development of Fuel Wood Plantations and Minor Forest Produce
Corridor I OA passes primarily thirough the tourist and core zones, where the level of patrolling
and security is high compared to the fringe areas. Moreover, under thle Eco-development
management plan, a participatory approach and joint forest management practices are being
adopted to encourage the development of minor forest produce and fuel wood plantations. KSHIP
also envisages making one-off capital investments for plantation programmes in the habitat
manipulation and restoration zones throughi which the project corridor also passes.
6.2.5  Protection of Animal Crossings
The corridor passes through a sensitive zone for wildlife safety and it is important that adequate
protection and security measures are adopted at animal crossings to reduce road kill (see
Appendix D). The main issues of concerin in thils regard are Speed and Traffic Control. It would
be impractical attempt to guide animiial movements as Park fauna have been crossing over the
project corridor for more than 40 years. Therefore it is important that speed and traffic regulation
measures are implemented. Details of these measures are given in Items 5.4.5, 5.4.6 and Figures
8.1/8.2 above.
6.2.6  Tourism Promotion
Tourisimi hias been promoted in a co-ordiniated maninicr in the National Park but is restrictcd to the
T-ourist Zone. I'resently, ulider an Eco-touLisiII venturc by thie Forest Department, thcre is one
Jungle Lodge that caters for local and foreigil tourists. In addition, several private resorts have
been established. The Tourist featurcs that have becn selected for fundinig unlder- KSI-IIP includc
the following:
*     Forest Roads
20km of forest roads in the Tourist zone ranges of Dodda Byraniia Kuppe and Anthiarasanithic
require mainitenianice to facilitate the moveml1enit of Departmenit vehicles and effective patrolliig.

Improvement Project                      ithlilc passes through Rajiv Gandhi National Park, ANagarahole
The forest roads near Sunkadakatte and Balle should be accorded priority, as these are located in
tile vicinity of Corridor I OA. The estimated cost for this maintenanice is Rs. 10,500 per km.
*    Improvement of Infrastructure at Viewv-points and at Waterholes
The facilities at viewpoints and waterholes sucih as towers, bench tables, toilets, buildings,
drinlkinig water, litter bins, etc. will be improved and maintainied.
*    Removal of Weeds and Tall Grasses in View Lines
Weeds and grasses will be removed from view lines in the Tourist zone.
*    Conservation and Protection Signboards
Proper signboards withi messages on conservationi and bio-diversity will be provided.
6.2.7  Funds for Iniprovement of Water Holes
Water holes at Bisalwadi Kere (5 km from Sunkadakatte Checkpost) and Segur Kere (Km 73.8)
are located near the Project Corridor. Funds will be provided for the maintenance and desilting of
these water holes wvhich are frequented by Elephanit, Deer, Wild Pig and Gaur herds. It is
estimated that desilting and deepening of these holes would cost Rs. 1.4 lakhs each.
6.2.8  Funds for Plantations and Fodder Resources
6.2.8.1 Restorationi Zone: Plantations of about 10 hectares will be established in the restoration
zone of Metikuppe and Antharasantihe Ranges at a cost of Rs. 10,500 per ha.
6.2.8.2 Manipulation Zone: A plantation of about 5 hectares will be established in the habitat
manipulation zone of Dodda Byrannakuppe Range at a cost of Rs. 10,500 per ha.
6.2.8.3 Zones in Genteral: In addition to establishing plantations in the Park, KSHIP will provide
funds for the creation of fodder resources throughout the Park by clearance of
weeds/unsuitable growthi and restocking with grasses suitable for herbivore wildlife
grazing. The estimated cost for this process is Rs. 25,000 per ha.
6.2.9  Funds for Fire Protection Measures
Funds wvill be provided for clearing, 60km of firc lines and fire tracing, Sm wvide, including re-
sweepilig and re-burning at an estimated cost of Rs. 450 per km. Fire fightinig equipmlicnit
includin'g, pickaxes, drumils, buckets, etc. will also bc provided. A provisiolnal SUIml of Rs. 25,000
lias been allocated for these itemis.

6.2.12 Logistical Support to the Forest Department for Patrolling the Park
As well as road development within the Park, KSHIP intends to support the extension of
protection of forest resources and the augmentation of security and conservation measures. The
major items to be funded are as follows:
*      One Patrol vehicle, preferably with four wheel drive and equipped with fog and search
lights.
*      Construction of two permanent Anti-poaching camps.
*      Const-uction of two Fire Watch Towers, one each in the Core zone and Tourist zone.
*      Communication sets such as Walkie-Talkie and wireless sets.
*      Fire figlhting Equipment.
*      Maintenance of 10km of Forest Roads in the core zone in the vicinity of the Project
corridor.
*      Check posts with cabins at the entry and exit points to the core zone.
*      Unifonns and shoes for the foresters, guards and watchers.
*      Bicycles for the patrolling staff.
6.2.13 Sustainability of the Programme
It is also necessary to look into the sustainability of all the above measures. To ensure that the
mitigation measures related to improvement of infrastructure and plantation are not limited by the
KSHIP investment, another source of regular revenue has to be explored. The Forest Department
is of the same opinion and suggests that it should be authorized to collect tolls from vehicles
passing along Corridor 1OA through the National Park. The following charges could be levied:
*      Rs. 5 for 2 wheelers (motor bikes, scooters, and mopeds)
*      Rs. 20 for 4- wheelers (cars, jeeps, pick-ups, vans)
*      Rs. 25 for Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs)
*      Rs. 30 for Trucks (medium, heavy, multi-axied) and Buses
The income generated from these toll-charges could be used to meet the cost of maintenance of
the facilities mentioned above which wvill be created fiom the one off grant from KSHIP. Any
costs incurred in excess of the net collection of toll-charges would be absorbed in the annual
budget for the Park. Similarly, the Forest Department could use any surplus from the net
collection of toll-charges for Eco-development without fuirther reference to the PWD/EMP1YU
6.2.14 Budget for KSHIP Infrastructure Developiient of the National Park
T he budget detailed in Table 23 below sumimar-ises the items described above and the investments
related to forest infiastrUcture augmlentationi and conservation measures. The estimated total cost
of iiifrastructure developmzenit under KSI-lIP is approximately Rs. 39.0 Lakhs. A copy of the
Government Order fromi the Department of Forest and Ecology (Order No. FEE24 FAP 2003,
Bangalore, dated 15-02-03) has been cnclosed (see Appendix - A4). This is order stipulates the
procedure to be followed by the PCCF (WL) for implementing, under a separate Head of
Account, the mitigation nmeasures inside the Park.

CORRIDOR 10A PASSING THROUGII RAJIV GANDHI NATIONAL PARK, NAGARAHOLE
Suggestions: The road passing througlh Rajiv Gandhi National Park from Bawali to
Dommanakatte, is in very poor condition. So villagers of D.B. Kuppc Graim Panchayat
suffer from  health problems. Vehicles require 3 hours instead of I hour to reach the
destination. Road users suffer from heart problems and other healtlh problems. So we
request the concerned authority to rehabilitate the road urgently.
