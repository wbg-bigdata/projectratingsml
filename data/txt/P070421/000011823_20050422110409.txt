Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.    Introduction
Corridor 13A, also known as State Highway 95 (SH 95), commences at Ramanagar junction on
NH-4A near Londa in Belgaum District, enters Uttarakannada District and ends at Sadashivgadh,
near Karwar, close to the National Highway 17 (NH-17). The total length of this Corridor is 121
Km and it offers c onnectivity to Belgaum, Karwar and Goa. This corridor passes through the
Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and Anshi National Park. Corridor 13A has been selected for
rehabilitation under the Kamataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP).
2.     Project Road
A 28 km section of Corridor 13A i.e from chainage 55.57 Km to 83.41 Km, passes through the
Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and the Anshi National Park. The corridor traverses buffer and core
zones w ith undulating and hilly terrain t hroughout its e ntire length. T he width o f t he e xisting
carriageway varies from 3.75m to 5.5m. The section passing through the National Park and
Wildlife Sanctuary is in poor condition due to inadequate maintenance and the absence of an
overlay. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) has issued a LOU giving conditional
approval for rehabilitation of Corridor 13A through the Park (Appendix A refers). The Kamataka
State Pollution Control Board has granted clearance to the Project. About 28 Km of Corridor 13A
passes through the National Park. Construction of this section merits the utmost care and safety
measures. Construction activities within the Park will include the following:
*      Scarification of the road surface - bituminous layer.
*      Removal of debris and scarified bituminous layer.
*      Movement of Construction vehicles canrving construction materials such as earth-fill,
base, sub-base, bitumen, etc. into the Park and removing unsuitable/surplus materials
from the Park.
*      Movement of essential construction equipment such as pavers, road rollers and concrete
mixers.
*      Road pavement laying.
*      Repair of bridges/culverts.
*      Maintenance of carriageway for traffic movements.
3.     Baseline Environmental Situation
The corridor is located in the Westem Ghats edge of the Kamataka plateau and passes through
gently undulating and hilly terrain.
The high Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) level within the park is mainly due to the poor road
condition. Daytime noise levels exceed the limit prescribed for sensitive and residential zones.
The water quality of the four water bodies tested indicates that they were within the surface water
standard limits.
The vegetation in this stretch is a mix of tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen and moist deciduous
forests with intermittent patches of plantations carried out by the forest department. The typical
South Indian type of fauna is seen in this park and is not so diverse as compared to other parks.
The animals found in these parks are Elephant, Gaur, Sambhar, Mouse Deer, Tigers, Black
Panther and Giant squirrel. A variety of bird species are seen in the Park. Reptiles like Cobra,
Vipers, Kraits and Green snakes are also seen in the forests. Three locations have been identified
where animal movements have been observed.
Eco-tourism is being promoted in a coordinated manner in these two parks. Ulvi village which is
about 22 Km from the Project Corridor is famous for its Channabasaveshwara temple. An annual
festival is held at Ulvi in February and March. About one-lakh pilgrims participate in this festival.

Improvement Project                          Corrudorl3A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
The Forest Department along with the District Administration makes extensive arrangements to
regulate pilgrim movement and protect and prevent pilferage of Forest resources during the
festival period.
4.     Public Consultations
Forest Officials including the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), NGOs and local
community leaders, stakeholders and residents were consulted for their opinions on the present
environment problems and on potential rehabilitation of the project road with mitigation
measures. About 37 persons were consulted at Kumbarawada and Ulvi places located on project
road on 31/12/2002, 01/01/2003 and one interested party at Mysore on 03/01/03. All were in
favour of improving the road with adequate protection of the ecology of the parks.
5.    Impact Assessment and Mitigation Measures
The main impacts due to the project on land resources, air quality, water quality, noise levels and
safety and most importantly protection and conservation of the wildlife and floral wealth of the
National Parks were assessed. Suitable mitigation measures have been formulated to protect the
environment and ecology of the national parks. Separate budgetary provisions have been made to
augment the forest and wildlife conservation and protection measures in the Park. To mitigate the
impacts caused on the Park environment during project implementation, the following measures
would be implemented:
•  The road rehabilitation design has been simplified and the improvements are restricted to the
existing formation width with required camber and shoulder strengthening. Traffic calning
measures have been included in the road design to enhance the protection of wild life. To
ensure the safety of the wild animals crossing the road and to alert and slow down the
vehicles approachuig these areas Rumble strips have been included in the design at
these locations.
*  Conditions have been specified in the Bid Documents that make it mandatory on the
Contractor to implement environment protection measures in the Park Area that include
specific conditions on construction scheduling, storage of aggregate, debris management, site
security, p ollution abatement m easures, traffic m anagement and movement of construction
vehicles and construction zone and road users safety.
* Construction working schedules would be implemented in a manner so that not to impact on
the Park's flora and fauna. No construction related activity would be allowed to continue after
4.00 p.m. in the Park area. Adequate signboards and Caution boards would be installed to
guide vehicular movement during nighttime in areas where animal movements have been
observed.
* Approved borrow pits and quarries would be used for construction purposes and must be
located outside the National Park. Quarries and borrow pits would be acceptably rehabilitated
after completion of the construction work.
. Static Construction Equipment/Machinery such as Asphalt and Hot Mix Plants, Stone
Crushers, etc. would be located outside the Park.
* The aggregate and earth material would be properly stockpiled in designated area to prevent
erosion and run off related problems.
All debris or waste materials would be disposed outside the Park.
Construction workers camps would be located outside the Park. The Contractor will ensure
that the workforce does not resort to tree felling and collection of firewood or fallen branches
in the Park precincts.
Construction of Toll gates at entry and exit points and regulating night time traffic .

6. Integration of Park Management Plan and Park infrastructure augmentation and
Conservation under KSHIP:
The Karnataka forest department has been involved throughout in the process of
preparation of EIA, EMP report. The recommendation of the concerned wildlife wardens
and PCCF have been considered in general and also developmental works in Park Area
and traffic safety in particular.
The KSHIP has explored the various areas where Capital investment can be made to augment the
park's forest and wildlife Conservation and Protection Measures and in the process adopt a
holistic approach to road rehabilitation and traffic management in conformity to the Management
Plan of the National Park. A budgetary provision of about Rs. 39.46 Lakhs has been made under
KSHIP to develop Park infrastructure and augment conservation and eco-development activities
in the Park. The MoEF while according clearance has supported the mitigation measures
suggested by the PCCF and Park authorities. The budgetary provision of Rs. 39.46 Lakhs
addresses, the mitigation measures and conditions stipulated by MoEF. Some of the Salient
measures are listed in Section 5.
7.     Environmental Management Plan
An Environmental Management Plan has been formulated in tune with the requirements of the
Project Activities and necessity for protection of the ecological resources of the corridor.
Activities to be executed both inside and outside the Park have been fully emphasized. All
necessary precautions to be taken to protect the flora and fauna of the park have been included
with special emphasis on construction scheduling. The Environmental Management Plan will
guide and control the project implementation in the Project Corridor. The EMP would be an
integral part of the Contract.
8.     Institutional Set-up, Environmental Monitoring and Training
The KSHIP Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has a fully established Environmental
Management Plan Implementation Unit (EMPIU) that would supervise the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) implementation in the Project Corridor.
The frequency and duration of monitoring, number of locations selected and record keeping
procedures to be followed during project implementation has been defined. If any procedure does
not conform to the prescribed standard, it will be further monitored and corrected.
Training on basic road construction techniques and related environmental impacts would be
required for the Forest Officers and Park Rangers. This would facilitate e ffective c oordination
between the Forest Department and the PWD for future maintenance of the corridor.
One Assistant Environmental Engineer has been appointed exclusively for monitoring the Project
road along w ith f ew R ehabilitation roads p assing t hrough w estern g hat. I n a ddition one forest
official from PRU will visit the Project road every month and will appraise the PRJ for taking mid
course corrections if any.
9. Budgets for EMP Implementation
The cost estimate for EMP implementation for the section of Corridor 13A which passes through
the Park is Rs. 20 lakhs.
10. Conclusion
The Park revenue will improve following road rehabilitation and in turn this increment in
revenue would result in better park management and benefit eco-tourism being promoted
in the Park. Strict implementation of the various mitigation measures would not only
benefit the regional and local economy but also ensure sustainable development of the
surrounding region.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR THE SEGMENT OF
CORRIDOR 13A WHICH PASSES THROUGH DANDELI WILDLIFE SANCTUARY
AND ANSHI NATIONAL PARK
1.     General
The Kamataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) is an initiative of the Public
Works Department (PWD) of the Govemment of Kamataka (GoK), under financial assistance
from the World Bank, to improve 2300 km of State Highways and Major District Roads. The
KSHIP Corridors are shown in Figure 1.
Corridor 13A, also known as State Highway 95 (SH 95), commences from Ramanagar
junction on N1-4A near Londa in Belgaum District, enters Uttara Kannada District and ends
at Sadashivgadh, near Karwar, close to the National Highway 17 (NH-17). This Corridor
offers connectivity to major economic centers namely, Belgaum, Karwar and Goa. The total
length of this Corridor is about 121 Km. The southern section of the corridor (about 28km)
passes through the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and Anshi National Park. This Environmental
Assessment (EA) study/report covers the 28Km section of the corridor through the Park and
has been prepared in conformation with Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) and
World Bank guidelines. Corridor 13A is shown in Figure 2. The section Corridor 13A
passing through the National Park is shown in Figure 3.
2. Project Description
2.1 Description of the Project Corridor
Corridor 13A passes through Joida Taluk, Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka State. Dandeli
Wildlife sanctuary is located at the latitudinal range from 14°12' to 15'12'N and the
longitudinal range from 74°16' to 74°44'E. Anshi National Park is located at a distance of
about 60 km from Dandeli and 35 kms from Karwar. The latitudinal range is from 140 54'N
to 15° 0 7'N and the longitudinal range is from 74° 1 5'E to 74°30'E. Within the National
Park, the corridor passes through the following Park zones:
a) Buffer Zone
About 5 Km of Corridor 13A passes through Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary. Kumbarwada
village comes under this zone. This zone is interspersed with strips of teak plantations and
agricultural lands.
b) Core Zone
A length of about 23 Km of Coridor 13A between Km 60.75 near Kaneri River Bridge and
Km 83.41 passes through this zone of Anshi National Park. Anshi village is located in this
zone.

Karnataka State Highways                    Environmental Assessment Reportfor the Segment of
Improvement Project                         Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
Existing Road Conditions
The established ROW  width of Corridor 13A varies between 18.00 m to 26.00 m, the
carriageway width varies from 3.75m to 5.50m. Except for a few sections, the corridor
passing through the National Park is damaged due to lack of maintenance and absence of an
overlay. Cracking, potholes and ravelling occur along the entire length. The deterioration of
the pavement and edge failures is mainly due to raised earthen shoulders. The presence of
water in the pavement structure has also weakened the sub-grade and pavement deformation
has taken place. Figure 5 shows the damaged condition of the existing Carriageway. Keeping
in view the sensitive of the area simplified and site specific rehabilitation design has been
prepared for this corridor which restricts construction activities within the available formation
width.
Following activities will be carried to improve the Project road condition.
*      Scarification of the road surface - bituminous layer.
Removal of debris and scarified bituminous layer.
*      Movement of Construction vehicles carrying construction materials such as earth-fill,
base, sub-base, bitumen, etc. into the Park and removing unsuitable/surplus materials
from the Park.
Movement of essential construction equipment such as pavers, road rollers and
concrete mixers.
*      Road pavement laying.
*      Repair of bridges/culverts.
*      Maintenance of carriageway for traffic movements.
2.2 Projected Traffic
Traffic surveys conducted during 1999 revealed that around 694 vehicles (Buses-16%, LCVs-
11% and 2Axle Trucks-36%) per day were using the corridor. Table - 2 below shows the
anticipated growth of traffic in these routes from 1999 to 2004.

Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
2.3 Legal Clearance Requirements
The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the State Authority on Forest & Ecology
cleared the project corridor 13A including the segment of road passing through parks area as
part of phase 2 roads.
The MOEF New Delhi cleared corridor 13 A barring 28 ktns stretch through the park area and
requested KSHIP to submit a separate EIA and EMP for this stretch of road.
A separate EIA EMP report for 28 kms of road was submitted to MOEF, New Delhi. The
proposal was referred to the standing committee of the National Board for Wild Life, which
reviewed the reports and visited the park area and project road and recommended the MOEF
to clear the project proposal. The MOEF has communicated the matter to the Chief Warden
Wild Life of the Government of Kamataka (See in Appendix A3).
Keeping the legal requirements in perspective and policies related to road improvement in
sensitive areas, the following parameters have been adhered to finalise the project design:
1. The activity should be restricted only to the existing road and no further acquisition of
land or felling of trees be allowed.
2. The r econstruction and r ehabilitation exercise o f t he r oad s hould b e o f highest quality
feasible so that no repairs be required for next 8-12 years causing frequent disturbance to
the habitat.
3. The actual repair work should start only when the required material/equipment has been
mobilised so that the work is carried out in the park for minimum possible time. All
labour camps, crushers etc. should be located outside the DWLW and ANP areas.
4. For providing safety to the crossing animals and avoid road accidents speed
breakers/rumble strips be constructed at the identified locations of the animal movements.
Enough hoardings and signages may also be put up for the public and vehicles.
5. The C WLW, K amataka, has recommended for providing fund for the development of
Park and Sanctuary. The KSHIP has also agreed for providing Rs. 34.51 lakh to the
Forest Department. The team while endorsing the view of the CWLW suggests that 5% of
the cost of the project or Rs. 35.00 lakhs whichever is higher should be made available by
the KSHEP to the Forest Department for the developmental activities of the Park and
Sanctuary as proposed by CWLW in this letter dated 29/11/2001.
6. The two toll gates be established at both the entry points of the patch of the road passing
through DLWS and ANP at the cost of the project. The Forest Department be allowed to
collect toll from the vehicles passing through the corridor. This money also be utilised by
the Wildlife authorities for maintenance of Park and Sanctuary.
7. The traffic in the stretch of road passing through DWLS and ANP after sunset and before
sunrise would be regulated by the Forest Department
The design details are discussed in Section 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 of this Report.
3.     Baseline Environmental Set up
3.1    Physical Resources
The physical resources refer to physiography, geology, climate, drainage-systems and soil
characteristics. These characteristics are described in the following paragraphs:
3.1.1  Physiography
The corridor is located in the Western Ghats edge of the Kamataka plateau and passes
through gently undulating and hilly terrain.

Improvement Project                        Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli WSildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
3.1.2 Geology and Pedology
Rock: The geology of the corridor constitutes rock types of Archaean Complex. These rocks
are made up of granites and schists, and also peninsular gneiss.
Soil: Three soil types are seen along the corridor:
i) Latentic Soil
ii) Yellow loamy soil and
iii) Black cotton Soil.
The soils vary in depth according to elevation and aspect, being shallow on hilltops and ridges
but deep in valleys and lower slopes.
3.1.3  Climate
Rainfall: The project area is exposed to torrential thundershowers commencing from April -
May, very heavy showers in June - August and also during October with heavy showers. It
receives relatively high annual rainfall averaging about 5000 mm at Anshi region and
relatively less rainfall at Kumbarwada, which is around 2000 mm, which comes under
Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary.
Temperature: The project area has generally moderate termperature with a maximum of
34.40C and a minimum of 2.1 °C.
Wind: Two monsoon winds blow over the Park. They are the South-westerly Wind between
June and September and the Northeasterly Wind between September and December.
Humidity: The relative humidity ranges from 63% to 65%. The park area is less humid
compared to the coastal region.
3.2    Environmental Features
3.2.1 Ambient Air and Noise Quality
Ambient air quality monitoring and noise level measurements were carried out in the corridor.
Two monitoring locations were identified for measurement of ambient air quality, AQ I and
AQ 2 and also for measurement of ambient noise quality, NQ I and NQ 2. The Ambient Air
quality monitoring was carried out during 9d" - 12ih January 2003. Details of the air and noise
monitoring locations are given in Table 4 below. The locations are shown in Figure 6.

The results indicate that the corridor experiences increasing dust formation. Apart from dust,
all other parameters are within the prescribed limits. The increased level of dust is due to the
poor road conditions with exposed aggregates and damaged shoulders.
iii) Ambient Noise Quality Result -
Noise monitoring locations were identified for the project area (see Table 6 above) and the
results of noise quality tests are given in Table 6 below.

The results indicate that the corridor water quality is within the surface water standard limits.
The domestic activities of local people near water bodies resulted in decreased DO with
increase in BOD along with COD and total Coliforms. Traces of Manganese were also
observed. I t i s due t o the weathering of r ocks that release M anganese particles. However,
these parameters do not affect the wild life in the corridor.
3.3    Drainage System
The project area is characterised by the seasonal west flowing rivers, streams and rivulets.
Kaneri River flows across the project corridor. Supa reservoir is also accessible through the
Project corridor.
3.4    Ecological Resources of the National Park
The Park's floral bio-diversity is wide and well represented. Typical south Indian type of
wildlife is seen in the Parks.
3A.1 Flora of the National Parks
Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary
The vegetation in this stretch is a mix of tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen and moist
deciduous forests with intermittent patches of plantations carried out by the forest department.
The canopy of the moist deciduous forest is relatively open, less stratified and the shrub layer
is better developed compared to evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. A list of flora is given
in Appendix - B1.
Anshi National Park
The park has a rich floral wealth. The crown density is above 40%. There is wide species
diversity in the canopy composition. Artocarpus hirsutus, Calophyllum polyanthum,
Diospyros ebenum, Diospyros malabarica, Hopea ponga and Vateria indica are some of the
common species. As the intensity of light and degree of humidity vary within the forest,
plants that can carry out metabolic activities at these levels form strata or storeys. This type of
tree canopy is characterized by species like Beilschmiedia dalzelli, Cinnamomum
malabatrum, Cryptocarya procera etc.
The evergreen forest is replete with large woody liana that spiral to the canopy. Shrubs are
frequent in these forests. The common shrub species are Eugenia macrosepala, Ixora
nigricans, Memnecylon terminale, Terminalia dillenia pentagyna etc. The weeds Eupatoriumn,
Choromolaena odorata, Lantana camara and Partheniwun have been found inside the Park.
The weed Macaranga peltata is found along the project road. A list of flora is given in
Appendix - B2.

Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
3.4.2 Fauna of the National Parks
Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary
The fauna is not so diversified as compared to other National Parks. The animals found in this
sanctuary are Elephant, Gaur, Sambhar, Mouse Deer, Black Panther, Porcupine, Giant
Squirrel, wildcat and civet cat. A variety of birds including red jungle fowl, Malabar pied
Hombill and some migratory birds are also found in the sanctuary. Reptiles like Cobra, King
Cobra, Vipers, Kraits and Green snakes are also seen in the forests. The fauna found in this
Sanctuary is listed in Appendix - Cl.
Anshi National Park
The typical South Indian type of fauna is seen in this park. Camivores constitute a major part
of it. These camivores include Black Panthers, Tigers, Indian Wild Boar, Wild dog, Indian
fox, Bear, Common Giant squirrel, porcupine etc. Indian Elephants and spotted deer are also
found in the park. Avifaunal survey has indicated the presence of 197 bird species belonging
to 45 families, out of which 19 species are endemic. The park is also a habitat for four
threatened bird species. These are the Nilgiri wood Pigeon, Malabar Grey Hombill, Ceylon
Frog Mouth and Broad tailed grass warbler. Yellow-legged green pigeon, great black
woodpecker and heart spotted woodpecker constitute other i mportant birds. Pythons, King
Cobras, Green snakes, and Vipers etc represent reptiles. The detailed list of fauna of this
National Park is given in Appendix - C2.
3.4.3 Animal Movements/ Crossings and Corridors
The animals that are seen crossing the road during the late evenings and early mornings are
Spotted Deer, Sambhar and Snakes. Forest officials informed on very rare occasions during
nighttime leopards have been sighted. The adjoining forest is very dense with adequate
number of water holes so the animals are seldom seen in vicinity of the road.
The EMPIU/PCC, with the help of the Park staff, have identified 3 locations between Km 60
and Km 80 where animal crossings are observed along the project corridor. These 3 crossing
locations are in the Core Zone. Locations of animal crossings are detailed in Table 9 below.
These locations are shown in Figure 7.
Table - 9: Locations of Animal Crossings on Corridor 13A

One can also note that except for one location, all the other crossings are the perennial
streams. No cases have been reported of herd animals being hit by vehicles. The Forest
Department Officials informed that in the last five years no accidental death of wild animals
have been reported on the Project Corridor. In all these locations the natural terrain prevents
speeding. Yet it is important that adequate protection and speed control measurers are
adopted.

Karnataka State Highways                       Environmental Assessment Reportfor the Segment of
Improvement Project                           Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
3.5     Human Use Values
3.5.1  Land Use
The Park area is interspersed with human settlements and the villagers practice agriculture.
The soil type varies from Black cotton to loamy soils also supports agriculture. Kumbharwada
is the only major settlement in the Park and some amount of farming activity is seen. No other
settlement or farmland is located in vicinity of the Project corridor.
3.5.2  Crops
The cultivation takes place during June to December. The agriculture is mainly rain fed but
irrigation is seen in few pockets. The main agricultural crop is Jowar and the commercial crop
is Sugar cane. Plantains are also seen in pockets.
3.6    Social Environment
3.6.1  Population
Corridor 13A functions as a connector to various other settlements located in more interior
parts of the sanctuary. There are about 248 hamlets comprising about 30 villages with a total
population of about 15,000 residing inside the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary. The Anshi
National Park contains 12 villages covering about 20 hamlets with a total population of about
3,600. The main occupation of these communities is agriculture and the majority of the Pawk's
inhabitants are not educated.
Tribal settlements
Tribal settlements are scattered throughout the Park and are represented by a few families. No
tribal settlements were observed near the project corridor. The Park administration is carrying
out rehabilitation of tribal families and the improvement of the project corridor would not
affect the livelihood of these communities.
3.6.2 Tourism in the Park Area
The tourism industry is a major revenue earner for Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary. Forest Lodges
and Rest Houses have come up in the vicinity of the Reserve Forests adjoining the sanctuary.
Anshi National Park has not gained much publicity in terms of tourism but Eco-tourism and
Nature education' camps are being promoted by the Forest Department and a Nature
Education Centre has been constructed to create awareness among eco-tourists and students
through adventure trails, camps, etc.
There is one Temple in the Park dedicated to Sri Channabasaveshwara, which is located at
Srikshetra - Ulvi. The Temple is shown in Figure 8. Ulvi village is situated at about 24 km
east of Project Corridor from Anshi village. There are also 5 ancient caves of tourist
attraction, located near Ulvi. A festival is held at Ulvi in February and March in which about
one lakh people participate.
3.6.3  Park Resources and their Conservation
The Park is rich in floral diversity. Felling of trees and theft of Minor Forest Produce has been
observed in fringes of the Park not near to the project area. The Park authorities informed that
no incidents of poaching have been reported in the park in the past five years.

Karnataka State Highways                      Environmental Assessnient Reportfor the Segmnent of
Improvement Project                           Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
The Park administration is responsible for protection and conservation of the Park resources.
Many pilgrims come to Ulvi Shrine during the festival in February and camp near the temple.
The Forest Department takes many preventive measures with the help of the District
Administration to protect the Forest Resources and prevent felling of tree and theft of Minor
Forest Produces during the Ulvi festival period.
Protection Measures taken by Forest Department include:
1. Establishing Additional Check posts in the Parks.
2. Temporary check posts on roads leading to Ulvi shrine are established by neighbouring
forest divisions.
3. Spreading awareness among pilgrims and eliciting their cooperation for protecting the
forest resources by means of Newspapers, TV and Radio broadcasts.
4. Deployment of additional forest p ersonnel from other F orest Divisions with required
infrastructure support and wireless sets.
5. Arrangement for public sale of Minor Forest produces at Government rates.
6. Instructions to the state Transport system to check and prevent transport of felled and
smuggled forest resources.
7. Co-ordination between the various Government Departments and the Temple Trust
Committee under the directions of the Assistant Commissioner, Karwar sub-division. The
Temple Trust is entrusted with the responsibility of managing the pilgrims, providing
facilities to the pilgrims.
8. Firewood for cooking is procured from the Forest Department's Karwar Division.
9. Police forces are deployed in addition to the forest staff for maintaining law and order
during the festival.
10. The Veterinary Department undertakes vaccination of the cattle brought to the fair.
The Management Practices adopted by the Park authorities are covered in Section 6 of this
Report.
4.     Public Consultation
The EMPIU/PCC undertook extensive field visits and held focussed consultations with the
local community, forest officials and local NGOs involved in Conservation Activities.
Public consultations were carried out to ascertain opinions on environmental protection,
environmental conditions/features along the corridor and the merits and issues related to road
rehabilitation. Records of public meetings and other activities, communications and
comments/suggestions were made (Appendix - G refers).
The consultation process gave valuable insights and inputs to formulate requisite mitigation
measures for the protection and conservation of wildlife and the Park environment. These
consultations brought forth the concems and requirements of Forest Department officials with
relation to rehabilitation of the corridor within the National Park. Their comments /
suggestions have been recorded (Appendix - G refers). Table 10 below gives details of the
Public Consultations.

Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
5.     Impact Assessment and Mitigation Measures
Impacts anticipated due to Road Design, during Construction and Operation phase of the
Project Corridor on the physical, biotic and abiotic components are discussed in this section.
The mitigation measures to be employed to reduce pollution and prevent pollution of the
various environmental resources are also detailed in this section.
5.1 Impacts due to Road Design
5.1.1 Proposed Road Rehabilitation Design
The corridor passes through Dandeli Wildlife sanctuary and Anshi National Park, keeping in
view the ecology of the area, the road rehabilitation design has been simplified and the cross
section has been reduced to the existing formation width. No tree felling or widening of the
existing formation is involved in the proposed design.
The road rehabilitation design involves improvement of the existing pavement surface and
camber improvement with shoulder strengthening. The proposed design is detailed below.
i)     Profile correction at the existing surface camber to the rehabilitation design cambers
using Bituminous Macadam (BM).
ii)    Overlay consisting of 50 mm Bituminous Macadam followed by 30 mm Mixed Seal
Surfacing (MSS).
iii)   Earthen shoulders to the new road level with adequate cross-fall to drain surface
water.
iv)    Grading of land between shoulders and ditches (Fire line trench) to allow surface run
off.
A typical cross section of the proposed rehabilitation road design is shown in Figure a hel.w.

5.1.2 Safety Parameters included in the Design
Three locations have been identified along the Project Corridor where Animal crossings have
been observed. To ensure the safety of the wild animals crossing the road and to alert and
slow down the vehicles approaching these areas, traffic-calming measures have been included
in the design. Rumble strips have been included in the design at these locations. Figure 10
shows the rumble strip design proposed for such locations. Adequate road furniture and
signage have been included to caution and alert the road users. The proposed Road signage is
shown in Figure 11 & 12.

5.2    Impact Assessment and Mitigation Measures during the Construction Phase
The road corridor passes through the National Park therefore to minimize impacts on the
forest w ealth a nd t o r educe p ollution during c onstruction related a ctivities a 11 borrow pits,
quarries, stone crushing units, hot mix plants, construction materials bulk storage areas,
construction workers camps etc., are to be located outside the National Park and at least 500
m from existing settlements in the downwind direction.
5.2.1 Impact on Land Resources
The local rock is granite and, if properly selected, adequate quality and quantity is available
for all purposes requiring broken or crushed rock. Borrow pits, Sand sources and Granite and
Moorum quarries located outside the Park boundaries have been identified.
Details of existing local quarries/borrow pits used for the extraction of rock for crushing,
natural gravel (moorum), sand and water sources are furnished in Table 11 below. The
reddish brown natural gravel (moorum) that has been identified at various sources has a CBR
varying from 9.60% to 14.50%. Sufficient moorum of good quality is easily available for all
purposes as filling materials. Clean river and stream sand sources of good quality were
identified having fines less than 2.0%, and available in sufficient quantity for all construction
purposes.

5.5 Km
9       Valipa Kumbli Sand Source is at a distance of 6.0 Km from Link Ch: 5.5 Km
The construction activities would be scheduled between 8 .00 a .m. and 4.00 p .m. No work
would be allowed beyond the specified time. The other components to be impacted upon and
mitigation measures to be employed during construction phase are elaborated in the
subsequent sections.
5.2.2  Impact on Air Quality
Air quality will be affected by dust (suspended particulate matter) generated by vehicular
movements during construction activities such as earthworks, hauling and tipping of materials.
The impact during construction would be localized, temporary and confined to the construction
area. The monitored data of ambient air quality indicates that, in the present situation, (pre-project)
the concentration of dust is greater than the standard limits and it will inevitably increase during
project implementation.
Dust formation along the corridor during construction would be controlled by spraying water
from bowsers on the road pavement and other exposed construction areas.
By taking the average Emission Factor (Source: Indian Institute o f P etroleum) a s g iven i n
Table 12 below for each type of vehicle, the polltition load measured in tons per kilometer per
day in the corridor can be calculated.

Along the entire corridor, the existing pollution load is very small although the condition of
the carriageway is poor and the shoulders are damaged. However, improvement of the road
will help to reduce vehicular pollution.
5.2.3 Impact on Water Environment
Rivers, streaiiu and ponds along the comdor could be affected by dust, spillage of oil and
construction materials and polluted water during construction operations.
The mitigation measures include:
1. Care must be taken during water sprinkling and spraying to control dust so that excessive
amount of water is not used and that contamination of adjacent water bodies and ground water
does not occur.
2. The stream courses and ditches will be kept free from dumping of road debris and earth
material.
3. Cross Drainage rehabilitation works will be carried out during dry season.
5.2.4 Impact on Noise Levels
Increase in noise is anticipated due to movement of construction vehicles and noise generated
due to Construction equipment. The mitigation measures include:
1. All construction vehicles, machinery and equipment deployed in the construction area will
be maintained in good condition.
2. The construction activities would be scheduled between 8.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. No work
would be allowed beyond the specified time.
5.2.5 Impact on Soil Quality
No impact on the soil quality is anticipated. The borrow material would be sourced from
outside the Park boundaries from licensed borrow areas and moorum quarries. The aggregate
and earth material would be properly stockpiled in designated area to prevent erosion and run
off related problems.

Improvement Project                         Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
5.2.6 Impact on Biological Environment - Flora and Fauna
The Park flora would not be impacted by construction activities along the corridor as no tree
cutting or pruning is required. The aesthetic appearance of the flora may change for a
temporary period due to deposition of dust on the leaves and foliage. This also would get
washed away with the first monsoon showers.
The movements of Park fauna across the corridor are more at nighttime. No construction
related activity would be allowed to continue after 4.00 p.m. in the Park area. Adequate
signboards and Caution boards would be installed to guide vehicular movement during
nighttime in areas where animal movements have been observed.
5.2.7 Traffic Management and Safety Aspects
Short-term impact associated with this project will be traffic management during the
Construction Phase. Road markers, safety appurtenances and safety signage will be displayed
in the construction area and advance warning signs will be established to forewarn the
incoming traffic about the Construction zone. The workers would be provided with adequate
safety gadgets and accessories for protection during the construction activity. The Contractor
with the approval of the KSHIP Site Engineer and forest officials will workout site-specific
safety measures during construction.
5.2.8 Social Impacts during Construction Phase
Local settlements and populace would not be affected by the project, as they are located 1 to 2
Km from the project corridor in the Park. Moreover there is no land acquisition or
displacement involved in this stretch. The construction activity can provide temporary
employmnirt to the unskilled workers residing in the nearby settlements and villages.
The well being of construction workers will depend upon the basic amenities and health
facilities offered to them at the construction camps located outside the park boundary.
Adequate sanitary facilities, water supply, electricity, provision of Kerosene for cooking,
medical facilities, solid waste management at Camp sites and proper dwelling units should
ensure good living conditions and enhanced quality of life for the Construction workers at the
Camp. The Contractor will ensure that the workforce does not resort to tree felling and
collection of firewood or fallen branches in the Park precincts.
53     Impact Assessment during the Operation Phase and Mitigation Measures
The operation phase impacts mainly arise due to increment in vehicular movements and the
resultant increase in the tourist inflow in the region. The rehabilitated road would benefit in
terms of tourism revenue and would indirectly contribute in educating the tourists and road
users in valuing the diverse ecological resources of Dandeli and Anshi national Parks. The
Kamataka Forest department is promoting Eco-tourism in a big way and would also benefit in
terms of additional revenue generated by means of Eco-tourism, nature education camps and
adventure trails etc. The impact on other physical components and measures to mitigate the
impacts are detailed below.
5.3.1 Impact on Air Quality
Increased traffic following road improvement will lead to increase in air pollution along
Corridor 13A. Dust entrainment would be considerably reduced due to improved road surface
and c ompacted earthen shoulders. Periodical air monitonng will be c arried out. Necessary
action will be taken by routinely checking loaded/unloaded trucks and other vehicles.

Improvenient Project                        Corridor 13A which passes through Dandel, Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
5.3.2  Impact on Water Resources and Water Quality
There would be no negative impact on the Park's water bodies and river systems following
completion of construction works. The improved Cross Drainage Structures of the
rehabilitated road would reduce soil erosion along the corridor. This in tum would
significantly decrease contamination or siltation of water bodies.
5.3.3  Impact on Noise level
Increase in vehicular traffic numbers in the Operation Phase will increase ambient noise
levels along the corridor. Caution Sign boards and checking of Vehicles emitting loud noise
and of poor maintenance should be carried out with the help of the Transport Department.
5.3.4 Soil Quality
The road rehabilitation treatment does not include raising of embankment and is limited to
profile correction and improved earthen shoulders to the new road level. Grading of land
between shoulders and ditches would prevent pooling of water and resultant run off and soil
erosion. There would be no impact on the soil quality during operation phase.
5.3.5 Impact on Biological Environment - Flora and fauna
The improved road surface would result in speeding of vehicles. Adequate Caution and
warning boards, infonnation boards with messages to protect Wildlife would be installed to
guide and educate the road users. The purpose is to instil awareness in the road users to slow
down on sighting any animal and allowing the animal to cross the road. Adequate traffic
calming measures in the form of rumble strips and signage depicting animal crossing would
be installed at areas where Animal movement is observed. Such locations have been identified
and adequate speed control measures have been incorporated in the road design at these
locations. Necessary design intervention and patrolling activities have been included to
prevent death of wild life due to road accidents.
5.3.6 Social Environment
During the Operation Phase, the local community would benefit in terms of better road
infrastructure and reduction in travel time to markets and district headquarters. The improved
road condition along with the road furniture would improve road safety.
5.4    Environmental Impact Evaluation
To assess the impact on the environment a matrix has been developed taking into account 12
impact areas that would be impacted due to road development. The following three scenarios
have been assessed:
1. No Project
2. Project without Implementation of Mitigation Measures
3. Project With Implementation of Mitigation Measures
A weighted scheme approach has been adopted. This approach is based on the s urmise to
assess quantitatively the impact and weight of that impact value by its significance or its
importance. T he i mpact criteria were selected b ased on the I ocation and sensitivity of the
Project area, biotic and biotic components to be impacted upon by the Project, conservation of
forest resources and wildlife and anticipated impacts on human use, tourism and road
rehabilitation design under consideration.
The purpose is to facilitate Environmental Impact Analysis to define two parameters of each
action that may have an impact on the environment. The first parameter is Magnitude (M) of

Karnataka Slate Highlways                     En vironmental Assessment Report for the Segmenit of
Improvement Project                          Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
the impact upon the environment. The term magnitude is used in the sense of Extensiveness
or scale. The second is the weighting of the degree of "importance"(W) i.e. significance of the
particular action on the environmental factor in the specific instance under analysis. As scale
of 1-5 has been used for the two components i.e. Magnitude and Importance. A (+) sign
preceding the Magnitude figure indicates the impact is beneficial and (-) sign indicates an
adverse impact. The scores have been assigned based on the judgment made by the PCC team
during field visits, baseline information, design considerations and prevailing and proposed
construction practices.
The product value of the Magnitude M and importance W determines the net impact of the
action on the environmental resource i.e. the impact magnitude. The total impact score of a
project altemative can be obtained by the sum of the impact magnitudes on the environmental
resources in a given scenario. Based on this approach the maximum impact score that can be
achieved is +300 i.e. a maximum impact magnitude of + 25 for each parameter and thereby
summation of 12 parameters equals +300 indicating positive and beneficial impact. Similarly
the minimum score that can be achieved is (-) 300 indicating negative and adverse impact. To
distinguish between the three scenarios and to give a qualitative aspect, the following
classification has been adopted.
Table - 14: Classification of Impacts
Type of Impact          Impact score range
Positive and Beneficial Impact   (+) 200 to (+) 300
Positive and Moderate Impact     (+) 100 to (+) 200
No appreciable Impact                  0 to (+) 99
Negative and Moderate Impact        (-) I to (-) 100
Negative and Significant lnpact   (-) 101 to (-) 199
Negative and Adverse Impact       (-) 200 to (-j 300
The impact scores obtained for the three scenarios for the project corndor are presented in
Table-15 below.
Table - 15: Impact Scores for the three considered Scenarios
Project           No         Corridor Rehabilitation          Corridor
Scenario        Project   without Mitigation Measures    Rehabilitation with
Mitigation Measures
Impact Score    (+) 46               (-) 113                   (+) 112
The detailed impact Matrix is presented in Table 16. It is clear from the scores obtained that
corridor rehabilitation with implementation of mitigation measures would have a positive and
moderate impact on the environment.
The impact scores of No Project Scenario and project with impl ientation of mitigation
measures indicate that Corridor improvement with the implementation of the various
environmental protection and conservation measures would further enhance the
environmental quality of the project area and would augment the Park infrastructure.

Karnataka State Highways                     Environmental Assessment Report for the Segment of
Improvement Project                         Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
6.     Management Plans of the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
6.1    Management Plan of the National Parks.
A comprehensive Management Plan has been formulated by the Forest Department for forestry
management, wildlife management, eco-development, Tourism and Conservation and people's
participation in Park management.
The PIU has explored the various areas where Capital investment can be made to augment the
forest and wildlife Conservation and Protection Measures and in the process adopt a holistic
approach to road rehabilitation and traffic management in conformity to the Management Plan of
the National Park
6.2    Road Rehabilitation and Habitat Conservation and Improvement Measures under
KSHIP funding
Using the Management Plans as reference documents, the EMPIU/PCC has explored various
options where additional capital funding under KSHIP could be used to augment forest and
wildlife conservation and protection with the objective to adopt a hoistic approach to road
rehabilitation and traffic management within the Park area. The items related to road development
and forest conservation selected for KSHIP funding are described below.
6.2.1 Conservation and Protection of Park's Natural Resources
To fulfil the various conditions required by the PCCF (wildlife) before full clearance is granted
for the rehabilitation of Corridor 13A through the Park, the rehabilitation design is restricted to
the existing formation of the road. The adopted design provides a good riding surface with
adequate camber augmented with shoulders and drainage to prevent road damage and soil
erosion. The corridor rehabilitation will include road furniture and other road safety requirements.
The road thus improved will require annual maintenance limited to minor repairs. Details of the
design proposed for Corridor 13A are given in Section 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.A cross-section of the road
design proposed for the corridor is given in Figure 9.
The problem of poaching and smuggling has not manifested itself to cause any concern.
Following the declaration of these reserves as Sanctuary and National Park, mining in these areas,
timber felling in the core zone a nd e xtraction o f F orest P roduce from t he core z one h as b een
stopped. The only problem faced by the forest authorities is during the U lvi Annual fair. The
shrine is located adjacent to Anshi National Park. Pilgrims have a tendency to source firewood,
timber from the forests. Pilgrims also camp along the road leading to the shrine and it is difficult
to negate the possibility that they would not resort to illegal felling or stealing timber.
Therefore to prevent such acts, the Forest Department along with the District Administration and
the Temple Trust makes elaborate arrangements to protect the Forest Resources and at the same
time create awareness among the pilgrims on the need to protect the natural resources of the Park.
The measures taken by the District Administration and Forest Department have already been
discussed in Section 3.6.3.
The point to note here is that the Project Corridor is one of the roads that offer connectivity to the
road leading to Ulvi. The problem of tree felling and timber smuggling is more in the other
connecting roads from Dandeli and Bhagawati leading to the shrine.

Karnataka State Highways                      Environmiental Assessment Reportfor the Segment of
Improvement Project                          Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
The practical measure would be to prevent camping by the roadside. Additional Campsites and
facilities should be provided and people should be educated and encouraged to use the facilities
provided at the campsite. The Forest Department and the District Administration should also
elicit the co-operation of the Ulvi Temple Trust in information dissemination and conservation
activities.
6.2.2 Development of Fuel Wood Plantations and Minor Forest Produce
Corridor 13A passes primarily through the buffer and core zones, where the level of patrolling
and security is high compared to the fringe areas. Moreover, under the Eco-development
management plan, a participatory approach and Joint Forest Management practices are being
adopted to encourage the development of minor forest produce and fuel wood plantations.
6.2.3  Protection of Animals crossing the Project Corridor
There are three animal crossing locations in the corridor that are important from wildlife safety
aspect. It is necessary that adequate protection and security measures be adopted at animal
crossings to reduce traffic related animal fatalities. The speed and safety aspects addressed as a
part of design intervention are:
*    Speed and Traffic Control
Rumnble strips are included in the Design to slow down vehicles at locations where Animal
Crossings are seen across the corridor. Details of these measures are given in section 5.1.1 and
5.1.2 above.
6.2A Tourism Promotion
Tourism has been promoted in a co-ordinated manner in the National Park but is restricted to the
Tourist Zone. Presently, under an Eco-tourism venture by the Forest Department, there is one
Jungle Lodge that caters for local and foreign tourists. In addition, a few private resorts have been
established. The Tourist features that have been selected for funding under KSHIP include the
following:
*    Forest Roads
30 Km of forest roads in the ranges of Kumbarwada, Anshi and Kadra require maintenance to
facilitate the movement of Department vehicles and effective patrolling. The forest roads in
Kumbarwada, Anshi and Kadra ranges should be accorded priority, as these are located in the
vicinity of Corridor 13A. The estimated cost for this maintenance is Rs. 10,500 per km.
*    Improvement of Infrastructure at Viewpoints
The facilities at viewpoints and waterholes such as towers, bench tables, toilets, buildings,
drinking water, litter bins, etc. will be improved and maintained. The viewpoints are given below.
1.     Supa Dam at Km stone 25.7
2.     View Point of Supa reservoir at Km stone 41.8
3.     View Point at Km 89- Lalgudi Falls
*    Removal of Weeds and Tall Grasses in View Lines
Weeds and grasses will be removed from view lines in the Tourist zone.

Improvement Project                          Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
*    Conservation and Protection Signboards
Proper signboards with messages on conservation and bio-diversity will be provided.
6.2.5  Funds for Plantations
Plantations of about 10 hectares will be established in the Restoration zones of Anshi and Dandeli
Ranges at a cost of Rs. 10,500 per ha. Cane plantation of about 5 hectares will be established in
Anshi and Dandeli ranges at a cost of Rs. 8,000 per ha.
6.2.6  Funds for Reconstruction of Forest Road Cross Drainage Structures
Reconstruction of 5 forest road culverts in the vicinity of the project corridor will be carried out at
a total cost of 7.5 Lakhs.
6.2.7 Publicity Boards, Awareness Boards and Caption Boards
KSHIP will provide publicity boards within the Park giving information on different aspects of
Park facilities. A sum of Rs. 2.25 lakhs will be allocated for these boards.
6.2.8 Logistical Support to the Forest Department
Along with road development within the Park, KSHIP intends to support the extension of
protection of forest resources and the augmentation of security and conservation measures. The
major items to be funded are as follows:
*      Construction of one Fire Watch Towers
*      Maintenance of 30 Km of Forest Roads in the vicinity of the Project corridor.
Improvement of water holes
*      Bicycles for the patrolling staff.
6.2.9  Sustainability of the Programme
It is also necessary to look into the sustainability of all the above measures. To ensure that the
mitigation measures related to improvement of infrastructure and plantation are not limited by the
KSHIP investment, another source of regular revenue has to be explored. The Forest Department
is of the same opinion and suggests that it should be authorized to collect tolls from vehicles
passing along Corridor 1 3A through the National Park. The following charges could be levied:
Rs. 5 for 2 wheelers (motor bikes, scooters, and mopeds)
*      Rs. 20 for 4- wheelers (cars, jeeps, pick-ups, vans)
*      Rs. 25 for Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs)
*      Rs. 30 for Trucks (medium, heavy, multi-axled) and Buses
The income generated from these toll-charges could be used to meet the cost of maintenance of
the facilities mentioned above which will be created from the one off grant from KSHIP. Any
costs i ncurred in e xcess o f t he n et c ollection o f toll-charges w ould be a bsorbed in t he annual
budget for the Park. Similarly, the Forest Department could use any surplus from the net
collection of toll-charges for Eco-development without further reference to the PWD/EMPIU.

Improvement Project                          Corridor 13A which passes through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
7.2   Implementation of Mitigation measures
The above activities will contribute to air and noise pollution in the National Park and will require
the implementation of mitigation measures. To ensure that these mitigation measures are
implemented, the EMP would be an integral component of the Contract. Conditions have been
specified in the Contract Documents to make it mandatory that environment protection measures
are diligently implemented during the Construction Phase. These measures will include the
following:
*      The construction working hours within the Park would be limited to 8 hours between
8.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. No work would be perrmitted after the specified period.
*      Other than construction equipment such as pavers, road rollers and cement mixers, water
bowsers, etc. no other plant/vehicles would be allowed to remain inside the Park during
non-working hours.
*      All c onstruction vehicles e mployed by the Contractor should possess ' Pollution under
Control' Certificates and should be maintained properly to minimise air and noise
pollution within the Park.
*      Trucks carrying construction materials or carting away surplus / unsuitable materials
must be covered with canvas or polythene sheets and the drivers must be instrcted to
limit their speed to 40 Km/hour or less within the Park.
*      Whilst bulk storage of construction materials must be located outside the Park, small
quantities of construction materials required to facilitate continuous construction
operations may be permitted at specified locations within the Park as approved by the
Site Engineer or the Competent Authority in consultation with the Assistant Conservator
of Forest or the Range Forest officer.
Individual construction working lengths must not exceed 500m.
*      Unsuitable or surplus excavated materials will be removed from the Park daily within the
scheduled working hours. No such materials can be stored within the Park.
*      Strict security must be maintained during the Construction Phase. Unless in an
emergency, no workers would be allowed to leave the work area during the working
hours. It would be the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the construction workers
do not become involved in poaching, felling of trees and collection of firewood or any
other forest produce within the Park.
.      Adequate traffic signs and effective traffic management of diversions are essential
throughout the Construction Phase.
To ensure smooth traffic and prevent accidents at all times, caution boards must be
installed at least 50m - 100m in advance of potential hazards to forewarn road users. All
traffic signs will be made with reflective paint.

Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
7.3    Activities outside the Park
Construction machinery such as asphalt plants, hot mix plants, stone crushers, etc. would be
located outside the Park to mitigate pollution of the various environmental components.
All excavated unsuitable materials from the existing road surface would be disposed outside the
Park. Construction Materials such as gravel, aggregate, sand and moorum would not be stored
within 100m of the workers camps. Construction workers camps would be established outside the
Park. Water supply, fuel wood, sanitary, medical and electricity would be provided in these
camps.
Table 18 below gives details of measures to be implemented during the Construction Phase to
mitigate the adverse impacts arising from the construction work.
8.     Storage, Handling and Disposal of Hazardous substances
A Guideline to contractors for storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances like
Bitumen, Diesel, Oil, Petrol, Kerosene, emulsions etc., has been prepared and appended in
Appendix G.
9.     Institutional Administration, Environmental Monitoring and Training
9.1    Institutional Administration
The EMPIU supervises and monitors all environmental aspects of KSHLP Phase I and Phase II
and provides training to the staff. The unit is led by a Senior Environmental Engineer, 5 Assistant
Enviromnental Engineers (four of them are placed in the divisional offices and one in PIU,
Bangalore), one Assistant Conservator of Forests at PIU, Bangalore and five Range Forest
Officers (deputed to the PIU).
Implementation of mitigation measures will be the responsibility of the EMPIU as a part of the
institutional strengthening plan. The EMPIU shall maintain close interaction and co-ordination
with all other authorities that operate within the Park.
Maintenance of the road during the Operations Phase will be the responsibility of the PWD, in
liaison with the State Forest Department on the timing, quantum and execution of the works.
One Assistant Environmental Engineer has been appointed exclusively for monitoring the Project
road along with few Rehabilitation roads passing through westem ghat. In a ddition one forest
official from PIU will visit the Project road every month and will appraise the PIU for taking mid
course corrections if any.

9.2    Environmental Monitoring
Monitoring of ambient air quality (Appendix - D), water quality (Appendix - F) and noise level
(Appendix - E) will be done by the EMPIU. All monitored data should be compared with
standards of ambient air, water and noise levels (CPCB, 1999, 2000) presented in Appendices DI,
El and Fl. Generated data of environmental features, photographic records of site/locations will
provide a useful Environmental Monitoring database. Table 19 below gives details of monitoring
requirements for the project.

9.3    Capacity Development through Training in Environment Management
EMPIU/PCC have held periodic meetings and orientation training workshops for all KSHIP staff
involved in environmental impact monitoring and mitigation. These meetings and workshops
have been successful in creating awareness and understanding amongst EMPIU and associated
staff on environmental issues related to road development.
Training and strengthening on basic road maintenance techniques will also be required. Forest
Officers and Park Rangers need to liaise with the PWD during future mnaintenance of the section
of Corridor 13A which passes through the Parki
10.    Budget for EMP Implementation of the Project Road through Dandeli Wildlife
Sanctuary and Anshi National Park
The detailed estimated cost of environmental mitigation measures for the section of Coridor 1 3A
that passes through the Park is given in Table 20 below. Some of the items in this budget have
already been included in the Phase II project budget (Table 7 under Section - Budget for EMP
Implementation (Phase II - Environmental Management Plan)). The budget below includes cost
estimates for the functioning of the EMPIU during the construction and operation phases of this
corridor. The cost estimates are based on the types of impacts envisaged, the mitigation measures
required and the related monitoring and training of personnel to be undertaken. The overall cost
estimate for environmental management of the Project is approximately Rs. 20.00 lakhs.

The Park revenue will improve following road rehabilitation and in tum this increment in revenue
would result i n better p ark management and benefit eco-tourism being promoted in the Park.
Strict implementation of the various mitigation measures would not only benefit the regional and
local economy but also ensure sustainable development of the surrounding region.

The proposal for Bllack -topping of road link passing through Dandeli Sanctwry was

highest quality            -   fleSQhai no rapjrs berquirfor next 8-12 years
