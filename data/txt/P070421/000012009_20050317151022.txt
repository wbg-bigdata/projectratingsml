Executive Summary
1.    The Government of Karnataka (GOK) is implementing the Kamataka State
Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) with assistance from the World Bank.
Phase-I consists of 394 kms of roads for Upgradation and 848 kms for Major
Maintenance. Phase-II consists of 548 kms of roads for Upgradation and 429 kms
for Major Maintenance. The GOK has adopted a Resettlement and Rehabilitation
(R&R) Policy for KSHIP to address the adverse impacts arising out of this project.
2.    The Upgradation of roads involves removal of existing pavement and widening to
a carriageway width of 7.00 m with 1.00 m paved shoulder and 1.5 m unpaved
shoulder on either side, strengthening of pavement, raising of embankment,
providing drainage and geometrical corrections. This results in adverse impacts
associated with land acquisition and loss of other facilities, requiring resettlement
and rehabilitation. Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) were formulated to
implement the R & R policy for Phase-I and II Upgradation roads. The impacts
identified in the Upgradation roads are being mitigated under the above RAPs.
3.    The Major Maintenance or Rehabilitation of roads involved improvement of the
roads in the existing width of carriageway. Thus there were no adverse impacts
involved in the Rehabilitation component of the Project. However, during the
course of the Project, design modifications, modification of alignments,
geometrical improvements, safety considerations etc. were incorporated in the
Rehabilitation roads. This involved social impacts, which required mitigation.
Therefore, a social screening along with a socio-economic census of the Project
Affected Families (PAFs) in the Rehabilitation packages was conducted during
September-October 2003 to identify the impacts. This RAP for Rehabilitation
roads (RAP-R) has been formulated to address the impacts in Rehabilitation roads.
4.    The impacts include 541 PAFs in 15 contract packages who are losing
residential/residential-cum-commercial/commercial structures and there are 285
BPL PAFs. Of these 72 BPL PAFs are losing residential structures, 195 BPL
PAFs are losing commercial structures, 7 BPL PAFs are losing residential-cum-
commercial structures and 11 BPL PAFs are partly affected. The impacts will be
mitigated in accordance with the provisions of the R & R policy for KSHIP as is
being done in Phase I and II Project Upgradation roads.
5.    There are 137 Community assets/public utilities were identified from 13 contract
packages only. No CAs/PUs were reported from other 2 contract packages. The
affected Community assets and public utilities will be relocated and reconstructed
by the project.
7.    The impacts are mostly in the drainage portion of the roads. As the drainage
works will be taken up after the completion of the main carriageway works, by
that time the impacts will be addressed as per R and R Policy.
8.    The key socio-economic characteristics of the PAFs are: The number of PAFs and
PAPs are 541 and 2755 respectively. There are 44 women-headed households.
Among religious groups, Hindus dominate with 69.50 per cent, Muslims were

25.32 per cent and others were 05.81 per cent. Distribution of PAPs by occupation
reveals that commerce/trade occupies a significant place with 62.11 percent of
PAFs involved, 9.42 percent having other occupations and 28.46 percent being
agricultural labourers. Reported data on household income/expenditure suggest
that of the total PAFs (541), 52.68 percent reported their income to be below the
poverty line (with cut-off income at Rs. 18,000 per annum). The reported average
annual income of APL families works out to Rs. 62,523. The average income
works out to Rs.1 1,259 for a BPL family. 47.79% of the PAFs have own TV.
22.08% have own bicycles/two-wheelers.
9.    The local authorities in Athani town in contract package M3 and in Nagamangala
town in contract package M6, had on their own accord demolished about 138
encroached structures along the project road within the town limits, without giving
notices and extending eligible compensation and assistance which is inconsistent
with the R & R policy for KSHIP. Remedial measures have been implemented to
the PAFs in the above towns, which include the delivery of entitlements as
applicable under the R&R policy, assistances like structure cost of the affected
pucca structures without depreciation, shifting and subsistence allowances to those
who have shifted, transition allowances from the date of demolition to delivery of
entitlements in case of those who have fully lost their houses or livelihood,
compensation for losses suffered during demolition (excluding the cost of
structures) and an opportunity for redressing any grievances before the District
Level Grievance Redressal Committee.
10.   Exgratia structure costs have been disbursed in Athani (M3) and Nagamangala
(M6) towns; the numbers being 47 and 86 respectively.
11.   As per the World Bank Supervision Mission September 27 October 1, 2004 in
their draft Aide Memoire NGO was asked to take up a Socio Economic Survey of
PAFs, who have fully affected and shifted. Accordingly NGO conducted Socio
Economic Survey and submitted the report and accordingly a plan of action has
been prepared and submitted to the World Bank.
12.   Internal monitoring and external evaluation mechanisms, methodology, and
indicators as in RAP Phase-I will be followed in implementation of RAP-R.
Periodical monthly progress by monitoring will be collected by field staff and
reviewed in PIU. External evaluation including income and access to basic
amenities will be conducted after substantial/full implementation.
13.   The Annexures include i) The general identification & type of loss ii) The
household particulars iii) The structure details and iv) The distribution of
community assets and public utilities v) Entitlement matrix vi) Action plan for
allotment of Alternative Houses and Commercial Sites vii) Action plan for
Relocation of Community Assets.

1. INTRODUCTION
Introduction
1.1   The Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project is being implemented in two
phases. Phase I consists of 394 kms of Upgradation and 848 kms of Major
Maintenance. Phase II consists of 548 kms of Upgradation and 429 kms of Major
Maintenance.
1.2   Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) were formulated to implement the R&R policy
for Phase-I and II Upgradation roads. The impacts identified in Upgradation roads
are being mitigated under the above RAPs.
1.3   The Major Maintenance or Rehabilitation of roads involved improvement of the
roads in the existing width of carriageway. Thus there were no adverse impacts
involved in the Rehabilitation component of the Project. However, during the
course of the Project, design modifications, modification of alignments,
geometrical improvements, safety considerations etc. were incorporated in the
Rehabilitation roads. This involved social impacts, which required mitigation.
Therefore, a social screening along with a socio-economic census of the Project
Affected Families (PAFs) in the Rehabilitation packages was conducted during
September-October 2003 to identify the impacts. This RAP for Rehabilitation
roads (RAP-R) has been formulated to address the impacts in Rehabilitation roads.
1.4   The RAP-R is basically an addendum report to Phase I RAP. This RAP-R consists
of three chapters. Chapter 1. Introduction outlines the objectives of RAP-R and
the details of the identified impacts. Chapter 2. Baseline Socio-Economic
Characteristics, provides an analysis of the socio-economic data collected
through the census, to measure the magnitude of social impacts on project affected
persons and families. The analysis identifies severely impacted categories and
helps in estimating the extent of costs involved for mitigating the social impacts in
addition to analysing the census data. Chapter 3. Implementation Mechanisms
outlines the implementation mechanisms for resettlement and rehabilitation. It
takes into account costs and budget implications and monitoring and evaluation of
the resettlement components.
Brief outline of Rehabilitation roads
1.5   Phase I consists of 848 kms of Rehabilitation roads. Phase II consists of 525 kms
of Rehabilitation roads. The contract package-wise distribution of Rehabilitation
roads is given in Table 1-1.

Socio - Economic Census
1.8   The social impacts and resettlement component includes assessment of social
impacts in Rehabilitation roads of the project and development of appropriate
mitigation plans as required. To facilitate the preparation of RAP-R, social
screening, Public consultations and a socio-economic census were conducted in
the Rehabilitation roads.
1.9   The socio-economic census was conducted for the width of the road till the edges
of the drains. The socio-economic census helped to register and document the
status of the potentially affected population in terms of their assets and sources of
livelihood.
1.10  This census provided a baseline against which mitigation measures and support
have been measured. Analysis of collected data examined the needs and resources
of different groups and individuals. The results of the census are discussed in
Chapter 2.
Minimizing the adverse impacts
1.11  Efforts are being made to revise the cross-section of the road at places where
impacts are concentrated, without compromising on the safety parameters, so as to
minimize the adverse impacts of the project.
Remedial measures for Athani (M3) and Nagamangala (M6) towns PAFs:
1.12  The local authorities in Athani town in contract package M3 and in Nagamangala
town in contract package M6, have on their own accord demolished the
encroached structures along the project road within the town limits, without giving
notices and extending eligible compensation and assistance which is inconsistent
with the R & R policy for KSHIP. The World Bank Mid Term Review
Supervision Mission of February 2004 recommended initiation of remedial
measures for the PAFs in the above towns.
1.13  47 PAFs in Athani town have experienced adverse impact from the demolition of
their structures. 91 structures in Nagamangala town have been demolished. The
remedial measures which have been implemented include the delivery of
entitlements as applicable under the R&R policy, assistances like structure cost of
the affected pucca structures without depreciation, shifting and subsistence
allowances to those who have shifted, transition allowances from the date of
demolition to delivery of entitlements in case of those who have fully lost their
houses or livelihood, compensation for losses suffered during demolition
(excluding the cost of structures) and an opportunity for redressing any grievances
before the District Level Grievance Redressal Committee.

2.    BASELINE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
2.1   The main findings of the socio-economic census of Project Affected Families /
Persons (PAFs/ PAPs) are presented in this chapter.
Socio-economic census
2.2   The socio-economic census was required in order to generate necessary data/input
for preparing the RAP-R. The census would provide a baseline measurement of
potential impacts on affected families/persons that form the eligibility criteria for
entitlement spelt out in the R & R Policy of the KSHIP.
Public Consultations:
2.3   Consultations with the affected population were restricted to discussions held with
the PAFs during the socio-economic census. The PAFs were informed about the
entitlements and assistances provided by the Project to the various categories of
impacts, involvement of the NGO in RAP implementation and grievance redressal
mechanism.
Methodology and Data Base
2.4   A socio-economic census of the project-affected population was conducted. This
has provided a baseline against which mitigation measures have been worked out.
For this purpose, information related to the PAFs' assets, incomes and other
relevant socio-economic information has been collected.
Methods of Data collection
2.5   Household level contacts and interviews with each affected family for completing
the household socio-economic profile were conducted. Each of the households
surveyed and the structures likely to be affected by the project has been
documented.
Socio-economic census: results and discussion
2.6   The socio-economic census reveals that there are 541 PAFs and 2755 PAPs.
Contract package-wise distribution of PAFs/PAPs is as shown in table 2-1 below.

The socio-economic census revealed that the number of PAFs and PAPs are 541
and 2755 respectively. There are 44 households with females as heads. Among
religious groups, Hindus dominate with 69.50 per cent, Muslims were 25.32 per
cent and others were 5.18 per cent.
Occupation and Poverty Line
2.8   Distribution of PAPs by occupation reveals that commerce/trade occupies a
significant place with 62.11 percent of PAFs involved, 9.42 percent having other
occupations and 28.46 percent being agricultural labourers. Reported data on
household income/expenditure suggest that of the total PAFs (541), 52.68 percent
reported their income to be below the poverty line (with cut-off income at 15,000
+ 20% = 18,000 per annum). The reported average annual income of APL families
works out to Rs. 62,523. The average income works out to Rs.1 1,259 for a BPL
family.
Assets/ownership characteristics:
47.79% of the PAFs have own TV. 22.08% have own bicycles/two-wheelers.
Details of PAFs by Impact Categories
2.9   In all 541 structures are being affected by the rehabilitation roads. Of which 128

* The extent of impact is only preliminary in nature as given in table 2.3 the exact extent of loss will be known at the time ofjoint verification
which will be taken up by the NGO, Revenue and PWD Department. Once joint verification is completed the exact number of PAFs who are to
be provided with houses and commercial sites will be known. Accordingly the impacts will be mitigated.

2.11  There are 44 women headed households and 21 physically handicapped persons.
Depending on their interest the project authorities will be training the women
headed households in income generation activities, so that they can improve their
income level. Physically handicapped persons will be assisted in enrolment in
employment exchanges, assisting in getting disability certificates and pension
from department of physically handicapped.
2.12  There are 137 Community assets/public utilities were identified from 13 contract
packages only. The affected Community assets and public utilities will be
relocated and reconstructed as being done in Phase I and Phase II roads. The
details of CAs/PUs are appended in Annexure-4.
2.13  According to the R&R Policy, Resettlement sites will have to be developed,
where 20 or more families are getting displaced in a continuous stretch of 2 Kms
at one given location. Accordingly the Rehabilitation Center will be established in
M-30 and M-33 packages.

3. IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS
Introduction
3.1    This chapter outlines mitigation of impacts, grievance redressal mechanism,
implementation schedule, costs & budget and monitoring & evaluation of the
resettlement components.
Mitigation of impacts:
3.2   The PAFs will be provided assistance as prescribed in the Entitlement Matrix of
the R & R Policy for KSHIP. The BPL PAFs losing residential structures will be
entitled to be provided with EWS houses; the BPL PAFs losing commercial
structures will be entitled to be provided with commercial sites. The affected
community assets / public utilities will be relocated and reconstructed by the
Project.
Grievance Redressal
3.3   The project has established a Grievance Redressal process, with District-Level
grievance redressal cells. These cells hear complaints and facilitate solutions; and
the process, as a whole, has promoted dispute settlement through mediation to
reduce unnecessary litigation.
Implementation Schedule
3.4   The resettlement program will be co-ordinated with the timing of civil works. The
project will provide adequate notification, counselling and assistance to affected
people so that they are able to move or give up their assets without undue hardship
before commencement of civil works. The impacts identified are in the drainage
portion of the roads. Though contracts are awarded for tranches 1 to 5, drainage
works have not commenced in the portions where impacts are identified. Prior to
commencement of works where impacts have been identified, the concerned
Executive Engineer will confirm the delivery of entitlements. The RAP-R
implementation schedule is shown in table 3.1 below:
3.5   The start date for implementation will be the date of approval of the RAP-R by the
Steering Committee for the Project.

Implementation Procedure
3.6   Other implementation procedures detailed in RAP Phase I will also be followed in
the implementation of RAP-R.
Timing of resettlement
3.7   The resettlement process will be completed before the start of civil works in the
concerned portions. The PAFs who are not eligible for any assistance will be
given 60 days notice to vacate/shift out of COI. All those who are entitled for
compensation and assistance will be offered the compensation and assistance prior
to asking them to vacate the land or structure occupied by them. The
implementation schedule for Civil Works will be worked out in detail between the
Engineering Wing and the SDRC.
Costs and Budget
3.8   The total budget for RAP-R is estimated to be Rs. 4,99,40,000. A consolidated
overview of the budget estimate for the resettlement implementation, including
assistance, administrative expense, monitoring and evaluation, and contingencies
are given below in Table 3-2. The unit costs for various items as in RAP Phase I
revised periodically have been adopted for RAP-R.
3.9   The subsistence allowance, shifting allowance, relief assistance, amounts for
income generating schemes, cost for the provision of sites for commercial
squatters and rental allowance will be as provided in the RAP Phase I.
3.10  The budget required is available and will be included in the next annual budget for
the project.
