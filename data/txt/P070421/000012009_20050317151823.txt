EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.   The Government of Kamataka is currently implementing the Kamataka State Highways
Improvement Project(KSHIP) with the assistance of World Bank funding
2.   The construction of bypass at Raichur and Bijapur towns is under consideration for inclusion
in KSHIP.
3.   The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) of proposed bypass for Raichur and Bijapur towns has
been prepared on the basis of provisions contained in the document approved by Government
of Kamataka (GOK) entitled: Resettlement and Rehabilitation: Principles and Policy
Framework for the Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project.
4.   Since it is the construction of new road at Raichur and Bijapur towns, the impact is only on
land. Land Acquisition will be done through Land Acquisition Act. The R&R policy
provides scope of consent award for payment of compensation amounts on willing-seller--
willing-buyer basis without any pre-conditions.
5.   Census and socio-economic survey were conducted for the proposed bypass for Raichur and
Bijapur during the months of March to May 2003 and data have been updated in Feb 2004. 30
meters width (Corridor of Impact) was considered along the alignment i.e.7.6 and 6.7 km
respectively
6.   Raichur town:
As per census and socio-economic survey, there are 59 PAFs (out of 59 PAFs, S PAFs were
not available at the time of the survey). Data on 54 PAFs with 459 PAPs were collected. Of
the 54 PAFs, 3 are women headed headed PAFs households. Analysis of survey data shows
that 32 families falls under the Below Economic Land Holdings category. Average annual
income of families works out to Rs. 82,059. Average land holding is 6.34 acres. The extent
of land acquisition from private owners necessary for construction of bypass will be 52.39

belong to BPL category. In accordance with policy provisions subsistence allowance and
other assistances will be calculated on the BPL and Below Economic Land Holdings criteria,
if they are resettled and relocated. The assistance value will be decided by the GOK. The
extent of land acquisition from private owners necessary for construction of bypass will be
37.57 acres. The budget estimate works out to Rs. 3. 83 crore.
8.   There are no archaeological monuments and community assets on the proposed alignment
except a shrine in Raichur.
9.   Local level public consultations were conducted at Raichur and Bijapur towns for proposed
bypasses.
10.   The RAP describes the institutional and organisational mechanisms required for the

CHAPTER - 1         INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) is an initiative of Public Works
Department of the Government of Karnataka for Improvement of road network of the State with
World Bank assistance. The project is in two phases, Phase I consist of 394kms of upgradation and
848 kms of major maintenance. Phase II consists of 548 kms of upgradation and 429 kms of major
maintenance.
1.2 It is also envisaged in the project that new roads should be constructed to bypass six congested
towns. These towns are connected by links on the same or different corridors. It was further
decided to evaluate the alternative alignments for these bypasses for their preliminary techno-
economic feasibility to best judge their viability prior to the commencement of detailed designs.
1.3 Results of the preliminary techno-economic feasibility evaluations revealed that, out of the six
bypasses under consideration, Raichur and Bijapur would be viable with acceptable Internal Rates of
Return (IRR) for the chosen analysis period.
1.4 In Raichur town, the considered alignment connects link IA and IB, is the shorter compare to other.
The other alignment is long and traverse rocky hillocks and not cost effective. During informal
conversation with local residents it was revealed that the alignment considered presently is the best
option. In Bijapur, part of ring road alignment has been considered for inclusion in KSHIP.
1.5 This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is a project specific RAP, which outlines the extent of impacts
due to construction bypasses on communities and the mitigation of the potential impacts. Further, it
details necessary implementation procedures for resettlement and rehabilitation. This RAP is
prepared in accordance with the stipulations and guide-lines provided in Government of Karnataka's
document entitled: Resettlement and Rehabilitation:-Principles and Policy Framework for the
Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (GO No.PWD21 CRM Dt.01.07.1999, revised vide
GO PWD 21 CRM Dt.21.11.2000), and the World Bank Operational Directive 4.30.
R&R policy/Entitlements
1.6 The policy emphasizes that adverse impacts should be avoided or minimized.  Where it is
unavoidable assistance will be provided to improve, or at least restore, incomes and standards of
living for project-affected persons. The most direct and immediate impacts associated with Land
Acquisition. Mitigation measures are provided through compensation and assistance to households,
individuals and groups in accordance with policy provisions. Based on these objectives and
principle, GOK has adopted a R&R policy for the project which is consistent with the Bank's OD
4.30 and relevant local laws and acts. The policy describes the approaches for carrying out baseline
census and socio-economic surveys, preparation of RAP, consultations, institutional arrangements
and monitoring and evaluation procedures.
1.7 In the following, the RAP of the proposed bypass for Raichur and Bijapur towns is presented in four
chapters. In Chapterl, introduction to RAP of the proposed bypasses followed by a brief outline of

the content of social surveys and determination of cut-off date for title-holders is given. chapter 2,
Baseline Socio-economic Characteristics deals with the analysis of data collected from PAFs during
census and socio-economic survey which facilitates measurement of the extent of social impact on
PAFs. These quantitative socio-economic data are supplemented by inputs drawn from the
proceedings of the public consultation held with a group of local people with representation from
PAFs are used These inputs help in capturing the perceptions of PAFs about the proposed project.
Perceptions regarding mitigation measures and options regarding the nature of compensation desired
by people gets reflected in the proceedings. Chapter 3 deals with the Land Acquisition Process and
payment of compensation. Chapter 4 provides an outline of institutional arrangements and time
schedule for implementing RAP and estimated cost for acquiring the land required for the
construction of bypass. Relevant Annexures are given at the end of the RAP.
Introduction
1.8 The proposed bypass alignment begins at PWD Km stone 196.6 in limits of Yaramarus revenue
village on Raichur - Shaktinagar road (Link IA) north of Raichur town. The alignment moves
towards south and bends gradually. The alignment intersects Raichur - Mansalapur road at chainage
2.670 in the limits of Mansalapur revenue village and Arasinagi road, Major District Road (MDR) at
chainage 4.820. The alignment bends and joins Raichur - Lingasugur road at Km stone 5.2 west of
Raichur town. The proposed alignment passes through dry agricultural land falling within 5 revenue
villages (Table 1-1) (Figure 1-1).

Bijapur
1.9 Bijapur is a district head quarters in northwest part of Kamataka. The proposed bypass alignment
begins on Bijapur-Tikota road (link 2A) at PWD km. Stone 126.6 from this point, the existing
kutcha road forms the alignment and moves towards south and bends gradually. After 2.4 kms,
intersects Bijapur-Jamnkhandi road (link 3A). Then, the alignment moves towards east on dry land
and intersects NH 218 (Bijapur-Bagalkot road at the chainage 4.590.
Further the alignment bends and moves towards east. At the chainage 6.700 it joins NH-13 south-
east of Bijapur town.

1.10 The proposed bypass for Bijapur town is a part of Ring road. It is evident from the Documents of
Revenue Department that the Land Acquisition process is completed from starting chainage (0.000)
to 2.430 of proposed bypass and in the possession of PWD. The PWD has already constructed a
road connecting Link 2A and 3A, the same would be upgraded as part of construction of bypass.
The Land Acquisition process was completed in 1996 before the policy was adopted to this project.
Since the acquired land is traversed by proposed bypass alignment, the landowners are considered as
Project Affected Families (PAFs). During the socio-economic survey, these PAFs informed PCC
staff that they considered the loss incurred as incommensurate and approached the Court for
enhancement of compensation. Litigation is in the Court. The List of Survey No. and extent acquired
are given in Annexure 1 in Table 1.
1.11 It is also evident form the Documents of Bijapur Development Authority (BDA) that the Land
Acquisition process of agriculture lands of Survey Nos 491 and 952 located between the chainage
4.730 to 5.176 and 5.846 to 6.080 of the proposed bypass alignment respectively is completed and
the same are in the possession of BDA. The concerned landowners informed PCC staff during
socio-economic survey of the proposed bypass alignment that they have filed the cases in Court for
enhancement of compensation. The litigation is in the Court.
1.12 As per the Documents of the Revenue Department, the Survey No. 1032 which is affected by
proposed alignment from chainage 5.176 to 5.410 is Govt. land (belong to Wakf Board). Two
families claimed that they were tenants. As per the Revenue Documents the litigation is pending in
Land Tribunal.
The RAP for the proposed bypasses of Raichur and Bijapur town has been prepared with a well-defined
three-stage process as outlined below:
Stage 1 - Social Survey and data Compilation
Stage 2 - Data Analysis for Social Impact Assessment
Stage 3 - Preparation of a RAP based on the Social Impact Assessment
1.13 The scope of work involved contacting the persons/families who are likely to lose land/other assets
abutting the identified road alignment section and carrying out social surveys within horizontal
width of 30m, which is considered as the corridor of impact (COI). The basic objective of these
surveys was to assess the socio-economic status of the persons and households who are likely to be
affected due to the implementation of the proposed bypass.

Social Surveys
1.14 The following Social Surveys and consultations were carried out for Project Affected Families
(PAFs) and Project Affected Persons (PAPs). Each of these components facilitated identification of
specific needs of PAFs:
*  Baseline Census helped in identifying the PAFs
*  Socio-economic survey (Sample) (SES) helped in identifying income and other livelihood
characteristics of PAFs and PAPs
*  Public Information and Consultations helped in identifying areas of Public participation in Project
Implementation
The details about the methodology and instruments used are as given in Phase I RAP Report.
Cut-Off Date for Title holders
1.15 The cut-off date for title-holders is the date of Notification as per section 4(1) of Land Acquisition
Act. It is recognised that there will be a margin of error in the census, and any person who was not
enumerated but can produce documentary evidence that he/she is rightfully an entitled person will
also be included during the joint measurement. After joint measurement, efforts will be made by PIU
to trace such respondents for working out their eligibility for entitlements.
Extent of Impact
1.16 The properties to be acquired are mainly agricultural lands. There are no impacts of residential
structures. Hence the type of loss will be mainly of agricultural land and the extent of land
acquisition is high with 30meters of COI for the 7.6 and 6.7 km length of proposed alignment in
Raichur and Bijapur towns respectively. In Bijapur, one PAF is loosing shop. In case of another
PAF, he is loosing land, which is converted to commercial purpose. Both of them will be dealt with
as per the R&R policy provisions.

Proposed mitigation measures:
1.17 Mitigation measures are provided through compensation and assistance to PAFs in accordance with
the R&R policy provisions of KSHIP. The following mitigation measures are proposed as per R&R
policy of KSHIP to address the adverse impacts due to Land Acquisition for construction of
proposed bypasses at Raichur and Bijapur town:
* Consent Award or Compensation in accordance LAA.
*  In case of severance of agricultural land, an additional 25% of total compensation will be paid as
severance allowance.

CHAPTER 2 - BASELINE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
Social Impact Assessment
2.1 Social Impact Assessment (SIA) of the proposed bypasses was undertaken as required under the
World Bank Operational Directives (O.D) 4.20 and 4.30. The database for undertaking the SIA
exercise in the proposed bypasses based on the census and socio-economic survey-data collected
from the Project Affected Families (PAFs) during the months of March to May 2003. Both the towns
were revisited in February 2004 for collecting additional information and update the data. Total
length of the proposed bypass road is 7.6 km in Raichur town and 6.7 km in Bijapur. This section
attempts to capture the extent of social impacts based on the data collected during Census and
Sample SES on the socio-economic characteristics of the PAFs and their family members Project
Affected Persons (PAPs).
Raichur
2.2 Data on salient socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the PAFs and PAPs on the
proposed bypass alignment indicate that, 54 families with 459 members are likely to be affected. Of
the 54 PAFs, 3 were women headed families. Analysis of the data shows that 32 families reported to
have Below Minimum Economic Land Holdings (Table 2-1). 3 families having their annual income
Below Poverty Line falls under Below Minimum Economic Land Holdings category. Distribution
of annual income 19 PAFs falling within Rs 18,000 to 50,000 categories. 59% of PAFs are in Rs
50,000 and above group. Data on income distribution among PAFs are given in Table 2-9 of
Annexure 2. Further, of the total PAFs, in 5 cases, the Social Team could collect the details about the
affected area and names of owners of the affected area from local village officials.  These
respondents were not available to collect other socio-economic and demographic information at the
time of PCC survey. Hence, the analysis of socio-economic data is restricted to 54 PAFs. However,
joint measurement of land acquisition process will determine the land ownership and other impacts.
This helps to trace the owners of these 5 PAFs for working out necessary compensation entitlement.
On the identified alignment, social survey team did not come across any other community asset
getting affected except a small shrine. The total area to be acquired for the construction of the bypass
works out to 52.39 acres. Of this area only 1.33 acre is under the ownership of a private trust. The
Land is neither leased out nor encroached upon by others. (Table 2-1 of Annexure 2).
2.3 Agriculture being the dominant avocation in the study region, 48 per cent of PAPs was engaged in
cultivation and 6 per cent were reported to be agricultural labourers. The rest were engaged in non-
farm activities.

2.4 Data on salient socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the PAFs and PAPs on the
proposed bypass alignment indicate that, 48 families with 364 members are likely to be affected. Of
the 48 PAFs, 3 are women headed families and 27 families are reported to be below Minimum
Economic Land Holdings (Table 2-2). Out of 6 BPL families, 3 families falls under below Minimum
Economic Land Holdings category. Women headed families and ST households are part of main
stream economy. Distribution of annual income among PAFs indicates that 58% of PAFs are in Rs
50,000 and above income group. Data on income distribution among PAFs are given in Table 2-10
of Annexure 2. Further, of the total PAFs, in 7 cases, the Social Team could collect the details about
the affected area and names of owners of these areas from local village officials. These respondents
were not available to collect other socio-economic and demographic information at the time of PCC
survey. Hence, the analysis of socio-economic data is restricted to 48 PAFs. However, joint
measurement of land acquisition process will determine the land ownership and other impacts which
helps to trace the owners of these 7 PAFs for working out necessary compensation entitlement. The
total area to be acquired for the construction of the bypass works out to 39.32 acres. Of this area for
19.43 acres, Land Acquisition process was completed and the affected families have approached
Court for enhancement of compensation. (Table 2-2A and 2B of Annexure 2).
2.5 The proposed bypass for Bijapur town is a part of Ring road. It is evident from the Documents of
Revenue Department that the Land Acquisition process was completed before policy was adopted to
the project from chainage 0.000 to 2.430 of proposed bypass and is in the possession of PWD. The
PWD constructed road would be upgraded as part of construction of bypass. Hence the landowners
whose land has been acquired are considered as PAFs. During the socio-economic survey, these
PAFs informed the PCC staff, that they considered the loss incurred as incommensurate, hence they
approached the Court for enhancement of compensation. Litigation is in the court. (Details of
survey nos. and areas are given in Annexure 1 Table 1).
2.6 It is also evident from the Documents of Bijapur Development Authority (BDA) that the Land
Acquisition process of agriculture lands of Survey Nos. 491 and 952 located between the chainage
4.730 and 5.176 and between chainage 5.846 and 6.080 of the proposed bypass alignment
respectively was completed and the same are in the possession of BDA. The concerned landowners
informed PCC staff during socio-economic survey of the proposed bypass alignment that they have
filed cases in the Court for enhancement of compensation. The litigation is in the court. (Details of
survey nos. and areas are given in Annexure 1 Table 2).
2.7 As per the Documents of the Revenue Department, the Survey No. 1032 which is affected by
proposed alignment from chainage 5.176 to 5.410 is Government Land (belongs to Wakf Board).

Impacts
2.9 The impacts are on agricultural land. The land holding categories verses extent of land getting
affected due to construction of bypasses at Raichur and Bijapur are given in Table 2-1 of Annexure 2
and Table 2-2A and 2-2B of Annexure 2 respectively.
Social Stratification
2.10 Data on social stratification of PAFs of proposed bypass of Raichur town indicate that out of 53
PAFs who furnished complete household socio-economic data, all the PAFs belong to general
category and 5 are women headed households (Annexure 2-Table 2-3). In case of women headed
households, none of them belong to BPL families and as all these PAFs own agriculture land and
are part of the mainstream population, they do not fall into the vulnerable groups.
2.11 In Bijapur town out of 48 PAFs who furnished complete household socio-economic data, 44 PAFs
belong to general category and 1 to ST and 3 are women headed households (Annexure 2-Table 2-
4). Out of 3 women headed households, two families belong to BPL category and entitled for
special assistance envisaged in R&R policy of KSHIP.
Demographic and Literacy levels of Project Affected Persons
2.12 Demographic characteristics like age and sex distribution PAF of proposed bypass of Raichur town
indicate that, 38% PAPs belong to less than 18 years age-group followed by 18-59 age-group with
52%. The sex ratio in project area is 908 females for every 1000 males (Annexure 2-Table 2-5).
2.13 Age and sex distribution of PAF of proposed bypass of Bijapur town indicates that, 40 per cent
PAPs belong to less than 18 years age-group, followed by 18-59 age-group with 52%. The male-
female ratio among PAPs works out 925 females for every 1000 males (Annexure 2 Table 2-6).
2.14 Another social development indicator is level of education among PAPs. Data shows 35 per cent of
PAPs are illiterate, 37 percent are Primary and 21 percent are Secondary. (Annexure 2 Table 2-7).

Public Consultations
Public Consultation - Proposed Bypass for Raichur Town
2.15 Following the completion of Socio-Economic Survey of Raichur bypass and after identifying the
number of families being affected for the entire proposed bypass alignment Social wing of the PCC
organised a public consultation at Raichur Town on 28th March 2003.  Raichur town is both
district and taluk head quarters. Project Affected Families (PAFs) expressed their preference to
attend the public meeting in the morning. The venue for the public consultation was fixed at the
Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee.  As per requirement, PAFs were informed about the
day, time and venue of the public consultation two days in advance. While the Tahsildar of Raichur
Taluk was informed about the public consultation during the Socio-Economic Survey, the services
of the village accountants were sought in order to mobilise the PAFs.
2.16 The PCC staff (Social Wing) conducted the discussion. The participants included Project Affected
Persons (PAPs) covered under the survey and interested general public.
2.17 The PCC staff briefed the audience about the KSHIP and proposal for bypass under KSHIP and
explained the purpose of conducting the public consultation. With this background, the following
issues were taken up for discussion and public opinion on these issues was elicited.
Issues
2.18 The Socio-Economic issues that were brought up for discussion included Land Acquisition,
Compensation Package and the benefits from the Project.
(a) Land Acquisition
The PAPs expressed that due to traversing of proposed bypass alignment amidst their agriculture
land, it gets into two pieces, becomes unfit for cultivation.
(b) Compensation
People expressed that the quality of the land and type of crop they grow are such that agriculture
operations do not require huge investment and physical labour. Since the land is getting affected,
it will affect their livelihood.
The PAPs were apprehensive about the compensation they would be given by the
Government.They expressed their views that compensation should be fair and should be
disbursed in time.
(c) Livelihood
The PAPs suggested that it would be extremely beneficial if the PAPs were given government
jobs in lieu of the land lost.

Mitigation measures
a) & b) Resettlement Action Plan adequately addresses the benefits to be extend to the Project
Affected Persons and has an inbuilt clause that compensation disbursement and benefits are to be
disbursed to the PAPs before commencement of civil works.
c) Benefits to be extended as per R&R policy and RAP content. There is no scope of providing
government jobs to PAFs in KSHIP. PAFs were explained that there is provision to get
assistance to purchase income-generating assets under economic rehabilitation provided for BPL
families, if they are resettled and relocated.  And also explained that during civil works,
contractor provide opportunity for local labour.
Public Consultation - Proposed Bypass for Bijapur Town
2.19 Following the completion of Socio-Economic survey of Bijapur bypass and after identifying the
No.of families being affected, the PCC organised a public consultation at Bijapur on 30th April
2003. The venue for the public consultation was fixed at meeting hall of Town Municipality of
Bijapur. The PAPs of the proposed bypass alignment were informed about the day, time and venue
of the public consultation in advance.
2.20 The PCC staff conducted the discussion.  The participants included Staff of Bijapur Urban
Development Authority and PIU, KSHIP Sub-Disivion Bijapur, other Govt. officials and project
affected persons and members of project affected families.
2.21 The PCC briefed the audience about the KSHIP and explained the purpose of conducting the public
consultation. The importance of people's participation was highlighted to those present at the
venue. With this background the following issues were taken up for discussion and public opinion.
Issues
2.22 The main issues discussed during public consultation were:
A. Land Acquisition
The PAFs expressed that PWD is going to establish control line once the road is constructed
within which structures cannot be constructed.  Apart from becoming unviable for agricultural
operations many plots where the road traverse amidst the land, the agriculture would not be a
productive occupation due to pollution caused by vehicular traffic. Compensation has to be on par
with the prevalent market rates. Besides, the PAPs equivocally expressed that the compensation
should be disbursed without delay.
B. Compensation Package
The PAFs preferred the compensation rate to be based on square meters. They also insisted that
the compensation should be on par with prevailing open market rate.

Improvement Project                                             Raichur & Bijapur Bypasses
C. Alignment
One of the PAFs expressed that at the start point of bypass i.e., intersection point on Bijapur-
Jamkhandi road the alignment is on curve which is not technically feasible. Since it is low-lying
area, slab drain has to be constructed which is costly and also the alignment adversely affects the
land (alignment passes amidst land and cuts into two pieces). If the alignment were straight, it
does not involve any cross drainage structure for storm water passage and also the impact on
adversely affected land would have been minimized
Mitigation measures:
a)&b) Resettlement Action Plan adequately addresses the benefits to be extended to the Project
Affected Persons and has an inbuilt clause that compensation disbursement and benefits are to be
disbursed to the PAPs before commencement of civil works.
c) The issue has been passed on to the engineering section and also PAP informed that he would
be convinced that the considered alignment is also feasible. PCC confirmed that the considered
alignment is feasible.
Overall response of the PAPs towards the proceedings was cordial. The proceedings of public
consultations of Raichur and Bijapur town were videographed.
2.23 Analysis of the feedback from the PAFs during public consultation revealed that their
apprehensions and priorities centred round the magnitude of the loss they likely to incur, whether
these losses compensated adequately in time and land become unviable pieces which can be
considered by PIU during Land Acquisition. The Land Acquisition for proposed bypasses will be
through Consent Award. Hence it is possible to consider the several factors those affect the land
prices.

CHAPTER - 3 LAND ACQUISITION AND PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION
Land Acquisition
3.1 The land required for construction of proposed bypasses in Raichur and Bijapur town will be
acquired as per Land Acquisition Act.
3.2 The Land Acquisition Act contains rules for the time required from when people are first notified
about the State's intent to acquire the land, to the time people are required to vacate their holdings.
3.3 The normal procedures for land Acquisition under Section 4.1 will be followed in this project.
Although the Land Acquisition Act has a provision for emergency acquisition requiring shorter time,
this clause will not be invoked unless it is documented that an emergency exists and that it is not
possible to follow the normal procedure for Land Acquisition.
3.4 The Land Acquisition Act and R&R policy (specially formulated for this project) provides adequate
policy and legal framework to mitigate the adverse impacts of this project.
3.5 The civil works are linked with the completion of land acquisition. It is estimated that 52.39 acres
and 38.49 acres are required for construction of bypasses at Raichur and Bijapur respectively. The
cost estimates have been given in Table 4.2 & 4.3 of Section 4. The minimum time taken for
completion of land acquisition is 7 to 9 months assuming that full infrastructure is given and there
are no delays. The Land Acquisition process is in different stages in these towns.
Consent Award
3.6 The land needed for construction of bypass in Raichur and Bijapur towns will be only through
Consent Award.
3.7 Consent award is the amount that the PAP negotiates with the project authorities, for the loss
incurred, on a willing buyer-seller basis. Once the amount is agreed upon the PAP cannot move to
court for enhancement of the amount. This amount is negotiated between the GOK and the land
/structure owner on a mutually agreed price without any preconditions.
3.8 After section 6(1). notification, PAPs will be called for Consent Award. In case, if the PAPs are
reluctant to agree with the Consent Award, then General Award will be sought. Though Consent
Award reduces lengthy process of Land Acquisition, some statutory steps must be followed. These
steps are indicated in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 of Chapter 4.
3.9 In some cases it may so happen that after acquisition the remaining plot of the titleholder may not be
viable. If the remaining land is below 10 guntas (0.25 acre) he will have the option of either keeping
the remaining land or getting the replacement value of the entire and, including the remaining
unviable piece of land that shall also be acquired by KSHIP.

Raichur
3.10 52.39 acres of agriculture lands are getting affected due to construction of bypass at Raichur. Joint
measurement has been completed and Issue of 4(1) Notification is published.
Bijapur
3.11 The extent of land estimated for the construction of bypass at Bijapur town is 38.49 acres, out of
which 19.43 acres of land has been acquired.
3.12 It is evident from the Documents of Revenue Department that the Land Acquisition process was
completed prior to the policy was adapted to the project (from starting chainage (0.000), to 2.430 of
proposed bypass and in the possession of PWD). The PWD has constructed a road, the same would
be upgraded as part of construction of bypass, and also the Land Acquisition process was completed
at the two pockets (i.e. from chainage of proposed alignment 4.730 to 5.176 and 5.846 to 6.080) for
the two Survey No. 491 and 952 on the alignment, which connects NH 218 and NH 13. However,
the landowners have approached the court for enhancement of compensation. The Land Acquisition
process for proposed bypass alignment, which connects link 3A and NH 218 is in the process of

CHAPTER 4 -IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.
Implementation Responsibility
4.1 It is the responsibility of the PWD to ensure that the RAP is successfully implemented in a timely
manner. The implementation schedule will be updated, as more information becomes available.
Institutional Arrangements
4.2 The PWD has the overall responsibility of implementing the Resettlement Action Plan. Social
Development and Resettlement Cell has been established.  It is being headed by the Chief
Administrative Officer (CAO) drawn from Karnataka Administrative Services who is also incharge
of the overall co-ordination of the SDRC, the Environmental Management Plan Implementation Unit
and Information Systems. The CAO will co-ordinate with the Engineering Wing and the Project
Management Financial System.
4.3 The CAO has been assisted by the Assistant Commissioner, Land Acquisition and Assistant
Director, Social Development. In addition, Social Development Officers (SDO) are positioned at the
district level for day to day co-ordination and supervision. The tasks of the SDRC are as follows:
* The SDRC will establish operational links with other agencies of government involved in project-
induced resettlement.
*  It will bridge the distance between the project and project-affected persons and communities.
*  It will provide means and mechanisms for coordinating the delivery of the compensation and
assistance to entitled persons.
*  It will contribute social development perspectives and inputs to on-going project design and
implementation by working closely with PCC project planners, contractors and construction
supervision consultants.
*  It will link the project with state government agencies, provide liaison with PWD field units and
impacted communities.
*  It will also engage required training services, oversee a grievance redressal process, actively
monitor RAP implementation, and cooperate with planned project evaluations.
Training and Capacity Building
4.4 To enhance capabilities, the SDRC staff training would need to cover techniques in conducting
participatory rural appraisal for micro-planning, conducting census and socio-economic surveys,
dissemination of information, community consultation and progress monitoring and evaluation.
District Grievance Redressal Committee
4.5 The district level grievance redressal committees are set up under the chairmanship of the Deputy
commissioners to settle the disputes through mediation and reduce litigation.
NGO Partnership
4.6 The services of NGO are not required. The impact is on only agriculture land. The Land
Acquisition will be done through Land Acquisition Act (LAA). Joint measurement of land to be

Improvement Project                                              Raichur & Bijapur Bypasses
acquired will be taken care of by Joint Measurement. The LAA ensure that the compensation
process is prompt and efficient.  SDRC has adequate experienced staff to disburse the R& R
benefits to be extended to entitle PAFs in time.
Income Restoration(IR)
4.7 The focus of income restoration activities is to ensure that the PAPs are able to at least regain their
previous living standards. The main category of impacts as a result of construction of bypasses is
partial loss of agriculture land or full. The R&R policy of the project provides that those with legal
tenure, below poverty line and own below minimum economic land holdings are entitled to be
assisted under economic rehabilitation. Hence they will be compensated by way of alternate
economic rehabilitation support and training for up-gradation of skills or imparting new skills. Since
it is widely recognised that the best option is to allow the PAPs to continue their former occupations
majority of the PAPs are agriculturists, the options available under the schemes are sericulture,
poultry, animal husbandry etc. Circumstances may not permit or PAP may select to change
activities. SDRC will take up Needs Assessment Survey and prepare a plan.  The SDRC will
explore the possible options in consultation with PAPs and consider the optiona in light of local
conditions and opportunities etc. Based on the felt needs of these vulnerable groups, SDRC will be
prioritising the activities through people's participation. Further, these options will be tested for their
viability of skill, raw material and available appropriate technology.
4.8 Training in skill related activities can be imparted by ITI, LIDKAR, KVIB,KHDC and KSCDC. The
economic rehabilitation assistance money will be deposited in bank accounts to be released only for
the purchase of income generating assets.
4.9 There are 32 families and 27 families who have land holdings below minimum economic land
holding in Raichur and Bijapur respectively, and 3 families fall under the category of BPL in
Bijapur. These families will be entitled to be assisted under economic rehabilitation support.
Timing of resettlement
4.10 The Land Acquisition process must be completed by the start of civil works. Requisite
procedures will be developed by the PIU to carry out resettlement of PAPs. It is advised that the civil
works be first initiated for the town where the land acquisition process is completed, the PAPs are
received compensation and acquired stretch would be handed over to start work.    The
implementation schedule for Civil Works needs to be worked out in detail between the Engineering
Wing and the SDRC. Any delay in civil works would be expensive for the GOK, as the contractors
could go in for escalation and arbitration.
Implementation Schedule
4.11  The resettlement program  will be co-ordinated with likely timing of civil works.  The
resettlement process will be completed before the start of civil works.

Monitoring and Evaluation
4.15 The monitoring indicators in terms of physical and financial are identified. The implementation of
RAP for bypasses of Raichur and Bijapur will be closely monitored by SDRC and report regularly
to the Project Director. RAP implementation will be closely monitored to provide feedback to PIU
and SDRC project managers with an effective basis for assessing progress and identifying potential
difficulties and problem areas.
4.16 During implementation, the M&E system will perform the following key tasks:
a. Administrative monitoring to ensure that implementation is on schedule and that problems are
dealt with on a timely basis.
b. Impact evaluation to determine that recovery has indeed taken place and, in time, succeeded.
4.17 The indicators for achievement of the objectives under the resettlement and rehabilitation program
are of three kinds:
a. Process indicators indicating project inputs, expenditures, staff deployment etc
b. Output indicators, indicating results in terms of numbers of affected people compensated and
resettled, training held, credit disbursement, etc.
c. Impact indicators, related to the longer term effect of the project on people's lives.
4.18 The monitoring and evaluation indicators are given below. These are only broad indicators,

PCC staff clarified his question by giving the estimated rate per acre.
Mr. Gopal (PAP) raised a query what measures would be taken to counter the problems
of severance that would effect his land, which becomes unviable for agricultural
operations. PCC and PIU staff clarified that severance allowance will paid in addition to
the Land Acquisition compensation. All the PAPs expressed their appreciation for the
timely disclosure of Draft RAP and also requested the Project Staff to educate them with
the R&R Policy Provisions of the Project till the Land Acquisition process is completed.
Many PAPs enquired whether they could have the copy of RAP. PCC staff said that the
consultants would propose to the PIU to provide after the RAP is translated to local
language.
The PCC staff was informed that Mr. Rachappa whose land is proposed to be acquired
was missed out during census and socio-economic survey, included in PAFs list in the
Draft RAP.
The meeting ended with a vote of thanks from either side.

In the first place the PCC staff welcomed all the participants and explained the contents
of each section of Draft RAP in local language. PAPs started the discussions by raising
issues of compensation for land lost due to construction of bypass at Bijapur town.
Mr. Mallappa Mantri (PAP), queried about the amount quoted in budget estimates. PCC
staff gave the estimated rate per acre. He expressed that the prevailing market rate per
acre is much higher than the estimated rate for compensation. All PAPs were in the
opinion that the KSHIP's estimated rate per acre is much lower than the compensation
per acre paid in Upper Krishna Project. PAPs whose land acquired by the PWD before
before R&R policy of KSHIP was adopted moved to the Court for enhancement of
compensation expressed that the rate per acre enhanced by the Civil Court is also higher
than rate quoted in budget estimates of the proposed bypass.
PCC staff requested the PAPs for documents, which supports the compensation paid in
Upper Krishna Project or a copy of the latest Court Order regarding enhancement of
compensation in case of PAPs of Bijapur bypass whose land acquisition process was
completed before R&R policy of KSHIP was adopted. All the PAPs agreed to hand over
the copy. PCC and PIU staff assured the PAPs that the latest rate per acre would be taken
into consideration during budget estimation. All the PAPs expressed that the rate per acre
would be on par with rates paid in similar kind of projects.
After the completion of meeting, a copy of latest Court order regarding enhancement of
compensation in case of PAPs of Bijapur bypass whose land acquisition process was
completed before R&R policy of KSHIP was adopted was received and assured them the
same will be adopted while estimating budgets of proposed bypass of Bijapur.
All the PAPs expressed their appreciation for the adoption of Consent Award in Land
Acquisition process.
All the PAPs thanked the PCC and PIU staff for their whole hearted effort in organizing
the Draft RAP disclosure meeting.

GOVERNMENT OF KARNATAKA
RESETTLEMENT & REHABILITATION: PRINCIPLES AND POLICY
FRAMEWORK
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES
The Government of Karnataka (GOK) is preparing the Karnataka State Highways Improvement
Project (KSHIP). The aim of the project is to improve the performance of the State's road
transport network by improving road conditions and capacity, and to improve the State's capacity
to plan, develop and maintain the Karnataka roads network. The improvement works generally
consist of widening to two-lane carriage-way with paved shoulders, pavement strengthening,
removal of geometric deficiencies, repairs, rehabilitation and widening of bridges and culverts,
addressing traffic safety measures and simultaneously addressing environmental and social
impacts of the project.
1.1.   A selection of 960.50-km of roads will be upgraded in the project in two phases. These
roads will be improved through raising of formation levels, pavement strengthening,
widening and realignment wherever necessary. A additional 1083.10 kms of roads will be
selected for major maintenance. This policy applies to all components described in the
project appraisal document. Upgradation involves widening and strengthening of roads
and it necessitates acquisition of private lands or alienation of public land and properties
resulting in displacement of persons and loss of livelihood. The initial survey has
established that implementation of the project will entail acquisition of land, structures
and other assets and or cause displacement or loss of assets within government land,
Right of Way (ROW). The losses may be temporary or permanent and concern both
individuals and groups.
2.   PRINCIPLES
2.1.   This policy is based on the principle that the population affected by the project will be
assisted to improve their former living standards. The policy emphasizes that involuntary
resettlement will be avoided or minimized where possible by exploring other alternative
project designs. Where displacement is unavoidable, people loosing assets, livelihood or
other resources shall be assisted in improving their former living standards.
2.2.   This policy document describes the details of entitlements and type of assistance to be
extended to the affected persons, which will become the basis for preparing a detailed and
time bound Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The RAP will contain the implementation
details on how to ensure that principles and provisions of this policy can be implemented.
The Resettlement Action Plan will describe the approach to be followed in minimizing
and mitigating negative social and economic impacts caused by the project, including
displacement.

Annexures
2.3.   This policy identifies categories of expected project impacts, including loss of property
and assets, loss of livelihood, and other social and economic impacts on groups and
roadside communities. All people, households and groups adversely affected by the
project would be registered and support will be given in accordance with these policy
provisions.
3.   NEED FOR LAND ACQUSITION AND RESETTLEMENT IN THE PROJECT
3.1.   Most of the infrastructure work planned for the Road Sector project will take place within
the established Right of Way (ROW), and major land acquisition is not foreseen. Land
acquisition will take place only where there are new bypasses to be constructed, where
there are changes in alignment of the existing road, or where for widening there is not
enough ROW.
3.2.   Studies have revealed that the ROW is not free of encumbrances. Government land is
encroached upon by squatters who have erected structures used for residential or business
purposes, and by people cultivating land within ROW. These squatters and encroachers
are not entitled to legal compensation for the land they have occupied. The project will
give targeted support to below poverty line families to ensure that squatters and
encroachers are able to maintain shelter and livelihood, and non-land assets lost are re-
established.
4.   IMPACTS AND ENTITLEMENTS
4.1.   This policy addresses the direct and indirect impacts of project construction and operation
on affected persons, families, households, communities, and groups. The most direct and
immediate impacts are those associated with project construction, mainly land
acquisition. Other losses include loss of shelter, and other assets within the project's
corridor of impact; as well as roadside structure, business establishments and public
facilities. Mitigation is provided through compensation and assistance to project-affected
persons, families, households, and groups. These social units are entitled to compensation
and assistance on the basis of this policy framework adopted by the project. The policy
provides mitigation for:
*  loss of assets, including land and house or work place;
*  loss of livelihood or income opportunities; and
*  Collective impacts on groups, such as loss of community assets, common property
resources, and others.

Annexures
4.2.   Loss of assets and livelihood are impact categories that represent direct project impacts
on an identified population. The people likely to be affected will be surveyed and
registered, and project monitoring and evaluation will compare long-term impact against
baseline socio-economic data.
4.3.   Collective impacts on groups represent direct and indirect impacts, where group members
need not be individually registered. Group-oriented gains and losses in this category are
less quantifiable in terms of impacts on the individual. Mitigation and support
mechanisms are collectively oriented, and the monitoring of these efforts will examine
the impact and benefits for the groups involved.
5.    DEFINITIONS
5.1.   Under this resettlement policy adopted for the project, several categories of project-
affected persons are recognized with varying eligibility for the compensation and
assistance packages. The project-affected persons would be entitled to either
compensation or assistance or both. The relevant considerations are described below:
(a) Private Property Owners: Are those who have legal title to land, structure and other assets.
(b) Squatters: Are those who have illegally occupied government lands for residential, business and
or other purposes. They are not eligible for compensation but would qualify for assistance and
targeted support if they are below poverty line.
(c) Encroachers: Encroachers are persons who have extended their building, agricultural lands,
business premises or work places into government lands. As a rule, they are not eligible for
either compensation or assistance. The assistance to these persons will be on case to case basis
provided that they are below the poverty line.
(d) Tenants: Tenants are those persons having bonafide tenancy agreements, written or unwritten,
with a private property owner with clear property titles, to occupy a structure or land for
residence, business or other purposes. They are eligible for certain compensation or assistance as
per the existing norms and practice.
5.2.   The three major categories of units entitled for compensation and assistance include (i)
Project Affected Families (PAFs); (ii) Project-Affected Persons (PAPs); and (iii) Project
Affected Groups (PAGs).
(a) Project-Affected Families (PAFs), are defined to include each adult displaced person his/her
spouse, minor children and other dependents who habitually reside in one household.
(b) Proiect-Affected Persons (PAPs) are persons who have economic interests or residence within
the project impact corridor and who may be adversely affected directly by the project. Project-
affected persons include those displaced, those losing commercial or residential structures in whole
or part, those losing agricultural land or homesteads in whole or part, and those losing income
sources as a result of project action.

Annexures
(c) Project Affected Groups (PAGs) are groups or communities outside the immediate impact
corridor that may be affected by the project with a focus on the more vulnerable or weaker groups in
society.
(d) Cut-off Date: The date of Notification under Section 4 (1), will be the cut-off date where land
acquisition will be required. In the case of squatters and encroachers and unauthorized occupants the
date of the Project Co-ordinating Consultants socio-economic survey will be considered as the cut-
off date for entitlements under the project. For the purpose of recognizing adults (above 18 years) for
economic rehabilitation, the date of extending assistance or payment of compensation will be used
for determining economic rehabilitation. This applies in case the payment of compensation or
relocation if delayed beyond two years. For the purpose of identifying below poverty line families,
the cut off date is the date of census survey.
(e) Povertv Line Groups are those groups, which have an income upto 20% more than the Poverty
Line income as fixed for Karnataka as per Planning Commission norms.
(f) Vulnerable groups are those groups such as women-headed households, handicapped/disabled
and landless families, who will be dealt with on a case to case basis. The specific assistance for these
groups will be reflected in the RAP.
(g?) Compensation refers to the amount paid under the Land Acquisition Act for private property,
structures and other assets acquired for the project. In this context, compensation refers to payments
made by the government when Eminent Domain is exercised and title of a property is transferred
from a private entity to the government.
(h) Consent Award is the amount that the PAP negotiates with the project authorities, for the loss
incurred, on a willing buyer-seller basis. Once the amount is agreed upon the PAP cannot move to
court for enhancement of the amount. This amount is negotiated between the GOK and the land
/structure owner on a mutually agreed price without any preconditions.
(i)Replacement Cost of the acquired assets and property, is the amount required for the affected
household to replace/reconstruct the lost assets through purchase in the open market. Replacement
cost will be calculated at PWDs current Schedule of Rates without depreciation.
(i) Assistance refers to the support provided to PAPs in the form of ex-gratia payments, loans, asset
services, etc. in order to improve the standard of living and reduce the negative impacts of the
project.
(k) Gramthana refers to non agricultural land within the village built up area.
(7) Any other unidentified categorv not yet identified, shall be documented and mitigated based
on the principles agreed upon in the KSHIP social impacts and resettlement policy.

7.   SUPPORT PRINCIPLES FOR CATEGORIES OF IMPACTS
7.1.   The project entitlements for PAFs cover loss of land, structures and other assets. The
entitlement unit for such assistance is the family unit (PAF). If a household asset is to be
taken, the family, as a collective unit, will be "entitled". Compensation will be given to
the head of the household and, when new land or structures are given both the husband
and wife's names will be placed on the title. Entitlements provided to project-affected
families also include a shifting allowance, subsistence allowance, rights to salvage
building materials and counseling on alternative assistance.
7.2.   The project will ensure that new housing is made available before people are required to
relocate. The project approach will be to minimize relocation distance and the disruption
of local support networks. In the event that large population clusters are affected by the
project and must be relocated, the project will provide new housing in a resettlement site
approved by the affected people, with adequate infrastructure and utilities. Resettlement
sites will be developed in case there are 20 or more families getting dislocated in one
cluster. This will be provided as an option and households may still elect self-relocation.
In such cases, compensation and other support will be provided to self-relocating
households and project will assist and facilitate their resettlement process. If resettlement
sites are developed as part of the project, the local host population will also be consulted
about their views and needs, and be given appropriate support to reduce any negative
impact caused by an influx of new people.
7.3.   Early census survey will identify all potentially affected people, whether inside the ROW
or outside and also in cases of realignment or ROW extension. A cut-off date will be
determined for each of the project roads. Opportunistic encroachments and squatting
taking place after this date will not be considered eligible for support under this project.
Wherever Government land is available beyond the corridor of impact, project affected
families will be shifted there to continue their business.
7.4.   The project may generate unskilled labour for construction, operation and maintenance.
These jobs will be offered to PAPs and other local people. A clause will be incorporated
in project construction documents requiring contractors to give a small percent of the
employment opportunities to eligible unskilled and semi-skilled PAPs and local people
when they possess necessary qualifications and ability.
7.5.   Where the project affects tribal groups living in the vicinity of the road corridor, the GOK
and GOI policies will apply. 1 Special attention in the project will be directed to
developing assistance and support mechanisms that are culturally appropriate to the
affected tribal groups.

Annexures
7.6.   Any other group-oriented impacts not yet identified, shall be documented and mitigated
based on the principles provided in this policy.
Targeted support to below poverty line groups
7.7.   The project will develop target assistance for groups such as women-headed households,
children, the elderly, and the disabled. The RAP will address special attention, options
and support mechanisms for these groups. Attention will be given on a case by case basis,
with regard to their habitation, livelihood, educational opportunities, vocational training,
etc. The type of special assistance will be determined during development of RAP.
Options and choices
7.8.   The project will provide options and choices among different entitlements to the affected
population. As part of the project consultation and participation mechanisms, people will
be informed and consulted about the project and its impacts, and their entitlements and
options. The affected population will be counseled so that they are able to make informed
choices among the options provided. This will be done particularly in the case of below
poverty line groups, who will be encouraged to choose those options of low risk.
8.   RESETTLEMENT PLANNING APPROACH
Right of Way and Corridor of Impact
8.1.   Right of Way is the lawfully acquired corridor of public land owned by the State
Government and administered by the PWD for the transit of the existing road. Using
available records with the PWD and the Revenue Department, the project will verify the
boundaries of the legal right of way as well as boundaries of private properties within and
in the vicinity of the likely Corridor of Impact. Displacement under the project will be
limited to the corridor required for the road and its safety zone. This corridor is referred
to as the Corridor of Impact. Within this corridor, there should be no structures or other
hindrances. The advantage of this approach is that such a corridor is easier to maintain
free of encumbrances than the full Right of Way.
8.2.   The project will ensure that those outside the Corridor of Impact but inside the Right of
Way are not displaced during the lifetime of the project. If they are made to move during
the lifetime of the project or within three years after the completion of the project, they
will be considered eligible for the support mechanisms available to people affected by the
project. It is recognized that this approach offers only a temporary solution, and does not
adequately address the longer term needs of maintaining the Right of Way clear, or of
providing the squatters and encroachers with the security of tenure needed to improve
their lives.
8.3.   By limiting displacement and the need for resettlement to the Corridor of Impact, exact
identification of affected population is not possible until engineering designs have been
completed. A shift in alignment of a meter may mean the difference between whether a
person is considered affected by the project or not.

Annexures
Census and baseline socio-economic surveys
8.4.   A full census survey will be undertaken to register and document the status of the
potentially affected population within the project impact area, their assets and sources of
livelihood. This census will cover 100 % of the potentially affected population within the
likely Corridor of Impact and a reasonable distance beyond, to ensure that people and
assets have been registered in case of a later shift in alignment legal boundaries including
the Right of Way will be verified and certified. A limited sample of the potentially
affected population will be studied in more detail to provide the baseline information
against which project impacts will be measured and evaluated. This sample will be
representative of the different impact categories identified.
8.5.   Following final designs, those within the Corridor of Impact will be considered eligible
for support under the project. This is likely to be substantially lower in number than those
initially covered in the census.
Screening and Planning
8.6.   Every effort will be made to reduce potential negative impacts of the project, both in
terms of environment and social issues. The project will therefore carefully coordinate the
design process with the socio-economic impacts, in order to minimize negative impacts
and maximize benefits. When choosing among different design options, such as whether
to construct a bypass or improve the road through built-up area, environmental and social
indicators will be factored into the decision along with technical and economic
considerations.
9.   IMPLEMENTATION
9.1.   During project implementation, the resettlement program will be coordinated with
completion of designs and the likely timing of civil works. The project will provide
adequate notification, counseling and assistance to affected people so that they are able to
move or give up their assets with out undue hardship before civil works are to start. The
project will ensure that civil works are not started on any road segment before
compensation and assistance to the affected population has been provided in accordance
with this policy framework.
Land Acquisition procedures
9.2.   The normal procedures for Land Acquisition under Section 4 (1) will be followed in this
project. Although the Land Acquisition Act has a provision for emergency acquisition
requiring shorter time, this clause will not be invoked unless it is documented that an
emergency exists and that it is not possible to follow the normal procedure for Land
Acquisition. The LA procedure outlined is to be followed in conjunction with the Land
Acquisition Act.
Consultation and Participation Process

Annexures
9.3.   Involuntary resettlement generally gives rise to severe problems for the affected
population. These problems may be reduced if, as part of a resettlement program, people
are properly informed and consulted about the project, their situation and preferences, and
allowed to make meaningful choices. This serves to reduce the insecurity and opposition
to the project, which other wise is likely to occur. The project will therefore ensure that
the affected population and other stakeholders are informed, consulted in a meaningful
way and allowed to participate actively in the development process. This will be done
throughout the project, during preparation, implementation and monitoring of project
results and its impact.
9.4.   The consultations will be conducted in a way, which is appropriate for cultural, gender
based and other differences among the stakeholders. Where different groups or
individuals have different views or opinions, more emphasis will be given to the views
and needs of those below poverty line.
Institutional Arrangements
9.5.   The RAP will contain detailed information about institutional and organizational
mechanisms required to implement the plan. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will
have the responsibility of implementation and coordinating the resettlement along with
other project components, and will be staffed with people with experience in resettlement
and social development.
9.6.   The Project Implementation Unit requires coordination among different agencies,
working in different districts and jurisdictions. This presents particular challenges, and
may pose a risk of delay in implementation of the resettlement program. An assessment
will therefore be made of institutional capacity and risks. This assessment will be
described in the Resettlement Action Plan, accompanied by a strategy for developing the
required capacity and minimise implementation risks. This will include analysis of
training needs and a plan for training of personnel at different levels. Such capacity
building will be co-ordinated with the overall project implementation schedule, to ensure
that skilled staff are available to implement the Resettlement Action Plan without causing
delays to civil works.
9.7.   Since much of the work related to resettlement involves social development and
community participation, the project will work with agencies experienced in this type of
work, such as NGOs. Consideration will also be given to coordinating with other
development programmes, such as housing schemes/rural development schemes in order
to provide the project affected population with access to services and programmes already
in place.
9.8.   While consultancy services will be used in preparing and implementing this project, an
important objective is to develop local capacity to plan and implement resettlement
programs. The project will therefore document how capacity building at different levels is

achieved, and how this project contributes to improved sector-level or State wide policies
and practices related to resettlement in the State.
Costs and Budget
9.9.   The Resettlement Action Plan will contain a consolidated overview of estimated costs.
This will consist of an item-wise budget estimate for resettlement implementation,
monitoring and evaluation and contingencies including administrative expenses. The cost
of resettlement will be included in the over all costs of the project. Compensation
amounts and other support mechanisms will be adjusted based on inflation factors. The
budget will incorporate provisions for this, and the Resettlement Action Plan will
describe how such adjustments and updates to the budget are to be made.
Grievance Redressal
9.10.  It is expected that through a participatory process and good compensation and support
mechanisms, acceptance of the project will be enhanced and complaints reduced. There
may nevertheless be individuals or groups who feel that they are not given adequate
support, or that their needs are not properly addressed. The project will therefore establish
a Grievance Redressal Cell with local committees, which will hear complaints and
facilitate solutions. This Grievance Redressal Cell will be used to settle disputes through
mediation, and to reduce unnecessary litigation.
9.11.  The project will describe the step-by-step process for registering and addressing
grievances, and provide details regarding registering complaints, response time,
communication modes and mechanisms for appeal or approaching civil courts if other
provisions fail. In addition to local Government officials and representatives of the
project, each Grievance Redressal Committee will have representation from the local
affected population and collaborating agencies.
Monitoring and Evaluation
9.12.  The project will develop indicators for achievement of the objectives under the
resettlement program. These will be of three kinds: Process indicators, Output and Impact
indicators,
9.13.  The benchmarks and indictors will be identified in the RAP. It will be limited in number,
and combine quantitative and qualitative types of data. The indicators will be related to
process and immediate outputs and results, will be monitored internally by the project.
This information will serve to inform project management about progress and results, and
to adjust the work program where necessary if delays or problems arise. Provision will be
made for participatory monitoring involving the project-affected people and beneficiaries
of the resettlement program in assessing results and impacts.
9.14.  The project will also contract with an external agency such as an academic institute,
which will undertake independent concurrent evaluations at least twice a year during the
