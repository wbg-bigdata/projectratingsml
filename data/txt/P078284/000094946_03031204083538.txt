I. THE PROJECT
A. Summary of Development Objectives
The development objective of the proposed Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project is to facilitate the
country's economic and social recovery through improved physical access to goods, markets, and
administrative and social services.
The development objective will be achieved by: (i) removing key transport bottlenecks that seriously
hamper recovery, (ii) building capacity in management, implementation, and maintenance of transport
services and works through the provision of equipment and technical assistance related to planning,
maintenance, and supervision of works, and (iii) assisting in the establishment of an institutional and
policy framework for the sector for sustainable service delivery in the transport sector.
The removal of key transport bottlenecks will immediately promote regional economic integration and
facilitate trade, delivery of humanitarian aid, and reconstruction efforts in all sectors. Normal traffic
operations on the key road arteries and in the air will be restored, also facilitating movements on the key
import/export links and main corridors. Additionally, the civil works and subsequent maintenance
financed through the Project will provide opportunities for employment through the engagement of the
local population in rehabilitation activities.
B. Sector Issues Addressed by the Project
Fragmentation. The responsibilities for the transport sector are shared by a number of different
organizations: the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and
Tourism and the Ministry of the Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRD - responsible for rural
access roads). The management of the transport sector is, therefore, fragmented and at time
uncoordinated, and lacks a coordinated strategy.
The Project is addressing the lack of coordination and ineffective sector management in a technical
assistance component through a full review of the sector (Transport Sector Review). This will be a
locally led effort with support from internationally experts to form the basis upon which ATA will revise
transport policies, restructure and integrate sector institutions, and formulate projects for capacity building
and development of the transport sector in the short to medium term.
Investment Priorities. While laying the foundation for longer term sector reforms and improving sector
management capacity for roads and civil aviation, the Project will finance high priority rehabilitation
requirements on the northern road corridor and at Kabul International Airport. The northem corridor was
selected as the initial priority because it is the main artery between the capital and the northern regions,
and international link to neighboring Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Many humanitarian shipments are
transported on this road and are currently constrained by extremely poor conditions in certain areas
(Salang Pass and Kunduz area). It is also part of the Afghan Ring Road System, which draws together all
major regions. Rehabilitation of the Salang Road and Tunnel will have practical and symbolic
significance for the economic and political integration of the country given its strategic location.
Reinstatement of the Kabul International Airport in conformance with international civil aviation
standards is indispensable for re-establishing credible economic and political ties with the outside world,
and an important first step in rejuvenating domestic aviation travel.
Implementation Capacity. Weak sector management capacity has been addressed through short term
technical assistance and on-the-job training in implementing the above investments (Emergency Public
Administration IDA Credit of US$10 million). In the case of air traffic control, an interim solution of
supporting international skilled personnel was chosen, whilst local air traffic controllers are being trained.
1



Because of the dearth of existing information, the Transport Sector Review will provide a basis for
prescribing longer term reforms and necessary strengthening of human resources and institutional
implementing capacity.
Given the virtually total lack of maintenance capacity (human resources, equipment and financing), it was
decided to provide basic equipment and training, as well as Technical Assistance and interim financing
for operation, so as to assure winter travel through the Salang pass and the Salang Tunnel during coming
winters, while a performance based multi- year road maintenance and management contract is being
prepared. At the same time, a long term solution for cost recovery of maintenance will be addressed in
the Transport Sector Review.
Project Financing. Except for the co-financing identified from the Swedish International Development
Coordination Agency (Sida) and the Norwegian Agency for International Development (NORAD), the
Project would be financed from the proposed IDA credit, except for a contribution by the Government of
US$ 15 million. Discussions are underway between ATA and the Government of Italy with regards to
co-financing of the Charikar-Bamiyan road which would reduce the Afghan contribution significantly.
Retroactive financing would be provided within the limits set in OP 12.10 on Retroactive Financing.
The AACA in cooperation with MPW has carried out advanced procurement in order to address critical
reconstruction needs in the Salang area before the winter starts. The MCAT has also taken steps to
advance the procurement of critical aviation equipment for safe airport operations, for ground handling,
the terminal building and for aeronautics and radio navigational aids. The management of procurement
services for the critical aviation equipment has partly been contracted out to the International Civil
Aviation organization (ICAO) in Montreal.
The Government lacks financial capacity to pre-finance some advanced activities and eligible
expenditures on components of ETRP. Reimbursement of expenditures through retroactive financing
under the proposed credit is, therefore, likely to be minimal. One practical option was to allow these
critical advanced payments to be made from the recently approved IDA grants, in particular the
Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (CEPWP) and the Emergency
Infrastructure Reconstruction Project (EIRP). In order to do this, and on the request of the Government,
the Development Grant Agreements for both Projects were amended to make changes to the project
descriptions, reflect new categories of expenditures, and amend procurement schedules.
The overall amount of pre-financing provided for in the above IDA grants will not exceed 10 percent of
the amount of the ETRP credit.
C. Detailed Project Description
1. - Components.
The Project consists of four parts: (A) Highways; (B) Civil Aviation; (C) Secondary and Tertiary Roads;
and (D) Institutional, Policy and Other Studies.
Part A: Highwavs (US$69.90 million). The objective of this component is to restore an adequate road
connection between Kabul and the provinces in the north and the countries along Afghanistan's northern
border. The component includes two key road sections, the Kabul-Salang-Doshi Road and the Doshi-Pol-
e-Khomri-Kunduz Road of the Kabul - Kunduz - Shirkhan corridor. In addition to linking the capital to
the north, rehabilitation of the Pol-e-Khomri - Kunduz road will also ensure a dependable link between
Kunduz and the border town of Shirkhan is rehabilitated. The project roads are part of the Afghan Ring
Road System, which draws together all the major regions.
2



In assessing the rehabilitation requirements and the scope of the Project, the focus has been on restoring
the road to its former state rather than on improving the standards of the road. The existing alignment has
therefore been followed except on short sections liable to flooding, where the road is likely to be elevated.
The proposed Project would support the rehabilitation of the existing road along its current alignment. It
will also finance equipment and training related to winter road maintenance in the Salang area. The
Project would also finance the necessary TA to establish permanent self-financing arrangements for road
maintenance and operation of the Salang tunnel and mountain roads from road users. The Emergency
Community Empowerment and Public Works Project would finance up to US$ 3.5 million worth of road
related expenditures on the Kabul-Salang Doshi road. The Norwegian Agency for International
Development has agreed to finance construction supervision of the Salang Tunnel contract.
Part B: Civil Aviation (US$19.30 million). Kabul International Airport is situated at approximately 6
km from Kabul City at an elevation of nearly 1,800 m. It has a moderate climate with a lowest average
temperature of -10 °C in January and a highest average temperature of 35 °C in July. The airport has one
paved runway with a length of 3,500 m and a width of 45 m, and a taxiway system and various aprons
south-west of the runway. The airport was damaged extensively cluring the civil war that ended in 2002,
but the runway strip is reported to be de-mined and bomb craters in the runway pavement have been
repaired with concrete. The runway shows reflection cracking and intermediate cracking, open paving
joints and loss of material at the surface. Cracks have been partly sealed with bitumen, which sticks to
the aircraft tires during hot weather.
The works to be financed include emergency repairs, rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged
runway pavement, as well as provision and installation of airfield ground lighting, including power
generators, a no-break set and CCR's. The design stage is estimated to last 12 weeks, and the
construction period not more than four months. There will necessarily be an interim period, estimated at 3
months, between the end of the design stage and the mobilization of the contractor.
This component will also provide communications and air traffic control equipment identified by ICAO
as necessary for the Kabul Airport to function to intemational standard. Whilst local air traffic controllers
are being trained, the Project will finance temporary manning of the air traffic control functions for six
months. The Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project could finance early procurement of
equipment worth up to US$ 3.0 million if payments become due before the ETRP IDA credit is signed
and effective.
Part C: Secondary and Tertiary Roads Component (US$38.30 million). This component will finance
the rehabilitation of selected secondary and tertiary roads serving rural populations in the area of
influence of the main road corridor being rehabilitated under the Project. These would primarily be roads
linking the communities to the major network.
Two secondary roads have been pre-identified by the Government and cofinancing has been discussed
and agreed with two donors. These are the Talaqan-Faizabad section of the Kunduz - Faizabad road, and
the Charikar - Bamiyan road. A planning process has been initiated in expectation that these roads will be
eligible for financing under the Project. The rehabilitation design and standards will be adjusted to match
the available funding and the internal rate of return requirement of 12 percent.
For the tertiary rural roads, labor-based methods would be used where appropriate. The methodology for
the screening and selecting of the roads will be carried out through a participatory process, and will serve
as a pil6t approach for screening and selecting rural road improvements in the future. Implementation
support will consist of short term technical assistance and training for developing a methodology for
subproject screening, selection, design and project implementation.
3



Part D: Institutional, Policy And Other Studies (US$1.30 million). This component will lay the
foundation for sustainable management of the transport sector. It will include a Transport Sector Review
(TSR) to develop Institutional and Policy Framework for the Sector, and pre-feasibility studies for
potential future investments. Procurement of consulting services for the TSR will be financed by the
Swedish Intemational Development Agency (Sida), and procurement for these services is completed and
the consultants are already mobilized.

2. - Key Policies and Reforms supported by the project
Overall Sector Policy. The Transport Sector Review is intended to assist the Government in preparing
an overall vision and strategic plan for the transport sector (covering aviation, roads, road transport and
road traffic), consistent with the overall policies and the draft Afghanistan National Development
Framework. A half-day workshop was organized by AACA and Sida in July 2002 as a project launch,
attended by representatives of all the affected ministries and the ]3ank.
Cost Recovery. Achieving cost recovery from road users for maintenance of the Jabal os Saraj - Salang
- Doshi and the Pol-e Khomri - Kunduz roads is critical to secure a longer term sustainability of the road
improvements to be made under the Project. Sustainable arrangements need to be put in place for future
maintenance and operation of the Salang mountain pass road, since in particular winter maintenance is
critical to keep this important corridor open.
The MPW has revived an old system of toll collection on roads in many provinces and toll stations are
now manned by MPW on both sides of the Salang mountain pass and in the Kabul area. The original idea
in the 1999 legislation was for MPW to use the funds collected for construction and maintenance of roads.
However, this is not happening due to leakages or the fact that the amount collected is passed on to MOF
from the Provinces rather than MPW. There is a need to address the arrangements for financing of the
road sector in general, and this will be a process to be undertaken under the Transport Sector Review
study under this Project.
However, a review of the current system (see Annex 8, Documents in Project File) has been undertaken
as part of the preparation of this Project. It examines the modalities for the establishment of self-
financing arrangements for the Salang Tunnel road for regular routine and periodic road maintenance and
for addressing the backlog of accumulated additional needs developed over a long period of maintenance
neglect. This would assist the MOF and MPW in establishing road maintenance cost recovery policies
for this Project and put in place maintenance and operation by contract rather than force account as is now
the practice.
Force Account. The Project would assist the MPW in moving away from force account as the main form
of providing road services. This would be done through contracting of rehabilitation work on main roads,
contracting of rural road upgrading, and by assisting in a move away from force account through
provision of regular road maintenance by multi-year maintenance management contracts. The MPW will,
through the Project, get considerable experience in management of road contracts and in managing the
assistance of design and construction supervision consultants.
3. - Benefits and Target Population
Institutional benefits. This operation will, apart from emergency assistance, set the stage for putting in
place an appropriate policy and institutional environment that will promote long term management of the
nation's transportation system. In addition to the creation of suitable legal and regulatory frameworks,
capacity building efforts supported by the Project would help to create absorptive capacity for handling
donor assistance, community driven development as well as other forms of private sector involvement
across infrastructure sectors.
Improvements to the Kabul Airport will facilitate the re-establishment of Afghanistan as a destination for
international investment, tourism and assistance efforts. It will benefit all air passengers and lead to the
growth of employment from related economic activities in support of air traffic.
Target populations. Improvements to the northern corridor and adjacent rural roads will improve
physical access to markets, goods and services of some I million people living in the 12 districts through
which the improved roads pass. As a national artery, this road will also benefit many more people and the
country at large by facilitating the flow of humanitarian aid passing through the north to the entire
5



country. The rehabilitation works will generate local employment and increased traffic will generate
employment in the transport service industry, as well as agriculture and industry benefiting from
improved access to inputs and markets.
All income groups-travelers, suppliers, and consumers of goods and services-use the Kabul-Doshi
road. Without the Project, the existing high transport costs would continue to affect prices and
availability of services to the community, and would severely constrain economic and social
rehabilitation, as many sections of the road are not operational at all times. With the Project, the road will
be open at all times and thus travel times between Kabul and major cities in the north will reduce, and
transport costs will decrease. The lower passenger and freight transport costs will lead to reduction in
fares, marketing costs of products, and the price of goods, and to the reduction of transport bottlenecks
affecting economic and social recovery. This will have direct benefits for the traveling public,
agricultural and industrial producers, consumers, and local communities having improved access to social
services and employment centers.
4. - Lessons learned from previous projects
The main lessons learned from other emergency reconstruction projects include the following:
1.   Reduce complexity in emergency operations which need to address critical requirements: avoid
multiple objectives; avoid major innovations and set up simple implementation arrangements.
2.   The Bank should be prepared to support the Borrower through proactive and staff-intensive
involvement upfront during project preparation (and subsequently during first stages of project
implementation). Engagement by the Borrower of adequate technical assistance in project
implementation should be ensured through financing under the IDA credit, or (preferably for the
Borrower) under timely grant financing from donors.
3.   Bank versus recipient executed rules for trust funds. Many post-conflict countries have very little
government capacity for project management, procurement or financial management. It makes
little sense to spend great effort justifying Bank-execution in situations where, for the initial period,
it is obvious that Bank execution will apply.
4.   "Good practice" in post-conflict operations indicates shortened project preparation timetables,
whilst investing more BB resources and effort into implementation/supervision. This will allow
possible re-orientation and upscaling of project components and mobilization of co-financing as the
situation evolves. However, Bank procedures for processing such amendments might be too time
consuming or/and provide obstacles due to Bank policy constraints.
5.   Retroactive financing is of limited use to jumpstart project activities before Board presentation,
either because post conflict government physically has no cash as has been the case in Afghanistan,
or because the amounts are insufficient.
6.   Project negotiations and effectiveness are often extremely time consuming and confusing to weak
post-conflict governments, especially when joint or parallel cofinancing involves the setting up of
Bank managed trust funds. Delays often occur at this stage rather than before appraisal.
7.   Post-conflict operations often involve the financing of NGOs, some of which in some countries are
just private contracting entities, set up as NGOs for tax purposes. The Bank has considerable
experience in dealing with all types of NGOs, but we have no consistent provisions for competitive
procurement, financial management and accountability from different types of NGOs.
8.   The Bank needs to respond quickly in project preparation to avoid changes and holdup of the
delivery of Bank assistance.
9.   Timeliness and flexibility are of key importance during project implementation in ensuring the
effectiveness of Bank assistance. Changing circumstances call for quick adjustments within and
between components and possibly also flexibility in implementation arrangements.
6



10.  Special attention needs to be given to defining procurement arrangements, since time is of the
essence in emergency operations. Weaknesses in preparation place a subsequent burden through
the need for intensifying supervision input to correct deficiencies.
11.  The issue of Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) needs to be carefully addressed in tendering and award
of civil works contracts.
12.  In some post-conflict situations contractors may have difficulties in getting satisfactory advance
payment and performance guarantees from reputable international banks. Some flexibility may
have to be shown by the governments in such cases by accepting more risks or by using alternatives
of disbursing advance payments that reduces the government's risks, for example by disbursing
advance payment to an escrow account or in trances depending on degree of mobilization.

II. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Implementation. The Project would be implemented over 33 months starting in April 2003.
The Project would be implemented by the Ministry of Public Works except for the Civil Aviation
Component, which will be implemented by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism. The AACA will
facilitate a transparent procurement process and financial management. The Project will provide support
for the MPW in undertaking implementation by financing international consultants to be in charge of
design and construction supervision of the road contracts, the Salang Tunnel contract and the financing of
rural road rehabilitation. There will be a small permanent maintenance unit established for the Salang
area from existing staff within MPW. This unit will be responsible for contracting out winter road
maintenance including tunnel operation on the road across the Salang mountain.
B. Procurement Agent. For the roads related components, procurement of works, goods and services
and contract disbursements will be done through the AACA and its procurement agent, but monitoring of
technical assistance and physical components, project administration, etc. would be done by the
implementing ministry, the MPW. The ICAO in Montreal has been contracted by the Government to
assist the MCAT with procurement and installation of critical equipment and recruitment of air traffic
control staff, which will be carried out according to Bank guidelines. Suitable contractual arrangements
for each component are defined in Annex 6 and include: larger civil works contracts (ICB) for the roads
to be financed; a smaller turn key contract (LIB) for the rehabilitation of the Salang tunnel and snow
galleries including nominated sub-contractor for ventilators, lighting and generators; an equipment and
training contract for winter maintenance equipment for the Salang pass road; arrangements for separate
contracting of bridges; goods contracts for civil aviation equipment using IS; NCB for labor-based road
works and QCB selection of consultants unless Single Source is used where appropriate. (See Annex 6).
C. Role of World Bank during Implementation. The role of IDA during the project implementation
will be to monitor the compliance of credit covenants and assist in resolving any issue arising out thereof
and maintaining regular liaison between project implementation officials. lDA's monitoring during
implementation will focus on:
a.     Compliance with loan agreement including
* Procurement
* Disbursement, financial management and auditing
* Environmental issues
* Social Issues
b.     Project progress (physical and financial)
c.     Attainment of agreed performance indicators.
A full supervision mission will be carried out quarterly, with specialists visiting Afghanistan as required.
The Ministry of Public Works will submit a quarterly progress report, detailing the procurement and
progress towards achieving output and outcome objectives.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation. Given the emergency nature of the Project, the output, outcome and
sector indicators (Annex 1) have been crafted to focus on the time bound objectives of facilitating
transport and access in the shortest possible time, while providing on-the-job learning opportunities and
institution-building for sustainable management and maintenance of transportation assets. Annex I
provides a summary of the monitoring and evaluation arrangements envisioned for the Project. The Bank
supervision will focus on assessing these indicators and assisting the Government in overcoming
implementation difficulties in a timely manner.

III. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION
A. Procurement Management
The Project is implemented by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation
and Tourism (MCAT), who have no recent experience in implementation of IDA financed projects. No
formal procurement capacity assessment was carried out for MPW mainly because of the lack of past
experience in procurement of road services and their past reliance on force account. But also because of
the availability of a procurement agent, whose role is to assist implementing agencies in all procurement
related activities. Also in the case of MCAT no assessment was made, basically for the same reasons, but
also because of the support they are expected from the ICAO.
The IDA Emergency Public Administration Project is funding the services of a Procurement Agent to
support the AACA and various ministries. The Procurement Agent will be responsible for the
procurement of all goods, works and consultancy services for the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation
Project, except for some equipment under Part B Civil Aviation. The Ministry of Civil Aviation and
Tourism has already taken steps to advance the procurement of critical equipment for safe airport
operations, for ground handling, for the terminal building and for aeronautics and radio navigational aids
(RNA). To this purpose, the MCAT has contracted out some of the procurement services to ICAO in
Montreal, and bidding documents have been reviewed by the Bank and contracts are about to be signed
between ICAO, the Government and the suppliers.
In view of the post-conflict environment in the country, the procurement risk is considered high, despite
the use of procurement expertise of a specialized firm (Procurement Agent) in the AACA. Project
supervision will include procurement expertise in most missions over the life of the IDA Credit.
Threshold limits described below have been set considering these risks.
1. Procurement Management and Plan. The procurement arrangements and the estimated costs for
the project components to be funded by IDA are shown in Table-A. Procurement under the IDA Credit
would be carried out in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
Credits" (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997 and January 1999) and
"Guidelines for Selection atid Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997,
revised in September 1997 and January 1999, and May 2002). The "Bank's Standard Request for
Proposals: Selection of Consultants" (July 1997, Revised April 1998 and July 1999) would be used for all
consulting services. For the procurement of works and goods, IDA shall suggest appropriate bidding
documents/contract formats to be used.

I) Figures in italics are the amounts to be financed by IDA. All the costs include contingencies.
*) The total is US$3.50 million larger than the credit amount. This is because US$3.50 million is expected to be financed from the
Emergency Conuunity Empowerment and Public Works Project
2/ Includes civil works, goods, and services to be procured out of Force Account and through nationalinternational shopping, direct
contracting, three quotations, community participation, consulting services, training, technical assistance, incremental costs etc.
General Procurement Notice for this Project has been published in the UN Development Business (June
30, 2002, Issue No. 585), the Development Gateway and the on-line version of UNDB.
Bl: Works (US$108.05 Million)
Works will comprise of road rehabilitation, reconstruction and maintenance, including rehabilitation of
the Salang Tunnel, bridges and the Kabul Airport Runway, a new water supply and sanitation system for
the Kabul Airport, and the rehabilitation of secondary and tertiary roads. For the road projects, both pre-
and post qualification will be used with reduced periods for preparation and evaluation.
ICB/LIB
Most highway rehabilitation and reconstruction works will be procured following ICB procedures,
namely the Kabul-Doshi rehabilitation, Pol-e Khomri-Kunduz and Kunduz-Shirkan reconstruction. Bids
will be invited on a slice and package basis with a minimum size of slices of about 4.0 to 5.0 million US
dollars, in order to attract international contractors, at least from the region. Works on the Salang Tunnel
have been already awarded on the basis of LIB, due to the urgency of having the works completed before
the onset of winter. Contractors invited to bid for these works included all those who responded to the
General Procurement Notice published on UNDB, and those who expressed an interest in response to an
invitation sent to a wide geographical selection of reputable firms experienced in tunneling works and
advertised also through the embassies in Kabul and Islamabad.
NCB/Force Account
NCB procedures will be followed for the procurement of erection works for bridge contracts and for the
rehabilitation of secondary and tertiary roads, because of the scatiered location and the anticipated size of
contracts not exceeding US$2 million. The Bank's standard bidding document for smaller works will
have to be used for such contracts.
Force account procedure is being used for winter maintenance/emergency work up to an aggregate limit
of US$700,000 over a two year period.
B2: Pr,ocurement of Goods (US$11.95 Million)
The procurement of goods consists of items such as equipment for tunnel ventilation, steel girders for
bridges, equipment for winter road maintenance, and various equipment for airport maintenance and safe
operation (including communication and RNA, ground handling, runway operation and fire fighting,
meteorological, de-icing, airfield maintenance ambulances etc). International Competitive Bidding
(ICB), InternationaVNational Shopping (IS/NS) and procurement through UN Procurement Agency (UN
Procurement) will be used.
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and Limited International Bidding (LIB) will be used for goods
estimated to cost more than US$500,000 per contract. This applies to procurement of civil aviation
equipment, where LIB will be used and possibly also steel girders for bridge rehabilitation works.
International/National Shopping: This will be used for goods estimated to cost less than or equal to
US$500,000 equivalent per contract. The contract packages are expected to be in the range of
US$10,000 to US$200,000 with few contracts of up to US$500,000. Under shopping procedures, the
11



Procurement Agent will use simplified documents and procedures for soliciting, receiving and evaluating
competitive quotations from usually at least three suppliers (in International Shopping from two different
countries). The shopping method to be used will be based on IDA's memorandum of June 8, 2000,
Guidance Procurement Notes on handling procurement under Shopping Method. In view of the
emergency operations, the threshold has been set higher than the normal limit of US$100,000.
Direct Contracting: Spare parts and supplemental equipment which must be procured from the original
supplier, may be procured in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3.7 of the guidelines.
Aggregate value limited to US$0.5 million for Part A and US$1 million for Part B.
Procurement through UN Procurement Agency: This will be used for the goods under Part B, Civil
Aviation, to be procured by ICAO, appointed by the Government, under its own financing, as
Procurement Agent for a part of these components. In compliance with para. 3.10 of the Guidelines,
ICAO shall strictly follow all the procurement procedures outlined in the Credit Agreement on behalf of
the ATA, review procedures and documentation, with modifications, acceptable to IDA, to reflect the
specialized nature of the equipment being procured.
B3: Consulting Services and Training (US$8.80 Million)
Although for consulting services the preferred selection method should be Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS), it is envisaged that for some consultancies, for quicker selection, the method to be
used is Selection based on Consultants' Qualification (CQ) or Quality Based Selection (QBS). (This
means seeking of Expressions of Interest (EOI) based on brief TOR, specifying in the EOI criteria for
establishing a shortlist with a view to selecting the firm with the most appropriate qualification and
references. The selected firm will be asked to submit a combined technical-financial proposal before
being invited for negotiations). The EOI for these consultancies shall be published in UNDB/
Development Gateway and other targeted announcements.
Other Methods of Selection: For very small assignments, and where in the interest of the client rapid
selection is essential, the services of the consultants will be procured in accordance with the provisions of
paragraphs 3.8 through 3.1 1'(Single-source selection) and paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 (Selection of
Individual Consultants) of the Consultant Guidelines.

5. Procurement Information. The Procurement Agent will prepare procurement information, which
will be collected and recorded as follows:
- prompt reporting of contract award information for the respective components; and quarterly
reports prepared by AACA indicating revised cost estimates for individual contracts and total cost;
- revised timings of procurement actions including advertising, bidding, contract award and
completion time for individual contracts; and
- compliance report by AACA within three months of the Credit signing date.
6. Proposed Procurement Arrangements and Frequency of Supervision.The project elements, their
estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement are summarized in Table A. Consultant Selection
Arrangement are given in the Table in para B3 above. Thresholds are given in Table B.
B. Financial Management
1. Accounting, Financial Reporting and Audit Arrangement: The financial management and audit
functions for the proposed Project will be undertaken through the contracts which are supported by the
recently approved IDA financed Emergency Public Administration Project. Under these contracts FM,
audit and procurement Agents respectively are responsible for supporting the transitional govemment to
carry out the core functions of financial management, audit and procurement. This is considered an
appropriate mitigation measure since the financial management and auditing capacity is limited. The
14



Financial Management Agent would assist the Ministry of Finance to maintain the accounts for all
government expenditures including the proposed Project. To supplement this function, the accounting
departments in MPW will provide the basic inputs for project financial monitoring and reporting. The
government's budget and accounting system will be used and quarterly management reporting will be
prepared by the line ministries' accounting departments and reviewed and approved by the MOF, assisted
by the Financial Management Agent. A Special Account for the road component of the Project would be
needed and opened and maintained by a Bank acceptable to IDA, and would be operated by MOF. A
Special Account is also expected to be needed for the Civil Aviation component, since the UN specialized
agency ICAO has only been contracted to undertake some of the procurement and payments on behalf of
the Government. A Management Service Contract between MOF and ICAO has been entered into for
this purpose.
2. Staffing and Training: The Financial Management Agent will support the MOF, the line ministries
and other implementing agencies to perform the necessary financial management functions. The
accounting staff of the line ministries will need to be provided with adequate training for carrying out an
adequate accounting and financial reporting function. MOF/FM agents will coordinate the training.
3. Accounting Policies and Procedures: The Project will follow standard ATA financial management
policies and procedures, including using the ATA Chart of Accounts to record Project expenditures. The
use of these procedures will allow for adequate recording and reporting of Project expenditures
Accounts will be consolidated centrally in the MOF (supported by the Financial Management Agent) for
all implementing entities and consolidated Project financial statements will be prepared for all sources
and uses of Project funds.
4. Audit Arrangements: The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Auditor General with the
support of the Audit Agent with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project
financial statement to the Association would include a summary of funds received (showing funds
received from all sources), and a summary of expenditures shown under the main Project components/
activities and by main categories of expenditures. The format of the annual Project financial statements
will be similar to the Financi'al Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The audit of the Project accounts would also
include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy of the accounting and internal control systems; (b) the ability
to maintain adequate documentation for transactions; and (c) the eligibility of incurred expenditures for
Association financing. The annual Project financial statements audited by the Auditor General would be
submitted within 6 months of the close of AIA's fiscal year. The following audit reports will be
monitored in the Audit Reports Compliance System (ARCS):
Responsible Agency                     Audit                  Auditors
MOF using Chartered Accountants from  SOE, Project Accounts and  Auditor General
Bearing Point, formerly KPMG         Special Account
The Auditor General will audit the accounts of all the implementing entities. However, a consolidated
audit report (with consolidated financial statements) will be issued for the project.
5. Reporting and Monitoring: Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be produced showing: (i)
sources and uses of funds by disbursement category and project component; (ii) physical progress; and
(iii) status of procurement activities. These will be submitted to the Association within 45 days of the end
of the quarter. Format for these reports are being developed for the other IDA projects and this Project
will adopt the same format when available and agreed upon.

Figures in the table are rounded to the nearest 100,000.
Financing Percentage. The IDA grants approved FY 2002 for Afghanistan all had standard disbursement
percentage (SDP) of 100 percent on the grounds that data were not available for detailed calculations. It
appears that very little tax was actually collected on the ground, some levies did not go to the government,
there were complications with the number of currencies in widespread circulation and exchange rate
fluctuations, and tax policy and administration were almost non-functional.
Although there have been some improvements in the situation, and the currency reform is currently
underway, there is still insufficient data to calculate detailed SDPs for Afghanistan. The tax system is
still in flux although some recommendations for changes have been made by the IMF and others. Actual
collection of taxes on the ground remains unclear, and the Afghani currency remains subject to
fluctuations and uncertainty. Data collection to ascertain actual collection of taxes on the ground would
be problematic in view of logistical and security constraints. Based on the above the OPCVP has agreed
to a 100% SDP for Afghanistan for IDA operations until end December 2003, when the SDP for
Afghanistan will be reviewed.
Retroactive Financing. Provision has been made to reimburse ATA for payments it makes, up to SDR
8.00 million, between June 30, 2002 and Credit signing for Project expenditures.
Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA Credit would be transaction-based (replenishment,
reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with full documentation or
against statements of expenditures as appropriate.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the basis of SOEs for: (a)
goods and works under contracts not exceeding US$300,000 each; (b) maintenance works procured under
the provision of force account up to US$700,000 equivalent in aggregate; (c) consultants' services under
contracts not exceeding US$100,000 for firms; and (d) consultants' services under contracts not exceeding
US$50,000 equivalent for individuals.
Special Account. Two Special Accounts (Special Accounts A and B) will be opened and maintained in a
bank acceptable to the Association; and would be operated by MPW and MCAT in accordance with the
Association's operational policies. The Authorized Allocation of the Special Accounts would be US$7.8
million and US$1.8 million respectively which represents the estimated amount of expenditures to course
through the Special Account in a 3-month period. Given the short disbursement period and the immediate
need for funds in both special accounts, the full amount of the Authorized Allocation of the Special
Accounts will be available to MOF upon Credit effectiveness.
16



Minimum application size. Applications for replenishment to the Special Accounts will be submitted (a)
monthly, or (2) when either Special Account balance is reduced by 40 percent, whichever comes first.
For each Special Account, the minimum application size for withdrawal applications for reimbursement,
direct payment, or for applications for Special Commitments is 20 percent of the initial Authorized
Allocation of the Special Account.
Authority to withdraw Credit funds. MOF will retain the right to sign and submit withdrawal applications
to the Association.
D. Funds Flow. Funds flow under the Project will use the existing government system as much as
possible. As is the practice for government expenditure, all Project payments will be routed through the
Ministry of Finance (MOF). Treasury officials at the MOF will be the authorized persons to operate the
US$ Special Accounts of the Project at Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the Central Bank of Afghanistan;
IDA funds will be deposited into the Special Accounts. When a project payment is required to be made,
implementing agencies (line ministries/government departments) assisted by the supervision engineer will
submit a standard payment request to the MOF-Treasury. Treasury officials, after verifying the
documents and checking the availability of funds in the corresponding Special Account and budget will,
(a) for payments in Afghanis issue a check in Afghanis for encashment at DAB and (b) in case of a
payment in foreign currency instruct DAB to execute the payment. All withdrawal applications to the
IDA, including replenishment, reimbursement and direct payment applications, would be prepared and
submitted by the MOF.
Due to reasons related to security, damaged infrastructure, and a breakdown in communication between
the branches and the Kabul office of DAB, the ATA will face a challenge in effecting payments
throughout the country. Although not all the branches of DAB are currently fully functional, efforts are
being made to rehabilitate the branches so that the payment needs of the ATA throughout the country can
be met, including making arrangements for secure transport of cash notes around the country. In addition,
in the short term there could be a shortage of Afghani currency notes within the formal system. Salary
payments have recently been made in all of the 32 provinces, and the payment systems are being restarted
throughout the country. Although the ATA and DAB prefer to use the normal payment systems, in the
case that DAB cannot provi'de the payment services in all required locations, the ATA could resort to
alternative systems (e.g., Hawala) to effect payments in these locations. If the ATA chooses to use such
an alternative system for the flow of funds on IDA-financed activities, the implementation mechanisms
and risk mitigation measures will be agreed with IDA prior to the flow of funds through the alternative
system. This mostly applies to the Secondary and Tertiary Road Component and the Winter Road
Maintenance, both of which require payments to be made outside Kabul. The risk of making the
payments in various locations, the risks of shortage of Afghanis and inability to produce bank statements
in time have been addressed through the engagement of the Financial Management Agent.
E. Supervision Plan. From a financial management perspective and based on risks, the Project will
need close supervision by an FM Specialist. The focus of the FM Specialist during supervision will be on
financial reporting, funds flow, special accounts, counterpart capacity and FM Agent activities and
performance, and internal controls and audit arrangements for the Project.

Safeguard Framework
5. Environmental:                 Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
Steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including consultation and
disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
Highways. An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the initial emergency road
investment was elaborated and agreed with the Government during appraisal (Annex 11). Three
engineers from the MPW, including one female engineer, participated in the field review process and
public consultations. This provides the genesis of the MPW Focal Point, who will follow up on the
ESMP and Safeguard requirements for the Project.
Civil Aviation. A review of environmental and safety issues at the Kabul Airport was conducted in July
2002. The review was carried out with the assistance of the Managing Director of the Kabul Airport and
the ICAO Coordinator. An environmental and safety audit was carried out of the Kabul International
Airport, in collaboration with airport authorities and the ICAO representative (Annex 12).
20



Secondary and Tertiary Roads. Since the location of these investments will be determined during the first
6 months of implementation, the Project will adopt the ESMP framework for the main road investments,
and if necesary, adapt the Social and Environmental Safeguard Framework already developed for the
Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project to the needs of this component.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
Highways. Issues of concern identified during the preparation of the ESMP will involve standard
measures that can easily be addressed during project design and implementation:
*      Safety control measures to limit the risk of accidents, including clearance of land mines and
unexploded ordnance (see Section F.3 and Annex 14);
*      Traffic diversion and traffic control measures during tunnel works;
*      Possible shifting of moveable stalls in Malakhan and Jabal os Saraj;
*      Measures to prevent irrigation canals from overflowing onito the road, particularly between
Khenjan and Doshi;
*      Routine measures to avoid any interference with graveyards located along the roadway; and
*      Measures to ensure hiring of local labor by the contractor.
The ESMP includes specific measures to mitigate potential construction and operation period impacts,
with a particular section on land mine clearance and unexploded ordnance (Annex 14). Key activities of
the ESMP include: contract requirements for proper management of construction waste, control measures
f6r waste fuel oil and lubricants, reduction of noise and dust levels, and rehabilitation of areas used for
bypass roads and construction materials. Construction contracts will include specific environmental
provisions and contractors preparing bids will receive a briefing concerning requirements during the site
visit. Provisions have been included for "chance find" procedures for buried or unrecorded archeological
and historical sites. The plan includes measures to institutionalize implementation and monitoring of the
ESMP in MPW.
Kabul Airport. The audit of ithe Kabul Airport revealed no serious environmental and social concerns
directly regarding proposed IDA-financed equipment and runway repairs (Annex 12) . The airport
management is cognizant of social issues and runs a day care center for employees. The fire-fighting
equipment will be housed in an existing structure currently occupied by the Turkish army, but who will
leave in six months. General safety and sanitation concerns noted during the audit include: land mine
clearance, storage of fuel, unauthorized access to the runway, solid waste disposal and water and sewage
facilities. These are matters presently being dealt with by joint management with the military and the
ISAF forces, and will be reviewed again prior to delivery and installation of project-financed equipment.
Secondary and Tertiary Roads. Annex 13 contains a draft framework for the ESMP process for the
tertiary roads to be identified, which builds on the existing Framework Agreement for the EIRP and the
ESMP carried out for the Highway Component. This will include the screening of potential investments
for safeguard issues, public consultations, mine clearance and the establishment of short environmental
and social management plans for each subproject. The ESMP for the secondary roads will be prepared
based on the ESMP carried out for the Kabul-Doshi road. The screening and ESMP process will be
carried out and documented by the Environmental and Social Safeguard Focal Point, which was initiated
during the ESMP for the Highway Component.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: September 2002
The Project has been placed in environmental screening category B consistent with the provisions of
Operational Policy 4.01 of the World Bank/IDA. The environmental category is justified, since civil
works will be limited to improvements of an existing and well-established road, with wide existing rights
21



of way, and where there will be no resettlement or land acquisition, with the possible exception of the
relocation of several moveable stalls. The public consultations confirmed that there are no protected areas
or historical sites that would be affected by the road project.
The ESMP is being translated into Dari, the main language in the project area and will be disclosed to the
public in Kabul at MPW office and in the cities where consultations were conducted together with the
detailed design documents. It was also agreed that the ESMP would be made public on the World Bank
website and made available at the Infoshop. The document was sent to the Infoshop in September 2002.
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
Public consultations were held at the towns of Khenjan (July 10, 2002), Kunduz (July 11, 2002) and
Jabal os Saraj (July 14, 2002). In Jabal os Saraj, a separate women's consultation was also conducted.
These consultations confirmed that the proposed initial investment is a high priority for men and women.
The communities are keen to begin the Project and stated their willingness to assist the MPW, design
team and contractor in project implementation. Also discussed and agreed were community-based
arrangements for compensation in the event of shifting of moveable stalls. A record of these
consultations is appended to the ESMP.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
ESMP assigns specific actions to MPW and the Resident Engineer (RE) to monitor the impact of the
project on the environment during the construction and maintenance phases. A program for monitoring
safety during the operational phase will be developed and agreed early during the construction period.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The preparation process revealed the following key social issues:
De-mining operations. There is a risk that de-mining operations to be done prior to construction will not
be fully effective, posing a safety risk to the contractor workers and residents. The Project will institute a
specific policy for dealing with land mines and unexploded ordnance (Annex 14).
Health and safety hazards of workers during construction period and at the Salang Tunnel and snow
galleries. Particular safety risks are posed by potentially poor ventilation in the tunnel and traffic
diversions during the continuous work periods. Other safety risks of workers and local residents need to
be considered, in respect of, among others, the added risk of health hazards in and around the construction
camps due to poor sanitation and increased social interaction. Contract conditions will hold the contractor
responsible for developing and implementing a safety plan.
Local interference with traffic diversions. Past experience with emergency tunnel cleanup has been that
local commanders have hampered traffic diversions in the tunnel. The Resident Engineer (RE) and
contractor will be responsible for securing prior agreements with communities on traffic diversions
throughout the construction period. This problem was discussed at the local consultations, and the
communities reaffirmed their willingness to work out appropriate solutions (see community facilitation
below).
Road safety and travel patterns through populated areas. For those roads passing through populated
areas, the construction of an embankment for the road could disrupt regular patterns or introduce safety
22



concerns for activities such as water fetching by women and children. In these cases, local consultations
with women should identify such concerns and design measures, such as community road safety actions,
marked pedestrian crossings and speed reduction measures will be introduced.
Land ownership and land acquisition. Road improvements will occur on existing right-of-way only,
which is generally sufficiently wide. Through populated areas, the road may narrow slightly, so as to
avoid building destruction or taking of agricultural land. There is a small chance that rminor land
acquisition and movement of existing sheds may be necessary at Malakhan to adjust to hydrological
requirements. Currently the shops on the riverside are exposed to erosion from the river. At Jabal os
Saraj, a number of moveable sheds (on wheels) that have located on the abandoned approach to the bridge
may have to relocate when the bridge is repaired. The permanent shops will not have to be moved. No
land acquisition is foreseen in the city of Kunduz, since the existing road width is very wide.
Local Employment. Employment benefits are expected from the road improvement works. Mechanisms
to ensure that local populations are the beneficiaries will to be defined as much as possible and realistic,
within the social and ethnic context of each road section.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
Community facilitation and participation. Based on the consultation, the communities will nominate one
or more contact persons, with whom the MPW, Design Engineer, Resident Engineer and contractor will
interact with on social and cultural matters. The Design Engineer will include, where appropriate, a
specific plan for local consultations and negotiations during construction to ensure consensus among
residents living along the roads in the organization and achievement of the road improvement, and on
measures of concern. These will include, but not be limited to, the following issues identified so far:
- Identification and clearance of mined areas and unexploded ordnance
- Safety control measures to limit the risk of accidents
- Traffic diversion and traffic control measures during tunnel works
- Possible shifting of movable stalls in Malakhan and Jabal os Saraf
- Measures to prevent irrigation canals from overflowing onto the road
- Measures to avoid any interference with graveyards located along the roadway
- Archeological chance find procedures
- Confer with farmers on appropriate measures for water control, such that they do no harm to, or
enhance, existing production systems.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
See above.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The Transport Sector Review is providing the framework needed to propose institutional rearrangements
needed in the sector, and this will also address social issues and outcomes.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
Annex 1 has the detailed performance indicators for all types of outcome.
7. Safeguard Policies:
7.1 Are any of the following safeguard policies triggered by the project?

Kabul-Doshi and Pol-e Khomri-KunduzShirkhan Roads
A.     Background
1.     The Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) has requested assistance from the International
Development Association (IDA) to finance emergency road repairs of the national road from Kabul to the
Salang Pass and to Dowshi. The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) will be responsible for the works to
be carried out by an international contractor selected through International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
procedures, in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.
2.     The works to be carried out include emergency repairs on some 170 kim of roads consisting of
reconstruction of damaged road sections, maintenance and rehabilitation of deteriorated road pavement,
reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged bridges, repair and maintenance of other drainage structures
as well as retaining walls and shoulders. The design work does not include repairs to the Salang tunnel
and snow galleries, which is a subject of a separate ongoing study. The design stage is estimated to last 8
weeks, and the construction period is estimated to be eighteen months.
3.     The following are the main objectives of the Consultant Service:
(i)    determine extent of emergency repairs needed ancl prepare any designs adequate to
determine quantities, cost estimates and describe the works;
(ii)   prepare procedures and documents for pre-qualification of international contractors;
(iii)  prepare bid documents for tendering of the works, provide all services during tendering
and contract award, and
(iv)   carry out construction supervision of the project road during implementation.
4.     The emergency nature of this assignment requires the short-listed firms to respond quickly as a
matter of urgency in preparing proposals for providing the services, as well as to mobilize the teams to
carry out the services. All of the works are located on existing alignments and within existing right-of-
way.
5.     The World Bank will finance the design and pre-tendering support under a separate contract using
the World Bank adrninistered Post Conflict Fund. The construction supervision services will be financed
under a proposed IDA credit for the transport sector in Afghanistan and negotiated upon satisfactory
implementation of the design works and pre-tendering support.

reconstruction of damaged road sections, rehabilitation of about 13 (?) short span bridges where mainly
the bridge decks have been damaged and need replacement, base course repairs and asphalt overlays,
placement of surface treatment where appropriate, restoration of retaining walls, repair of minor drainage
structures, shoulder and slope stabilization works and pothole repairs. The highway is crossing the
Salang Pass (3,400 m) where there are about 4 km of snow galleries and a 2.8 km long tunnel. (The
repair works for the tunnel and galleries and design and bidding documents for these works and supply
and retrofitting of ventilation and lighting are to be carried out under a separate contract not part of this
assignment). Improvement works such as widening of the road wiclths and realignments are not foreseen.
7.     This part of the assignment is to prepare designs/preliminary designs of the necessary
rehabilitation work sufficient to enable tender documents for the works to be completed by the consultant.
This would include preparation of a pre-qualification document, advertisement of the invitation to pre-
qualify and all work associated with the review and evaluation of responses from contractors and
recommendations in this respect. Provided the design services are carried out to the AIA and MPW's
satisfaction, the consultant will be offered to carry out construction supervision services according to the
terms of the consultant's proposal as negotiated at the award of the design services.
8.     The anticipated scope of work shall include, but not necessarily be limited, to the following:

PART C: RURAL ROADS
PREPARATION, PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION
BACKGROUND
The development objective of the proposed Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project (ETRP) is to
facilitate the country's economic and social recovery through improved physical access to goods,
markets, and administrative and social services.
The development objective will be achieved by: (i) removing key transport bottlenecks (collapsed
bridges, disintegrated pavements, damaged tunnels, unsafe air traffic operation) that seriously hamper
recovery; (ii) providing equipment and technical assistance related to planning, maintenance and
supervision of works, thereby building capacity in management, implementation and subsequent
maintenance; and (iii) assisting in the establishment of an institutional and policy framework for the
sector for sustainable service delivery in the transport sector.
The project has four parts:
Part A: Highways includes the rehabilitation of two key road sections, the Kabul-Salang-Doshi Road
and the Pol-e-Khomri-Kunduz Road of the Kabul - Kunduz - Shirkhan corridor, which is the main artery
between the capital and the Northem Region, and intemational link to neighboring Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan. In addition to linking the capital to the north, rehabilitation of the Pol-e-Khomri - Kunduz
section will also ensure a dependable link between Kunduz and the border town of Shirkhan, as well as
the to Mazar-e-Sharif. The project roads are part of the Afghan Ring Road System, which draws together
all the major regions.
Part C: Civil Aviation will provide communications and air traffic control equipment identified by
ICAO as necessary for the Kabul Airport to function to international standard. Whilst local air traffic
controllers are being trained, the project will finance temporary manning of the air traffic control
functions for six months.
Part C: Rural Roads will finance the rehabilitation of selected secondary and tertiary roads serving rural
populations near the roads being rehabilitated and linking them to the major network, using labor-based
methods where appropriate. The methodology for the screening and selecting of the roads will be carried
out through a participatory process, and will serve as a pilot approach for screening and selecting rural
road improvements in the future. Implementation support will consist of short term technical assistance
and training for developing a methodology for subproject screening, selection and project
implementation.
Part D: Institutional, Policy And Other Studies, which will lay the foundation for sustainable
management of the transport sector. It will include a Transport Sector Review (TSR) to develop
Institutional and Policy Framework for the Sector, and pre-feasibility studies for potential future
investments. Procurement of consulting services for The TSR will be financed by the Swedish
International Development Agency (Sida), and procurement for consulting services is underway.
OBJECTIVES
35



The objective of this assignment is to assist the Govemment to prepare, plan and implement Part C: Rural
Roads of the ETRP, in conformance with IDA and Government regulations. In doing so, the Consultant
will: (a) establish a methodology and basic data sets to be used for screening and selecting future rural
road improvements; (b) prepare designs and bidding documents; (c) support bidding and contract award;
and (d) oversee supervision of works for an initial set of roads. A corollary objective is to train
Government counterparts and other stakeholders in all aspects of project development and management,
with an emphasis on labor-based technologies and employment generation.
TASKS
The Consultant will work closely with the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) to carry out the following
tasks.
Task 1: Identification of ETRP Rural Roads Program
The Consultant will work with the Government and local authorities to identify and select roads to be
improved under the Rural Roads Component. Roads will be screened according the following criteria:
*  Contiguous to northern corridor road being improved under Part A, or contiguous to an
improved road leading to the northern corridor road.
*  Improvements along existing alignment only, with minirmal land acquisition and little or no
resettlement.
*  Preliminary information on existence of mines and unexploded ordinance (UXO)
*  Synergy with other road improvement programs, such as USAID.
*  Identified as a priority improvement by local authorities and tribal leaders.
*  Traffic levels that yield an economic rate of return of at least 12%.
The Consultant will work with the MPW and local authorities to collect and analyze the relevant data,
which will permit: (a) the initial identification and screening of emergency rural road improvements; (b)
preliminary assessment of improvement costs; (c) collection of traffic data and calculation of economic
rate of return; and (d) environmental and social screening and initial local consultations.
The Consultant will develop with MPW a transparent screening and prioritization methodology to
identify the highest priority emergency improvements for Part C financing, based on the above criteria,
and within the existing budget constraint.
In assessing the improvement costs, the Consultant will consider the feasibility and cost of various
technical approaches for achieving the minimum service level of bituminous surface treatment, and
recommnend cost-effective methods for rural road rehabilitation, with an emphasis on maximizing local
employment utilizing labor-intensive techniques.
The Consultant will also gather information on the capacity of local contractors and NGOs to carry out
the proposed works, as well as the MPW to supervise the works.
Based on the above analysis, the Consultant will assist the Govermment to propose to IDA a program for
Part C Rural Road emergency improvements. This program will include, but not be limited to:
*  Summary of methodology and results of screening and selection of improvements
*  Analysis and proposed technical approach to rural road improvements
*  Approach, organization and estimated timetable for completion of bidding process,
implementation of improvements and environmental and social safeguard compliance, including
mine and UXO clearance.
36



*  Immnediate needs for personnel and training of MPW personnel.
* Estimated program cost and budget
All Part C Rural Road improvements should be identified and approved by IDA within two months of
mobilization.
Task 2: Detailed Program Preparation
Upon approval of the proposed program, the Consultant will work with the Government to prepare
detailed designs, bidding documents and other preparation activities. These will include, but not be
limited to:
*  Preparation of bidding documents for local competitive bidding (LCB). It is anticipated that
these works will be carried out by qualified local contractors and/or NGOs, in conformance with
the Environmental and Social Management Plan to be developed by the Consultant (see below).
*  Establishing and implementing a procedure for managing the bidding process, in accordance with
IDA regulations, including: (a) issuing the bids, including conducting an informational workshop
for potential bidders; (b) evaluating the bids; and (c) contract negotiations & award.
*  Establishing and implementing an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and
Social Framework Agreements (SFA), including a program for mine and UTXO clearance, for
each road to be improved, in conformance with World Bank Safeguard Policies (see Appendices
1 and 2).
*  Establishing an organization, staffing, budget and schedule for program implementation and sub-
project supervision.
*  Carrying out on-the-job training in all aspects of program preparation.
The Contractor will work out a phased timetable such that an initial set of rural road contracts can be
awarded and work begun within six months of mobilization, with the remaining contracts following in
sequence.
Task 3: Program Implementation
The Consultant will perform intensive on-the-job training for MPW personnel in the supervision of the
initial road improvement contracts. This will include, but not be limited to:
*  Resident Engineer services, including inspection and certification of works; request for IDA
disbursements; payments to contractors; and reception of finished works.
*  Monitoring of environmental and social aspects, including mine and UXO clearance, as defined
in the ESMP
* Completion of monthly progress reports and sub-project completion reports.
* On-the-job training in all aspects of program implementation.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR RURAL ROADS
APPROACH
The ESMP process for rural roads will involve a series of steps to ensure that all subprojects are screened
to ensure conformance with safeguard policies and planned and carried out in a participatory manner. In
addition to a concise ESMP, each subproject will also prepare a Social Framework Agreement (SFA),
which stipulate roles and responsibilities among the communities, MPW and contractors during the
construction, as well as maintenance arrangements during the operations phase. The following table
summarizes the proposed stages.
-Phase .                   A                  .         Responsibility

ESMP = Environmental and Social Management Plan
SFA = Social Framnework Agreement
RE = Resident Engineer
MPW = Ministry of Public Works
The ESMP and SFA will be translated into the local language and provide a monitoring tool for the
community and MPW.
IMPLEMENTATION
A consultant will be recruited to work with the MPW in establishing the above process. The consultant
will work in close coordination with the Environmental and Social Management Focal Point in the
Ministry of Public Works (MPW). His/her scope of work will include two major objectives:
*  Assist the Government to establish a process for meeting the World Bank's requirement for
environmental and social safeguard management in the planning and implementation of the Rural
39



Roads Component of the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation P'roject. This will include: (i)
developing standard methods and procedures for assessing environmental and social concerns as an
input to the sub- project screening, program planning and implementation process; (ii) developing
standard approaches and procedures for appropriate sub-project mitigation and monitoring measures;
and (iii) developing subproject Environmental and Social Framework Agreements, in which all
parties agree on safeguard principles and roles and responsibilities for implementing the agreed
measures specified in the ESMP for environmental and social management, as well as sustainable
maintenance of the improved assets.
* Provide on-the-job training to Afghan counterparts and other stakeholders in the preparation and
implementation of the ESMPs and SFAs, as well as the mainstreaming of environmental and social
management approaches.

ANNEX
TERMS OF REFERENCE
For
TRANSPORT SECTOR REVIEW
Background
1.     More than two decade of conflict and three years of drought have led to widespread human
suffering and massive displacement of people in Afghanistan (AFG). The prolonged state of conflict has
also resulted in large-scale deterioration of the transport infrastructure, depletion of skilled manpower and
weakening of the capacity for managing the transport sector, including its public institutions. The
Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is currently responsible for operations and maintenance of the national
roads, in addition to housing, water supply and city planning. It is also involved in the maintenance of
airport pavements and the management of several state-owned construction units for housing, roads and
airports. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) manages the government-owned vehicle fleet and regulates
the private sector transport industry, including international transport operations. The Ministry of Civil
Aviation and Tourism (MCAT) is responsible for the management of the national airline (Ariana Afghan
Airline), airports and the air navigation system, as well as a number of hotels.
2:.    The Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) was established as a consequence of the political
process in Bonn, Germany, and took power on 22 December 2001. The AIA has been tasked with
preparing the way to convene an emergency loya girga within 6 months. The loya girga will lead to the
establishment of a transitional administration (ATA) and then to the holding of elections within a period
of 2 years.
3.     The AIA has requested assistance from the Swedish International Development Cooperation
Agency (Sida) to finance a;review of the transport sector in AFG. The Transport Sector Review (TSR)
was proposed by a Joint World Bank/ADB mission in March 2002 (see Aide Memoire: Afghanistan
Transport Sector; Joint Donor Mission, 13 March 2002) to initiate a process towards strengthening transport
sector management in order to improve efficiency, improve rural accessibility, address isolation of
communities, upgrade inter-urban and urban transport infrastructure and services, and facilitate trade,
returning refugees and humanitarian aid.
4.     The TSR is intended to prepare an overall vision and development strategy for the sector
(covering aviation, roads, road transport and road traffic), consistent with the overall policies and
development framework of the AIA/ATA. The study will examine transport from a national perspective.
Priorities will be formulated for each transport sub-sector, in an integrated manner using a multi-sectoral
framework consistent with how ALAJATA is addressing development strategies in other sectors. Policies
will be formulated both for the domestic transport scene as well as international transport operations. The
TSR is to form the basis upon which AIA/ATA will revise transport policies, restructure and integrate
sector institutions, and formulate projects for development of the transport sector in the short to medium
term.
5.     The development strategy will include a five-year program of prioritized actions and investments
critical for development of the transport sector in AFG. Investments will comprise both capital and
technical assistance projects for institution-building purposes. The five-year transport development
strategy, as well as estimates of project costs, where applicable, will be prepared in order that funding
targets may be set and a financing plan can be prepared.
45



6.     In order to assist with the implementation of the TSR, ALAVATA requires professional consulting
services, and therefore wishes to recruit an experienced consulting firm (the Consultant). Sida will be
responsible for the recruitment of the Consultant. The AIA/ATA will be responsible for executing the
TSR, and will for this purpose set up a Steering Committee to provide guidance to the Consultant.
Obiectives
7.     The overall objective of the TSR is to stimulate economic growth, reduce poverty and facilitate
return and integration of displaced people in rural and urban communities. Specific TSR study objectives
include: (1) prepare sectoral policies; (2) recommend institutional restructuring consistent with AIA/ATA
overall policies; (3) review service delivery and role of force account and public corporations in transport;
(4) propose a prioritised plan of action for the next five years; (5) provide information, necessary for
decision-making regarding identification and estimation of costs for priority development projects; (6)
develop priority investment project proposals; and (7) prepare technical assistance proposal(s) for
implementation of the sector strategy and institutional strengthening of concerned authorities.
Phasing of the Scope of Work
8.     The scope of work will be undertaken in two distinct phases. Phase 1 -- the policy formulation
stage -- will cover task A under the Scope of Work, whilst Phase 2 will cover the strategy including
actions and projects, i.e. tasks B to F. The details of tasks B to F are tentative at this stage and will be
confirmed at the end of Phase 1.
9.     The purpose of Phase 1 is to formulate an (indicative) transport policy for AFG. It will identify
essential dimensions of the sectoral policy, such as policies in respect of international transport
operations, the role of the private sector, the role of the public sector, and the institutional arrangements in
the public sector, including the role of the central government vis-a-vis local governments in this regard.
The first phase will result in a policy document, which will also include an outline action plan setting out
key actions (e.g. legal actions) and a timetable to give effect to the policies. A first draft of this document
will initially be presented at a workshop involving policy makers. senior staff of the concerned ministries
and authorities, private sector/stakeholder group representatives, and other agencies. A second version --
taking into account the outcome of the seminar -- will be reviewed by designated representatives of the
AIA/ATA. Once the policy document has been accepted by the designated representatives of AIA/ATA,
the scope of work under tasks B to F will be reviewed and finally decided on by the steering committee.
10.   ' The purpose of Phase 2 is twofold. Firstly to prepare the strategy for achieving the identified
transport policy, comprising a detailed action plan, an identification of responsibilities and methods of
implementation. Where appropriate and relevant, the proposed strategies will be translated into high-
priority institution-building and capital investment programmes, including where relevant and applicable,
budgets for operations (infrastructure, public institutions and ministries).
Scope of Work
11.    The Scope of Work consists of six main tasks including a number of sub-tasks. As mentioned, the
details of tasks B to F are still to be confirmed. Where not specifically mentioned and where relevant, it is
expected that a number of cross-cutting themes will be addressed, including:
the role of the private sector
46



-      governance  i.e. aspects related  to  accountability  for performance  with  respect to
project/programme implementation as well as the operations of public agencies
-      *gender, including with respect to access and isolation
-      poverty, i.e. how specific actions and projects to will contribute to alleviation of poverty. Efforts
shall be made to identify specific interventions such as rural access improvement programmes to address
poverty in rural areas.
A.     National Sectoral Policy and Key Institutional Reforms
12.    This task focuses on transport in general and by sub-sector. It will address the existing legal
framework, institutional and managerial arrangements, (sub-) sectoral policies, financing and cost
recovery, regulatory framework and organization of co-ordination and monitoring.
A.1    Review of the current legal framework: This review will include an identification of the laws
and regulations of relevance to the transport sector. It will contain an analysis of this legislation,
from the point of view of its policy and institutional implications as well as of how operational it
is. The review will also cover multilateral and bilateral agreements of relevance to the transport
sector, including an analysis of which international conventions of significance to transport
operations to which AFG has acceded, and any shortcomings in this regard.
A,2    Overview of the transport sector institutions: This sub-task will furnish an overview of
transport sector authorities, including but not necessarily confined to, their roles, functions,
responsibilities, and institutional weaknesses and strengths. The purpose is to address the
issues/concerns and provide a framework for improved functioning of the sector and sub-sectors.
Attention will be given to institutional capacity to undertake transport sector planning, needs
assessments, prioritisation, budgeting and formulation of improvement projects.
A.3    Transport sector policy issues: The focus of this sub-task is to identify the key transport policy
issues facing AFG. In addition to reviewing the policy papers and statements made by the
Government/local authorities, consultations will be held with the concerned national and local
authorities. The objective is to assist the authorities in formulating a transport policy in the
national context.
A.4    Sector financing and cost recovery: This sub-task will identify the current commitments and
availability of resources (by source) for implementation of on-going and proposed activities for
improvement of the transport sector, including performance efficiency of the institutions,
provision for operations and maintenance, etc. Income/funding sources will be analysed
separately. Appropriate mix of sources, funding types -- including public-private partnerships in
transport infrastructure investment, services, and operations and maintenance -- will be addressed.
A.5    Private sector participation: This sub-task will address specific policy issues concerning the
potential for increase in private sector participation in transport investments and operation. Based
on the assessment, policy options and strategies will be proposed for consideration.
B.     Ministry of Transport
13.    The government structure in transport may change as a consequence of the policy formulation
Phase. However, it is expected that the key role in the sector will be played by an organisation responsible
for transport.
47



B.1    Review of the Ministry of Transport: This will entail a more detailed review of the set-up of
the Ministry of Transport than the one undertaken as part of sub-task A.2, including organisation,
staffing, operational procedures.
B.2    Proposals for reform: Taking into account the outcome of the policy formulation phase,
necessary reforms shall be identified, and a strategy shall be formulated for how to effect these
reforms.
B.3    Action plan: The strategy will be translated into a rnore detailed action plan, setting out
timetables, responsibilities and mechanisms. The action plan will consider both what is necessary
to continue performing ministerial functions and to implement reforms. An outline of any (legal)
changes deemed necessary to effect reforms will be prepared by the Consultant.
B.4    Support projects: A strategy may involve support activities to be financed by donors. Such
support activities, to achieve the envisaged reforms, shall be packaged into projects in a format
appropriate for consideration by donors. Outline TOR will be drafted by the Consultant, where
relevant.
B.5    Budgets and costs: If relevant, a five-year budget shall be prepared for related operation as well
as a financing plan, identifying separately local and expected foreign financing.
C;     Civil Aviation
14.    The arrangements for the operations of civil aviation will likely be changed as a consequence of
the policy formulation phase. This task will focus on the future institutions for managing and developing
major airports and the air navigation system of the country as well as the institution to be responsible for
the regulation of aviation safety and security.
C.1    Review of past and present institutional arrangements: This will entail a more detailed review
of the set-up of the institutional arrangements in civil aviation, including Ariana, than the one
undertaken as part of sub-task A.2, including organisation, staffing, operational procedures and
funding.
C.2    Proposals for reform: Taking into account the outcome of the policy formulation stage,
necessary reforms of the civil aviation sector shall be identified, and a strategy shall be
formulated for how to effect these reforms.
C.3    Action plan: The strategy will be translated into a more detailed action plan, setting out
timetables, responsibilities and mechanisms. The action plan will consider both what is necessary
to continue performing functions in the civil aviation sector under current arrangements and to
implement reforms. An outline of any legal changes deemed necessary to effect reforms will be
prepared by the Consultant.
C.4    Support projects: A strategy will involve support activities to be financed by donors. Such
support activities shall be packaged into projects in a format appropriate for consideration by
donors. Outline TOR will be drafted by the Consultant, where relevant.
C.5    Operational budgets and financing: If relevant, and taking into account the proposed reform, a
five-year budget shall be prepared for the operations of the institutions in the civil aviation sector
as well as a financing plan, identifying separately local and expected foreign financing.
48



C.6    Investment plan and financing: Taking into account previous needs assessments as well as
supplementary studies, as well as any reform to be proposed, key capital investment projects for
the coming 5 years will be identified and cost estimates prepared. The projects will be formulated
in a format appropriate for consideration for donor support. Priority will be given to repairs and
investment that could facilitate speedy development of international and domestic flights.
D.     The Road Sector
15.    The key issues to be reviewed will include both how to build up capacity within a possibly new
institutional structure for road management as well as the rehabilitation and upgrading of roads. The road
sector covers all roads with the exception of urban streets and roads not part of the national and provincial
road network.
D.1    Review of past and current institutional arrangements: This will entail a more detailed review
of the set-up of the institutional arrangements in the road sector than the one undertaken as part of
sub-task A.2, including organization, staffing, operational procedures, performance and funding.
D.2    Proposals for reform: Taking into account the outcome of the policy formulation stage,
necessary reforms of the road sector shall be identified, and a strategy shall be formulated for
how to effect these reforms.
L).3   Action plan: The strategy will be translated into a more detailed action plan, setting out
timetables, responsibilities and mechanisms. The action plan will consider both what is necessary
to continue performing functions in the road sector under current arrangements and to implement
reforms. An outline of any legal changes deemed necessary to effect reforms will be prepared by
the Consultant.
D.4    Support projects: A strategy may involve support activities to be financed by donors. Such
support activities shall be packaged into projects in a format appropriate for consideration by
donors. Outline TOR, will be drafted by the Consultant, where relevant.
D.5    Operational budgets and financing: A five-year budget shall be prepared for road maintenance
and the operations of the institutions in the road sector as well as a financing plan, identifying
separately local and expected foreign financing. Strategies to ensure predictable, uninterrupted
and adequate funding for road maintenance will be developed and evaluated for consideration.
The possibility of establishing a designated "road maintenance fund", its management and
functioning will be also examined.
D.6    Investment plan and financing: Taking into account previous needs assessments as well as
supplementary studies and analyses of traffic and road network conditions, key capital investment
projects for the coming five years will be identified and cost estimates prepared. The projects will
be formulated in a format appropriate for consideration for donor support.
E.     Road Transport
16.   In AFG public transport system is mainly road based except for a small river transport operation
in the North. This task will focus on operational aspects of the transport services management and
delivery systems.
E.1    Overview of public transport: The purpose of this sub-task is to provide a general overview of
the current public transport service operations system in the country. The sub-task will include
49



reviewing the transport service provisions, (actual) operations, and plans and projects of the local
authorities effecting the sector.
E.2    Transport operators: This sub-task will address the functioning and efficiency of transport
operators in both public and private sectors. The legal, as well as operations and administrative
procedures governing participation of both public and private sector operators in the delivery of
transport services (quality and adequacy) will be analysed. Financial and fiscal issues, subsidies,
loans, taxes, duties, tariff setting, etc. will be reviewed. Recommendations will be offered to
improve quality, efficiency, and adequacy of services by the operators.
E.3    Taxi service industry: This sub-task will address the taxi service industry separately given that
the industry plays a major role in meeting the increasing demand for public transport. Regulations
pertaining to taxis and their operation will be addressed, taking into account quality, adequacy,
reliability, and affordability by the commuters. The optimal role of this industry will be defined,
and recommendations will be suggested to achieve this objective.
E.4    Transport authority: This sub-task will examine current functioning (and, practices) of the
transport sector regulatory authorities, and evaluate their effectiveness in carrying out their day-
to-day responsibilities. Shortcomings in fulfilling the role and functions will be addressed. Taking
into account the outcome of the Phase 1 of the TSR, specific recommendations will be made
concerning changes in the performance economic regulation of the road transport industry.
F.     Road Traffic
17.    Road traffic concerns such matters as safety, overload control, licensing and registration.
F.1    Review of road traffic: The Consultant is expected to make an initial review of issues related to
road traffic, identify major issues and propose strategies to improve the regulation of road traffic.
The Consultant wil! also identify the need for legal change and prepare an outline of proposed
legal changes.
F.2    Support projects: The proposed strategies may involve support activities to be financed by
donors. Such support activities shall be packaged into projects consistent with envisaged reform
and in a format appropriate for consideration by donors. Outline TOR will be drafted by the
Consultant, where relevant.
F.3    Budgets and costs: If relevant, a three-year budget shall be prepared for the operations of
organisations involved in the regulation of road traffic as well as a financing plan, identifying
separately local and expected foreign financing
Deliverables
18.    The deliverables with respect to Task A will comprise (i) an analysis report comprising the
overall findings and analysis with respect to sub-tasks A.1 - A.5; and (i) the policy document, with and
(outline) action plan (see para. 9)
19.    A final draft and a final report will be prepared for each one of the Tasks B-E, and as each task is
completed (see further below). The Consultant will also at the end of the assignment assemble all the
documentation prepared under the TSR in one Review Report, with a covering memorandum as guidance
to the reader.
50



20.    During the second phase, the Consultant is expected to prepare interim reports to be decided on
by the Steering Committee in consultation with the Consultant. The purpose of these reports is to speed
up the processing of the reports and the acceptance of their proposals.
Consulting Team
21.    The Consultant is expected to field a high-caliber team with considerable experience in policy
formulation, development and implementation as well as in-depth understanding of institutional change in
the public sector including privatization, and public administration management issues. The first phase
will involve two experts for in total about 5 (effective) man-months of foreign consultants.
22.    All work will be executed at the highest possible speed. It is expected that the Consultant will
draw on his experience when formulating action plans and projects, thereby obviating the need for
detailed data collection. The total input of foreign consulting time during the second phase is therefore
expected not to exceed 20 (effective) man-months. The expertise required during the second phase will be
identified by the Consultant.
23.    The Consultant will be assisted whilst working in AFG by three local consultants -- fluent in
English -- one lawyer, one economist and one civil engineer. The local consultants will be identified by
the Steering Committee, but will become members of the Consultant's team. They will be funded under
the contract. The Consultant will also have to budget for all costs whilst in the field.

ANNEX
CLEARANCE OF MINES AND UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Afghanistan remains one of the countries most severely affected by mines and unexploded Ordnance
(UXO) in the world, and their existence can pose a threat to safe project implementation. Mine and UXO
clearance activities are coordinated by the UN Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (UNMACA). In
2001, there were five UN Regional Mine Action Centers (RMACs) and 15 implementing partners
(NGOs). In the absence of an indigenous national coordinating body, UNMACA plans, manages and
oversees all mine action activities for Afghanistan, as well as providing technical support and ensuring the
proper integration of mine action into the wider humanitarian assistance program to the country.
The purpose of this Annex is to set out a strategy for Clearance of Mines and Unexploded Ordnance in
respect of the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project.
DEFINITIONS
"Mine" means any type of land mines (anti-personnel and anti-tank) or "booby traps."
"VXO" means any type of unexploded ordnance.
"Extended Site" means the places where movement will, or may, be caused by execution of the works; it
includes the Site, all places to be used by the contractor (including safe working zones, campsites, access
roads and quarries/borrow pits); as well as resettlement areas and temporary bypasses for regular traffic
where necessary
"Risk area" means an area known or thought to be possibly contamninated with Mines and UXO.
"Mine/UXO Check" means verification of the absence of Mine and UXO in a Risk Area, or detection and
neutralization of all mines and UXO present in the area, if any.
PROJECT SITUATION
Northern Corridor
The Extended Site is one that can be considered a Risk Area. Mine clearance activities are currently
underway along the road corridor, implemented through Halo Trust.
52



Photo No. I - km 117.1 Minefield marked by painted stones left and right of pavement edge.
Prior to undertaking the field survey, an initial field visit was made with two officers from Halo Trust to
determine the exact location of all minefields and unexploded ordnance within the road corridor. All the
known minefields and battle areas have been marked in the field by painted stones and marks on
buildings. These locations, which are also recorded on Halo Trust's and UNMACA's maps, were
identified by the Halo Trust officers as far as Salang Tunnel and marked as Waypoints on the base maps
prepared by the Mission. North of Salang Tunnel, the data was still being compiled by Halo Trust and
was not available to the Mission at the time of the field visit.
Kabul International Airport
The Extended Site is one that can be considered a Risk Area. Clearance of mines is the single most
important safety issue facing the airport. In July 2002, there were still significant mines and unexploded
ordnance along the perimeter and around old equipment and wrecks. At issue is the fact that part of the
airport is still considered a military base, and the military has been reluctant to remove the mines, viewing
them as a form of protection. As of August 11, 2002, MACA confirmed that they have again begun mine
clearing activities at the Kabul Airport.; they have three active teams on the task. The Danish team
maintains radio contact with the tower and the teams report their planned activities daily to the tower. It is
estimated that the work will take 1.5 to 2 years to complete. The clearance rate is approximately 250,000
to 300,000 square meters every 1.5 to 2 weeks (longer in areas with dense vegetation). Clearing of
subsurface mines in the UNJLC hangar storage area at the airport was completed by MACA.
53



Rural Roads
Since these investments are not yet identified, it is not yet possible to appraise the situation of the Site or
Extended Site .
STANDARDS AND METHODS
Mine and UXO clearance shall be carried out in accordance with internationally recognized procedures
and methods for such works. All such works will be carried out in coordination with ongoing land mine
clearance activities by UNMAC and any other organization carrying out such activities in the Extended
Site.
Mine-related activities typically include three types of activities:
-Level 1 survey (or general survey), which is conducted through interviews of communities and
health workers, with a view to identify those areas where the presence of mines is suspected
or confirmed.
-Level 2 survey (or detailed survey), typically conducted with specially trained dogs to determine
the exact perimeter of a mined area.
-Clearance, either manual or with dogs, to remove mines and UXO.
Mines should be removed or destroyed to a depth to which they can be detected. Generally this would not
be less than 200 mm.
A record must be kept of all mines and munitions cleared, stating location and type when known, and
reported monthly during the clearance period.
54



PROCUREMENT STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING MINE AND UXO CLEARANCE IN ETRP
Solution 1 (Salang Tunnel and Adjacent Snow Galleries): Contractor is fully responsible and
reimbursed for the cost of mine and UXO clearance; cost determined on a non-competitive basis.
Approach: Under this solution, the contractor is rendered fully responsible for ensuring that the Extended
Site is clear of mines and UXO. He is reimbursed for the cost of engaging an internationally qualified
service or individuals for this purpose. He is liable for any accidents or loss of life as a result of
undetected mines or UXO causing injury or damage in the Extended Area and is expected to carry
insurance for this purpose. A provisional sum for this service is provided to all bidders, such that the
service is not a factor in price competition. The actual sum to be included in the contract is determined at
negotiations, when the contractor presents his assessment of real needs to meet this obligation
Advantage: The advantage of this approach is that there is no incentive for the contractor to cut mine
clearing costs in an effort to present a lower price. There is no need to apply penalties in the case of
accidents.
Risk: The risk with this approach is that it may be difficult to assess the provisional amount to put in the
bidding document, and there is no way of knowing the final cost figure until contract negotiations, which
could involve an increase in the contract amount.
Applicability: This solution works well where prior risk is fairly well known and considered to be low,
such that the provisional sum is expected to be close to the final negotiated amount. This is the situation
at the Salang Tunnel and Snow Gallery areas.
Solution 2 (Highway Rehabilitation - Kabul-Doshi, Pol-e Khoinri Roads and future major highway
rehabilitation): Contractor is fully responsible and reimbursed for the cost of mine and UXO
clearance; cost is entered by the contractors in their initial bids.
Approach: The difference between this solution and Solution 1 is that the contractors are required to
evaluate the needs for mine and UXO clearance and to enter these into the price of their bids.
Advantage: This solution has the advantage of establishing mine and UXO clearance costs prior to
award of contract. In addition, the introduction of competitive pricing for this service will hold down the
cost.
Risk: The risk is that there is an adverse incentive for the bidders to underestimate the need for mine and
UXO clearance, to the detriment of safety. To address this problem, one could introduce penalties for
mine and UXO-related accidents on the Extended Site during construction
Applicability: This solution is most applicable for large contracts, where there is a large and/or still
unknown level of risk with respect to mines and UXO in the Extended Site. Such is the case with the
highway improvements along the Kabul - Doshi and the Pol-e Khomri Roads, as well as other larger
scale highway improvements expected in the future.
Solution 3A (Rural Roads Component): Government, project entity and/or community contracts
for mine and UXO clearance; contractor maintains insurance for liability and damages.
Approach. During the project screening and part of the Environmental and Social Management Plan, the
Government would carry out level 1 survey to determine the actual risk level in the Extended Site. Prior
55



to contract award, level 2 surveys and clearance services would be contracted directly and certified. The
contractor however, still retains insurance to cover liability for accidents due to undetected mine or UXO.
There is no penalty applied in the case of an accident.
Advantage: The advantage of this approach is that it will facilitate the utilization of small contractors
who do not have the resources or capability to contract out the mine and UXO clearance services.
Risk. The risk is that this adds another activity for the Government, project entity and/or community,
who may already be strapped for resources and management capabilities. Short term consulting services
would probably have to be recruited to manage these service contracts.
Applicability: This solution would be applied in the case of relatively small works, which utilize local
contractors. It is anticipated that this will be the case with most of the rural road subprojects.
Solution 3B (Rural Roads Component: Contractor assumes responsibility for contracting mine and
UXO clearance services; price determined on a non-competitive basis.
Approach: During the project screening and part of the Environmental and Social Management Plan, the
Government would carry out level 1 survey to determine the actual risk level in the Extended Site. Based
on this, the Government would announce a provisional sum to canry out these services. As with Solution
1, the provisional sum is provided to all bidders, such that the service is not a factor in price competition.
During negotiations, an amount is agreed and the contractor is reimbursed for the cost of engaging an
internationally qualified service or individuals for this purpose. He is liable for any accidents or loss of
life as a result of undetected mines or UXO causing injury or damage in the Extended Area and is
expected to carry insurance for this purpose. No penalties would apply
Advantage: The advantage is that the responsibility for clearance is transferred to the contractor.
Risk: The risk is similar to that of Solution 1, that costs may escalate if the initial survey underestimates
the level of risk.
Applicability: This is a preferred solution where contractors have the capability to engage and manage
the clearance services, particularly if the road improvements are bid as a "package" or an extension of the
major highway improvement contracts.
Solution 4 (Airport Equipment Installation): Government or Airport Authority contracts for mine
and UXO clearance; contractor maintains insurance for liability and damages.
Approach. Prior to installation, clearance services would be contracted directly and certified by the
Government and Airport Authority. The contractor however, still retains insurance to cover liability for
accidents due to undetected mine or UXO. There is no penalty applied in the case of an accident.
Advantage: The advantage of this approach is that it will facilitate efficient delivery and installation, the
later may be carried out by small contractors who do not have the resources or capability to contract out
the mine and UXO clearance services.
Risk. The risk is that this adds another activity for the Government or Airport Authority, who may
already be strapped for resources and management capabilities. Short term consulting services may have
to be recruited to manage these service contracts.
Applicability: This would seem to be the only solution to ensure that equipment is safely delivered and
installed at the airport.
