                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the first phase (operation) of the APL is to assist the Government of St. Lucia to increase the employability of youth through private-sector driven
                         training. This objective will be pursued through three means: (i) establishment of a competitive training scheme that finances private sector-driven training and
                         traineeships, (ii) development of an improved policy framework for delivering training by enhancing OECS collaboration in training and introducing occupational
                         standards to increase quality and value of training, and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity to better implement, monitor, and plan training.
