                                   RESTRUCTING PAPER
SUMMARY

1. The major change and rationale for this proposed Level Two Project Restructuring is to
   revise the PDO indicator in order to better measure the Project’s impact on the employability
   of youth over the long term.

PROJECT STATUS

2. The Project was approved by the Board on May 8, 2007 and became effective on December
   19, 2007. It was first restructured on December 5, 2011, and it is expected to close on
   September 15, 2013. It has three components: i) Skills training for unemployed youth; ii)
   Improving the policy framework for delivering of training; and iii) Project management and
   institutional strengthening.

3. Under Component 1, the Project has been successful in enrolling a total of 945 (against an
   end-of-Project target of 870) trainees, and diversified training with 38.7 percent of the youth
   enrolled in training other than hospitality (against an end-of-Project target of 30).

4. However, Saint Lucia’s economy has been hard-hit by the financial crisis, and this has
   affected the job market and employment has been cyclical particularly in the hospitality
   sector, which has affected trainee ability to secure jobs. In addition, as employers have been
   reducing employees to adjust to a weaker market, their willingness to take on trainees for
   traineeships has weakened as well, affecting the number of completed traineeships and
   consequently the number of youth certified. As a result, about 44.6 percent of the youth are
   employed 15 months after the start of training (against an end-of-Project target of 65
   percent). Interviews with trainees and training providers indicate that those who have
   managed to secure employment before completion of training to obtain certification have in
   most cases dropped out and are the first ones to be let go when the business situation
   deteriorates.

5. Under Component 2, the Project has been successful in vetting 87 standards (against an end
   of Project target of 85) and pre-qualified 117 accredited training providers (against an end of
   Project target of 65). A labor market assessment has also been completed.

6. Under Component 3, the Government has taken steps to strengthen institutional capacity to
   implement and monitor Project implementation through the hiring of personnel and
   developing the requirements of the Management Information System (MIS).

PROPOSED CHANGES

Results Indicators

7. The PDO indicator relating to “percentage of youth enrolled in the training schemes who are
   employed fifteen months after the start of their training? has been dropped, since it is not a
                                                1
   good measure of the Project’s impact on employability of youth. This is because
   employment opportunities are driven by other factors beyond the scope of the Project,
   including the state of the economy. This indicator will continue to be monitored for
   information purposes.

8. A new PDO indicator has been added: “Number of youth certified at level 1 or above?.
   Since certification is an asset that enhances ability of a trainee to get a job and / or keep one,
   it is a much stronger long-term measure of employability. The changes to the Results
   Framework are summarized in Annex 1.

9. The intermediate indicator “Number of NVQs/CVQs issued? has been dropped since it
   measures the same thing as the new PDO indicator.

10. End of Project targets for the following intermediate indicators have been changed as follows
    to reflect current achievements:

           o Number of unemployed youth enrolled in training increased from 870 to 945.
           o Percentage of enrolled youth in training in other sectors than hospitality increased
             from 30 to 38 percent.
           o Number of pre-qualified or accredited training providers increased from 65 to
             117.
           o Number of standards vetted increased from 85 to 87.
