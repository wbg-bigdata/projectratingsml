APPRAISAL OF THIRD RAILIAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.0:1      The Government of the Republic of China has asked the Bank for
a loan of US$ 31.2 million equivalent to help finance part of the fore:Lgn
exchange costs of the Railwiay's new 1969-1972 Four Year Investment Pla2.,
which extends and completes the previous 1965-1970 Investment Plan. The
Project   is designed to increase the Railway's capacity and to modernize
its equipment; it would consist of the high priority items of the new
Investment Plan for the years 1969 and 1970, additional to those being
financed under the existing Bank loans (409- and 524-CHA). The proposed
loan would be for the procurement of additional rolling stock and motive
powqer, signalling equipment, track materials, workshops machinery and the
fin.ancing: of consulting services and training.
1.02       This Appraisal Report, is based on the findings of a Bank mis-
sion in November-December 1968, consisting of Nlessrs. Brechot, Chapman.
and Hughes, and on information provided by TRA.
1.03       The Renublic of China received on Anril 28. i965. a first loan
(409-CHA) of US.) 20 million to help finance the acquisition of diesel
lorrrnntAirPq- passenger nndr freight cars  gradel crossing and TnarshalliTng
yard equipment.  The first loan was intended to cover TRA's most urgent
irquirements dl-ing the first four-year period (1965 to 196R) of the 1.hen

2. BACKGROUND
It. Ue era'
it *  U  ^. _1tA s2 .L 
2.01       Taiwan has an area of about 3o,UUU ian , or about the same as tne
Netherlands. Development of the island has been significantly influenced
by climatic and topogranhic conditions.   Hign mountains, in the central and
eastern regions, occupy about 64!o1 of the area.  Alluvial plains in the -vest



-2-
account for another 24%. A third distinguishable region is a narrow and
high2Jy fertile valLey close to the east coast. Most of the economic andc
social development has taken place within the western coastal plain,
stretching from Keelung on the north coast to Kaohsiung in the south.
2.02      The popuLation of the island is about 13 million, or slightly
more than that of the Netherlands. From a high growth rate of 3.7p per
annurm ten years ago. the nonulation growth has slowed down to 2.3% per
annum partly as a result of birth control programs. The density of the
non3lati_on is amonoy- the hiahest in the world in terms of available arabl]e
land, with 87% of the population living in the western plain between
Keeliing andl Kaohsiung.  Agricnlture emplnon   qhnnt+ half t-he population bhut
industrial product-ion is growing rapidly.  Gross National Product wJas

which averaged 8% per annum from 1953 to 1964,increased to 8.9% in 1965-
1967, and 10% in 19'68 according to prelt-iars  figures  A hIib 4r1rtrh rate

which contains all the large cities. This axis is served principally by
the ±'aiwatn Railway Administration's (TRA) main line, by road Uransport tLntII
a small amount of coastal shipping. The main north-south highway has
reached its capacity in parts.  It is proposed to construct two sectiJons;
of an expressway, mainly in urban areas, by 1975 but transport requirements
in the densely populated corridor are likely to justify the existence of
both the expressway and the railway in the foreseeable futurc (;ara. 6.01).
The two main ports, Neelung in the north and1 hT:flsiung in rhe :cuthwast,
handle about 3 million tons and 7 million tons of traffic a year respectively.
Feeder roads and small private railways connect the main route with industriab
agricultural, mining and timber enterprises.  The eastern valley is served
principally by a 1'176 km railway paralleled by an unpaved single lane road.
Coastal shipping is relatively small but is important in connecting this
eastern region with the rest of the country as no rail link exdsts and road
connections are poor. Domestic air transport is comparatively insignificant.
2.04      The railways are the most important freight transport mode in
Taiwan, accounting for over 70% of ton-km in 1967 (Table 1).  This pro-
port:Lon has fallen from 80% in 1963, due to the increase in road transport.
The average lengilh of haul for the railways (160 km) is nearly five times
that of road, indicating that road vehicles are important for large tonnages
of short-haul traffic.  Rail freight traffic has been increasing by about
3% per annum for the last seven years compared with an increase of 14% per
anml for -truck traffic.  This is to be expected with the change in the



economy from basic industry and resource exploitation to more secondary
industry, coupled with intensified road building in the last few years.
The number of motor vehicles has increased rapidly in the last six years,
cars increasing by about 12% and taxis by 312 (Table 2). Roads are con-
gested with slow moving vehicles such as bicycles w.Yhich are a common form
of freight transport; there are six times as many motorcycles as all other
veh:icles (Table 2).
2 .0-      Railways accounted for 42?-∞ of the long distance pass-km in 1968,
but only a small share of the local movement (Table 3). Rail passenger
tra'ffic has been growing rapidly in recent years at nearly 7:, per annum..
2.06       The main West Line crossing Taipei through its center, together
with a line going north, causes very serious traffic congestion at 37 level
crolssings. _Following studies made by urban transport experts, the Execu-
tive Yuan 4/ has recently decided that the most economical solution to this
situation is to elevate the railway line across the city; the cost of this
construction has been estimated at scme US$ 33 million and the executicn of
the oroject will require four years.  Government agencies concerned are to
drawl detailed plans for the construction which does not physically inter-
fere with the present railway project but reference to it has been included
in the Terms of Reference for the proposed study on electrification (see
para. 3.09). Nlo arrangements have as yet been made for financing the eleva-
tion of' the railiway lines across the city wihich essentially aims at reliev-
ing urban road congestion and is not rquiiire hby TRA's operations. Althourgh
the works are likely to be economically justified it is not considered that
TRA should. hbe asked to partiirpat  in the financing of thons Tnrkq  e-rrpnt
to t;he extent, of any improvement to their facilities, as the main benef'i-

2.09       A CormmrIttee for Coordination of Transport was set up in NOVE!mber,
196, under the Communications Committee of the CIECD as a condltion of loan
409.-CHA. Members of the Committee are the heads of the transport agencies.
In its first year;, its staff studied a number of short-term problems, includ-
ing the standardization of harbor accounting systems, a survey of inland
warehouses, production of rail and port traffic forecasts, and traffic dis-
tribution between transport modes including commuter traffic.   These studies
are now, being considered by the Government.  Continuing work is being (one
regarding the establishment of longer term development programs. Current
studie,s under wzay, or to be started shortly, include railway electrification,
newJ port and airport facilities, a north-south expressway and urban transport.
2.10       Highway user charges are also being studied by CIECD.   In 1967,
total road expenditures, capital and current, w-rere NT$ 315.5 million while
total receipts from road users were NT$ 225.2 million.
2.11       Overall transport planning is still at an early stage in that
each agency draws up its own plan and submits it to the Central Governneni;
through the anpropriate channels. The investment program for the new :Four
Year Plan 1969-1972 is given in Table 4. Investment in shipping is expected
to be 32/% of fixed capital formation; railways, with 25%J, exceed highways
(16%), wi}hich is surprising as the highway figure includes investment in
vehicles (probably one-half).  This apparent imbalance may change slightly
in the next planning period if the north-south expressway is constructed.
The rail-rav proposed electrification program (see para. 3.09), however, if
it eventuates, could offset this to some degree.
2.12       On the wfhole, transport coordination through the CIECD has made
a satisffactorv beginning. Although the present project is well justified,
future lending in the transport sector should have regard to the varicus
stUAiies nr cl i unri,r iWay,
3. THE TAITAN RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION
A. Ornanization, HManagement and Staff
3.0l       TRA is an agency of the Provincial Government of Taiwan which is
responsible for the Railways' operation.  The Ministry of Communications of
the Ce-tral Gover.nmen.t also has authority over TRA and, as a result of this
dual resnonsibility, some government control procedures are unduly complex
and time consuming.  The freedom of TRA, however, in day-to-day operations
is not affected by these requirements.
3.02       lianagement, operations, administration and services are generally
sa-tisLactory and weell organized.  Staff Js competent and industrious and
labor relations are satisfactory.



3.C3       TBA has no staff conversant with the economics of railroad cmd
otler ~   -L r.dsoarnlo-  X  sitmae,et i        rpr     t   nes$ment;
progrram, examine transport cormpetition, study operational efficiency, traof-
fic costing and tariff policy.   TLo correct this, ThAL wishes to set Up
a Plannin,  Unit., and proposes to send two of its staff abroad for a
year to ,be tra.ied in transport economics.    The foreign excnange cost Of
this training is included in the proposed loan. Agreement has been
reach.ed during negotiat ions on the establishmment and staffing of such a
unit, its activities and, for coordination purposes, its relationship ltiith
B. Prorerty
(i) Track
3.04       TRA consists of two systems:   (a) the TIest Line (1.067 m gauge),
.;ith 408 km of main line and 397 km of branch lines; and (b) the East Line
(0.762 n gauge), wzhich is only 176 Im long.  The -'est Line has 210 km of
double track while the East Line is all single track.   Terrain presents
some difficulties on both lines.   There are 1,667 bridges with a total
length of' 41,900 m; and 69 tunnels totalling 19,820 m.
3-0)5      Both 1;est and East Lines are well maintained.  The West Line
standard of construction, with mostly 37 kg/m rails, gravel ballast,
uwooden sleepers and dog-spikes is adequate at present. However, with
increasing traffic density and greater train and car weights, a gradual
imnproVemenrt to ,50 kg/m rail, concrete sleepers and welding of rails is
necessary and is planned by TRA, The permanent way of the East Line, equip-
pecd Jith 30 'i/a-A rail is being re-ballasted to alloTw for an increase cf
maiimLm axle loacl from 8 to 10 t;ons after full dieselization.
3.o6       The signalling system is being continuously improved to increase
line capacity.  A substantial part of the Uest Line is operated wlith the
automnatic block system and centralized traffic control (CTC) covers 324
route-'-r with 87 more route-km to be equipped under the present project.
Forty stations and yards are equipped with relay, electric or electroriechan-
ical interlocking plants.  Lines with lighter traffic have the electric
tokcen block slystem.  Two hundred and sixty highwiay level crossings are now
provided with automatic gate or alarmL systems.

40 freight cars fcr the East Line). Most of these items are beinC pro-
cured un. -.>r Bank financing.
3.09       Host of TRA's steam locomotives are old, more than 40% being
over .40 years. TRA is advancing a considerable way towards full diesel-
izat.iDn bv addinp 12 di=esel locomotives on the East Line in 1968, with
26 locomotives for the W.iest Line to be delivered in 1969 (under loan
52L-C:HA) and 18 more included in the proposed project.  However, the
Government for economic and policy reasons (indigenous electric power,
security, foreign exchanee. etc.) wishes to study the possibilities of
main 'Wlest Line electrification. In view of the considerable expected
increase in trnffin beyond the nresent level of 100 trains a day and of
the forecast high traffic density on this Line, there is a case for elec-
trif icatinn or fudll dieselization. iThile the nresent number of diesel
locomotives, together wJith the units ordered or planned to be ordered du:r-
ing the nroannt perinod, 4ouuld not exceed the needs for branch lines and
shunting operations, an early decision on electrification or full diesel-

Eua-.Shan yard, 4 FDm north of Taipei, which is not well design-ed and cannot
be extended, will be replaced by the new Chi-tu fully mechanized marshall-
ing yard being built with Bank financing (loan 409-CHA); construction,
which was delayed because of land acquisition difficulties, is expected to
be comp leted in June 1971. A new modern marshalling yard is also to be
constructed at Kaohsiung in 1971-1972 to replace the existing one which
has become inadequate.
3.12     TRA's buildings, stations, shops and sheds are well maintained.
The West Line operates two workshops in Taipei and Kaohsiung. With the
increasing number of diesel locomrotives and passenger and freight cars,
bothl shops need extension and modernization of facilities and equipment;
Kaohsiung workshop cannot be extended at its present site and TRA has
acquired land on which a new worlkshop -- included in the present project --
wiLl be erected. lúaintenance equipment will also be needed in the new
diesel locomotive depot being built at the site of Chi-tu marshalling
yaro-. On the East Line, maintenance and repairs are done at the Hwa-Lien
worksho)p which is well eauipped.
C. Mannow,Ter. Productivity and WTages
3.1:3    Details of TRA's labor force, productivity in terms of train-lan
and traffic units and labor costs are given for 1963 to 1968 in Table 6.
3.14     Over this period the average labor force has remained within
cos1e *Iimi+ts arclncd 21;700 emnlovees: and with increasing traffic, pro(duc-
tivity has improved.  The number of employees per 1,000 train-km has been
reducher9 from 1.00 to 0.83; which compares quite favorably with the per..
formance on most IJ.S. and European railways, and the traffic units (pass-
km | + n-icm) per employee have  increased by 50% from 245,000 to 372,000.

cost per traffic unit rose in 1966 - 1968 after being static during 1963
to 1965. TRA's salaries and wages, especially those of tihe more senior
technical and supervisory staff, are expected to be raised on July 1, 1969,
costing an additional amount of NT$ 126 million in a full year.  This will
bring the salaries of such staff more in line with those of other entities
directly under the Central Government.
D.   Operations
3.16      Tables 7 and 8 present a surmary of railway operating statistics
for the West and East Lines over the last ten years which show improving
efficiency in most of the important indices.  However, diesel engine-km per
en^ine day in service have decreased due to the assignment of new loco-
motives to shorter runs previously performed by steam, and average turn-arouncq
time of freight cars has increased slightly, though it is still satisfactory.
Wagon-km per wagon day has slightly decreased.  The average load of freight
cars is static confirming the need to increae-e the capacity of new cars as
is now planned. Passengers per car also show a slight downward trend, as
new passenger cars are nut into service, but this marks only some relief of
overcrowding. Punctuality of passenger and freight trains averaged respec-
tIvel1yT 9L and QnI in 1967, which is good.  The nlanned investments intrack,
workshops, motive power and rolling stock should enable TRA to make further
improvements.
3.17      Operationral statistics for the RQ+ Lin      was     Tho  satis-
factory; punctuality of trains, at 97% represents a very good performance.
E.   Traff'ic
(i) Passenger Traffic
3.18      TEA obtains about 63% of its earnings from passenger traffic.
In 1967, short distance traffic (an average of 25 m) accoun.ted for about
3 billion pass-km, of which about one-third was commuter traffic (Tables
3 and 15). Long distance passengers accounted for about 2 billion DaSs-kmX
but; only 8% of the number of passengers. A recent study of CIECD,sti:ll
under consideration by the Government, indicates that large losses are
being aicurred by- commuter traffic, which is almost entirely made up of
students carried at fares 757 below the basic rate.
3.19      Long distance and commuter traffic on the West Line has be rL
gro-ing at about 15% and 2% a year respectively from 1960 to 1967.  Though
tho Dpob2'em of uriremunerative commuter traffic will remain for some time
to come, it is expected to diminish in relative importance as the birth
rate declines and as students come to be restricted to their own school
zones undler the CGovernment's new school building program.
(ii) Frei it Traffic
3.20      Freight traffic has been growing at about 3.8% per year over the
last eighlt years., rising from about 2 billion ton-km in 1960 to nearly 2.6
bi:Llion ton-km in 1968 (Table 9). The West Line carries 98% of TRA f:^eight

a target, of 5.5% w:<zas agreed upon with TRA as a minimum return to be achieved

_/  Ton-km plus pass-km
3.24' Average revenue per traffic unit has improved steadily,
due to rapidly increasing higher class passenger traffic and
tariff increases that were made effective August 15, 1967.
3.25       As a lorm of dividend from its earnings, TRA makes large con-
tributions to the Provincial Government which annually amounted uo NT; 60U
million uitil 1967, Ywhen the am.ount was increased to NT$ 72 million.   In
that year, in conjunction with an increase of 15% in passenger fares, mR A
commenced paying an adcdtional contribution based on two-thirds of the
a;1citional revenue earned by this 15 increase, but limited to NT$ 85
nillion in any one year.   In 1967 the total paid to the Provincial Govern-
ment amounted to NT$ 99.13 million, with the full amount of .T$ i57
million being paid in 19680
3.26       Despite making these annual contributions to Government, TRA
has accumulated a substantial earned surplus.    Debt service and debt
equity ratios remain satisfactory, as shown in Tables 10 and 11 respec-
tively.
(ii) Tariffs
3.27        Rates and fares must be approved by the Commissioner of Conmunica-
tions, the Governor and the Assembly of the Provincial Government, ancl by the
lIiinister of Comnmiications and the Executive Yuan of the Central Government.
The tariff structure, summarized in Annex 1, is generally satisfactory in
that (apart from the social privilege rates and fares), individual freight
raltes; having regard to loading characteristics, bear reasonable realationships
to each other.



1)  PassengeFares and    reight Rates
3.28        The first major change in tariffs since 1961 was introduced on
August 15, 1967, w:hen all passenger fares were increased by 15% and, by
expanding the existing five freight commodity classes to eight, the rates
for some lower class commodities, including the most important, coal, were
raised by about 13%b.
3.29        Due to lack of staff experienced in economics, TRA has not ;yet
been able to comply with the undertaking, given under both Loans 409-CHA
and 524-CHA., to introduce new tariffs based on costs. TRA has now agreed
to appoint consultants to introduce modern traffic costing techniques, and
instruct TRA staff in continuing such techniques and in establishing a
rates and fares structure reasonably related to costs and which will en-
sure an adequate return on the net fixed assets in use. The proposed loan
would finance the foreign exchange cost of such oonsultants.   Agreement
was reached during negotiations on the terms of reference of the consult-
ants.

3.33        The study of TRA's commuter traffic (Annex 2) is still beiAg
considered by the Government which, as an intermL measuLe, has decided to
campensate TRA for the deficit on the traffic by reducing TRA's total annual
contribution to the Provincial Government from tne present N1l 157 million
to NT$ 50 million, as from July 1, 1969. Agreement was reached during :ne-
gotiations on this matter.

ava:ilable when reqjuired.
3.35        TRA has borrowed from the Pool, beginning in 1959, principally
to meet major costs of tvDhoon damage, and also to finance capital invest-
menOb As of December 31, 1968, TRA owed the Government Pool NT$ 259 m:Ll-
lion;- on which annual interest of almost 10% is paid. Over the last few
years TRA has not been able substantially to reduce this comparatively
expens-ve frorm of' borrowing, but would be able to eliminate i.t in 1972
(see para. 5oO8).

44. THE PROJECT
A. The 1969-1972 New Investment Plan
k4.01        RA's traffic has increased faster than expected, necessitating
procurement of additional motive power and rolling stock, improvement and
strengthening of track and modernization of workshops. Accordingly, TRA
having reviewed its capital investment program for the period 1965-1970,
has drawn up a new Capital Investment Plan for the period 1969 to 1972 -with
a total cost of N~$ 5,670 million (Us$ 11.2 milon equivalent), incl-ding
a foreign exchange conponent of abcut US$ 82 million equivalent).
4e02        In view of recent and proposed investments, and given the con-
tinuation of TRAts present good staLn-dards of periatincy, effie-iOn%rr Certa#-+l

reduction's in rolling stock over the years 1971-1972, and in miscellaneous
investment- over the whole period was discussed during negotiat-ons  and
agreement was reachled with TRA on a Plan for the period 1969 to 1972 reduced
to  lT$* ,4e  (     TJS7 ITTS& LJJqJ   .qLivalerUJ  W-.Lh  a  -vorign  exchange

(i)  Items to be financed by the proposed loan; and
(ii)  11ems essential to the project but to be financed
by TRA for reasons explained in para. 4.04.

4.0Lo      The items to be financed by TRA are (a) the signalling equipment
(CTC) required in the double tracking of the 7 sections between Chanehua and
Taiaan, this equipment has to be of the same make as that presently in
service and its nrocurement would therefore not follow the usual international
competitive bidding procedures;    (b) 100 suburban serwice passenger carso

increase their output, improving the availability of locomotives and rolling

4.09       Consulting services and training are as described in paragraphs
3.03, 3.09 and 3.29. Tentative terms of reference for the study on
electrification of the main West Line have been agreed with TRA, who will
select a suitable firm of consultants, to be approved by the Bank. Completion
of this study is planned for the end of 1969.
4.10       Cost estimates of the foreign exchange components of the project
are based on quotations for items of similar nature recently ordered on
the basis of international competitive bidding. A contingency of about 7.5% h&8
been added to allow for a possible increase in the price of steel. Local
costs which include port charges and fees, duties, assembly costs of bogies
for passenger cars, track work costs, erection costs of signalling and
level crossing warning equipment, are based on actual expenditures for
similar works performed in Taiwan;    a contingency of about 7.5% has also beeL
added to allowi for possible wage increases. Both foreign and local estimates
are considered realistic.
C. Execution of the Project Disbursement and Procurement
4.11       TRA is competent to carry out the project.    Disbursements will be
made on the basis of C.I.F. costs of imported equipment and the foreign
costs of Consulting Services and overseas training.     All of the items tc be
financed out of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan will be procured
through internationaL competitive bidding, in accordance wiith the procedue-Ss
of the Bank.

5.05        Over the period, operating ratios are expected to improve from
79 in 1970 to 76 :n 1972: with interest requirements rising from NT$ 103
million in 1968 to NT$ 210 million in 1971, and falling to NT$ 199 mill:Lon
in 1972, the times interest earned ratio will decline from 3.8 to 3.2 in
1970, r:ising to 3,e4 in 1972; these ratios are satisfactory. Net income
after interest, after falling fram N $ 380 million in 1969 to NT$ 332
mill:ion in 1970 should rise to NT$ 476 million in 1972. The rate of re-
turn is expected to fall from 7.8% in 1969 to 6.7% in 19703 thereafter
improving to 7.3% in 1972, Agreemient was reached during negotiations that
a rate of return of no less than 6.5 % would be earned in 1969 and 1970,
with a minimum of 7% being earned thereafter.

5.o8      In order to provide for a) the construction of 100 coirmuter
passenger cars, b) the removal of the workshops at Kaohsiung and c) the
construction of a new and more efficient shop, together with a new
marshalling yard on the outskirts of the city, TRA will borrow the abo-e
amiount from the "Pool" funds during 1969 but should be able to repay all such
borrowing before the end of the program period.
5.09      The forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1969 to 1972,

A.   Traffic Forecasts
6.01      Traffic forecasts for the Taiwan Railwqays have been made on a
regular basis since 1963. Forecasting of traffic is done at two levels.
The CIECD forecasts traffic for all forms of transport, based on
trends cf industrial production, population, foreign trade and national
income. TRA forecasts rail traffic only, basing its estimates entirely
on industry interviews and population growth projections. The results
of the two forecasts give quite similar results for rail traffic.   TEA
forecasts covering the period up to 1972, the last year of its Four Year
Investment Plan, are extremely detailed and are acceptable to the Bank.
It is reasonable to expect that the trend of the forecast will continue
after 1972 with some modification, however, to take into account the
proposed expressway sections. For the purposes of the following economic



- 20 -
analysis, therefore, passenger traffic is estimated to increase by
/Y, per annum to the end of 1974 and then fall to 41; per ann-wum to the
end of the project life.  Freight traffic is forecast to grow at a rate
of 4L,j per annum to 1974 and at 2.5, per annum thlereafter.
6.02     The largest volume of railway freight traffic is coal, which
accounts for about 255; of the total. Though future increases in local
production are not expected, due to the exhaustion of the better seams
and the substitution by some coal users of other forms of energy, demands
are expected to rise as car shortages are alleviated. Cement transport
is expected to increase by 4h per annum. This may be a somewhat co0-
servative estimate, however, in view of the rapidly expanding construction
:industry and new kilns which are planned. As with coal, the railwaays have
not been able to fulfill all car requests.  Substitution of imported grains
for domestic rLce is expected as land is put to other uses.  Fertilizer
transportation will increase due to the expansion of local production at
the expense of imports.  An increase in salt transport is expected as more
chey;aical industries are formed.  On the East Line the most notable -Lncrease
is Ln timber, rising from 2.3 million ton-l,k in 1967 to 16.3 million ton-
'on Lin 1972.  This is due to new logging operations and planned expo:,ts of
oiGrlywood and veneer.
6.03     Passenger traffic forecasts are given for both lines in Table 15.
Long distance traffic is expected to grow at a rate of 12% per annum to
1972 and though the grow-fth rate appears exceptionally high, it is reason-
able given the absence of alternative highnways, the density of population
and the dynamic growth of the economy.
6.04     in the longer term; the railwjay can expect to suffer from
highway transport competition even though, as Table 9 shows, most of
TRi'As freight traffic is of bulky low value commodities that are not
attractive for road competition provided the railway can offer efficient
services.  IIoreover road transport i s relatively exnensive and will remain
so having rcegard to the poor alignmens available; this is so even for
short journeyrs. Nevertheless, if the West Coast expressway sections are
constructed, some traffic will undoubtedly be diverted.  This has been
taken into accolunt in the economic analysis=

needecl to cope vith the new motive power and rolling stock, as well as
freight handling equipment and signalling devices to cope with congested
cornditIons.  A separate economic justifica3ton has not been made for the
locomotives as they are not required to replace existing power but to haul
additional traLffic.  Their cost has therefore been included wvith the cost
of rolling stock. Similarly, the costs of workshop and depot equipment
in the project; have been incLuded in the costs of mnotive power and rolling

7.01     D.Luring negotiations assurances were obtained from the Governmeint of
the Republic of China and TRA on the following principal items:
i)  TRA's capital investment plan (para. 4.02) and extent of
participation in financing railwiay line elevation in
Taipei (para. 2.06);
ii)  TRA's proposed planning unit (para. 3.03), electrification
stuc,y (para. 3.09), and traffic costing study (para. 3.29)g
iLii) abolition o0 discounted   r       rates (para. 3. c2) and
reduction of annual contribution to Provinci    Government
(para. 3.33).
7.02     The Project, which is technically sound and of economic benefit
to the country, would be a suitable basis for a Banlc loan of US$ 31.2
million equivalent to the Republic of China. Although the economic life
of the assets in the Project is about 20 years a term of 15 years, in-
cluding a three year period of grace, is recommended on country economic
grounds and TRA is capable of servicing the loan on these terms.   The
proceeds of the loan would be made available by the Central Government
to the TRA on the same terms and conditions as those granted to the Centra:L
Government by -he Bank.

1961. Further revaluation can be considered
-whIen ,,hLiS inde-x hias irl e by 2V0%.  ULand 
is not subject to this manner of revalu-
ation, but in 1967 Government ordered a
special revaluation for taxation purposes.
TRA complied and the accountiing adjustmnent
has been made in 1968, the resulting net
surplus of NT$1,479 being added to -capital
surplus".  The enhanced value arising from
the revaluation has been added to i"Fixed
Assets" under "non-operational", until such
time as TRA has determined the value of
operational land.
4. "Capital" includes the surpluses resulting from revaluations of
assets carried out in 1952 and 1961, wnich
totalled about NT$4.1 billion.
5. Apparent discrepancies in reconciling figures between Tables 10 and.
11, in 1966, 1967 and 1968 (mainly affecting Fixed Assets, Deprecia-
tion and Earned Surplus) arise from year-end adjustments due to a)
retirements of assets and b) corrections to previous years' accounts.

The Communication Committee of CIECD has prepared a study of TRA's
commuter traffic, based on 1966 operations.
The study shows that the deficit of about N1T$125 million on this
traffic was caused by Fixed Period Tickets for:
Deficit
Students             (75% discount)  647 million Pass-Km  NT$113 million
Government Employees (40% discount)   79 million Pass-im        6 million
Military Personnel   (80% discount)    32 million Pass-Km       6 million
NT$125 million
The recommendations of the study include:
a) Relief of overcrowding and increase in the Railroad's capacity
to carry growing commuter traffic by:
i) Restricting operation of non-commuter trains during
peak hours of commuter traffic, and
ii) Procuring more high-capacity commuter cars
b) Abolition of the 40% discount to government employees.
c) Students at above senior middle schools, universities and colleges
should pay the same fares as the general public.
d)  The price of military fixed-price tickets to be slightly increased.
e) MvIore strict enforcement of the school zoning program by Government,
thus reducing much unnecessary cross-city student travel.
f)  TRa to be compensated by Government for the loss incurred.
No clecision has yet been made by the Government, but government
officials are of the opinion that a combination of gradual fare increases,
together with the better enforcement of school zoning regulations (which
would involve solving problems of uneven qualitv of education) would, in
time, help to reduce the deficit.

THIRD RAILIJAY PROJECT
Taiwan Railway Administration
Economic Benefits and Methodology
1. Passenger Cars - West Line
The largest element of the project, NT$ 550.5 million, consists
of the provision of 268 long distance passenger cars for the Wlest Line
reflecting the rapid growth in traffic.   Several reasons account for this
high growth, the most important being rapidly expanding incomes and popu-
lation. combined with poor highway alternatives.   TRh now operates 705
cars on this line.  During the 1969-70 period, a net addition of 137 cars
will be mrade under the Bank first and second railwav loans and by self-
financed funds.  The TRA will still require the 268 cars included in this
nroiect, to mpet tfhe needls of' lono distnnce traffic. If the cars are not
acquired, passengers would undoubtedly be diverted to- the highways at sub-
stnanti.allyM higher costs=   W .hhen the nreratincg costs for the 12 locomotives
required to haul these cars are included, the cost per pass-km is NT$ 0.170
nnri 'YTt 0.215 for rail and hius resrectively  The rmnmparison with nrivate
cars has not been made. The bus costs include a sum for maintenance cf
existi Sng- rnaAo and becausea +hei -r'n4 Thir  c passnger cars unhl A he filz 1u itil1-
ized on procurement, no traffic growth has been assumed.
The benefits of continuing to provide adequate rail service for
pa-;sengers, ra,jer th1-  A44v -..  4  -them, t4-o -rA ------n-r-,  res1l+ ir a
rat,e of return of at least 9% hlich is satisfactory.
2. Freight Cars
The traf'fic forecast for 1971 cannot be transported by rail unless
new freight cars are acquired.   TRA has consistenLtly to zurn dom iarge
volumes of traffic because of freight car shortages. The project includes
60C) freight cars of 30 and 35 ton carrying capacity.  These are much l.arger
than most of the present cars which average 17 tons.   If these new cars
were not purchased, the result would be a diversion to the roads at subw-
stantially higher costs, even allowing for extra railway handling cost,s.
Analysis suggests that rail costs, as compared with road haulage costs,
result in net savings of NT$ 180 million/year. These benefits do not
increase as the cars will be fully utilized immediately they are put into
service. In order to haul the freight cars, 6 new locomotives will be!
required, the capital and operating costs of which are included in the:
economic justification. The freight cars are well justified, with an eco-
nomic rate of return of 30'p over their life.

3. Double Tracking
The total length of line between Changhua and Tainan is 142.5 km,
out of which at present 54.9 km are double track and 53.5 are being con-
verted to double track, mainly with funds provided in the second Bank loan,
leaving eL balance of 34.1 km single track. The Centralized Traffic Control
(CTC) signal system, which is used on the line over the single track sec-
ticins and the 54.9 km of double track sections, is being extended to the
53.5 km of double track under construction; though it is estimated that CTC,
by raisirng track capacity to about 120 trains a day, would delay the need
for total. double tracking of the line, traffic forecasts are such that this
measure now appears to be the only solution.  The present project is for
the double tracking of the remaining 34.1 km. Advantage of the double track-
ing work will be taken by TRA to install at low cost an individual CTC
signal svstem on each of the two tracks. This will increase track capacity
up to 244 trains a day against a forecast of 120 trains in 1972 with the
present CTC.  The economic comparison has been made with highways beca.use
the! best alternative to capacity expansion is to divert to highways the
trafficr which could not be handled by rail.  The benefits of double track-
ing result in an economic rate of return of 12% after taking into acccunt
the costs of' add ition21 CTC ec.uinment to be financed by TRA and additional
line maintenance costs.
4. Automatic Warning Devices
The installation of automatic warning devices is a continuing
project, having been cormenced under the first Bank loan.   It is proposed
to insta'll devices at 64 highway grade crossings, including 14 on the East
Li ne. 4tadequate a.     c* becoming 'rce.nt. as there are now over 100
trains per day on many parts of the line and traffic, both rail and road,
is gro,ing rapid,y. There were, for example, 61 traffi    fatalities at
crossings on both lines in 1967, as well as 194 serious injuries.   A com-
parison of the costs for manually operated war.ning terixrs   with those for
automatic indicat;es that the latter are more economic, even allowing ior
much hlgher instclation costs, one man, for maintenance bel-n  reqlirecL for
ten places as compared with one man per crossing for manual operation. The
savings  tG the 2'RA, and to thIe econoimV, c: automatic wrning devi ccs result
in a rate of retLrn of 24? e:xcluding any allouances for the value of i.LI-

loan), as well as newi equipment in the car inspection yard at Kaohsiunlg
which now handles about half or the West Line passenger cars.    mne cost
of the equipment has already been included in the justification of the
additional motive powrer and rolling stock being procured and so rio sepa-
rate justification is required.
6. Track Strengthening
The liest Line consists almost entirely of 37 kg/m rail or lighter.
This and the standard of construction of the substructure limits track
capacity. Heavy axle loads cannot be carried safely at economic speeds.
The project includes improvement of alignment, widening of roadbed, and
strengthening of track by upgrading the rail and ballast.    The improve-
ments are part of a long range program and only the most urgent work --
the 40 km south of Taipei -- is included in this project. Reduction of
curvature will reduce rail wear and train operating costs by eliminating
thie need to slow down and then accelerate, with corresponding heavy fuel
corslnnptfton. MJaintenance costs of track and the replacement of rails and
ties Nill also be reduced considerably through the use of heavy welded
rails in 1 km sections, better ballast and concrete ties. Running tines
will be improved by higher train speeds, resulting in time savings for
crEws. l'he benefits result in an economic rate of return of 9%. A fur-
ther saving is important but is not included above, the time savings of
passengers. If this benefit is added, the rate of return is increased.
to 18%.
7. IHodernization of Freight Handlinz
TRA is making every effort to maintain a sound competitive pc,si-
tion in the inland movement of international container traffic, rail bieing
more economic thcn truck transportation for all but short hauls.    At pre-
sent, TRA is not equipped to handle containers from ships to inland con-
signees. The proiect calls for a pilot scheme in which the containers; would
be tran^sferred from rail to road vehicles (private where available) by gan-
tryr cranes at two inland noints and moved to the consignees.
TRA is also preparing to meet the growing competitive challenge of
trucks in the domestic movements of traffic that is of high value in rela-
tion to bulk.  Thiis will he done by mechanizing handling through contain.er-
ization and palletization.
The movement of international containers by rail/truck was com-
p-anre,md wilt-h mviratrmri. on+.t - ent   -Ty hyi trck.  The TRA traffic froreca.st i s bhased

8. Trailers - East Line
Passenger traffic on the East Line is expected to grow at an an-
nuaCl average rate of 4 per ann-wi to 19r2 and ca be expected to continlue
at this rate in the absence of a paved road. It is proposed to add trail-
ers to the existing diesel railcars to hanule the additional traffic aad
to replace worn out passenger cars. Under the second Bank loan diesel
railcars wers fited with more powerful engines to haul these trailers.   A
comparison of carrying the same traffic on the parallel gravel highway
results in a rate of return of 12%1 over the project life.
9, Passenger Car Bogies
Ine program of replacing over-aged passenger car bogies was com-
menced by the second loan under which 100-sets are being procured. The
old wooden bodies have now all been replaced by steel bodies and the con-
version of the bogies would considerably increase the working life of the
coaches. Justification for the project lies not only in the elimination
of dangerous operating conditions, but also in increased speeds, better
riding qualities, and lower maintenance costs. The cost of the new bogies
together wJith the cost of the steel bodies (now a sunk cost), would total
NT$P4 65.5 million. For completely new cars, the cost would have been
XT$ 120,0 million, showing clear economic justification.  If the coaches
were not rehabilitated at all, the passenger traffic would have the alter-
native of travelling by road. Comparison of rail and bus costs indicate a
rate of return of 33%.
10. Signalling - Patu and Kaohsiung
The manual signal interlocking systems of the TRA are inefficient
and very old. Those in the worst condition are at Patu (41 years) and
Kaohsiung stations which handle very heavy traffic.  Because of the age of
th.lese installations, it is becoming extremely difficult to obtain replace-
ment parts.  The oroject will provide for electrification of the signalling
which will result in vastly increased safety, savings in manpower and elimi-
nation of train delays. The cost savings only amount to about NT$ 2.5
million per annum and will yield a rate of return of about 6%. Though this
rate of return may appear low, the signalling is justified on grounds of
safety, the full economic benefits of which are not measurable.
