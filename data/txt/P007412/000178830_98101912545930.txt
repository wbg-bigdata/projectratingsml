SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an agricultural credit project which will
continue an on-going Bank-financed lending program for investments in dairy,
beef, citrus and coconut on about 200 farms and finance also a few units of
agro-industries. Agriculture is important to Jamaica, contributing 18% of
its exports and of its imports, and providing the means of livelihood to about
a third of its population. Though this sector of the Jamaican economy has
been relatively stagnant till recently, the resource base promises good growth
potential and there is need for such development to meet the expanding tourist
demand as well as other domestic requirements, and, correspondingly, to reduce
the need for importing milk and other livestock products, vegetable oils, and
such. The Project seeks to support the on-going efforts of Government in this
direction by providing long-term credit and supporting technical assistance.
ii.       This would be the second Bank loan to Jamaica in the agricultural
sector; the first was made to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) in 1970 for
agricultural credit and it is almost fully committed. As a result of a
comprehensive agricultural sector study recently completed by the Government
of Jamaica with Bank assistance, further Bank financing is likely to be
sought for agricultural projects, including, in particular, a sugar industry
rehabilitation project now under preparation and a rural development project
oriented to small farmers.
iii.      The proposed loan of US$5.5 million to JDB would finance 51% (equal
to the foreign exchange component) of total Project cost, which is estimated
at US$10.8 million equivalent. JDB would contribute US$3.5 million equivalent,
or about 32% of the total cost, while the balance of 17% would be contributed
by the sub-borrowers. Of the total cost, 57% would be for livestock, 30% for
crops, 15% for agro-industries and the balance for technical services.
iv.       The period of sub-loans would vary from 10 years for dairy farms
to 15 years for citrus and coconut farms. Interest at 10% per annum would
be charged on sub-loans which would be denominated in US dollars. With a
view to ensuring a larger proportion of relatively small sub-loans than was
achieved under the first project, the lower limit for JDB sub-loans would
be reduced from J$ 20,000 to J$ 15,000, and at least one-third of sub-loans
approved by JDB under the Project would be required to be of J$ 35,000 or
less. Further, a contribution of only 10% of the Project cost would be
required for sub-loans of J$ 35,000 or less, as compared with 20% for larger
loans,
v.        The Project would be administered by JDB, with the technical experts
and staff established under the first Project being retained and strength-
ened. Provision is also made for overseas training of JDB technicians in the



- ii -
development of goats, sheep, mango aitd avocado--all to be financed on a modest
scale in the Project--and for studiesi related to the sugar industry rehabili-
tation project.
vi.       Items of on-farm investment to be financed by sub-loans are varied
and would not be suitable for international competitive bidding. Farmers
would make their purchases through normal commercial channels, which provide
adequate competition and supplies and represent various international firms.
Awards for construction and machinery for agro-industries, however, would be
made only after obtaining quotations from at least three suppliers provided,
however, that, where machinery is estimated to cost US$150,000 or more tender
notices would be published locally and submitted to representatives of embassies
of Bank member countries in Jamaica, and all contracts in excess of US$150,000
would require prior Bank approval.
vii.      Estimated financial rates of return range from 19% to 32%, and the
overall economic return is 26%. With appropriate assurances, the Project
would be suitable for a loan of US$5.5 million, repayable in 16 years,
including four years of grace. The loan would be granted to the Jamaica
Development Bank on the guarantee of the Government of Jamaica.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INrRODUCTION
1.01      In December 1970, the Bank approved a loan of US$3.7 million to
the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) for an agricultural credit project which
represented a three-year lending program for coconuts, citrus, beef and milk.
The loan became effective in June 1971. Though initially slow moving, the
project gathered rapid momentum in 1973. Expecting the loan to be fully
committed by about the end of 1973, JDB requested a second loan in July 1973.
The Project now proposed would be essentially a continuation of the first
Project but would provide also for financing some additional categories of
on-farm investment and certain facilities foi marketing and processing crops
and livestock products. A loan of US$5.5 million to JDB on the guarantee of
the Government of Jamaica is recommended.
1.02      The Project was prepared by JDB, and this report is based on the
findings of an appraisal mission to Jamaica in September/October 1973, con-
sisting of Messrs. C. G. Ramasubbu and 0. Urbina (Bank) and R. P. Armour
and J. D. Collarte (Consultants).
1I. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Jamaica has a total area of about 4,400 square miles, with a maximum
length of 146 miles and a width of 52 miles. Its mid-1972 population of 1.95
million gave an average density of 163 per km2 and represented a rate of growth
of 1.7% between 1965 to 1972. The per capita income was J$ 720 in 1971.
2.02      A large part of the island is mountainous, being divided by shale
and limestone plateaus in the central and western area and by the Blue Mountain
range in the east. Rainfall varies from less than 50 in. in the south to 140
in. in the northeast and up to 200 in. in the Blue Mountains. The fertile,
flat, alluvial soils found on the coastal plains are used for export-oriented
commercial farming, while the hilly inland terrain accounts for subsistence
farming.  The island is prone to hurricane damage.
2.03      Agriculture's share in GDP declined from 17% in 1953 to 8% in 1970,
partly as a result of the development of tourism, mining and manufacturing
and partly because of a fall in the agriculture growth rate from about 37%
during the 1950s to about 1.3% in the 1960s. (This rate has, however, sub-
stantially improved since 1971, mainly in domestic food crops.) Despite the



related fall in agricultural employment, one-third of the population still
depends on agriculture for its livelihood. Agricultural products (US$66 million)
account for 187 of total exports, with sugat (USS42 million) and bananas
(I'SS15 million) being the principal items. Food items constitute an almost
equal share of imports and consist mainly of meat, milk, fish, cereals and
related products.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.04      Of about 1.5 million acres of land considered suitable for agri-
culture, 0.75 million are cultivated. Land untder purestand crops (360,000
acres) is devoted mainly to sugarcane (157,000 acres), banana (41,500 acres)
and coconuts (39,000 acres) but other significant crops are yams, citrus,
cocoa and coffee. The 200,00C acres under mixed crops show widespread inter-
cropping, as of coconuts with banana and citrus with pumpkin.  About 356,000
acres of improved and natural pastures and fallow land are available to support
Jamaica's livestock industry, and there are 222,000 acres of ruinate (lands
once cultivated, later neglected and now in need of clearing) (Annex 1).
2.05      Despite Government support through a wide array of subsidies which
are now being gradually reduced, the performance of agriculture in Jamaica
in the 1960s was disappointing, especially in respect of export crops. How-
ever, the recent improvement in other crops and in livestock points to the
potential for development. Recognizing the need for an overall plan for
agriculture, the Government of Jamaica conducted a comprehensive survey of
this sector in 1972/73 with the assistance of Bank staff and an international
team of experts. A Green Paper on implementing the resulting recommendations
has been published. (See para. 2.10)
2.06      Decline in the production of sugarcane resulting from drought and
shortage of agricultural labor, management difficulties and obsolete machinery,
led to a fall in sugar output from a 1966 peak of 500,000 tons to 370,000 tons
in 1972. However, a comprehensive sugar industry rehabilitation project is
now being prepared for improving the productivity of cane farming and ration-
alizing and streamlining the factories. Banana production has also been
declining and exports have dropped off, mainly for reasons of quality control.
Other traditional export crops, such as pimento, coffee and ginger, have been
stagnant or declining, while domestic food crops and meat products have been
making progress.
2.07      The livestock sub-sector, which accounted for about 20% of the
value of agricultural production in 1972, has performed well in recent years,
especially in poultry and swine, achieving an annual growth rate of 5.8%   -
between 1964/65 and 1970/71, as compared with 0.7% for the agricultural
sector as a whole. The national herd has grown to between 350,000 and 400,000
head, 75% being beef cattle. With the rising demand for beef and milk for
the tourist market and for domestic consumption, there is much scope for in-
creasing production and reducing the heavy dependence on imports by developing



improved pastures on unused lands, better farm management, effective regula-
tion of the industry, and better processing facilities. Animal health services
are adequate for the on-going development projects.
2.08      About 78% of the farms in Jamaica are less than 5 acres and cover
only 15% of the land, while those in excess of 500 acres account for only
0.1% of the number of farms but occupy about 43% of farm land (Annex 2).
These figures, however, distort the position to the extent that sugar estates,
now largely taken over by Government, and mining companies together account
for an estimated 50% of the area under the farms exceeding 500 acres. Ten
acres are assumed to be the minimum area required per family, but nearly
190,000 farmers have smaller units and, of these, about one-half are primarily
dependent on their farms, while the others are part-time farmers. The major
policy goals are those of finding additional land for farmers whose holdings
are uneconomic, improving the utilization of idle land and raising productivity
through irrigation and other measures. Government has not yet decided on how
to make available to smaller farmers the substantial acreage taken over from
sugar factories, pending the formulation of a rehabilitation plan for the
sugar industry (para 2.06). Mining companies also own large areas of farm
land, some of which they cultivate and some of which they lease out.
2.09      As part of the Government project GROW (Growing and Reaping Our
Wealth), a land lease program is in operation under which land owned or
leased by Government from private owners is re-leased to farmers in small
plots. Farmers are provided credit in the form of inputs and services, such
as tractor ploughing, which they are required to repay by selling produce to
the Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC). About 10,000 small farmers are
expected to be placed on 25,000 acres of land, in addition to their existing
holdings, by the end of 1974. The GROW project also includes a few large
Government far m--called Food Farms--which cover about 25,000 acres and are
operated now as single production units but are likely to be developed
eventually into long-term leasehold property occupied by small farmers
organized into service cooperatives. There are, in addition, about 270 land
settlements, involving nearly 40,000 settlers, each family holding an average
plot of about 4.4 acres.
2.10      The Land Utilization Commission (LUC) was established in 1966 to
deal with idle or grossly underutilized agricultural lands, being authorized
to take them over and bring them into full use if owners failed to do so.
LUC's effectiveness has been limited, however, by its inadequate staffing
and time-consuming procedures and the restriction of its jurisdiction to farms
of over 100 acres. The Government is now actively considering the various
measures suggested by the Agricultural Sector Study (para. 2.05) for improving
the utilization and distribution of agricultural land, including the following:
(a) pressing ahead with permanent settlement of Government-purchased land
and acquisition of 120,000 more acres of cultivable land, including improved
pasture for settlement; (b) extending LUC's powers to farms between 10 and
100 acres and increasing its resources; (c) pressing mining companies to
develop their tenant farming and resettlement programs; (d) preparing a
code to govern tenurial conditions and size of farms; (e) ensuring services



-4-
to small farmers through cooperatives; and (f) implementing new irrigation
schemes and rationalizing the operation of existing ones. The Government has
obtained the services of a Land Reform expert and proposes early action on
his advice. It is expected that, as part of an effort to help Government
implement the action program emerging from the Sector Study, the Bank will
be called upon assist in the preparation and financing of a project designed
to ameliorate the situation of the small farmers; this might take the form
of a rural development project including components foi Improving land utiliza-
tion and crop production.
2.11      With 675 field personnel, the present agricultural extension service
should be adequate, but is handicapped by lack of transportation, understaffing
in vital areas, poor salaries, and conflict in the field with staff of com-
modity boards, who are better trained and better paid. The Jamaica School of
Agriculture meets the demand for graduates at the intermediate level, but the
output of Jamaican graduates from the College of Agriculture at the University
of the West Tndies in Trinidad is inadequate to meet Jamaica's needs. Scholar-
ships are being offered to attract more students. Agricultural research,
carried out primarily by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the
commodity boards, is mostly adaptive or applied to help traditional crops.
It requires closer coordination so as to upgrade quality and support improvted
production and introduction of non-traditional crops.
2.12      Marketing of export crops is organized largely through commodity
boards, such as the Coconut Industry Board (CIB) and the Banana Board, or
through producers' associations, such as the Citrus Growers Association (CGA),
while products for domestic consumption are sold mainly through the Parish
council markets. The latter are dominated by "higglers," who travel in trucks
and buy at the farmgate. The state-owned AMC operates as a wholesaler and
retailer in Parish markets; as an exporter of a few crops; and as the sole
importer of foodgrains.
2.13      Apart from sugar, agro-industrial activity in Jamaica has been
concerned mainly with processing facilities for food products--milk pro-
cessing plants, canning factories for vegetables, fruits and fruit juices,
and slaughterhouses for cattle and pigs. Production capacity is sometimes
underutilized because of the lack of adequate produce of standard quality.
C. Agricultural Credit
2.14      The major institutional source of agricultural credit in Jamaica
has been the Agricultural Credit Board (ACB), a statutory Government body
which channels short-, medium- and long-term funds provided by Government
and by external agencies, mostly to small farmers through People's Coopera-
tive Banks (PCBs) and regional land authorities (Annex 3). JDB, a multi-
purpose development bank, is the other state-owned credit institution. Loans



- 5 -
are also made by the commodity boards. Among private institutional sources,
the commercial banks are the most important and provide mainly short-term
credit to commercial farmers, including sugar estates. Government is en-
couraging commercial banks to play a more active role in agricultural credit
under a scheme which provides for Government guarantees for term loans for
agricultural investment. Hire purchase firms play a limited role in fi-
nancing machinery purchases. Non-institutional sources (shopkeepers, sup-
pliers of farm snputs, higglers and relatives) provide mostly subsistence
credit and their role in farm financing is small.
2.15      ACB accounted for outstanding agricultural loans of about J$ 26
million at, the end of March 1973. Under the Farmers' Development Program,
financed from a revolving fund made up mainly of periodical contributions
from Government, the board provides loans up to J$ 20,000 to relatively small
farmers; the actual average of loans made to about 90,000 beneficiaries dur-
ing 1962-72 was about J$1,550. A second ACB program was the USAID-financed
Dairy Development Scheme for medium-sized farmers.
2;16      The other important program, administered until recently by ACB, is
the IDB-financed Self-Supporting Farmers' Development Program (SSFDP) which
finances, ordinarily, farms between 5 and 25 acres, and only farmers who
derive their incomes mainly from agricultural and livestock activities and
have agricultural and livestock assets not exceeding J$ 25,000. No loan
exceeds J$ 15,000 and interest rates are 6% for short term and 4% for long
term. The cost of the program, established in 1969/70, in its first and
second stages was US$17,5 million and is estimated at US$15.8 million in the
on-going, third stage. Management of the program was switched to JDB, prin-
cipally because of a rising delinquency rate. The senior staff of JDB will
now superintend implementation, review oper4tional policies and procedures,
screen existing program staff and recruit new staff. Government will meet
staff costs and pay a commission to JDB for its services. The funds pro-
vided under this program are substantial in relation to the likely demand
from eligible farmers and to the availability in Jamaica of suitable staff
required for loan appraisal and supervision.
2.17      JDB is the main Government agency for term lending to different
sectors of the economy.  In connection with the first Agricultural Credit
Project, it built up its agricultural staff and evolved appropriate lending
policies and procedures. As of December 31, 1973, JDB had made 108 agri-
cultural loans (including some outside the Project), amounting to J$ 6.6
million.
2.18      There are 115 PCBs in Jamaica, most of which are handicapped by a
weak capital base, inadequate organizational structure, unsatisfactory mainten-
ance of accounts, and poor loan collections. Government is now considering
whether these banks should continue to operate and, if so, how their number
could be reduced to form more viable units,
2.19      Agricultural credit in Jamaica appears inadequate for medium- and
long-term purposes and for small and medium farms. JDB and, to some extent,
SSFDP have contributed to financing investments, but part of the substantial
ACB credit appears to have financed non-agricultural expenses and investments.



-6-
Interest rates on agricultural loans range mostly between 4 and 8-3/4% and
are unduly low, even negative, under the present inflationary conditions
(para. 5.i4). The Agricultural Sector Study has recommended the establish-
ment of an agricultural credit bank, but no final decision has yet been made.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE FIRST PROJECT
3.01      The first Agricultural Credit Project, supported by a Bank loan of
US$3.7 million, envisaged a program of on-farm investment of US$8.3 million
and supporting technical assistance. This included coconut farms (US$2.6
million), citrus farms (US$1.6 million), beef ranches (US$2.5 million), and
dairy ranches (US$1.6 million). The Bank loan became effective on June 1,
1971, but commitment and disbursement were slow till the end of 1972 for
such reasons as uncertainties affecting interest in investment in agriculture,
inadequate publicity, and sub-borrowers' del.ays in complying with collateral
requirements. However, thanks to JDB's initiative and steps to publicize
the program and to help sub-borrowers complqte formalities, plus an improve-
ment in the investment climate, the Project gathered momentum in 1973. As
of March 31, 1974, 96 sub-loans totalling J$ 4.95 million (US$5.45 million
equivalent) had been approved; US$3.10 million of the Bank loan had been
committed; and the loan is now expected to be fully committed by the end of
May 1974.
3.02      Disbursements have, however, been slow because of sub-borrowers'
delays in confirming loan acceptance and furnishing collateral and the two-
year phasing of on-farm investments.  With only US$1.62 million of the Bank
loan disbursed as of the end of March 1974, the closing date of the Bank
loan (December 31, 1974) may require a short extension (Annex 4).
3.03      Demand for sub-loans for livestock development, especially beef, has
been stronger than that for crops because of improved milk and beef prices.
Interest in coconut has been particularly limited because a subsidy was avail-
able from the CIB for replacing Jamaica Talls, which are susceptible to the
Lethal Yellowing Disease, with the Malayan Dwarf variety. Accordingly, the
Bank loan proceeds were reallocated to increase the funds for beef (from
US$1.10 million to US$1.60 million) and dairy (from US$0.50 million to US$0.75
million) and reduce the amount for coconut (US$1.20 million to US$0.70 mil-
lion) and for citrus (US$0.70 million to US$0.45 million).
3.04      JDB's Agricultural Department has been strengthened by the appoint-
ment of two well-qualified livestock specialists, an internationally recruited
agricultural economist and five project or assistant project officers. The
Department has evolved suitable procedures for loan appraisal, and loan super-
vision has been generally satisfactory.



- IF - 
3.05      The average size of sub-loans was relatively large (J$ 65,935) in
the first 18 months, as the demand was initially for larger loans and JDB's
staffing and promotional efforts permitted it to reach only a limited clientele
at that stage. The average, however, declined subsequently to J$ 33,000 for
the quarter ended December 31, 1973. The average up to end 1973 is about
J$ 54,000. Further, fewer sub-loans have been made to established-farmers
and more to those entering agriculture than earlier contemplated. Several of
the sub-borrowers' projects combined two or more enterprises. In some cases
in which the sub-borrowers were not residing on the farm, JDB has insisted on
the appointment of an approved resident farm manager. JDB has also found it
necessary to make loans from its own funds for land purchase as a means of
stimulating on-farm development projects. Sub-borrowers generally obtain
80% of the investment cost. Sub-loans are for 10 to 15 years, inclusive of
grace periods of three to seven years and carry interest at 8-3/4%.
3.06      It is too early to assess the impact of the Project, as most loans
were approved in 1973 and are yet to be fully disbursed. In general, farm/
ranch development plans were economically justified and well supervised.
Sub-loans approved up to end 1973 are estimated to generate incremental pro-
duction of 944 tons of beef by 1977, 1.1 million imperial gallons of milk
by 1976, 2,282 tons of copra by 1980 and 644,000 boxes of oranges by 1980.
IV.  THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
4.01      The Project would support a two-year lending program of JDB to
finance (a) on-farm investment for milk, beef, citrus and coconut production
and, to a lesser extent, sheep, goats, mango and avocado, and (b) agro-indus-
trial activities, such as marketing and processing of agricultural produce.
Investment items to be financed would include fertilizers and pastures,
animals, dairy equipment, tractors and farm machinery, fences, corrals, roads
and such. Technical assistance would also be provided. The Project would
help commercial farms increase production so as to reduce the heavy depend-
ence on imports (meat, milk and vegetable oil) and promote exports (citrus),
while meeting the increasing demand for tourist and domestic consumption.
4.02      The Project would be administered by JDB, and loans would be made
to sub-borrowers on the basis of technically and financially evaluated develop-
ment plans. Implementation of these plans would be supervised by JDB technical
staff.
4.03      The following table shows the major on-farm investments expected to
be approved for financing over the two-year commitment period:

/1   Several of these loans are likely to be less than US$15,000 and hence
would probably be made to persons borrowing from JDB for another project
enterprise as well. Only 15 loans are estimated to be exclusively for
financing enterprises of these two categories and are included in the
total number.
B. Detailed Features
Dairy
4.04      Dairy enterprises of about 40 acres participating in the Project
would be located mainly in the western part of the island where rainfall
distribution permits sound dairy development. Each farmer would invest
primarily in land development and pasture improvement through reseeding and
use of fertilizers, fencing, stockwater supply, milking facilities, dairy
equipment, and improved heifers for replacement, mostly to be purchased from
the state-owned Agricultural Development Corporation, which would import some
heifers and rear them up to two years. Farms would also be converted from
dual-purpose operations (beef and milk) to single-purpose milk production
units, rearing only heifer calves and replacing low producing cows with better



ones. Breeding would be through artifical insemination, using mainly Holstein,
Brown Swiss and Jamaica Hope semen. Special attention would be given to pasture
management, cattle health and nutrition and handling of milk. Larger dairy
farms (about 75 acres) would be situated mainly in the drier parishes of St.
Elizabeth, Manchester, Clarendon, and St. Catherine. Farmers would intensify
production by renewing old pastures and establishing new ones and by making
silage for supplementary stockfeeding during the dry season. The farm de-
velopment pattern would be similar to that for the small dairy farm, the
main difference being in pasture management and forage conservation, which
requires more intensive use of machinery (Annex 5).
Beef
4.05      Beef farms under the Project would be located in the south and
southwest parts of the island where the rainfall is too low for dairy develop-
ment and would specialize in producing one- to two-year-old steers weighing
about 660 lb for finishing in other areas where surplus of pasture might be
available. To accomplish this, farmers would introduce seasonal breeding and
marketing of the culled animals and of steers for fattening, so as to reduce
the number of cattle to be fed during the dry season. Supplementary feeding
(hay) and rotation grazing would also be undertaken. The major investments
would he in pasture improvement and breeding stock (Annex 5).
Coats and Sheep
4.06      Organized production of sheep and goats would be developed in the
very dry areas of the south coast, in small- and medium-size units which
would be established mostly alongside other livestock activity such as beef
development. Investment would be mainly in pasture improvement, fencing,
water supply, sheep and goat sheds, and purchase of breeding stock (Annex 5).
As the development of these two enterprises is new and limited in the island,
only a small amount of funds has been provided. However, a larger effort might
be possible later in the light of experience under this Project.
Citrus
4.07      The Project provides for about 48 loans to citrus growers, eight
of them for groves of 100 acres each and 40 for smaller growers having only
50 acres each. Intercropping with bananas in larger groves and pumpkin in
smaller groves is envisaged in the farm models. Though the high demand and
good price for pumpkin make it a particularly attractive catchcrop, pineapple,
plantains or papaya may be substituted where convenient. The investment
outlav includes expenditure on land preparation, planting materials, machinery
and equipment, fertilizers and pesticides, and operating costs for machinery
and labor (Annex 5).



- 10 -
Coccnut
4.08      Some 12 sub-loans are contemplated to enable farmers with holdings
of about 100 acres each to plant the Malayan Dwarf coconut. Existing coconut
farmers, whose plantings have been decimated by the Lethal Yellowing Disease,
receive CIB's financial support (para 3.03), but no similar assistance is
available to farmers entering the industry. As under the first Project,
bananas would be used as a catcherop during the first six years, but gradually
removed from the third year onwards. The investment expenditure would include
outlays on land preparation, planting materials, machinery and equipment,
fertilizers and pesticides, and operating costs for machinery and labor
(Annex 5).
Mango and Avocado
4.09      A small allocation has been made for about 30 loans for development
of groves of 20 to 30 acres of mango and avocado in response to the strong
interest expressed by the Ministry of Agriculture and JDB. AMC has indicated
that supply of mangoes falls short of demand, and this is particularly true
of the large, colorful fruit required for the tourist trade. The present
production of avocado, coming mainly from seeding trees in mixed tree crop
cultivation and based on normal yields, is also barely sufficient to meet
domestic demand and supply the promising export market. Since Jamaica has
little experience in commercial avocado production, and "root rot" is preva-
lent in poorly drained soils, growing areas have to be carefully selected.
Variety selection and better production practices are also necessary improve-
ments for both these crops and would be stimulated by the availability of
loans and the technical assistance for which provision has been made (para
4.11 and Annex 5).
A ro-industries
4.10      Under this category, activities such as marketing, processing and
transportation of crops and livestock products and manufacture of agricultural
production requisites such as concentrate feeds for livestock would be eligible
for financing. It is especially in the livestock sector that financing would
be needed, as existing facilities for slaughtering animals and for collecting,
chilling and pasteurizing milk may not prove adequate in volume or quality
in the context of the production likely to result from the credit projects
of the Bank and the IDB. The Government of Jamaica is interested in develop-
ing such activities and several proposals are being considered. Loan requests
to JT1B would be carefully scrutinized with respect to technical and economic
feasibility as well as in regard to size, quality and location of existing
facilities, since, in some instances, existing capacity exceeds need. (para
2.13). A part of the Bank loan allocation under this category (US$200,000)
is earmarked for cooperatives, so as to enable producers to own such facilities
and thus ensure remunerative marketing of their produce. Further, under this



- 1 1 -
category, a sum of US$100,000 would be available for making sub-loans to
contractors who would provide tractor services for meeting the land prepara-
tion requirements of (a) the land-lease program for small farmers (para 2.09),
and (b) some Project sub-borrowers whose work cannot be done economically by
manual labor.
Technical Assistance
4.11      The Project would, in addition, cover the foreign exchange costs
of technical assistance for (a), the continuation of the services of an inter-
nationally recruited agricultural economist for two more years (para 5.06);
(b) the deputation of JDB technicians overseas for training in livestock
development, with emphasis on sheep and goats, and tree crops, including, in
particular, mango and avocado (para. 5.09); and (c) consultant services for
technical studies required for the formulation of a Sugar Industry Rehabili-
tation Project, a likely candidate for Bank financing (para. 2.06). As the
expenditure on the consultant services would be incurred before the proposed
loan is likely to be signed, retroactive financing would be permitted up to
US$120,000 on this account.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Cost Estimates
4.12      The total cost of the Project is estimated at J$ 9.8 million (US$10.8
million), of which 51%, or J$5.0 million (US$5.5 million), would be foreign
exchange. Estimated Project costs, including an allowance of about 20% for
price increases, are summarized below:

A list of investment items which would be involved appears in Annex 6.
Financing
4.13      The Bank loan would finance US$5.5 million, or 51% of the total
Project cost which represents the foreign exchange component. JDB would
contribute about US$3.5 million, or 32%, while sub-borrowers would contribute
US$1.8 million, or 17%.  Financing of the Project components would be shared
as follows:

technical assistance.
/2 JDB to provide 90% of Project cost in respect to sub-loans of less than
J$ 35,000 and 80% for all other sub-loans.
4.14      JDB would be the borrower.  Sub-loans would be denominated in US
dollars. The Government of Jamaica would guarantee the loan and bear the
residual foreign exchange risk. An assurance to this effect was obtained
at negotiations. The Bank loan would be at the standard interest rate and
be repayable over 16 years, including four years of grace. With sub-loans
being made over a two-year period, they would be almost fully repaid within
16 years after the commencement of the Project (Annex 7).
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
4.15      The items to be financed for on-farm investment are varied and would
be purchased by sub-borrowers over three years.  They would, therefore, not be
suitable for bulk procurement through international competitive bidding but
instead would be obtained through existing commercial channels.   Imported
goods are obtained mostly from the British commonwealth countries, EEC, and
USA and a number of suppliers are represented locally, prices are competi-
tive and after-sales services satisfactory. Licenses required for importing
agricultural machinery are usually granted by Government, though often delayed,
and all such equipment is exempt from import duty, except for irrigation pumps
(15%) and pipes under 2" in diameter (22%).



- 14 -
4.16      The agro-industrial units to be financed would vary in size,
capacity, nature, and number of units and time of construction. Further,
their timing cannot be forecast. The grouping of contracts would, therefore,
not be practicable and individual contracts would not be expected to attract
a wide response through international competitive bidding. Assurances were,
therefore, obtained that (a) JDB would ensure that awards for construction
and machinery would be made by sub-borrowers only after quotations had been
obtained from at least three suppliers; (b) tender notices for machinery
costing US$150,000 or more would be published locally and submitted to all
representatives in Jamaica of countries who are members of the Bank and are
likely to be interested; (c) bidding documents would permit quoting on the
basis of a single contract for the complete works or for individual contracts
fo'r civil works or equipment; and (d) all contracts for US$150,000 or more
would require prior Bank approval.
Disbursement
4.17      Bank Loan disbursement would take about three and a half years
(Annex 8). Disbursement would be made, agaipst a certificate of expendi-
ture, for 60% of all sub-loans disbursed by JDB and the actual foreign
exchange expenditure incurred by JDB for technical assistance. The docu-
mentation for such expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank for
review, but would be retained by JDB and made available for inspection by
the Bank. Retroactive financing would be permitted up to US$120,000 for
expenditures incurred after October 1, 1973 on technical assistance relating
to the Sugar Industry Rehabilitation Project (Para 4.11) and for disbursements
after May 1, 1074 for on-farm investment up'to US$250,000 (para 5.17).
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      JDB was established under the Jamaica Development Bank Act of 1969
to provide development finance as a successor institution to the Development
Finance Corporation, which had been handicapped by its limited funds and
had not financed agriculture.  Thanks to capital contributions from Government
and the Central Bank, external assistance and efficient management, JDB has
shown progress, as illustrated by the increase in the number of new loan
approvals for tourism, industry and agriculture--from 50 in 1970 to 123 in
1972--and in their total value--from J$5.2 million to J$9.8 million. JDB's
role in agricultural lending commenced mainly with the first Bank Project.
Capital
5.02      JDB's authorized capital, which had been J$10 million initially,
was raised to J$20 million in 1973. Its paid-up capital was increased from
J$4.5 million at the end of 1969 to J$ 12.92 million as of December 31, 1973,
made up of J$7.75 million contributed by Government and the balance by the
Bank of Jamaica. In addition, JDB has borrowed J$4.2 million from Government
and a total of J$8.5 million from Barclay's International, IDB, Export-Import



- 15 -
Bank, CIDA and the Bank. JDB has not so far floated bonds or debentures
though statutorily permitted to do so.  JDB has sought additional equity
from Government, and Government is reviewing its requirements on the basis
of cash flow projections. Assurances were obtained from Government that
it would arrange for the JDB to be provided with sufficient funds for its
lending program under the Project; and specifically that it would provide
at least J$ 1.8 million to JDB by way of equity/loan and on terms and con-
ditions satisfactory to the Bank, within 12 months of signing the guarantee
agreement.
Financial Position
5.03      The balance sheet and profit and loss statements of JDB (Annex 9,
Table 1) show an all-round increase in its 'ssets, liabilities and operations.
As of September 30, 1973, the arrears for 30) days or over, excluding those
in respect of subsidiary companies (para 5.04), amounted to J$0.36 million,
as compared with its loan portfolio of J$22.7 million.
5.04      JDB inherited from the Development Finance Corporation two wholly
owned subsidiaries whose working had been causing concern. One of these
is the Jamaica Ceramics, whose liquidation has been completed and the
balance of whose property is expected to be sold at a price which would
cover the outstanding liability of J$0.6 million owing to JDB. The other
is the Hotel Corporation of Jamaica (HCJ), in which JDB's investment is
about J$5.0 million. This includes HCJ shares revalued, on JDB's establish-
ment, at about J$1.25 million on the basis of replacement costs, despite its
poor earning prospects, the surplus being credited to JDB's capital reserve.
As JDB's involvement in HCJ is excessive for a single enterprise and the
state of this account is unsatisfactory, it is important that HCJ is taken
off JDB's books or that JDB's exposure is otherwise reduced. A subsidiary of
the Government owned Urban Development Corporation, known as the National Hotel
and Properties Limited, proposes to take over the HCJ and is, therefore, now
reviewing its property. Though the Jamaica Hilton hotel, HCJ's sole asset,
is said to be showing some improvement in occupancy rate and earnings and
JDB anticipates no loss on its investment, it is very doubtful if JDB will
recover, in full, the book value of HCJ's equity. As these matters affect
JDB's financial position and have been long outstanding, assurances were
obtained that, by December 31, 1974, action for winding up Jamaica Ceramics
would be completed and that JDB would take all necessary steps to sell its
property. Assurances were also obtained that JDB would divest itself of
its financial interest in HCJ by December 31, 1974 for a compensation not
less than its cash outlay for its original equity holding in HCJ and the
total outstanding loans due to it from HCJ and that Government would take
steps to ensure that this covenant is fulfilled.
5.05      Between 1970 and 1973, while JDB's loan portfolio was more than
trebled, its net income from lending operations (excluding provision for
losses) increased from J$84,000 to J$586,000 despite the increase in its
administrative expenses from J$476,000 to J$822,000. The special reserve
and the reserve against losses were together adequate to cover the JDB's
irrecoverable debts, estimated at about J$0.8 million.



- 16 -
5.06      JDB-'s Board of Management, nominated by the Minister of Finance,
consists of 11 members, including the chairman and the representatives of
the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. The chief executive is the
Chairman-cum-Managing Director, who is an experienced commercial banker.
The bank's staff totals 75, including 26 professional and technical personnel.
Its organizational structure is shown in Annex 9. The Agricultural Depart-
ment is headed by a manager recruited earlier with the Bank's approval as a
livestock specialist and includes an agricultural economist recruited through
FAO and a local candidate recently appointed to understudy him. Assurances
were obtained that JDB would continue to employ a qualified and experienced
agricultural economist recruited for a period and on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank and a suitable understudy who would take over from
him at a time to be agreed with the Bank.
5,07      Other staff of the Agricultural Department consists of a livestock
specialist, two project officers and three assistant project officers.  One
of the project officers is at present dealing with the SSFDP work, for which
separate staff is also being recruited. In view of JDB's new responsibility
for the SSFDP and the appraisal and supervision work involved in the on-going
and proposed Bank Projects, assurances were obtained that no staff of the '
Agricultural Department, other than the manager, the agricultural economist
and the livestock specialist, would be assigned any SSFDP responsibilities.
Assurances were also obtained that JDB would appoint two more assistant
project officers, one as a condition of loan effectiveness and the other
by December 31, 1974.
5.08      With the expanding volume and geographical coverage of JDB's agri-
cultural lending, it is desirable that one or two members of its professional
staff be located outside Kingston, say, at Montego Bay. Assurances were
obtained that JDB would review the problem and consult from time to time
with the Bank during the period of disbursement of the Bank loan.
5.09      Only limited experience and technical knowledge are available within
Jamaica in respect to development of goats and sheep and mango and avocado.
Provision has, therefore, been made for overseas training in these fields
of suitable JDB staff. Assurances were obtained that particulars of such
training and names of the candidates would be submitted to the Bank for its
prior approval.
Lending_Policies and Procedures
5.10      JDB staff would help applicants prepare farm development plans,
would appraise sub-projects with reference to their technical feasibility and
financial viability, and would supervise all sub-loans. Any sub-loan which,
by itself or together with an earlier sub-loan to the same sub-borrower under
the first agricultural credit project or the proposed second project, exceeded
US$150,000 and every sub-loan for agro-industries would require prior Bank
approval.



- 17 -
5.11      Lorng-term loans are available from the IDB-financed SSFDP for live-
stock and crop development, to farmers with holdings of 5 to 25 acres, for amounts
up to JS$ 15,000. To bridge the gap between this ceiling and the minimum sub-
loan offered by JDB at present, assurances were obtained that the lower limit
of JDB loans would be reduced from J$ 20,000 to J$ 15,000. Further, in view
of the scope under the proposed Project for ensuring a larger proportion of
s mall sub-loans, especially for citrus and dairy, (para 4.03), than was
achieved under the first project, and the need to encourage JDB to move
towards smaller sub-loans, assurances were also obtained that at least one-
third of the sub-loans approved by JDB under the proposed Project during
each 12-month period would be for J$35,000 or less. Further, a contribution
o f only 10% of the Project cost would be required from a sub-borrower, if
the sub-loan, together with any earlier sub-loan to him, is for J$35,000,
compared with 20% for larger loans.
5.12      Mortgage on land would normally provide the security for sub-loans,
supplemented by bills of sale on livestock, machinery or equipment, personal
guarantees and life insurance policies. Generally, loan applicants have
been able to meet JDB's collateral requirements, but they have often delayed
the submission of relevant documents, especially where a common law title had
to be converted into a regular title. JDB is helping its clients in completing
these formalities expeditiously.
5.13      Cash flows of investments proposed under the Project, as indicated
in the farm models (Annex 10), show that total repayment periods not exceeding
15 years (including grace periods up to seven years) would be appropriate for
sub-loans for different types of investment.
5.14      The rate of interest charged on sub-loans under the first Agricul-
tural Credit Project is 8-3/4%, apart from a commitment charge of 1/2% on
undrawn balances and an evaluation fee of 1/2% paid prior to the first dis-
bursement; sub-borrowers also incur other incidental expenses such as stamp
duty, registration fee and evaluation fee for the security.  This on-lending
rate was reviewed for the proposed second Project in view of the inflationary
trend in the Jamaican economy. In the 12 months ended December 1973, prices
increased by an average of about 19% over the previous year.  Till recently,
the rates of commercial banks for loans (mostly short term) ranged from the
prime rate of 9% to 12%, while the maximum rates paid were 7.5 to 8.5% on
deposits for six to 12 months. The rate of interest charged under the
S5FDP for medium-term loans is 4% and that for short-term loans is 6%, which
is also the rate for ACB loans. Government announced, in January 1974,
various fiscal and monetary measures to check inflation, including an in-
crease in the Bank Rate from 7% to 9% and the corresponding rise in banks'
prime lending rate from 9% to 11%. Government is also considering increas-
ing the interest rate from 8% to 10% on term loans advanced by commercial
banks for agricultural purposes with the guarantee of the Government under
the Farm Loans Act. Assurances were obtained that all sub-loans would be
denominated in US dollars and a rate of interest of 10% would be charged
on sub-loans under the Project.  These arrangements would result in an
increase In the effective interest rate on sub-loans to the extent that
"I



- 18 -
continuing deomestic inflation is reflected in an adjustment of the exchange
rate between the Jamaican dollar and the US dollar.  Government would receive
a fee of 1/2% per annum from JDB for covering the potential foreign exchange
risk to JDB arising from possible fluctuations in the exchange rate between
the Jamaican dollar and currencies other than the US dollar.
5.15      The lending terms and conditions are set out in detail in Schedule
A and assurances were obtained during negotiations that they would be observed.
5.16      As the funds available under the first Project are likely to be
fully committed before the proposed second Bank loan is signed, JDB has re-
quested retroactive financing of sub-loans that it would grant in the interim.
Though a few sub-loans may be made before the second Bank loan is signed,
only a small amount could be disbursed against them in that time. Reimburse-
ment from the second loan would, therefore, be permitted up to US$250,000 in
respect of disbursements made before the date of signing the loan, provided
that the sub-loans have been made on the terms and conditions specified in
Schedule A.
Aecounts and Auditing
5.17      JDB would continue to maintain separate accounts of Project opera-
tions. The Jamaica Development Bank Act requires that JDB's accounts be
audited annually by auditors approved by the Minister of Finance, and, in
addition, the Auditor-General is entitled to examine the accounts, if so
directed by the Minister. JDB's accounts have also been audited annually
by the Jamaican office of Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co. since its es-
tablishment. Assurances were obtained that JDB's accounts would continue
to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, that the audited
accounts and auditors' reports would be sent to the Bank within four months
of the end of JDB's fiscal year, and that JDB would maintain separate accounts
of Project operations.
Coordinating Committee
5.18      Under the first Project Government agreed to maintain a Coordinating
Committee consisting of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture
and one senior official from the Ministry oi Finance for reviewing Government
programs for agriculture so as to ensure that agricultural credit plans are
coordinated within the context of Government policies and priorities. The
Committee held several meetings during 1971 and 1972 but did not meet at all
during 1973. Assurances were obtained from Government that the Coordinat-
ing Committee would meet at least once a quarter during the period of sub-
loan disbursement under the proposed project.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
A. Production
6.01      Under the Project, improved pasture would be planted on about 10,000
acres, which would help expand the livestock industry, while reducing depen-
dence on animal feed imports. The dairy farms to be financed are estimated



- 19 -
to account, at full development, for an incremental annual production of 4.7
million imperial quarts of milk. An increment of 310 metric tons of carcass
meat equivalent, including 1,700 feeder steers would also be produced, in
addition to about 1,200 improved breeding hbifers, which would be sold to
local farmers to upgrade their stock. The Xncremental value of annual pro-
duction would be about US$1.23 million for riilk and US$0.90 million for beef,
including live animals for fattening and breeding heifers for replacement.
The additional production of crops would include (a) 450,000 boxes each of
oranges and grapefruit, valued together at about US$1.3 million, and (b) about
1,440 tons of copra valued at about US$0.24 million. Additional production
would also result from sub-loans for sheep, goats, mango and avocado though
it is difficult to estimate the quantity. The incremental production of
beef, milk, copra and most of the oranges would meet the growing tourist and
domestic demand and help reduce significantly the present imports of meat and
meat products (US$18 million), milk products (US$10 million), and vegetable
fats and oils (US$4 million).
B. Marketing
Milk
6.02      Jamaica's domestic milk industry accounts for only about a quarter
of the national consumption and has bright prospects, which have improved
following two price increases granted by Government in 1972/73. Neverthe-
less, its expansion has been limited because of the unsatisfactory and un-
economic marketing structure. A private condensary established in 1960 to
reconstitute imported skim milk powder and produce canned condensed milk
is obliged to accept and collect all fluid milk offered to it at prices
fixed by Government. While making a profit on cheaper imported dry milk, the
condensary drives about one truck mile for every imperial quart of fresh milk
purchased and now collects about a sixth of the country's milk production
from farmers who are so located or so small that they cannot interest the
other plants or sell to consumers direct. With increasing demand for fluid
milk and the establishment of four new pasteurizing plants, the bulk of the
fresh milk now goes to them and to the raw milk market, both of which pay
better prices (about J$20 cents per imperial quart) than to the condensary
(average of J$13.6 cents). It is in relation to this market that there is
a need to improve and augment arrangements for transporting, chilling and
pasteurizing fresh milk, taking into account the emerging pattern of milk
production and the capacity of existing pasteurization plants. Such im-
proved arrangements would require to be accompanied by efforts for raising
the productivity of the livestock industry. The Government intends shortly
to adopt a milk policy covering regulation of the marketing of all fresh
or processed milk and gradual prohibition of unpasteurized milk sales. The
provision in the Project for agro-industries would help finance proposals
for rationalizing the existing collection and transport system for milk and
expanding and modernizing the milk processing facilities, organizing them,
preferably, through cooperatives or other producer organizations.



- 20 -
Beef
6.03      Demand for local beef has been growing and is expected to increase
at 3% annually in the coming 15 years. The expanding needs have been met
mainly by increasing imports until domestic production can catch up. Larger
production calls for an improvement of the marketing structure dominated
at present by dealers and butchers. While 40,000 animals are slaughtered
through butchers in small abattoirs and on farms, about 16,000 are handled by
the two main slaughterhouses--the municipal one at Kingston and the other owned
by a mining company at Ocho Rios. The slaughterhouse at Kingston does not
satisfy the hygienic standards required by the tourist industry and is wasteful
as it lacks offal processing facilities. This does not affect marketing in
the short run as beef is in short supply, but it would handicap the development
of the industry. Hence, under the first Agricultural Credit Project, Government
agreed to take steps to facilitate the availability of additional slaughter-
house facilities for the beef production resulting from the Project. Various
proposals have been considered so far by JDB and Government, including one
based on a 1970 feasibility study covering a modern enlarged abattoir, a
feedlot and a meat packing complex, and another proposed by some United
Stateg investors to establish, jointly with the Government of Jamaica, a beef
cattle farm-cum-slaughterhouse complex. Currently, the idea of establishing
two or three small units in different parts of the island is being preferred
to that of a single large unit in Kingston. Specific proposals on these
lines recommended by a team of consultants appointed by Government with appro-
priate terms of reference are now under consideration by Government.  Assurances
were obtained from Government that it would send to the Bank, by December 31,
1974 its decisions on the proposals regarding improvements to, and expansion
of, slaughter house facilities in Jamaica, together with a time-table for im-
plementirng the proposals and an indication of prospective sources of financing.
6.04      Government controls on beef prices have been in operation since 1940,
except for two brief intervals of decontrol. Since April 1973, most beef cuts
have been decontrolled and, as a result, prices have gone up--for 100 lb of
liveweight, from J$20 to J$30 for ordinary culled animals and from J$30 to
J$37.50 for feedlot cattle. Butchers manage to produce as little as 10 to 20%
of the cuts under control (stew and soup), though these cuts are supposed to
account for 50% of the meat produced per head. In any case, price and quality
controls are difficult to enforce as there are over 1,000 registered butchers
and many unregistered ones. Beef prices continue to be attractive and account
for the wide interest in this enterprise.
Citrus and Other Fruits
6.05      As a result of the growing demand for fresh fruit, the price of
oranges in the tourist and domestic hIarkets is about J$1.90 per box, as
compared with J$1.20 paid by the Citrus Growers' Association (CGA) for
fruit for processing and export. Therefore, there has been a reduction in
the supply of fruit to CGA and other processing plants and the exports have
been declining and accounted for less than one-half of the country's citrus
production. Exports of fresh grapefruit, however, are lucrative in the tradi-
tional European market in August and September when it is not well supplied
with this fruit from other sources, and the ortanique (a successful hybrid



- 21 -
of the orange and the tangerine, now grown only in Jamaica) has attracted
high prices in a promising export market. Because of the natural protection
of oranges during handling and storage, the existing arrangements for domestic
marketing--sales to consumers through higglers and retailers and direct sales
to hotels and supermarkets--have been adequate, though unsophisticated. The
production of mangoes and avocadoes in the near future is likely to continue
to fall short of the demand represented by the growing domestic market and
limited export enquiries.
Coconut
6,06      The domestic demand for copra is firm and growing, Jamaica having
become a net importer of copra and coconut oil. Exports of frozen coconuts
and seed coconuts are also increasing. Farmers' returns improve when coconuts
are sold as copra and the number of copra-drying factories (half of them
owned by growers) is increasing and can be assumed to be adequate. CIB is
required by law to buy all coconuts and copra produced and pays transport
allowances, which make its price, in effect, a guaranteed farmgate price. To
promote interest in planting new orchards, CIB increased the price it paid
for a unit 1/ of coconuts from J$2.25 to J$3.00 and for a short ton of copra
(grade 1), from J$136.40 to J$180.80, between 1967-70 and 1973.
C. Producer Benefits
6.07      On the basis of investment costs, yields and price assumptions set
out in the farm models (Annex 10), farm incomes after debt service are estimated
as follows:
1/   Approximately 50 Units of coconuts produce 1 short ton of copra.

the best estimate. Any larger increases in costs than those assumed below
would probably be accompanied by at least equal increases in sales receipts
and hence should not adversely affect the profitability of the investments.

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The proposed second Project would continue the impetus given by
the first Project to the development of commercial farming and use of idle
land in Jamaica through supply of long-term credit on the basis of farm/ranch
developmental plans and technical guidance from JDB staff. By supporting
enterprises which help meet the growing demand for domestic consumption, the
Project sub-loans would help Jamaican agriculture recover from its recent
stagnation and also bring about a general improvement in production techniques
through demonstration affects. The increased production should improve the
country's balance of payments through import substitution (milk, beef, and
coconut oil) and export earnings (citrus). The sub-loans for agro-industries
should help expand and improve facilities for marketing and processing,
especially in the livestock sector.
7.02      The first  Project has helped JDB pioneer successfully in project-
type term lending for agricultural investment, which is reflected in the
decision of Government to entrust to it the management of the IDB-financed
SSFDP. The second Project carries this further, with provision for overseas
training of JDB technicians, with special emphasis on sheep, goats, avocado
and mangoes, fields in which Jamaica lacks expertise. The Project would
also help promote cooperatives to provide marketing and other facilities to
farmers, a matter of keen interest to Government.
7.03      The Project would also contribute, in a limited degree, to the fuller
employment of family labor on livestock farms and of paid labor fcr harvesting,
land clearing and other operations. Agro-industrial units to be financed
under the Project and ancillary services and facilities required for handling
the additional production arising from the Project should also augment employ-
ment opportunities.
7.04      The economic rate of return of the Project is estimated at 26%
(Annex 11).
VIII. AGREEMENT REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(i)   Government to arrange for JDB to be provided with
sufficient funds for its lending program under the
Project (para. 5.02);
(ii)   Action to be taken by JDB, by 31 December 1974, to
divest itself of its financial interest in HCJ
(para. 5.04);



- 24 -
(iii) JDB continuing to employ a qualified and experienced
agricultural economist (para. 5.06);
(iv) appointment of two additional assistant project
officers (para. 5.07);
(v) ensuring that at least one-third of the sub-loans
during each 12-month period would be of J$35,000 or
less (para. 5.11); and
(vi) the denomination of sub-loans in US dollars and
charging an interest rate of 102 (para. 5.14).
8.02      The condition of loan effectiveness would be that JDB had appointed
an additional assistant project officer.
8.03      With the foregoing assurances, the proposed Project is suitable for
a Bank loan to the Jamaica Development Bank of US$5.5 million for a term of
16 years, including a four-year grace period.

JAMAICA
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
General
Together with other Caribbean islands, Jamaica shares a tropical
climate.  Rainfall varies from 140 in. of well distributed rain in the north-
ea;t to less than 50 in. of seasonal rain in the south.
2.        Soils are generally fertile, with hills of limestone and shale
occurring inland. Of Jamaica's 2.8 million acres, some 53% (1.5 million) are
considered to be suitable for agriculture. The best lands are on the coastal
plains and are organized into fairly large commercial farms. On the other
hand, most subsistence farming takes place in the hills.
3.        According to the 1968/69 Agricultural Census, the area cultivated
was of some 740,000 acres (see below).
Cultivated:
Pure stand crops                          357,412 acres
Mixed stand crops                         200,478 acres
Food forest                                23,490 acres
Improved grassland                        159,537 acres
Sub-total                            740,917 acres (49.7%)
Used but not Cultivated:
Natural grassland                         161,920 acres
Fallow                                     34,377 acres
Ruinate 1/                                 221,613 acres
Sub-total                            417,910 acres (28.1%)
Woodland and Other:
Woodland                                  200,652 acres
Other land                                129,709 acres
Sub-total                            330,361 acres (22.2%)
Total Land in Farms:               1,489,188 acres (100%)
1/   "Ruinate" is land that has been cultivated at least once before but is,
at present, covered by weeds and scrub with probably a few low trees but
not dense woodland. (Extremely rocky land or steep land of no agri-
cultural value is not considered ruinate.)



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Use of Cultivated Land
4.        As shown in the preceding table, about half of the land in farms
is cultivated.  The main crops in each category are as follows:
Sugarcane                           157,386 acres    44.0%
Citrus                               18,188 acres      5.1%
Yams                                 25,851 acres      7.2%
Bananas                              41,447 acres    11.6%
Fresh potatoes                        1,920 acres      0.5%
Coconuts                             39,291 acres    11.0%
Cocoa                                 7,419 acres      2.1%
Coffee                                7,003 acres      2.0%
Other                                58_907 acres    16.5%
Total Pure Stand Crops:        357i4l2 acres   100.0%
5.        Unfortunately, no information is available on crops in mixed stand,
which account for about 200,000 acres and are defined to include "... all
herbaceous crops (tubers, pulses, etc.) or tree crops interplanted or mixed."
For example, coconut is interplanted with sugarcane and, citrus with banana.
The exclusion of these figures makes production and productivity data only
rough estimates. Food forest, as defined by the census, covers "... the
cases where a canopy of tall economic trees existed (bread fruit, star-apples,
mango, avocado, pear, etc.), in association with or without a lower canopy
of cocoa, citrus, coffee and other small trees and shrubs." Scattered tree
crops are not included.
6.        Finally, cultivated and improved pastures accounted for some 160,000
acres. Together with natural pastures and fallow lands, they provide an
area of some 356,000 acres of pastures for Jamaica's livestock industry. To
these, the 222,000 acres in ruinate should be added as they are used for
seasonal grazing.
Agricultural and Livestock Production
7.        The recent performance of agriculture in Jamaica reflects a decline
in the growth rate from about 3% in the 1950s to about 1.3% in the 1960s.
However, there has been an appreciable recovery in 1971 and 1972. This
improvement has been mainly concentrated in domestic food crops, while
stagnation has continued in the rest of the sector (Table 1). Production
of sugar and bananas, the main agricultural exports, has declined so
that Jamaica falls considerably short of meeting quotas in preferential
markets in the United Kingdom (sugar and bananas) and the U.S. (sugar).
Output of domestic food crops is rising more slowly than population growth,
and imports of foodstuffs--cereals, meat, dairy products, edible oils and
fish--are increasing (Table 2). Performance in the livestock sector,
particularly the poultry and swine industries, has been more satisfactory,



ANNEX 1
Page 3
but these enterprises are based largely on high cost imported foodstuffs,
which are an increasing constraint. The contribution of agriculture to GDP
declined from 17% in 1952 to 8% in 1970, but rose to 9% in the following
two years.
8.        Crop yields are very low and far below their potentials.  In
particular, sugar produced per acre has fallen 15% since 1968. Banana yields
per acre are only two-thirds of what can be achieved with techniques already
available in the island. Where production of domestic food crops has in-
crgased, as, for example, yams and potatoes, expansion of area has been the
main factor. Productivity on livestock enterprises is also low, even though
potential is high (Annex 5). Jamaica meets about 70% of its requirements of
meat and could become self-sufficient in a relatively short time. For milk
production also, the situation is one of low productivity and low production.
Jamaica meets at present only some 25% of its needs in this area (Annex 5),
and the demand for dairy products is continuously on the increase.
9.        The total value of food imports grew steadily from J$ 45.8 million
in 1967 to J$ 86.4 million in 1972, of which cereals accounted for J$ 30.0
million. Rice imports increased moderately in 1972 while those of flour showed
a marked decline. In the vegetable group, there was a large increase in the
imports of pulses while those of potatoes were well below the 1970 level.
In the fresh meat group, the increases in imports of beef and mutton were
more than compensated for by the decreases in poultry and other meat. The
increase in imports of corned beef, codfish, dry milk and cream is particularly
noticeable. Butter and cheese imports, however, showed substantial declines.
Exports
10.       Exports of agricultural produce are dominated by sugar and banana,
which have traditionally accounted for about three quarters of the total.
Neither of them increased in the 1968-72 period, as the following table
illustrates:
Sugar     Banana      Cocoa Beans /1   Coffee /2   Ginger       Pimento

1969       302         151          3,187          1,036         614        7,225

/1   Excludes exports of cocoa products, which have also grown rapidly.
7T   Excludes exports of coffee products, which show a similar trend.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
11.       Nevertheless, in 1972, better prices for most agricultural products
exported from Jamaica resulted in a substantial improvement in the value of
exports (Table 3). The agricultural balance of payments, however, still
showed a deficit of some J$ 10 million. The set-back in sugar exports reflects
the impact of drought and shortage of agricultural labor on the production of
cane and of other problems of the industry such as obsolete machinery and
management difficulties. Banana exports also have been on the decline, mainly
for reasons of quality control.
Land Tenure
12.       There are in Jamaica 193,359 farms with a total acreage of 1,489,188,
but distribution of land is extremely uneven (Annex 2). In 1969, less than
300 farms (0.1%) had some 644,000 acres, or 43% of total agricultural land,
while 152,000 farmers (about 78% of them) had only 15% of the total.
Employment
13.       Even though agriculture contributes only 9% of Gross Domestic
Product, farm employment accounts for about 30% of Jamaica's labor force.
Migration from farms is faster than the rate at which the rest of the economy
can absorb newcomers, and unemployment is high (12-14%). Nevertheless, labor
is scarce at harvest time, the workers being paid low salaries, with no
security of job tenure and usually living under difficult conditions. This
situation has prevailed a long time in Jamaican agriculture and additional
problems have resulted from the stigma attached to manual work in traditional
crops (sugar, coconuts and bananas).
Development Strategy
14.       The previous Government had set foi,th goals for agricultural and
rural development in the Second Five-Year Plan (1970-75). Broadly, the Plan
proposed to: (a) produce locally as much of the food requirements and raw
materials as is economically sound, with special emphasis on the production
of high protein foods (pulses, vegetables, etc.) for improving nutritional
standards; (b) produce for export those commodities which have a ready market
overseas, such as sugar, bananas, citrus, cocoa, coffee and pimento; (c)
establish favorable and efficient marketing end processing arrangements for
agricultural commodities, price incentives for producers and a sound land
utilization and land ownership policy; and (d) ensure that farmers and workers
reap their due share of the improved living standards which the country as a
whole enjoys. Though the Plan subordinated goals such as land distribution
or widespread access to the use of land to the objectives of increased pro-
duction and assigned only a relatively unimportant role to producer organi-
zations and cooperatives, these aspects of agricultural development are
receiving the attention of the present Government as part of the review of
programs and policies which has followed the Agricultural Sector Study.
Another aspect of official policy, now being reviewed, concerns heavy govern-
ment subsidies for agriculture (including those for fertilizers and animal
feeds), which amounted to J$ 3.5 million in-1971/72.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
Ag&icultural Cooperatives
15.       There are relatively few agricultural cooperatives in Jamaica and
even fewer successful ones. The most important group (20) is organized
around collecting and marketing of coffee and the boxing of bananas, though
a few other cooperatives also exist such as those for irrigation, cattle
insurance and cooperative farming. The Christiana Potato Growers' Cooperative,
which has business of some J$1 million and serves some 4,000 members, is an
outstanding example that illustrates the potnntial for cooperative development
in the country. Apart from a few such instances, however, the record of
cooperatives so far has been hardly impressive. The reasons cited to explain
their relative lack of success include the multiplicity of promotional bodies
with only nominal budgets and without any coordination among themselves; the
passive indifference of the sources of finance, both in and out of Government;
and the lack of technical support, education and training of managers. Peo-
ple's Cooperative Banks, which are engaged itn the provision of rural credit,
have also remained non-viable and weak institutions burdened with overdues
(Annex 3). In summary, the lack of a development policy for cooperatives
in the agricultural sector has resulted in disappointing performance and has
deprived development agencies of a valuable tool for achieving their goals.
Recently, however, the Government has declared its intention to review the
role of cooperatives in the global agricultural strategy, but no action has
yet been taken.
Marketing
16.       The structure of agricultural marketing in Jamaica can be broadly
divided into two sectors: a market for primary products oriented to exports
and a market for catering to domestic consumption needs, also including
export crops when used for internal consumption. The export market is
organized mainly through statutory boards, one for each crop, such as the
Coconut Industry Board and the Banana Board, or associations of producers,
such as the Citrus Growers' Association and the Sugar Manufacturers' Associa-
tion. The domestic market is divided between the Parish Council Markets,
which are manned through the "higgler" system, 1/ and the Agricultural Marketing
Corporation (AMC).
17.       Parish Council Markets serve in three basic ways:  (i) as retail
outlets; (ii) as transfer markets; and (iii) as wholesale retailers, the first
being the most important. Most root crops and a large percentage of fruits
and vegetables are channelled through these markets and they also play a
significant role in the distribution of fresh pork, beef and fish. Physical
facilities are inadequate, and overcrowding, wastage and insanitary conditions
prevail.
1/   In Jamaica, a "higgler" is a person who buys and sells domestic food
crops. Although the majority of them are women, many men also operate
in the system. The institution started from the days of slavery when
the surplus food produced by slaves was bought by itinerant freemen who
travelled in wagons from the towns to plantations. Today, higglers
travel in trucks, buy at the farmgate (and occasionally reap the produce
by themselves), and sell at the Parish Council Markets. An estimated
20,000 higglers were supposed to be in operation in 1973, marketing some
70% of domestic crops.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
18.       The AMC is a Government agency which has operated since 1964 to
market domestic crops and the produce of some fruit trees on a wholesale as
well as a retail basis, functioning also as the sole importer of foodstuffs
for domestic consumption. AMC has additionally undertaken some exports of
surplus crops, including, principally, the trish potato 1/. AMC has not been
very successful and is considered only a peripheral supplier of local agri-
cultural produce. As a retailer, however, it has enjoyed a measure of
success, serving mainly medium and high income groups and achieving an indirect
and limited regulation of prices by operating in direct competition with
supermarkets.
19,       In summary, marketing of agricultural and livestock produce in
Jamaica is not efficient or organized to be sufficiently remunerative to
producers, particularly in the case of livestock and domestic food crops.
The marketing of commodities to be financed under the Project is analyzed
in detail in Annex 5.
Processing
20.       Apart from the sugar industry, which is a special case by itself,
existing agro-industries in Jamaica represent mainly transport, processing
and other related facilities for food products, be they locally produced or
imported. Except for milling facilities for animal feed, these units are
concerned with the processing of agricultural products for human consumption.
The small size of the country and its agricultural sector, is a constraint
on the development of large agro-industrial input processing facilities. 2/
21.       It is difficult to discern any clear-cut Government policy regarding
agro-industries beyond following the pattern of import substitution common to
other developing countries. It is not infrequent to find agro-industrial
operations, such as milk processing plants or canning factories for vegetables,
based on imported products until local production catches up. In general,
food processing factories in Jamaica are small, deal with a variety of raw
materials, and produce a final product that is extremely variable in quality.
The main constraints in this field are: (a) the absence of a stable and
coordinated agro-industrial policy; and (b) the difficulty in getting enough
input of standard quality due to the large number of small farmers and the
absence (until very recently) of quality controls and price incentives. 3/
Some items currently in short supply are pineapples, ackees, mangoes, guavas,
oranges, grapefruit and ortainques among fruits and carrots and tomatoes
among fresh vegetables. All meats, except pig meat, are also scarce.
1/   Potatoes account for two-thirds of total AMC exports, which amounted
to about J$ 400,000 in 1972.
2/   With the exception of two fertilizer packing plants.
3/   The Agricultural Marketing Corporation has introduced some minimum
standards for fresh vegetables. So have some milk processing plants
for milk, but no such practice exists for beef or pig products.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
22.       Inadequacy of supply (and, to some extent, unreliability) arises
from the failure of domestic agricultural production to keep in step with
overall growth in demand, and more particularly, to the failure of processors
to stimulate increases in production by entering into meaningful contracts
with farmers or to integrate them into their own growing facilities. The
uncertainty of supplies of raw materials has forced many firms to resort to
importation of a wide range of basic inputs. It has also given rise to the
accumulation of fruits and vegetables over long periods to ensure a sufficient
quantity for an economic production run, but this has resulted in quality
deterioration and spoilage. Additionally, it is responsible for the overall
underutilization of production capacity in the industry. Finally, the
problem has led to nonspecialization in many plants, with processors tending
to produce too many items. Changeover costs are therefore abnormally high
as the volume of production decreases.
Supporting Services - Extension
23.       Extension services are provided mainly by Government institutions
and commodity boards. The present Government service comprises four directors
of extension, nine extension specialists and six technical assistants as head-
quarters staff. Field staff consists of 325 extension officers, 103 technical
support staff and 247 non-technical support staff.
24.       Jamaica has a total of 193,000 farms, most of which (78.5%) are
five acres or less. It is primarily with this group of small subsistence
farmers that the extension agent works. Records show that the field staff
must actually divide its services among 131,000 farmers, or, each extension
agent or his supporting staff member must serve approximately 200 farmers.
This figure compares favorably with the availability of extension
services in the Caribbean area as a whole. However, the lack of
transportation would appear to be the major limiting factor in making such
services readily available to the small farmer. The effectiveness of ex-
tension services is further severely hampered by lack of personnel in certain
areas. The service has, in recent years, found it extremely difficult to
attract graduates of the Jamaica School of Agriculture to its ranks. At
present, in the most important division of area extension officers, only 71%
of available posts are filled. Added to this is the fact that 31% of the
staff personnel do not meet the minimum standards of technical training.
25.       The commodity boards, on the other hand, provide a highly specialized
service. This has ensured strong technical assistance for sugarcane, bananas,
citrus, coconuts, cacao and coffee. These commodity boards have a total of
157 field staff.
Research
26.       As in the case of extension, Jamaica relies mainly on Government
agencies and commodity boards to ensure that a viable and progressive industry
is maintained. The Ministry of Agriculture research service tends to be of



ANNEX 1
Page 8
an applied nature and is responsive to the farmers' demands for advice on
such matters as soil fertility, fertilizer use, variety selection, crop
management practices, pest/disease identification and prevention. Adequate
laboratory and field facilities are available to carry out these functions,
but only limited facilities, as well as time, are provided for more basic
research in many allied fields.
Recent Developments
27.       The relative stagnation or slow progress in Jamaican agriculture
prompted the Government to organize a global review of the sector's perfor-
mance and problems. This review took place in June 1973 and was led by Sir
Arthur Lewis, supported by an international team (including IBRD staff).
Based on a set of reports prepared by the Government of Jamaica, the team
produced a series of 11 Ministerial Briefs, which were the basis for dis-
cussions with the Prime Minister and his staff during July 1973. As a result
of these, the Ministries of Planning and Agriculture have prepared a
Green Paper which will serve as the basis for the development of the
agricultural sector, enlarging, modifying and qualifying the policy
directions contained in the Five-Year Plan presently in operation.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL PROJECT
Land Tenure
1.        Jamaica's agricultural land is unequally distributed, with some
300 units occupying 45% of the land. Most of the land in large units (over
500 acres) is in sugarcane. However, Government thinking on the redistri-
bution of the several sugar estates that it has taken over and in regard to
settlement programs on lands which are now idle or substantially underutilized
could lead to a more equitable pattern of land ownership in the future.
Distribution of farms and acreage is shown below:
Size Group              Number      %       Acreage      %
Less than 5 acres             151,705/1 78.5      229,216    15.4
5 to under 25 acres           37,607   19.4       340,575    22.9
25 to under 100 acres          3,055    1.6       127,208     8.5
100 to under 500 acres           699    0.4       148,048     9.9

/1   Includes 4,768 persons who own no land but are classified as farmers
because of their ownership of some livestock.
Source: Census of Agriculture, 1968/69.
2.        It is estimated that about 190,000 farmers operate units of less
than 10 acres, an area which appears to be the minimum amount of cropland
that can provide a reasonable income for a family (larger units, perhaps 50
acres, are required for livestock grazing). Of these, about 100,000 are
primarily dependent on agriculture, while the rest are part-time farmers
and employed elsewhere. The bona fide operators with less than 10 acres hold
an average of 2.2 acres each. Mbst have their land under freehold.
3.        A considerable amount of land in farms lies idle or is substantially
underutilized. Such land suitable for cultivation totals perhaps 100,000
acres, with another 100,000 acres suitable for pasture development. This is
not enough to accommodate all farmers on economic sized units, but it could
absorb about 15,000 to 20,000, which is about the number of smallholders who
can be moved to commercial agriculture in the near future. The remainder
would have to look increasingly to non-farm activities for employment oppor-
tunities.

Government Programs
4.        The first planned settlement scheme was started in 1929, largely on
an experimental basis, and, by 1959, 176 settlements existed. Some 10,000
freehold titles were issued during the same period. The nature of the program
did not change much until 1963, even though some attempts to organize coopera-
tive farming on a leasehold tenure basis were made in 1953. Between 1963 and
1971, 74 new farms were acquired by the Government and the number of settlers
rose to 40,000. The average plot was some 4.4 acres. The following table
summarizes available information.

1963-1971                74          54,446         27,911         6,440
Total                269        234,041        173,835         39,381
5.        Cost data for the entire period are not readily available, but for
the period 1929-50, the average cost was J$ 50 per acre, on the basis of the
following figures:
J$
Acquisition                                1,832,512
Development                                  971,700
Administration                               608,480
Miscellaneous                                231,254
Total                             3,643,946
6.        Cost of land, exclusive of pre-settlement costs, is equal, on an
average, to approximately 50% of the total cost, mainly because of high land
price, which is paid at commercial or near commercial market values. These
prices are only slightly related to the productive capacity of the land, and
have been pushed up mainly as a result of home building programs and pressure
from tourism.
Mining Companies
7.        Non-Government agencies provide land to farmers primarily on a
leasehold tenure. Although documentation is not complete, reliable informa-
tion is available in some instances, and particularly for land owned by
companies mining bauxite. As of December 31, 1969, the bauxite companies were,
collectively, the largest landowners in the country, with a total of 191,050
acres utilized as follows:

Company Farming                         58,638
Tenant Farming                          75,979
Resettlement                            10,557
Forestry                                16,880
Other                                    8,178
Total                            191,050
Of the total, some 40% is tenant farmed and about 30% is company farmed.
8.        Neither the scope of Government programs nor the limited attractive-
ness of the mining companies' tenant programs, however, can adequately solve
the serious land tenure problems now faced by Jamaica. A clear-cut policy on
land utilization, land tenure and rural development needs to be formulated
and implemented, and there are signs that Government is becoming increasingly
aware of the need for urgent action in this sphere.
Recent Developments
9.        Government has been reviewing its agricultural land policy since
1972. In the meantime, although no new settlements have been established,
three main developments have taken place:  the Land Utilization Commission
(LUC) has been reactivated; Operation GROW (para 15) has been implemented,
especially Project Land Lease; and a new Land Tax Act was passed in 1973.
10.       Land Utilization Commission.  The Land Utilization Commission (LUC)
was established in 1966 as a result of public concern over the high (50%)
proportion of cultivable and potentially productive agricultural lands that
lay idle or were grossly underutilized and the growing deficit in the agri-
cultural balance of payments. The duties of the Commission were to control
use of lands, ensure that occupiers of agricultural units fulfilled their
responsibility under the Land Utilization and Development Act, and, if neces-
sary, acquire lands on behalf of the Government so as to bring them into full
use.
11.       The LUC restricted its activities to farms of more than 100 acres
and approached law enforcement with ..." a lenient and persuasive approach
in carrying out its responsibilities." 1/ Consequently, results have been
poor, witb an area of only 62,000 acres brought into use between December 1,
1966 and March 31, 1972. The crop pattern of this area is shown in the
following table. Expanding pasture establishment may not have resulted so
much from LIJC's prodding as from the incentive provided by the removal of
beef price restrictions.

prepared by Mr. Rochester, Director of LUC.)

Total                                    62,363
12.       LUC procedures are complicated and time-consuming.  Before a piece
of land can be! declared idle, several "notices" are served on the landlord
and each can be appealed, the last one being a direct appeal to the Minister
of Agriculture. Between 1966 and March 1972, LUC served 449 "notices of
idleness" affecting some 100,000 acres.  Of these, 419 were appealed and,
therefore, granted grace periods of up to five years. Only in extreme cases -
in about 30 instances, up to March 1972 - did the Commission actually buy the
land.
13.       As the prices paid by LUC for land are comparable to commercial
prices, the threat of a LUC takeover is not an effective deterrent against
leaving land idle. Another weakness of LUC relates to its staffing: six of
its 12 positions for officers were vacant as of October 1973.
14.       In summary, the LUC is practically inoperative and is unable to
influence significantly the land tenure structure of Jamaica or the pattern
of its land use. To be effective, considerable budgetary allocations should
be made to improve the quality and number of technical staff and the legisla-
tion needs to be amended to shorten the period of implementation of notices
of idleness and to prevent political interference.
15.       Project Land Lease.  ProJect Land Lease (PLL), was undertaken as
part of the Government program known as Operation GROW (Growing and Reaping
Our Wealth), which also includes a few large Government farms operated as
single production units to raise food crops., The objective of the PLL is
to help increase the production of food crops quickly by providing small
farmers and tenants with supplemental tenancies. Land is provided on a five-
year lease basis and in units of 1.5 acres on average. Selection of tenants
is based on a thorough and impartial screening and if their performance is
not satisfactory they are subject to being dispossessed from their holdings
within 45 days.
16.       The crops to be planted must appear on an approved list, selections
being made mainly by the Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC), which acts
as a buyer for a large part of the harvested crops. Credit is readily avail-
able, but only in the form of physical inputs (fertilizers, seeds, and such)
or services (land preparation and the like) and is deducted from payments by
AMC. The PLL, therefore, operates as a commercial venture.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
17.       The program is administered by an ad-hoc organization, divided into
regional offices and headed by a capable expert on loan to the Government
from Alcan Jamaica Ltd. He reports directly to the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Agriculture, and up to now, operations have been efficient and
remarkably free from political interference.
18.       Land for renting was to have come from the LUC but because of its
inability to take decisive action (para 12), the program has been forced to
lease directly from landlords on the basis of an annual rent of J$ 10 per acre.
19.       At the end of August 1973, the activities of the PLL could be
summarized as follows:
No. of properties investigated                      192
Land investigated (acres)                        43,059
Land leased (acres)                              12,204
Arable land leased (acres)                        7,155
Land occupied by tenants (acres)                  3,127
No. of farmers interviewed                        3,359
---------Projections----------
Placements, Plantings, Value          31/8/73   31/12/74   31/12/75   31/12/76
No. of tenants placed                  1,763      4,500        8,000    10,000
Land planted (acres)                   1,277      5,000       12,000    18,000
Value of plantings (at maturity)    $0.4 m       $1.5 m       $3.6 m    $5.4 m
20.       The program has been well received by farmers and presents inter-
esting possibilities for the short and medium term, particularly because it
organizes imaginatively the use of resources otherwise left idle. By pro-
moting a better use of land, increased production, and high level of employ-
ment, it also presents a valuable avenue to agricultural development.
Nevertheless, the very nature of precarious ,tenure may, in the long run,
undermine its present advantages and it should therefore be developed into
a more permanent institutional framework.
21.       Land Tax Act.  Early in 1973, the Government passed a law on property
tax which introduced progressive taxation for agricultural lands according
to size.  However, as a result of pressure from farmers and landlords, a grace
period has been granted and it has not yet come into practice. To a great
extent, its effect on the land tenure structure will depend on strict enforce-
ment and realistic (commercial) assessment of land values. It should, however,
be noted that income from agriculture is subject to taxation which is fairly
progressive and that the legislation which aimed at providing incentives
for investment in agriculture by exempting the resulting income from
taxation has not yet become effective in practice.

Conclusion
22.       Future trends of institutional organization in the Jamaican land
tenure structure will depend largely on the orientation Government indicates
in the near future. The magnitude and scope of the problem are such that
unless decisive and continuous action is taken, the inequalities of opportunity
of the present land tenure system are likely to persist. Though a decision
on agrarian reform would be partly determined by political factors, the
follow-up measures (as, for example, the organization of supporting services
for the beneficiaries of land reform and technical assistance) would be areas
of crucial importance in which Bank support might be effective. Following
the Agricultural Sector Study, Government ist actively considering action in
this field and is awaiting the recommendatiobs of a Land Reform Expert whose
advice has been sought. The measures suggested by the Agricultural Sector
Study for improving the distribution and utilization of land include the
following: (i) pressing ahead with permanent settlement of Government-purchased
land, and acquisition of 120,000 more acres of cultivable land, including
improved pasture for settlement; (ii) extending LUC's powers to farms between
10 and 100 acres and increasing its resources; (iii) pressing mining companies
to develop their tenant farming and resettlement programs; (iv) preparing a
code to govern tenurial conditions and size of farms; (v) ensuring services
to small farmers through cooperatives; and (vi) implementing new irrigation
schemes and rationalizing the operation of existing ones.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Credit
General
1.        The main sources of institutional agricultural credit in Jamaica
are the Agricultural Credit Board (ACB), Commodity Boards or Authorities, the
Jamaica Development Bank (JDB), and commercial banks. Non-organized sources
of credit include attorneys, shopkeepers, suppliers of farm requisites, friends
and relatives. Their loans are mostly short-term and for subsistence but do
not account for any large share of farmers' borrowings.
ACB
2.        ACB, established in 1960 under a special statute, makes loans to
farmers directly and through approved organizations, including People's
Cooperative Banks (PCBs) and Land Authorities, and supervises and controls such
organizations. ACB draws its funds from Government appropriations, external
borrowings (as from IDB and USAID) and repayments on its earlier loans. Its
loan schemes include the Farmers' Development Program financed from the
Agricultural Credit Revolving Fund, Fisheries Development Program, the USAID
Dairy Development Program, and the Self-supporting Farmers' Development
Program (SSFDP) financed by IDB. The eligible farms under the SSFDP (which
covers short-term as well as long-term credit needs) are generally 5 to 25
acres, though farms up to 100 acres of poorer lands or under 5 acres of ex-
tremely good land are not ruled out. Beneficiaries must be earning their
incomes principally from agricultural and livestock activities and in no case
have gross agricultural and livestock assets in excess of J$ 25,000 on entering
the program. The first two stages of the program involved a total cost of
US$17.5 million, of which US$9.2 million was provided by the IDB. The third
stage has recently commenced, with the support of a further loan of US$8.1
million by the IDB. JDB has been made responsible for the management of this
program and will be paid a commission for its work. The senior staff of JDB
will oversee and provide policy direction to the staff of the program, which
will include ACB personnel screened for the purpose and those to be newly
recruited. The Ministry of Agriculture will also help by providing the neces-
sary extension facilities.
People's Cooperative Banks
3.        As of 30 June 1973, ACB's total outstanding loans, including those
under SSFDP, amounted to J$ 26.17 million, of which the overdues were as high
as J$ 6.6 million. The bulk of the overdues arose under loans made from the
Agricultural Credit Revolving Fund and reflected, in part, the weaknesses of



ANNEX 3
Page 2
the PCBs through which they were mainly channelled. These banks numbering
115, were intended to promote thrift, but over the years they have had a
disappointing record characterized by mounting overdues, neglect of the
function of mobilizing savings, poor organizational structure, and unsatis-
factory accounts-keeping. Most of them are non-viable institutions and
Government is now considering an action program for reducing their number and
developing those left into efficient business units.
Commercial Banks
4.        Operating through a dense network of branches, the seven commercial
banks in the island play a modest role in agricultural lending, providing
mostly short-term funds to large commercial farms engaged in the production
of sugarcane, banana and citrus and, to a lesser extent, livestock and coco-
nuts. The share of agriculture and fisheries out of the total advances of
all commercial banks amounted to J$ 12.9 million, accounting for about 3% of
their outstanding loan portfolio (this includes loans to sugar estates for
production of cane, but not for sugar production). Experience has shown that
commercial banks take an active interest in financing agriculture, especially
in providing term loans for investment expenditure, only with their established
customers and then only during periods of surplus liquidity.
JDB
5.        Jamaica Development Bank, which came into being only in 1969, has
developed its operations in the agricultural sector on a satisfactory basis
over the last three years (Annex 9). JDB has made a significant contribution,
not only in terms of the substantial amount provided by way of term loans,
but also in building up its technical capability for making such loans, by
employing the required specialist staff and by adopting appropriate lending
policies and procedures.
Commodity Boards
6.        Agricultural credit is also provided by the various commodity boards
and other organizations such as the Cocoa Industry Board, Cane Farmers'
Association, Banana Board, Sugar Industry Authority, and Citrus Growers'
Association. Most of the funds are short term and, as in the case of Sugar
Industry Authority, are for cultivation purposes under replanting or similar
schemes.
Supply of Credit
7.        There has been a substantial supply of agricultural credit in
Jamaica, provided by ACB directly or through other agencies, but many of its
small loans cannot be assumed to have been used for agricultural purposes.
Commercial bank lending is largely short term but is often allowed to roll
over and becomes effectively, in part, permanent credit. The specified period
of other loans such as those made by ACB is not of significance to the extent



ANNEX 3
Page 3
that a sizable sum is overdue and a part of such arrears is uncollectible.
Only JDB has organized term lending on a systematic basis. As for size of
farms financed, the loans which ACB makes from its revolving fund are generally
to small farmers (average J$ 1,550), though large loans are occasionally made
with the special permission of the Ministry of Agriculture. SSFDP loans seem
to be concentrated among farmers with 5 to 20 acres, while credit from JDB
and commercial banks is mainly oriented to commercial farmers.
Conditions of Lending
8.        Land mortgage is the common security for agricultural loans,
buttressed where necessary by personal guarantees, bills of sale of animals
and machinery and life insurance policies. Historically, mortgage of land
has rarely been enforced by credit institutions, though arrears have been
heavy. As for interest rates, the bulk of institutional credit is at sub-
sidized rates--4% on SSFDP medium-term loans and 6% on other SSFDP and ACB
loans. Commercial bank rates range from 9-1/2 to 12%, while JDB charges
8-3/4%. In the context of the present inflationary conditions in JaAaica,
with an increase in the Kingston cost of living index of about 25%
during 1973, even the rates of interest charged by JDB and commercial
banks on agricultural loans are too low to ensure a positive rate in
real terms.
Conclusion
9.        The broad conclusion of the Agricultural Sector study was that the
agricultural credit provided by numerous agencies in Jamaica is uncoordinated
and inadequate, particularly for medium and small farmers and for some crops,
especially those for domestic consumption; that the contribution of credit
to application of improved technology in agriculture has been negligible, and
that non-repayment of loans represents an implicit waste of credit funds.
Thought is now being given in Jamaica to a proposal, arising from the Sector
Study, for the establishment of an agricultural credit bank as a means of
coordinating and restructuring the agricultural credit system, but no decision
has yet been made.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Performance Under the First Agricultural Credit Proiect
Bank Loan
1.        To assist in financing JDB's agricultural lending program for the
expansion of the production of coconut, citrus, beef and milk, the Bank
approved a loan of US$3.7 million to JDB in December 1970 for its first agri-
cultural Credit Project. JDB was to charge interest at 8-3/4Z per annum on
sub-loans (estimated to number 140), providing for a grace period not ex-
ceeding seven years and the total repayment period not exceeding 15 years,
the specific periods being determined in each case by the expected cash flow
of the sub-borrower.
Project Progress
2.        During the first 18 months of Project effectiveness, sub-loan
approvals were slow, with only J$ 1.7 million committed by December 31, 1972.
This resulted from several factors such as (a) JDB's relative lack of experience
in agricultural lending; (b) the time taken to finalize procedures for loan
appraisal and disbursement; (c) uncertain investment climate during the period
preceding national elections; and (d) delays and difficulties experienced by
sub-borrowers in furnishing documents relating to their land titles.
3.        When the lending program did gain momentum during the first half of
1973, it was soon realized that there was a stronger demand for sub-loans for
beef and dairy and relatively less for coconut than was anticipated. A re-
quest was, therefore, made to the Bank for a reallocation of funds and it was
granted in June 1973. A second reallocation was made in December 1973 to
transfer further amounts from coconut and citrus to the two livestock cate-
gories, as shown below:
Category                    Original  First Reallocation  Second Reallocation
----------------(US$ million)       …------------  -…----
Beef                           1.10            1.50                 1.60

4.        The following table shows the amounts of sub-loans envisaged at
appraisal and approvals as of 30 September 1973, according to enterprise:

140            5.10       76          4.39
5.        JDB's disbursement of sub-loans (J$ 2.6 million up to 31 March
1974) has been generally slow because of (a) sub-borrowers' delays in fur-
nishing documents relating to the collateral, arising from land title problems;
(b) late confirmation of loan acceptance by sub-borrowers; and (c) the phasing
of investment over two (and sometimes three) years. JDB is taking various
procedural steps to improve disbursements and help sub-borrowers to complete
the necessary formalities. Disbursements under the Bank loan stood at US$1.62
million as of March 31, 1974, and the present closing date of December 31,
1974 seems likely to need extension.
Pattern of Lending
6.        Sub-loans averaged J$ 65,935 for the first 18 months and seven
loans exceeded US$100,000 and were submittedito the Bank for prior approval.
Following a recommendation by the Bank, JDB aimed at making smaller loans,
and as of 31 December 1973, the average sub-loan was reduced to J$ 54,000.
7.        Of 76 loans made up to September 30, 1973, 31.6% were to new farmers
developing uncultivated land, 17.1% to new farmers developing existing farms,
15.8% to experienced farmers developing new farms and the remaining 35.5%
to established farmers improving existing farm units. As a means of stimula-
ting the lending program, JDB commenced making loans from its own funds for
land purchase, where necessary, in association with development loans under
the Project. Farm development plans of some of the sub-borrowers new to
farming have been highly diversified so as to ensure an adequate cash flow,
but this tends to strain their limited capacity for farm management. Further,
some of the sub-borrowers do not stay on the farm, but in such cases JDB
insists on the employment of a paid manager, approved by it.
Staff
8.        At the commencement of the Project, JDB appointed an internationally
recruited agricultural economist and a livestock specialist. Field staff,
however, was inadequate, particularly during late 1972 and up to mid-1973,
to evaluate new loans and to supervise those already made, but, since July



ANNEX 4
Page 3
1973, there has been an improvement. The vacancy created by the promotion of
the previous livestock specialist to the post of the manager of the Agriculture
Department has been filled and more field staff has been appointed. During the
first nine months of 1973, about 100 visits were paid to 58 sub-borrowers and
arrangements for loan supervision are generally, satisfactory and improving.
Coordinating Committee
9.        The Coordinating Committee for the Project met several times during
late 1971 and twice during 1972 to discuss various probleas relating to the
implementation of the Project. It has not, however, met since the first
quarter of 1973 and needs to be activated in the interests of suitable coordi-
nation among the various agencies operating in the agricultural sector.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Livestock Products and Crops Covered by the Project
A. Milk
General
1.        Natural conditions in Jamaica are particularly favorable for cattle
production, with fertile soils, relatively high and well distributed rainfall,
benign temperature, and an exceptionally low incidence of disease. Jamaica
has about 630,000 acres of grassland but only some 150,000 acres are improved
pastures, the majority of which are either fertilized natural pastures or
guinea grass. Less than 100,000 acres are planted with pangola grass, which
is agronomically a good alternative as it is highly responsive to fertilizer
application. Pangola easily carries 1 Animal Unit (AU) per acre while
natural pastures carry only 0.4 AU per acre or less. Jamaican cattlegrowers
are planting most of their new fields with pangola but their rate of progress
is still low.
Cattle Stock
2.        The Census of Agriculture 1968/69 gives the following data on the
livestock subsector:
Dairy Cattle                   34,898
Beef Cattle                   183,654
Dual and Draft                 60,158
Total                    278,710
It is believed that this number should have increased substantially during
the last five years.  Jamaica Livestock Association indicated a figure of
the order of 350,000 to 400,000 head, some 75% of which would be beef cattle.
No statistical information is available to prove or disprove this assertion,
but it is commonly accepted by specialists in Jamaica.
Patterns of Production
3.        Dairy farms are concentrated in the hill country zone (rainfall 70
to 90 inches) or in the coastal plains, which are considerably drier (rainfall
40-60 inches). In the commercial farms of this zone, it is not uncommon to
use artificial irrigation in pangola grass fields during the dry season (two
to four months), thereby increasing the carrying capacity to 1.3 to 1.4
AUs per acre.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
4.        Large dairy farms are generally well equipped with milking machines
and cooling facilities and have a considerable degree of mechanization, while
medium and small dairy operations lack almost all necessary requirements for
efficient milk production. 1/ This is also reflected in the proportion of
improved pastures (35% in small vs. 65% in large ones) and pure-bred animals
in the herd (0.8% on small ones vs. 21.5% on large ones). In turn, this
affected the volume of milk yielded per cow per day (herd average): in small
farms, 1.7-2.1 imperial quarts per day, and on the large ones,: over 5 Imperial
quarts. In one of the milk processing plants, for instance, 10% of the
suppliers provided some 58% of the -total milk collected in 1972.
The Herd
5.        The 1968/69 census indicated that there-were some 34,000 cows in
Jamaica's dairy herd, and, by 1973, the figure generally accepted-was about
35,000. With some 14,500 heifers and 8,000 heifer-calves added, the total
dairy herd comes to 57,500 head, as shown below:
Dairy Cattle Population            1969       1970        1971        1972
Pure-bred cows              6,000       6,000       5,500      4,900
Grade cows                 20,000      20,500      22,500-    24,500
Non-descript cows           7,000       7,000       6,000      5,600
Total (milking and
breeding)        33,000     33,500      34,000      35,000
Heifers (2 years old)       5,500       6,000       6,500      7,000
Heifers (yearlings)         5,000       5,500       6,000      7,500
Heifers calves              6,000       6,500       7,000      8,000
Total (all dairy
cattle)         49,500      512500      53,500      57,500
The rate of wastage through death and culling is around 20% per year, but the
number of replacements has been growing during the last four years. This
points to a moderate expansion of the herd in the future.
Availability of Dairy Cattle
6.        The main breeds available are Jamaica Hope, Holstein, Brown Swiss,
Jersey and Red Poll. However, with a small base of dairy cows, the industry
could not expand but at a moderate rate. Hence, if production is to increase
significantly, an injection from outside the industry seems necessary.
Jamaica established a dairy development scheme in 1965 which required the
1/   With the exception of family farms operating under the Dairy Development
Scheme, which do not have a significant impact on national statistics.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
importation of dairy stock. rhe Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC)
has acquired considerable experience in importing 10- to 30-day-old Holstein
heifer calves, rearing them and selling them to farmers. However, this
program has been carried out only on a limited scale (ADC sold 253 heiferl in
1971 and 335 in 1972). Though the first IBRD agricultural credit to Jamaica
contemplated funds for importing some 500 heifers, no imports were actually
made. Probably because of poor milk prices, demand for these heifers was
less than projected, but, after new prices for milk were accepted by the
Government, a reversal of the trend has been reported. Jamaica Government is
considering a plan to expand the dairy herd and increase milk production,
which includes (a) the expansion of the ADC Holstein heifer calves importa-
tion scheme, as well as the importation of bred heifers; (b) cross breeding
imporited and locally bred Holateins, Brown Swiss, and Jamaica Hope bulls with
nativa commercial Brahman, Red Poll and creole-type cows; and (c) upgrading
the dairy-type cows by means of artificial insemination and use of selected
bulls.
7.        The artificial insemination service has played a significant role
in improving the herd. Farmers pay a fee of J$ 0.75 per service, using semen
from high-grade bulls, and professional attention is reported to be rapid,
efficient, and available almost everywhere.
Milk Production
8.        Of the 35,000 breeding and milking cows, some 30,000 supply the
milk market, using an area of about 30,000 acres of pastures. Milk production
is estimated to be around 42 million imperial quarts (Table 1), 90% of which
(38 million imperial quarts) is marketed (para 10). Estimated fertility is
58%, i.e., 58% of available breeding stock comes into production every year.
This would average some 500 imperial gallons per cow milked per year. With
proper husbandry, the national herd can average 70% fertility and produce
750 imperial gallons per cow per year. There is, therefore, ample room for
technological improvement, especially among medium and small farmers.
Demand for Milk
9.        Jamaica's internal production of milk accounts for less than 25%
of national consumption, which amounts to some 160 million imperial quarts
(in 1972). Imports of milk and dairy products have been growing at a
considerable rate, as shown below:

ANNEX 5
Page 4
In 1969, 67% of total demand for milk and milk products (expressed as fluid
milk equivalent) was imported, but in 1972, the Imported component of supply
was 74%. Thus, milk production in Jamaica is not keeping pace with demand.
Marketing
10.       One of the reasons for the insufficient expansion of the milk in-
dustry in Jamaica is the structure of marketing, which is recognized on all
sides to require rationalization. The present collection process is expensive,
with the condensary driving one truck mile for every imperial quart of milk
collected. The pasteurizing plants collect milk in the same areas and often
along the same routes as the condensary, which gives rise to keen competition
for quality cooled milk. Most of the milk is handled by itinerant peddlers
in an inefficient manner since there are too many handlers handling too little
milk and duplicating each other's functions. Consequently, the overhead cost
of handling and processing is very high. Because fresh milk is the highest
priced, efforts have to be made to develop that market to its fullest poten-
tial. The distribution pattern for fresh milk over the past four years is
as follows:
------------Percentages--------------
1969       1970        1971        1972

11.       In 1940, a Nestle's subsidiary established a condensary in Central
Jamaica (Bybrook), designed to reconstitute imported skim powder and to
produce canned condensed milk. Under the terms of its franchise, the con-
densary was obliged to accept and collect all fluid milk offered by Jamaican
farmers and to pay minimum prices established by Government. During the
1940s and 1950s, most of the fresh milk produced by Jamaica went to the con-
densary, but as the demand for fluid milk increased, new pasteurizing plants
were installed. In 1973 four were in operation and a fifth one was scheduled
to start operating in 1974. Consequently, milk collection by the condensary
has decreased from 12 million quarts in 1952 to 7 million in 1972. In prac-
tice, the condensary acts as a Government agency, paying (minimum) support
prices for milk farmers who are too far away or too small to interest the
pasteurizing plants. 1/
1/   The condensary can undertake this responsibility which implies high
collaction costs, as it profits principally from imported dry milk.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
Prices
12.       Farmgate prices for fluid milk are fixed by Government.  Even though
there is a complicated table for price adjustment that includes premiums for
seasonality, quality, and quantity of milk delivered, prices in 1973, on
average, were 13.4 J cts per imperial quart for the condensary and around
20.0 J c1:s per imperial quart of milk collected by processors and itinerant
retailers. Shaw Park Dairies, for example, paid 20.4 J cts to the producers
(farmgate price) in the month of July 1973, sold at 26.5 ets to wholesalers,
and charged 29.0 cts to consumers
Recent Developments
13.       In the last 18 months, the Government has granted two increases in
milk prices as steps to encourage internal production. There are also indi-
cations that a comprehensive milk policy is to be adopted by early 1974. It
would include the creation of a Milk Marketing Board for regulating all milk
produced and sold and would control the imports of milk and milk by-products.
Also, a rationalization of the milk transport system to avoid unnecessary
duplication of services would be considered. A cautious but definite policy
towards prohibiting the sale of unpasteurized milk to the public would be
complemented with an expansion and modernization of present milk processing
facilities.
14.       Jamaican milk producers have a guaranteed market and minimum or
above-minimum prices (if they can be integrated into the pasteurizing plants'
circuit of collection). Since the Government has indicated a clear-cut
policy for increasing milk production by granting two price hikes in the
past 12 months, immediate prospects for the industry are excellent. Medium-
and long-term prospects are also good as demand is four times the supply and
pasteurizing plants pay competitive prices.
B. Beef
15.       Jamaica's climatic, physical and pasture conditions for beef are
similar in nearly all respects to those described for the dairy industry.
Commercial beef herds are predominantly zebu crossbreds. The Jamaican Red
(red poll x zebu) and Janaica Black (angus x zebu) are locally developed
breeds which do well.
Raising Beef Cattle
16.       Beef cattle are grazed year round although in cattle areas there
is a well marked dry season of three to five months during which increased
supplementary feeding is needed. Most slaughter cattle are grassfed but there
has been a trend in recent years to provide supplementary feeding by using
concentrates prepared mostly with imported gratn and the limited amounts of
citrus pulp, coconut meal, brewer grains and wheat middlings locally avail-
able. As a result, a small number of feedlot operations have become estab-



ANNEX 5
Page 6
lished, especially for fattening. Feedlot practices vary widely, but because
the size of most of the operations is small, the overhead costs are high.
The main handicap for feedlots is the fact that the basic material for feed
and concentrates has to be imported. However, recent research in feeds based
on molasses and/or bagasse with urea and protein concentrates has yielded
encouraging results.
17.       Bulls are generally kept with cows all year round but there is now
a tendency towards seasonal mating in the best managed properties. Calving
rates average 60-65% and calf mortality some 5%. Post-weaning mortality is
generally low. Heifers are commonly mated at 1-1/2-2-1/2 years old. Calves
are weaned between seven and nine months old, with an average liveweight of
380-400 pounds. There is little trade in weaned steers for fattening since
most farmers rear their own through to slaughter weight. On improved pastures,
steers are usually finished at 900 pounds at about two years old.
Animal Health
18.       Diseases are limited to anaplasmosis and piroplasmosis (both
transmitted by cattle ticks), blackleg, hemorrhagic septicemia and anthrax.
Indigenous cattle have high natural resistance against the first two.
Dipping and spraying schedules control ticks, and regular vaccination is an
established practice. Incidepce of brucellosis is low and foot and mouth
disease is non-existent. Animal health in most herds is satisfactory.
Adequate Government-controlled quarantine facilities have existed since the
early 1960s, but the costs of acclimatization, plus initial higher prices
than those for animals sold on the local market, make imports of cattle
unattractive to the majority of ranchers.
Production Patterns
19.       Most beef cattle are produced in the west and about half of the
national herd is on some 200 farms of over 500 acres each. The sugar estates
and bauxite companies are important cattle farmers. Bauxite holdings alone
now are estimated at 38,000 head, and recent trends indicate a considerable
expansion of their cattle population. A similar tendency appears in the
conversion of uneconomic sugarcane fields into pastures and a move into former
coconut area now devastated by Lethal Yellowing Disease.
Production Levels and Demand
20.       Beef production rose slowly between 1960 and 1967 to some 62,000
head slaughtered per year. Since then, the registered slaughter has fluc-
tuated around 59,000 head per year, on average, as shown below:

About three-fourths of the animals are slaughtered locally. This figure very
likely under-states the total slaughter, 1/ but, assuming a rate of extraction
of 18%, a national herd of some 330,000 head would be indicated. During the
same period of time, pig production increased substantially (6% per year)
while registered slaughter of goats and sheep declined (further details can
be found in Table 2).
21.       The overall demand position for beef is strong, but there are three
distinct segments:
(a) The hotel industry, demanding higher quality cuts, mostly imported
from USA or Canada;
(b) Upper and middle income consumers, buying the best local beef and
imported grassfed frozen beef from Australia and New Zealand; and
(c) Lower income consumers, buying mostly cheaper cuts of local beef
and some imported frozen beef.
Total tourist-related demand for beef is estimated to be in the region of 1.6
million lb in 1973, but a Stanford Research Institute study forecasts a 222%
increase by 1980 to 3.6 million lb of beef, and by 1990 it should double
again. Local beef demand has also been growing rapidly, rising from 1960 to
1968 at an estimated 5.4% per year. Even with the expected slowdown in
population growth, this demand is projected to grow at no less than 3.4% per
year during the 1970s and by 3.1% per year during the 1980s (see below):
1/   It should be borne in mind that available figures of slaughter reflect
only legal slaughtering. Whenever price controls on beef become serious
obstacles to profit-making, considerable "under the tree" slaughter and
"blackmarket" operations take place. The above figures are therefore a
minimum.

22.       Up to 1965, about 80% of total beef demand was met locally, but
in 1972, this proportion had decreased to some 70%, and imports consequently
rose. The table below shows quantity and value of imports of fresh beef and
veal from 1965-1972. The Ministry of Agriculture estimated that, until 1970,
total local production had been stable at about 30 million pounds, 1/ but some
improvements were expected from 1973 onwards. Nevertheless, Imports are ex-
pected to increase substantially.

Marketing
24.       The marketing structure is deficient both in terms of organization
and physical facilities. In the absence of auction markets, on-farm sales
or direct selling of cattle to dealers and local butchers is the standard
practice. Marketing is in the hands of the butcher. It is widely claiued
that the dealer-butcher profits are too high in relation to their nvestment,
the low level of risk and the small amount of time spent on their operations



ANNEX 5
Page 10
as compared to the producers. 1/ Butchers in the larger cities slaughter in
municipal abattoirs and pay a fee for use of those facilities. Most of the
carcasses are then sold through the butchers' own retail outlets and the
remainder through supermarkets or to other retailers who employ their own
cutters. The following chart illustrates in a simplified way the channels of
marketing for beef.

Processing
25.       There are two main slaughterhouses:  Kingston (municipal) and Ocho
Rios (Reynolds Bauxite). About 16,000 head are slaughtered yearly in Kingston
and about 4,000 in Ocho Rios. The other 40,000 animals are slaughtered in
small country abattoirs and on farms. The facilities leave much to be desired.
The low stan'dards, combined with absence of processing facilities, imply not
only wastage but also the inability of the trade to meet the USDA grade
standards required by the tourist industry. Though the existing situation
does not impose a constraint on the marketing of beef which is always in short
supply, it is bound to hamper the future development of the industry.
I/   No analysis of margins of meat marketing exists.



ANNEX 5
Page 11
26.       A feasibility study on replacing the Kingston facilities by a modern
enlarged abattoir and meat processing complex, including feedlot operations
and costing in all about J$ 5.5 million, was completed by Stanford Research
Institute in 1970. The Kaiser Development Corporation had taken the initiative
in formulating a project, but due to the non-availability of a technical
partner, the deal fell through. Last year, a working group of the Coumittee
on Agro-Industries, set up jointly by the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Ministry of Industries and Tourism, had for some time been examining the ways
and means by which the proposal arising out of the Stanford Study in regard
to the meat complex could be implemented. Yet in 1972, two other proposals
were under consideration: one by Mr. Connally of Texas to establish a beef
cattle farm-feedlot cum slaughterhouse project in association with the Govern-
ment of Jamaica, and the other, of a less ambitious nature put forward by
Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica (Clarendon Meats Products Ltd.) for a meat packing
complex which would have capacity to process about 1.1 million lb of pork
and 1.8 million lb of beef per annum and involve a fixed investment cost of
about J$ 500,000. All of these proposals are still being considered by Govern-
ment.
27.       The absence of cold storage, offal processing facilities and minimum
sanitary standards is likely to constitute a serious obstacle if locally
produced meat is to compete satisfactorily with imports, and this would pose
a serious limitation on any beef production program which is aimed at in-
creasing significantly the present levels of slaughter. One of the reasons
why the prevalent situation persists is the lack of enthusiasm by farmers and
butchers for one modern central slaughterhouse. Some farmers fear that
Government would be able to enforce and police very tight beef prices by
simply closing the present abattoirs, while the butchers fear that they
would either be replaced by a meat packing plant and distribution system,
or forced out of business by enforced Government standards and cuts.
Prices
28.       Government-controlled prices have 1een in operation since 1940,
with two brief periods of de-control (June 1960 to March 1963 and January
1970 to September 1971). At present, and since April 1973, the Government
has partially de-controlled beef prices. Domestic beef cuts, with the ex-
ception of two (stew and soup), which should account for 50% of meat produced
per head, 1/ have been freed of price controls. This has resulted in a steep
rise in the price of beef in general.  For example, ordinary culled animals
which previously fetched J$ 20-21 a 100-lb liveweight went up to J$ 30 as a
rule. On the other hand, feedlot cattle, which under control were bought by
butchers at J$ 26 a 100 lb liveweight, went up to J$ 37.50 in most instances.
1/   Butchers manage, nevertheless, to market as little as 10-20% at the
prices fixed for these cuts (stew and soup). Their vast number (over
1,000 registered and an unknown number unregistered) makes price and
quality control impossible.



ANNEX 5
Page 12
C. Sheep and Goats
29.       Traditionally, sheep and goats have been raised by small farmers
and individuals owning no land. Although there are a few thousand sheep and
some 100,000 goats, mainly in the parishes of Manchester, St. Elizabeth and
St. Ann and in other widely scattered localities in Jamaica, there has been
no real effort in organized sheep or goat development, except for a few
farmers in the dry southern plain of St. Elizabeth who have undertaken fairly
large-scale breeding flock operations in the last three years.
30.       Government established a small research program in 1965, which has
been primarily concerned with evaluation of the "native" goat breeds for
hardiness, fecundity, and milking ability. Nevertheless, the dairy goat has
never gained particular popularity in Jamaica; instead, goat meat has become
extremely popular in the Jamaican diet. Sheep as well are important only for
meat production, since the wool is not utilized.
31.       Most Government effort has been directed toward the genetical im-
provement of the local types of animals. In the case of sheep, the St. Eliza-
beth breed has been crossed to the Barbados Black Belly and to the Suffolk
Down, while improved goat breeds such as the Toggenburg Saanen, British Alpine
and Anglo Nubian have been used to upgrade the native flock. However, the
efforts to increase mutton production have not been successful due, among
other reasons, to lack of appropriate management.
32.       Statistics relating to animal slaughter and mutton imports, reflect
a decline in production in the last five years, accompanied by increasing
imports of chilled or frozen sheep and goat flesh (see table below). The
increasing importation of mutton reflects a wide internal market for the
product which may be supplied by the farmers if trained staff help them to
increase their flocks and productivity and if meat marketing is better
organized.

D. Citrus
Citrus Production
33.       Citrus is produced throughout the island, but most of the commercial
growers are concentrated in the central zones of Clarendon, St. Catherine and
St. Mary. Total area covered by citrus is estimated to be around 30,000
acres, but there is disagreement on how much of this area is now in bearing.
For the present report, however, Government figures, published in the 1972
Economic Survey, are used.

Source: Economic Survey: Jamaica National Planning Agency, 1973.
This would indicate an area of 13,300 acres planted with citrus but not yet
bearing fruits. Average commercial yields are about 275 to 300 bo*es (80 lb
each) per acre of oranges and ortaniques, and about 500 boxes (90 lb each) per
acre of grapefruit when in full production. As can be seen from the table,
there is ample room for improving cultural practices, especially in fertilizing,
harvesting, and handling of citrus products, if productivity is to be raised.
34.       Despite relatively low productivity, citrus has been one of the
fastest growing enterprises in the agricultural sector. At present, however,
the industry is facing various problems resulting from a three-year drought
and declining official producer prices against a background of increasing
domestic demand.
The Citrus Growers' Association (CGA)
35.       The CGA is an association of about 20,000 members operating as a
limited liability company. It acts as the exclusive buyer for export and owns
two subsidiaries, Jamaica Citrus Growers' Ltd. and Caribbean Preserving Co.
Ltd, which processed about 54% of total citrus products in 1971/72. The
latter company is at present being absorbed into the former.



ANNEX 5
Page 14
36.       Traditionally, the CGA has regulated the export of citrus, both
fresh fruit and processed products. It also provides a field advisory service
and a spraying service and has given short-term  loans to growers from a 1961
UJnited Kingdom loan of about J$ 400,000 and a loan from Government of J$ 193,000,
which together provide the basis of a revolving fund currently administered by
CGA. Increased domestic demand, however, has altered CGA's traditional pattern
of operations, and its management has not been able to cope with the present
situation. The main development causing this change is a shift toward internal
markets, representing the increased demand for fresh fruit, from both the
domestic market and the tourist markets. As a result, prices of fresh fruit
have risen to the point of being 1.5 to 2.0 times higher than the Association's
countrywide fixed official farmgate prices for the years 1971/72 and the current
agricultural year (Table 3). This development encouraged growers to enter into
direct contracts with local fruit markets and has resulted in a supply of fruit
to CGA well below expectations. In fact, fruit supply to factories in 1971/72
has dropped 19% from 1970/71. While in 1947-54 equal quantities ofi fresh
oranges went to CGA and the fresh fruit market, in 1969-72, the supply to the
fresh fruit market was over twice that which reached the CGA, as shown below.

This trend has adverselv affected overhead expenses and throughput of pro-
cessing factories, thereby further reducing CGA's ability to pay better farm
prices.
Processing Plants
37.       Processing factories built and expanded in anticipation of steadily
increasing throughputs (based on areas planted with citrus) are suffering
losses arising from underutilization of capacities. In fact, on an average,
they operated in the 1966-69 period at a 49% level of installed capacity 1/
(Table 4). Exports of citrus products and related by-products, which constitute
the third largest agricultural export item from Jamaica, have, consequently, been
adversely affected, dropping from J$ 5.1 millLon in 1968 to J$ 4.2 million in
1972 (Table 5).

Physical Marketing
38.       Because of its excellent natural protection during handling and
storage, citrus fruit lends itself to non-sophisticated marketing arrangements
which are the predominant ones in Jamaica. The following chart illustrates in
a simplified way the channels of marketing for citrus.

Markets and Prices
39.       Prospects.  There is presently no Jamaican citrus product that
could not be marketed easily in greater quantities at prevailing prices. This
is partly a reflection of the fruit shortage in the island, but it also indi-
cates a favorable overseas market situation in general and a growing patronage
of Jamaican citrus supplies in particular.
40.       Exports.  Exports of fresh Marsh seedless grapefruit are most
lucrative during the early season (August-September) when the traditional
import markets in Europe (UK in particular) are not well supplied by other
countries. The ortanique, a very successful hybrid of the orange and the
tangerine that at present grows only in Jamaica, has attracted considerably
higher prices than oranges in export markets, considering the limited amount
produced. Furthermore, there are no limitations in view for a two- or three-
fold increase in production for export fruit alone. Jamaican oranges, on the
other hand, do not have natural competitive advantages because of unattractive
skin color and fairly tough cellulose. Additionally, the shipping costs to
major centers of consumption are high when fresh fruit exports are considered.
These disadvantages disappear, however, when processed items are exported.
Partly because of a favorable sugar/acid ratio of Jamaican Valencia oranges
and partly because of lower shipping expenses in the case of concentrated
juices, the prospects are considerably better.

41.       Domestic Market.  The best immediate prospects for oranges lie in
the domestic market. The Economic Survey of 1972, prepared by the National
Planning Agency, forecast an increase of 300% in the internal demand for
citrus fruits and by-products for the decade 1972-1982. This far outstrips
total present production, and, as new groves will take six to seven years to
enter into full production, the prospects are of relative scarcity and rising
prices. These substantial increases in aggregate demand are partly the result
of increases in household incomes and a high income elasticity of demand,
especially for orange juice, fresh grapefruit, and ortaniques. The other
component of aggregate demand is, of course, the tourist trade.
E. Coconuts
General
42.       Jamaica's coconut production is substantial and only coconut is
used as base for vegetable oil production in the island; some 18,000 tons of
copra are produced each year. While during the 1940s about one-third of the
crop was available as surplus for exportation, exports had fallen to about
one-tenth, by the early 1960s, and from 1964 onwards they ceased entirely.
Since then imports of copra or coconut oil have been increasing.
Production
43.       There are an estimated 6 million coconut trees in the island, some
4.3 million of which are bearing trees. Land presently under cocop.uts is
estimated at 131,000 acres, 97% of which are in eastern parishes, tiotably
St. Thomas, Portland and St. Mary.
Cropping Pattern and Plantation Ownership
44.       Coconuts are intercropped during the pre-bearing years.  Banana and
plantains have traditionally been used and they are quite suitable provided
they do not shade the young coconuts. Other crops such as corn, sweet potatoes,
pumpkins, and peas are also agronomically suitable. Ownership of coconut
plantations is, as for other major crops, concentrated in a small number of
large growers. In 1970, for example, 2.1% of all growers (178 out of 8,380)
delivered 62% of the raw material for copra production.
Lethal Yellowing Disease
45.       Total production is decreasing because of the outbreak of Lethal
Yellowing Disease. It first appeared in 1961 on the northeast coast and has
since then spread rapidly to most major areas. In 1971, the losses were esti-
mated at 100,000 bearing trees per year. At present, losses from this disease
are estimated at 200,000 to 250,000 plants per year. Affected trees drop
their nuts, the growing point and inflorescence turn black and the leaves



ANNEX 5
Page 17
turn yellow or bronze. The process may take as little as a year or as long
as five, but the Jamaica Tall palm shows no resistance and, on average, by
the third year after the disease appears in a farm, commercial production
ceases almost completely.
Coconut Industry Board (CIB)
46.       The Coconut Industry Board is a statutory body created in 1945.
It has nine members, five elected by coconut growers and four nominated by
the Government. It is an efficient and well run organization whose principal
objectives are to organize the orderly disposal of coconuts and other oil-
bearing crops to the best advantage of growers and to assist them in growing
these crops. The Board enjoys exclusive rights to purchase copra from copra
producers and to sell copra to local processors. This privilege includes
imports and exports of copra. The Board finances all these operations from
a 1 cent cess per lb on all coconut products consumed in Jamaica. 1/ It receives
no Government subvention or financing. 2/
Production Levels and Demand
47.       The current level of copra production is about 17,300 short tons
per year. To this should be added some 550 tons copra equivalent of coconuts
used for planting, processing, and such. This level of production is expected
to decrease in the period 1973-77 as the damaging effect of Lethal Yellowing
will affect production before the replanting with Malayan Dwarf varieties is
able to compensate for losses due to the disease. The following table gives
the supply and demand position for the period 1964-72 and projections to 1990:
1/   It therefore includes imported coconut oil.
2/   Fertilizers provided by the Board, as by all other statutory bodies in
Jamaican agriculture, carry a 20% Government subsidy.

/1   Projections of demand are not based on a fixed rate of increase per year,
as a degree of substitution of coconut oil by other vegetable oils is
taking place.
/2   The figures in the table exclude coconuts used for seed and exports of
frozen coconuts.
/3   The CIB hopes to achieve self-sufficiency by 1980 if it can increase
the rate of planting in the 1970-72 period. It does not seem a likely
development.
Declines in production are not only due to Lethal Yellowing but also to labor
probletns. Shortage of labor occurs in the reaping season, especially in farms
which have the Jamaica Tall variety, as workers refuse to climb the palms to
collect the nuts.
Processing
48.       Copra is dried in 53 factories, 49 of which are located in the
parishes of St. Thomas, St. Mary and Portland. 1/ About half of them are owned
by growers while the other half are owned by commercial concerns. A farmer
who converts his coconuts to copra increases their sale value by nearly 20%,
but growers who deliver coconuts to copra factories are automatically covered
by the insurance regulations relating to Lethal Yellowing and windstorm
damage. This operates as an extra incentive to them. During the early 1960s,
copra-drying facilities constituted a bottleneck at processing time in
some areas, but since then, diminished production and increased number of
factories have solved that problem.
1/   St. Thomas: 21 factories;  St. Mary: 15;  and Portland: 13.

Prices
49.       Prices for nuts and copra are fixed.  From 1946 to 1967, they
remained practically the same, after which a policy of fixing them for seven-
year periods was to be followed. Decreasing interest in planting new orchards
and dissatisfaction of coconut producers, however, forced price increases in
1970, 1972, and again in 1973 (see below).

/1   A "unit" of coconuts is formed by:  135 lb of Jamaica Tall nuts, or 155
lb of Malayan Dwarf, or 170 lb of Panama Tall. Approximately 50 units
produce 1 short ton of copra.
/2   The incentive system used by CIB is very effective, resulting, on an
average, in 95-97% copra being grade 1, which is rated as "excellent"
by world standards.
Despite these adjustments, actual prices have not been high enough to attract
many new farmers into coconut growing.
Marketing
50.       Grower prices are for husked nuts placed at any copra drier that is
rarely more than 10 miles from any grower. The CIB pays a transport allowance
of J$ 1.50 per ton to farmers for nut deliveries to the factories. To the
copra maker, the transportation subsidy is of J$ 3.00 per ton of copra de-
livered in Kingston. The guaranteed grower price is in effect a guaranteed
farmgate price. The Board is required by law to purchase all the copra and
coconuts produced in the island.

Exports
51.       Even though Jamaica has become a net importer of copra and coconut
oil, some coconut products continue to be exported, as shown below. Frozen
coconuts continued to be the most important item in 1972 and showed a small
increase in value over the previous year, although volume declined. This
decline was more than compensated for, however, by the large increase in the
volume and value of seed coconuts exported, mainly to Florida where Lethal
Yellowing has begun to appear.

Services to Coconut Growers
52.       Iindstorm Insurance Scheme.  The CIB operates an insurance scheme
for loss of bearing trees from hurricane or floods, but benefits are not
payable for the loss of crop or young trees. They are calculated according
to the growers' actual deliveries of coconut to copra factories in preceding
years, with a maximum coverage of J$ 8.00 per tree (US$8.80), and are payable
only when a minimum 5% loss of trees occurs and when at least 50% of the
stand has been replanted. In 1972, CIB's liability for hurricane insurance
was J$ 8.2 million, of which 56% is reinsured with the Lloyd's Group, London.
53.       Lethal Yellowing Replanting Scheme.  CIB offers to grant assistance
to registered growers of some J$ 58.00 per acre, including planting material,
which represents 50-66% of costs of replanting (J$ 75 for four years). Farmers
are eligible for the grant when 2.5% of Lethal Yellowing losses are recorded.
Since its inception, the scheme has granted some J$ 178,400 to farmers, and
by 1972 it had distributed more than half of the 2 million Malayan Dwarf trees
planted in the island. Seedlings available in 1970 totalled 344,000 and in
1971, 511,000: in 1972, CIB and private nurseries were aiming at a target
of one million seedlings planted each year, for at least a four-year period. 1/
54.       The Malayan Dwarf variety shows a high resistance to the disease
even when interplanted with Jamaica Tall. The dwarf is less susceptible to
hurricane damage, bears earlier and yields more. It also presents the com-
parative advantage of easier harvesting.
1/   In 1972, 1.12 million seedlings were available and 0.61 million (roughly
50%) actually planted on the fields. No data for 1973 were yet available.



ANNEX 5
Page 21
55.       Research.  For obvious reasons, CIB's research programs have, for
the past 11 years, been concentrated on the Lethal Yellowing Disease. After
years of abortive research to identify it and the vector, a breakthrough in
arresting and reversing symptoms In diseased trees has been reported by a
team of research workers at the University of the West Indies. The control
results from the action of an antibiotic drug, tetracycline, on tiny mycoplasms
in diseased coconut palms. Scientists have found clear indication that Lethal
Yellowing would appear to be related to the presence of this tiny organism
and it is believed that the disease is carried from one tree to another.
Although the treatment is effective, it is said to be too expensive at present
and therefore not recommended for commercial use. It is therefore unlikely
that this development will substantially affect the coconut industry in
Jamaica in the foreseeable future.
56.       The Board research staff comprises:  three university graduate
scientists, four trained field officers, six laboratory technicians and 19
experienced field assistants. Other fields of research have dealt with
fertilizer use and improved cultural practices.
57.       Extension.  The Board advisory staff comprises one advisory officer,
one assistant advisory officer, one coordinator and six district officers.
They are of generally good professional standihg and provide good quality
services to the farmer and effective feedback to CIB. On the whole, the
Board operates efficiently and has the confidence of coconut growers.
F. Other Tree Crops
Mango
58.       A small allocation (US$0.33 million out of the total Project cost)
has been made for mango and avocado cultivation in response to a strong
interest expressed by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Jamaica Development
Bank (JDB). This assumes about 30 loans to provide groves of about 25 acres.
59.       Existing cultivation of mango is mainly in mixed tree-crop groupings
and there are few orchards. Records indicate a total of some 250,000 trees,
if average yields are assumed.  On a pure-stand orchard basis, this is the -
equivalent of 5,000 acres at 50 trees per acre. The Project provides for a
4% increase in mango production, or 200 acres.
60.       The Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) has indicated that
supply falls short of demand, even for the local market, and this is parti-
cularly true of the large, colorful mangoes for the tourist trade. There is
also a demand for export fruit which cannot be fully met.



ANNEX 5
Page 22
61.       Mangoes have been grown successfully on the island for many centuries
and known diseases are readily controlled. There is a need for variety se-
lection and better cultivation practices, however, and it is expected that
loan support and technical assistance would stimulate the use of improved
techniques.
Avocado
62.       Present production comes mainly from seedling trees in mixed tree
crop cultivation and, based on normal yields and planting distances, corres-
ponds to 90,000 trees, or 1,300 acres. This, however, is barely sufficient
to supply domestic demand and there is a growing market for export fruit.
63.       Since little or no experience is available in Jamaica concerning
commercial avocado production on a large scale, and root rot is prevalent
in poorly drained areas, careful selection of growing areas is being recom-
mended for small groves of 20 acres. At the same time, variety sUlection
will provide more uniform fruits of high quality for the domestic market and
should stimulate the present interest in export fruit. Additionai acreage
under the Project would amount to approximately 200 acres, or an increase of
26%, based on present production capacity. More important, however, is the
need to improve the techniques to be used for both cultivation and marketing,
and technical assistance would be provided under the Project to meet this need.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Jamaica Development Bank
General
1.        Government of Jamaica established the Jamaica Development Bank
(JOB) in 1969 under the Jamaica Development Bank Act to take over the assets
and liabilities of its predecessor, the Development Finance Corporation and
to finance sound projects in the industrial, agricultural and tourism sectors
on the basis of technical and financial appraisal. To this end, JDB may make
loans and investments in new or existing enterprises, guarantee credits from
other sources, participate in mortgage credit and support security issues.
JDB functions as the Government agency for channelling external resources
into development of enterprises in Jamaica.. In the short period of its
active operation, JDB has built up satisfactory expertise in Project appraisal
and supervision and expanded its operations substantially, with loan approvals
expanding from J$ 5.2 million in 1970 to J$ 9.8 million in 1972.
Capital and Reserves
2.        JDB's authorized share capital, wUich had been J$ 10 million at
establishment, was raised in 1973 to J$ 20 mlillion. The amount paid up, as
of December 31, 1973, was J$ 12.92 million- J$ 7.75 million by the Government
of Jamaica and the balance by the Bank of Jamaica. JDB's reserves were made
up of (a) a capital reserve of J$ 0.3 million, representing a surplus from
the revaluation of JDB's shares in the Hotel Corporation of Jamaica (HCJ),
less amounts written off (para 7); (b) a special reserve fund of J$ 83,345
created in compliance with the statutory requirement that at least 25% of
the bank's net profit be contributed to this reserve till it is equal to
JDB's paid-up share capital; and (c) a reserve against losses, amounting to
J$ 1.1 million, also created from appropriations out of earnings, from which
bad debts may be written off from time to time (para 5).
Borrowings
3.        JDB's borrowings as of December 31, 1973 consisted principally of an
outstanding loan of J$ 4.2 million from the Government and an amount of
J$ 13.0 million, due to external sources and disbursements. The amount
outstanding under several lines of credit on July 31, 1973 was as shown
below:

Export Import Bank                               US$3.0
Barclays Bank International                      J$ 2.0
IDB                                              Us$5.2
Lira  500.0
IBRD                                             US$3.7
CIDA                                    Canadian $ 1.3
JDB's total liabilities should not exceed seven times its paid up capital
and reserves according to its statute, but the Loan Agreement for the First
Agricultural Credit Project stipulates a smaller limit of three times which
should not.be exceeded, without the Bank's prior approval. The debt-equity
ratio as of July 31, 1973 was only 1.1:1.
Loan Operations
4.        The following table brings out the progress and diversification of
JDB's loan operations since 1970:
(J$ million)
1970      1971        1972
Manufacture                             2.96       3.69        4.72
Tourism                                 1.23       3.18        1.70
Agriculture                             0.72       1.14        2.43
Service industries                      0.10       0.06        0.15
Storage, warehousing, etc.              0.17       0.64        0.81
Total                          5.18      8.71        9.81
The loans outstanding rose from J$ 8.33 million in September 1969 (repre-
senting loans transferred from the Development Finance Corporation) to
J$ 20.45 million as of July 31, 1973. The number of loans approved rose
from 50 in 1970 to 123 in 1972. There has also been an effort to lower the
size of individual loans so as to assist a larger number of small- and medium-
size enterprises, as shown below:
1970      1971        1972
Total No. of loans                              50         98         123
No. of loans under J$ 75,000                    27         67           88
Average size of loans (J$)                   103,814    88,901      79,797
Arrears of Loans
5.        Most of the arrears in JDB's loan portfolio are related to the
loans transferred to it by the Development Finance Corporation, while only
a small amount was overdue in respect of loans advanced since JDB's establish-



ANNEX 9
Page 3
mpnt. Arrears of 30 days and over as of August 31, 1973 amounted to J$ 0.56.
million (or about 2.7% of the loan portfolio of J$ 20.5 million) and were
lArgely accounted for by industrial loans. JDB's Loan Administration Depart-
ment keeps the overdues position constantly under review and takes the
necessary follow-up action. After scrutiny of the equity investments and
the loan portfolio, it was estimated that provision of about $800,000 would
be appropriate for loans which may prove irrecoverable and a sum of J$ 301,826
was transferred from JDB's 1972 earnings to its special reserve for losses,
raising the reserve to J$ 755,521.
JDB's Subsidiaries
6.        Jamaica Ceramics Industries (JCI) and the Hotel Corporation of
Jamaica (HCJ) are two wholly-owned subsidiaries of JDB that it inherited from
the Development Finance Corporation. JCI had run into severe production
difficulties and, after all efforts for reorganizing it or selling it failed,
the firm was taken into liquidation. The winding up is to be completed and
the property is to be sold. JDB is confident that this will be accomplished
shortly on terms satisfactory to it.
7.        The shares of HCJ, which owns the Jamaica Hilton Hotel, were trans-
ferred to JDB in 1969 after being revalued on the basis of the cost of
building and equipping a hotel in a similar location, and the unrealized gain
was credited to JDB's capital reserve (para 2). JDB has been trying to
transfer this investment (which appears excessive and of doubtful profit-
ability) to Government but has not so far succeeded. The present proposal
is to have HCJ taken over by a new company, National Hotels and Properties
Limited (NHP), which has been formed as a subsidiary of the Urban Development
Corporation to assume Government interests in all hotel projects. NHP is
now studying HCJ's accounts and evaluating its properties. JDB's balance
sheet shows the value of the HCJ shares at J$ 1,250,000 and the loan liability
from it at about J$ 3.4 million. JDB is confident that net book assets of
HCJ after meeting JDB loan dues would exceed the value of its shares as shown
in JDB's books and that there would be no loss to JDB in the event of the
transfer of its interests in HCJ to NHP.
8.        JDB is setting up, as its subsidiary, a new company known as the
Development Venture Capital Financing Limited to provide risk or venture
capital to development enterprises. The company will be funded initially
through Government equity and will finance such ventures by providing equity
(J$ 10,000 to J$ 50,000) and medium- or long-term loans which may not be
adequately secured. JDB also holds 51% of the share capital of the Jamaica
Unit Trust Services Limited, which operates as the management company of the
Jamaica Investment Fund. The units help to bring to non-traditional savers
and investors of modest means the benefits of investment in a diversified
portfolio of stocks and shares that is managed professionally so as to combine
a good rate of return with the minimum risk.



ANNEX 9
Page 4
Financial Position
9.        As may be seen from the summary of JDB's balance sheets and profit
loss accounts from 1970 to 1973 (Table 1), JDB is improving its earnings from
year to year. Its net income before provision for losses increased from
J$ 84,000 in 1970 to J$ 586,000 in 1973, reflecting the fact that its income
from loan operations has risen faster than its expenditure on staff for project
appraisal and loan administration.
Organization and Management
10.       JDB's Board of Management, nominated by the Minister of Finance,
consists of 11 members, including the Chairman and representatives of the
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. The directors are appointed for
three to five years, subject to removal only by the Minister of Finance or
by the unanimous vote of all the other members of the Board. A major change
made since the commencement of the First Project is the appointment of a
Chairman cum Managing Director as the chief executive of JDB in replacement
of the earlier arrangements under which JDB had a part-time Chairman and a
full-time Managing Director.
11.       Another recent change was the abolition of the erstwhile post of
the Deputy Managing Director and the establishment of two senior positions:
(a) the Director of Operations, with overall responsibility for the work of
the Industrial, Tourism and Agricultural Departments, including the processing
of loans, disbursement of funds and implementation of approved projects; and
(b) the Director of Economic Planning and Research, who is responsible for
the bank's economic activities, including market research, mobilization of
loanable funds, project identification, economic reports and special projects
(details are shown in Chart 1). At the end of September 1973, JDB had a staff
of 76, including 26 professional and technical staff. The senior staff of
JDB are well qualified in terms of academic training as well as practical
experience and the terms and conditions of JDB service have been such as to
attract competent personnel at all levels.
12.       JDB's Agricultural Department is headed by a Manager who had served
earlier as Livestock Specialist. He studied in universities in Australia and
New Zealand and had useful experience in livestock research and management
before joining JDB. He also spent two months with the Bank to familiarize
himself with Bank policies and procedures for appraisal and supervision of
agricultural projects. He is assisted by an internationally recruited agri-
cultural economist, a Jamaican livestock specialist who is well qualified
and has considerable practical experience in livestock work in Jamaica and
a Jamaican economist recently recruited to understudy the internationally
recruited economist. These are supported by two project officers and Rhree
assistant project officers.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The rates of return from the project to the economy have been
calculated separately for each farm model (Table 1) on the following
assumptions:
(a) Output Prices
(i) Beef
A price of US$38.5 cwt liveweight has been used.
It compares with the last "pink sheet" and recent
world commodity trade prices of US$34.6 and US$49.0
cwt liveweight respectively, in USA. It is also similar
to those of Mexican steers ("border price") transacted
recently at US$38.0. 1/ Import prices have not been
considered adequate mainly because of differences of beef
quality and type of consumer. Imports of beef are only
"prime grade" and consumed by the tourist trade while
local production is at best "standard", and of variable
quality. Besides, the further adjustments necessary for
rendering prices comparable (from liveweight, farmgate
price to frozen, carcass, c.i.f. as quoted on inter-
national transactions) would seriously affect the quality
of data. The constant price assumed, however, would
underestimate the economic rate of return, as, contrary
to earlier indications, the latest forecasts of the
Economic Analysis and Projections Department envisage an
annual rate of increase of 1.8Z between 1974 and 1980
and a further acceleration in the following five years.
Furthermore, internal beef prices in Jamaica have been
steadily increasing between April 1973 and October 1973
(appraisal date) and the trend promises to continue.
(ii) Milk
Current domestic prices have been used as in several
other livestock projects, milk being treated as a "non-
tradeable" commodity.
I/   Source:   Commodity Trade: The Wall Street Journal, February 12, 1974.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
(iii)  Citrus
The prices used are slightly lower than current domestic
prices and appreciably lower than those in comparable
markets, as shown below:
Oranges: A price of US$1.87 per box of 80 lbs has been
used, which compares with Florida prices of US$2.00 for
oranges for juice and US$4.50 for fresh fruit.
Grapefruit: A price of US$1.10 per box of 90 lbs has
been used as compared to Florida price of US$1.25 for
fruit for juice and US$5.50 for fresh fruit.
Jamaican oranges (about 75% of all citrus production)
do not,have natural competitive advantages for export
because of unattractive skin color and fairly tough
cellulose. Also, internal demand due to increased tourist
trade has created a strong demand for orange and grapefruit
juice (where the disadvantages mentioned earlier are not
relevant) and led to a situation of fruit shortage in the
island.
(iv)  Copra
A constant price of US$221.76(lg ton), corresponding to
the local price at appraisal has been used.  This repre-
sents a rough average of present international price
(c.i.f., Europe) of US$258.30 per long ton of copra, and
projected price for 1980 of US$167.90 (lg ton). 1/
(b) Current price levels have been used for investment and
operating costs with due allowances for prevailing taxes,
customs duties on imported items and subsidies as shown
below:
Import Duties:       Pumps: 15%
Pipes under 2" diameter: 22%.
Subsidies: 2/
Dairy          Pasture improvement (in addition to
fertilizers): 50% of the cost of estab-
lishment up to a maximum of J$ 20 per
acre and a limit of 25 acres per farmer.
1/   Economic Analysis and Projections Department estimate.
2/   A number of subsidies were discontinued during the 1970-73 period,
Animal Feed Subsidy and Farm Mechanization Subsidy being the more
important ones.



ANNEX 11
Page 3
Dairy          Installations and equipment:  up to J$ 100
per farmer.
Citrus         Citrus plants nurseries receive a 30 cents
subsidy from the government, per plant
sold. I/
Fertilizer:    20% of market value.
Farm buildings (animal sheds and storage facilities):
up to J$ 200 per farmer.
(c) Salvage values proportional to unexpired asset life have been
included.
(d) Labor has been costed at 80% of the current prevailing rates.
2.        On the basis of the relative share of various models in total Project
cost relating to on-farm investment, the overall economic rate of return is 26%.
