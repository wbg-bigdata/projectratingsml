INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE JAMAICA DEVELOPMENT BANK WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF JAMAICA
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.       I submit the fo'llowing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Jamaica Development ;3ank (JDB) with the guarantee of Jamaica
for the equivalent of US$5.5 million to help finance a second agricultural
credit project.  The loan would have a term of 16 years, including four
years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4% per annum. The Guarantor would charge
JDB a fee of one-half of one percent per annum for carrying the foreign
exchange risk.
PART I - THE EGONOMY
2.       Economic Keport (No. 257a-JX) entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaica" was distributed to the Executive Directors on
March 12, 1974.   Country data sheets are attached as Annex I to this report.
3.       During the decade 1962-72 the economy has expanded rapidly with
the annual rate of growth accelerating from about 4.5% to about 5.5%. At
the same time the economy has undergone major structural changes. Mining,
alumina production and tourism, all supported by large private capital
inflows, have expanded, while agriculture has stagnated and agricultural
exports, notably of sugar, have declined. This shift in the production
pattern has been accompanied by rapid urbanization, and by the emergence
of severe and persistent unemployment and of sharp disparities in income
distribution. Large-scale emigration abroad during the decade has resulted
in the loss of significant numbers of skilled and semi-skilled workers; the
consequent shortage of technically qualified personnel has been aggravated
by deficiencies in the academically oriented educational system.
14.      As a result of its limited resource endowment and the small size
of its domestic market, Jamaica has a very open economy heavily dependent
on the external sector. Until 1972 a widening current account deficit in
the balance of payments had been offset by substantial private capital in-
flows for expansion of the bauxite/alumina industry. These inflows fell
off sharply in 1972 with the completion of major investments in alumina
capacity. Partly as a consequence, but also due to some weakness in
monetary and fiscal programs, Jamaica for the first time since independence
experienced serious balanoe of payments difficulties. Corrective action
taken late in 1972 and earlX 1973, including devaluations, the imposition
of import restrictions and a tightening of credit policy, was successful
in temporarily reversing the reserves drain during the middle of 1973.
However, subsequently exchange reserves have fallen again and by the end



-2-
of 1973 were downr to about one month s imnports.  The situaltion has been
a-gravated Dy the tripling ofpetroleum prices at the end of 1973 which
wi'1 cost Jamaica about US$100 million extra in 1974, equivalent to about
c8 of 1973 exoort earrnings. To conserve foreign exchange reserves the
6overruient in early 1974 took additional measures includirng an increase
in gasoline taxes, further restrictions on imports and credit availability
and an increase in interest rates. Faurther tax increases will be necessary
and other meas-ares being contemplated include additional foreign borrowing,
including loans of a quickly disbursing natiure. Jamaica has recently ne-
gotiated an increase in the price of its sugar exports to tuhe United Kingdom
and is negotiating with the mining companies for an increase in revenues
from bauxite and alumina exports. The measures recently taken by the govern-
ment and the prospect of increased export earnings should provide some re-
lief to Jamaica's balance of payments difficulties in 1974/5, although the
situation will remain tight.
In recent months there has been a sharp increase in Jamaica's
domestic price level which during 1973 increased by an average of 19% over
the previous year. In part the increase can be attributed to recent in-
creases in world prices and higher import- prices resulting from devaluation.
However, under the pressure of active trade unions, wage settlements in
recent years have outstripped increases irn productivity and have been part-
icularly high during the last few months, reaching 25% in 'the constriction
industry and even higher levels in other sectors. The government is
considering the early implementation of a prices and incomes policy.which,
if effective, would help Jamaica retain its international competitiveness
and would facilitate the process of adjustment. The government is keeping
under review action to progressively increase interest rates, which have
become negative in real terms as a result of recent price inflation.
This would encourage savings, and help reduce the present interest rate
incentive to invest funds abroad rather than in Jamaica.
6.       Over the medium- and longer-term Jamaica will need to take action
to reduce the risk of further foreign exchange crises and consequent cons-
traints upon economic growth. Without a sustained rate of economic growth
it will be difficult for the colantry to achieve its principal objective of
a significant reduction in the high rate of unemployment, currently about
15%. The need for increased job creation will become even more acute in
the years ahead since the growth rate in the total population of working
age is expected to rise from 0.5% to 3% during the period to 1980 due to
falling emigration and an increase in the birth rate in the 1950s. For
the immediate future the potential for increased growth and employment
is encouraging. In agriculture, a comprehensive review of the sector has
recently been undertaken with assistance from the Bank; government initia-
tives are already under way to rehabilitate the important sugar industry,
and other goverment plans to revitalize the sector include land-use reorga-
nization to increase productivity and employment, and measures to stimulate
other export crops and domestic food production. In the mining sector,
bauxite and alumina output should increase substantially as a result of
recent and prospective investments. A substantial inavestment in an oil



refinery is in prospect with the possibility of associated investments in
petro-chemicals; and in manufacturing, there is potential for increased
contribution to export growth. However, the extent to which Jamaica's
agricultural and industrial growth potential can be realized will depend
in large part on how successful the govermnent is in implementing policies
to improve Jamaica's competitive position and to overcome existing insti-
tutional constraints.
7.       In order to reduce unemployment significantly Jamaica will need
to achieve an increased rate of growth of about 7% annually.  This will
require substantially higher inflows of private and public capital than
in the recent past. Such inflows are in prospect over the next few years
and given continued progress in public policies, it is likely that tha
could be maintained for the rest of the decade. The source and direction
of commitments of external public loans (including government-guaranteed
loans ) from 1965 to 1972 are given in the table in Annex I and have averaged
over $40 million per annum. For the five-year period 1974-78, public
capital inflows including guaranteed loans to the private sector, could
reach J$450 milYion. From existing indioations, about 60% will be raised
from official sources - the Bank, IDB ancd bilateral aid sources, while the
remainder would consist of medium-term loans from suppliers and financial
institutions. Private capital inflows in the form of equity and loan pay-
ments are also forecast to be substantially above the recent past, mainly
because of private loans projected for the proposed oil refinery. Jamaica
will also need to mobilize increased domestic financial resources, both
public and private. It will thus be necessary for the government to take
measures to restrain the growth of government current expenditures and to
achieve a further growth of revenue relative to GDP. A recovery in private
sector savings can also be expected provided the government maintains fiscal
discipline and discourages consumption by the appropriate use of monetary
policy.
8.       Jamaica will need to take prompt and determined policy measures
in the critical areas of the economy outlined above, and discussed at
greater length in the Economic Report, to maintain economic stability and
achieve a reasonable rate of sustained economic growth. Assuming sound
policies are pursued, public debt service as a ratio of export earnings
is projected to rise from about 4.0% in 1972 to perhaps 7.5% by 1980.
Given the importance of exports in Jamaica's GNP, this ratio is high but
not unmanageable, and the country remains creditworthy for further borrow-
ing on conventional terms. Although no special terms of Bank lending
appear justified on country grounds, the foreign exchange component of projects
in sectors such as agriculture, urban development and population planning,
may be relatively small; in order, therefore, to help achieve an adequate
level of external capital inflows some local currency financing would be
justified in these cases. While it has not yet been possible to assess
fully the impact of higher petroleum prices on the Jamaican economy, the
rise in export earnings in prospect from bauxite, alumina and sugar exports
should by the late 1970's substantially mitigate the effects of the increased
cost of petroleum imports (paragraphs 4 and 6 above). The Bank will review
the situation more closely, with particular emphasis on the external sector,
during a mission to the country planned for May.



?AiT r   - BANIC -RoE? OPE ATONS !N J.HAICA
Lr-. ,roduction
Since the country 's independence in 1962, the Bank has made nine
;Loans to Jamaica totalling nearly '5.0 miillion. Obo this amount aut
half has baer. for infrastructural invaestment in electric power, water
supoly and highways; the remainder has gore into aducation, family plan-
'n- agr-cu-lt.ral cradit and a recent s-ies and services project.    The
prorosed loan would be the second for agricu-tural credit, the first having
been made in December, 197G. There hava so far been only tuwo I'C opera-
tions; a _oan in 1961 to a concrete company, ard an equity/loan inrvestment
in 1968 in a hotel project.  Annex II contaLns a suriary statement of EBank
loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1974 together with notes on the
execution of on-going projects.  As noted in the Ann3x, the Bank has ex-
perienced -problems in the execution of projects in Jaaaica, although the
situation has improved in recent months.
Future Direction of Bank Lending
10.      The case for continued Bank lending rests on the need to provide
some of Jamaica's external financing requirements and to support appropriate
policies in critical areas of the economy mentioned in Part I of this report.
As in the past, Bank lending will also be directed towards achieving improve-
ments in infrastructure, at contributing to the alleviation of the unemploy-
men' problem, and to assisting in the wider distribution of the benefits
of growth. Following recent Bank participation in an agricultural sector
survey in Jamaica (see paras. 13 and 16) we expect an increasing emphasis
on this sector in the Bank's future operations in the country. After a
slowdown in Bank lending in 1972/73-due largely to institutionaL constraints
and slow project preparation - the pace of Bank operations is expected to
accelerate over the next few years. The Bank's share of extermnal public
debt is projected to increase from an estimated 15% in 1974 to about 20%
in 1978 and its share of external pu-blic debt service to increase from
10% to 12% over the same period.
i1       In infrastructure, the Bank plans to continue to lend support to high
priority investments in the transportation sector which were identified by a
transportation survey financed by the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) and carried out in 1968/70. Thus a highway project for constrwution of
about 20 miles of arterial roads and an airport development project will shortly be
ready for presentation to the Executive Directors. Other infrastructure invest-
ments being considered would have as a primary objective improving essential
facilities for the rapidly expanding Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA), which
itself accounts for over one-quarter (about 550,000) of tha total population
of Jamaica and a large proportion of its industry and commrce, A p-roposeRd sewer-
age and water supply project would provide limited extension of Kingston's
sewerage system to meet its most urgent needs, and also additional water



so as to avoid shortages which would otherwise develop over the next 3 to
4 years. The project would also include engineering studies and prepara-
tory work necessary for the next major water supply project for Bank
financing. More widely,the proposed infrastructural investments would
help strengthen the institutions concerned.
12.      In the social areas we propose to continue our association with
the education sector with a third education project.  However, the scope
of this project will not be defined until the conclusions of a recerrt survey
of the education sector, undertaken by AID with Bank participation, -have
been considered and more progress made in implementing the ongoing second
project. Further ahead, it is expected that a second family planning
project, which might include a nutritional component, would be considered.
13.      In the directly productive sectors, the Bank is already involved
in agriculture through a loan to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) for on-
lending for agricultural credits and a second loan is now before you for
consideration. At the request of the government, the Bank assisted in
the conduct of an agricultural sector survey in 1972/73 with a view to re-
vitalizing this sector as a means of promoting exports, stimulating
import substitution and helping to check the population drift from the
rural to the urban areas. We axpact to be able to assist the government
in implementing the program of action which has emerged from this study.
Detailed feasibility studies are already under way which should result in
a project for Bank financing to rehabilitate the important sugar industry.
Looking further ahead, it is expected that the government would wish the
Bank to assist in the preparation and financing of a project designed to
ameliorate the situation of small farmers; the content and scope of such
a project have not yet been defined but may take the form of a ru.ral de-
velopment project including components for improving land utilization and
crop production.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN JAMAICA
14.      During the past decade agricultural output lagged behind the
growth of the rest of the economy, growing at an annual average of 1.3%
compared with a rate of about 3% in the 1950's. Despite this weak per-
formance and the related fall in agricultural employment, the sector continues
to be the most important employer of labor,absorbing over one-third of
the total labor force. Agricultural products (US$66.0 million) account
for about 18% of total exports with sugar (US$42.0' million) and bananas
(US$15.0 million) being the principal items.  Food items account for an
almost equal share of imports and consist mainly of meat, milk, fish,
cereals and related products.
1>.      The performance d export crops has been especially poor. Due
ii rgely to drought, antipathy of labor to workicLng on the estates, manage-
ment weakness and obsolete machinery, sugar output declined from a peak
of 500,000 in 1966 to about 370,000 tons in 1972; banana production has



iso Deer. dec irning and expozts haava Uroppe` off, n _a-ry for reasons of
inadeoi±atve Te Lno1ogy and transportat ion. Other traditional export crops,
such as pimento, ccffee and cinger have also Deen stagnant or declining
4n recent years.
15.     The yields of most crops (for example, sugar, bananas and vege-
tables, are wiell below what they could be. However, if productivity can
,be raised, the natural envirornment in Jamaica provides sufficient scope
'or mecreasing output substantially to meet the market potential at home
and abroad. In o^er to fo=nalate a plan for revitalizing the sector,
t'ne governm-aent in 1972/73 undertook a major agriculturl sector study with
the assistance of Bank staff and an international team of experts headad
by  Sir Arthur Lewis, then President of the Caribbean Development Bank.
Following the study, a policy paper outlining the govermentIs strategy
-or reforming the sector has recently been published and the Bank will
shortly be discussing with tne governmant, and other external aid agencies,
how best to implement an action program f-or agricultural development. As
part of this program, ano as noted in -paragraph 13 above, the Bank expects
to assist the government in financing a project for the rehabilitation of
the sugar industry, which at present is not equ.ipped to tlake full advantage
of the improved prospects for tihis coimmodity. Furthermore, with the rising
demand for beef and milk for the tourist market and for domestic consumption,
there is considerable scope for increasing production and reducing the
heavy dependence on imports by developing imsproved pastures, better farm
management, and better processing facilities. Credit for increased beef
and dairy products would be included in the project now before you for
z,onsideration.
17.      A major concern of the government is how to improve the livelihood
of those small farmers presently cultivatin- about 145,000 farms with less
than fPive acres. The farms are frequently :ound on the hilly and less
fertile areas and such units are generally too small to generate satisfactory.
levels of income. The agricultural sector study emphasized the need to
develop an appropriate land policy including the encouragement of the
amalgamation of small holdings, the making available of additional land
ior farmers whose holdings are uneconomic, the utilization of currently
idle land, improved rural infrastructure and increased productivity through
irrigation and drainage. The government is already taking steps to reform-
ulate its land policy. As part of the gpvernment project GRAW (Growing
and Reaping our Wealth), a land lease program is in operation under which
land owned or leased by the government from private owners is released
to small farmers to increase the size of their holdings; about 10,000
small farmers are expected to be placed on 25 000 acres of land, in addition
to their existing holdings, by ths end of 19741. The GRIW project also in-
cludes a few large govermnent farms--called Food Farms--which cover about
25,000 acres and these are likely to be developed eventually into long-term
leasehold property occupied by small farmers organized into service co-
operatives. As mentioned in paragraph 13 above, the Bank plans
to assist the government in preparing and subsequently financing a
Project specifically directed at improving the livelihood of small farmers.



-7-
Institutions
18.      The Ministry of Agriculture is administratively responsible for
several agencies, division, and statutory boards working in the agricul-
tural sector.  The functions and responsibilities of the Ministry and
other agricultural institutions are in many instances ill-defined and
overlapping, which leads to confusion and lack of control. The Ministry's
agricultural extension service is handicapped by lack of transportation,
understaffing in vital areas, poor salaries, and ovorlapping with the
staff of the commodity boards, who are better paid and trained.   The
commodityr boards, such as the Coconut Industry Board and the Banana Board,
have the main responsibility for the marketing of export crops; in the
marketing of the other crops which are mainly sold in the local parish
markets, dominated by individual traders ("higglers"),an increasing role
is being played by the government- owned Agricultural Marketing Corpora-
tion (AMC), which also exports a few crops and acts as the sole importer
of food grains. The agricultural sector study concluded that the present
marketing system is costly, and that improved coordination particularly
in the areas of transportation and shipping was required; it is expected
that, following the study's recommendations, the government will shortly
undertake a detailed review of the organization, responsibilities and
operations of the Ministry of Agriculture and the related statutory bodies
so as to remedy their present weaknesses.
Agricultural Credit
19.      The major institutional source of agricultural credit in Jamaica
has been the Agricultural Credit Board (ACB), a government owned-body;
the ACB channels credit, under the largely government-financed Farmers
Development Program, mostly to mnall farmers through the Peoples' Co-
operative Banks (PCB's) and regional land authorities. Most of the 115
PCB's are handicapped by a weak capital base, unsatisfactory maintenance
of accounts and poor loan collections. Until recently the ACB also admi-
riistered the IDB-financed Self-Supporting Farmers' Development Program
(SSFDP). This program finances, ordinarily, farms between 5 and 25 acres
and farmers with assets not exceeding US$25,000. Loans are at interest
rates of 6% for short-term and 4% for long-term. The cost of the program,
established in 1969/70, is estimated at US$17.5 million for its first
two stages and US$15.8 million in its on-going third stage. Management
of the program was recently transferred from the ACB to the Jamaica
Development Bank (JDB), in an effort to improve financial administration
of the program. Agricultural credit is also available from the commodity
boards. Among private institutional sources, the commercial banks are
the most important and provide mainly short-term credit.
First Agricultural Credit Project
20.      The JDB is the main government agency for term lending to   the
agricultural, industrial and tourist sectors. It was the Borrower under



-C-
rne first Bank-fina-nced agr cul tural credit project, to which the proposed
nrcject is a follow-on. The first Bank Loan of US$3.7 mill'on, made in
December 1970, was to assist in financing an on-farm invest;nent program
amounting to US$6.3 million for beef, dairy, coconut and citrus production
and supportirng technical assistance. Sub-loans are for 10 to 15 years in-
Jlusive of grace period and carry interest at 8-3A4%. Until the end of
1972 coimaitments and disbursements ware slow due to  uncertainties about
tnve-stment in agriculture, inadequ;ate promotion, sub-borrowers' delays in
cc7mn,ying -Vrith collateral procedures and co-mpetitionr fromrr cormercial banks
wihich a-. true  in nad relatively &nea funds availabla for lending in the
sector. However, the JDB has since takei ste6ps to pblicize the program
and to ex:pedite approval procedures, wrhiie the govern,ment has made clear
the high priority it attacnes to investment in agriculture. The project
gathered momentur. during 1973 and by Miarch 31, 1974 US 3.1 million of the
3cnk loan liad been cormnitted and the loan is expec-ted to be fully committed
by the end of May 1974. Disbursements have been slow mainly because of
sub-borrowers' delays in confirming loan acceptance and completing other
Lormalities, and the closing date for the loan (December 31, 1974) may require
a short extension.
21.      Demand for sub-loans for livestock, particularly beef, has been
stronger than for crops because oi improved milk and beef prices; and in-
;erest in credit for coconut has been limited  because of goverimnent
subsidies available for replanting with disease resistant varieties.
Accordingly, at the request of the Borrower,the proceeds of the first
loan have been reallocated to reflect the changed pattern in demand.
Account has been taken of this in determining the provision for coconut
investments in the proposed second loan which will be mainly for farmers
entering the industry. The average size of the sub-loans up to the end
of 1973 was about J$54,000. The sub-loans were relatively large in the
early stages of the project as the demand at first was mainly for larger
loans and JDB's initial staffing and promotional efforts permitted it to
reach only a limited clientele. However, the average size of sub-loans
has fallen in recent months; in order to encourage JIB further in this
direction and to ensure a wider coverage, a-ipropriate provisions
have been included in the loan agreement for the second project (see
paragraph 29 below). It is too early to assess the impact of the project,
as most loans were approved in 1973 and have yet to be fully disbursed,
but some of the early sub-projects are showing satisfactory results.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.      The proposed project would essentially be a continuation and ex-
pansion of the on-going three year Bank-assisted program for investments
ln coconut, citrus, beef and milk. The project was prepared by JDB and
appraised in September/October 1973. Negotiations for the proposed loan
were held in Washington in April 1974; the negotiations for the Borrower



-9-
were led by Mr.N. Chin, Chairman/Maulaging Director of the MTB and for the
government by Mr. R. Mullings, Deputy Financial Secretary, Ministry of
Finance.
23.      A project appraisal report entitled "lJamaica - Second Agricultural
Credit Project" (No.350a-JM dated May 7, 1974 J is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and
project are summarized in Annex III hereto.
Project Description
24.      The project would support a two-year lending program of   JDB to
finance (a) on-farm investments for dairy, beef, citrus and coconut pro-
duction, and to a lesser extent, sheep, goats, mango and avocado; and (b)
agro-industrial activities. Technical assistance would also be provided.
The project would be aimed primarily at commercial farmers, with farm
sizes ranging typically from about 40 to 200 acres,   so as to increase
prodiction and thereby reduce the heavy dependence on imports, promote
expor-ts and meet the growing demand for tourist and domestic production.
The loan would be made to the JDB, with the guarantee of Jamaica; the JDB
would administer the project and loans would be made to sub-borrowers on
the basis of investment plans evaluated by the JDB as to their technical
and financial soundness.
a. On-Farm Investments
25.      Investments in dairy enterprises (about 41.0% of total estimated
on-farm investments) would include land development, pasture improvement,
fencing; water supply, dairy equipment and stock improvement. The major
investments in beef farms (about 23.0% of the total) would be in pasture
improvement andbreeding stock. Production of sheep and goats would be
developed alongside other livestock activity; i mVieMnts (together
about 4.0% of the total) would be mainly in pasture improvement, fencing,
water supply, sheds and breeding stock. On citrus and coconut farms, in-
vestment expenditures (about 27.0% of the total) would include land pre-
paration, machinery, equipment, fertilizers and pesticides. A mwall loan
allocation would be made for about 30 sub-loans for developmentof mango
and avocado (together about 4.0% of the total).
b. Agro-industries
26.      Under the category of agro-industries, activities such as market-
ing, processing and transportation of crops and livestock production and
manufacture of agricultural production prerequisites (e.g. cattle feed)
would be eligible for financing.    In particular, there is need for credit for
improved slaughterhouse facilities and for collecting, chilling and pasteurizing
the increased milk production expected to result from the Bank and IDB-
financed credit projects. A part of the Bank loan allocation under this



- 10) -
category (US$200,GCO) is earmarked for cooperatives, and a sum of US$100,000
would be available for maadng sub-loans to contractors who would provide
tractor sarvices 'or land preparation.
c. Technical Assistance
27.      Thr-e s^oiect woul d also incLuda -ach=ical asist e for (a) the
contirn-ation cf tha services of a.- aE cultral aconcaiis-t for two mo1ra

and goats, and t-ree crops., imcludiag, n1 particular, mango and avocado, and
(c) consultant se-vices for technical studies aaerngg completion reqired for
the formulation of a sugar rehabilitation project (see paragraph 13 above).
Project Cos-t and Financin
28.      The total cost of the project (net of duties and taxes) is estimated
at US$10.8 million. It would be financed as follows: the Bank loan of US$5.5
million would be equivalent to the estimatead foreign excha  cost, or e1%;
the JDB would contribute about US$3.5 million, or 32%; and sub-borrowers
would contribute US$1.8 million, or 17%. The Bank loan would be repayable
over 16 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4%.
Size of Sub-loans
29.      To encourage the JDB to make a larger proportion of relatively
small sub-loans under the second project than was achieved under the first
(see paragraph 21), the lower limit on ttB minimum size of sub-loans would
be reduced from1 J$20,000 to J$15,000 (smaller loans are available under the
SSFDP program financed by IDB), and at least one-third of the sub-loans approved
under the project during each year would be for J$35,000 or less. F'irthar, a
contribution of only 10% of the sub-proJect cost would be raquired from a sub-
borrower if the sub-loan (together with any earlier sub-loan to him) is for
J$35,000 or less, compared with 20% for larger sub-loans.
Relending Terms
30.      Sub-loans would be denominated in US dollars and would be for
periods ranging from 10 to 15 years including grace periods of three to
seven years at an interest rate of 10% per annum. In addition, theri
would be a commitment fee of at least 1/2% on undrawn balanoes and an
evaluation fee of at least 1/2%. The denomination of the sab-loans in
US dollars and the nominal interest rate and other charges agreed upon are
expected to result in ani adequate effective interest rate under the project
despite the relatively high rate of inflation in Jamaica (see paragraL±i 5),



The Janiican authorities last devalued the J$ in early 1973; further
adjustnents may be expected if domestic inflation continues at a high
rate.  The proposed interest rate of 10%, with the sub-loans donominated
in US dollars, compares with an interest rate on sub-loans under the first
Bank project of 8-3/4% and rates of 4% to 6% under the SSFDP, with sab-
loans being denominated in Jamaican dollars.
31.      Government would ultimately bear the foreign exchange risk in
respect of JDB's liability for servicing the Bank loan and would charge
JDB for this a fee of 1/2% per arrum. However, the proposal to denominate
sub-loans in US dollars would have the effect of reducing the foreign ex-
change risk in respect of depreciation of Jamaican currency vis-a-vis the
US dollar; government would therefore in effect have to cover only the
exchange risk on currencies other than the US dollar to the extent that the
Bank loan is repayable in such other currencies.
The Borrowing Institution
32.      JDB was established in 1969 with an initial authorized capital
of J$10 million which was raised to J$20 million in 1973.   Its paid-up
capital was increased from J$4.5 million at the end of 1969 to J$12.92
million in December 1973, comprising J$7.75 million from the government
and the balance from the central bank, the Bank of Jamaica. In addition,
JDB has borrowed J$4.2 million from government and a total of J$8.5
million from other external lenders, including the Bank. JDB has sought
additional equity from government as counterpart for its various lending
programs, and government will arrange for JDB to be provided with sufficient
funds for its lending program under the project (draft Guarantee Agreement;
Section 2.02). Government will also provide JDB with at least J$1.8 million
by way of equity or loan within twelve months of signing the Guarantee
Agreement.
33.      Between 1970 and 1973, while JDB's loan portfolio more than trebled,
its net income from lending operations (excluding provision for losses) in-
creased from J$84,000 to J$586,000 despite increasea in its administrative
expenses. As of September 30, 1973, the arrears for 30 days or over, ex-
cluding those in respect of subsidiary companies, amounted to J$360,000
compared with its loan portfolio of 422.7 million. The loan agreement for
the first credit project stipulates that JDB'a total liabilities should not
exceed three tines its paid-up capital and reserves, without the Bank's prior
approval. As of July 31, 1973, the debt equity ratio was only 1.1 to OD9. JDB
inherited from its predecessor, the Development Finance Corporation, two wholly
owned subsidiaries, Jamaica Ceramics Industries Limited and the Hotel Corporation
of Jamaica Limited (HCJ), whose operations have caused some concern. However,
Jamaica Ceramics Industries Limited is now in liquidation and JDB has undertaken
that by December 31, 1974, ib willhave taken al necessary action to sell the



--2
re           -enain: n -opezv of Jamaica Ceram'ics  imi -a  (d_aft 7oan Agreement;
Section L.00). Also, the jDB has undertalen to divest, itself of its financial
irvarest in H'J, oy December 31, 197a, for not less than its original equity
holding in HCJ and the total outstanding loans due to it from HCJ (draft Loan
-.neement; Section 4.07).
..     JDBn Is ef-ficiently managed.  Its Board of Mangement, nominated by
.-: .in! ster oG Finance, consists of 'I membDers, including the Chairman and
tie representat.ves of the central 3bank and the Ministry of Finance.
s staff totals 75, includTig 26 pr3fessional and technical personne.
T.-.e angr`cultural department is headed boy a ;anager recruited earlier with the
Bank's agreement as a livestock specialist', and also includes an agricultural
economist recruited throughr the FAO and a local candidate recently appointed
to understudy him. JDB would continue to employ a qualified and experienced
agricultural economist and an understudy who would take over from him at a
time to be agreed with the Bank.  In order to ensure adequate staff capabil-
iie s to deal with the increasing number of sub-loans under the first and
nrooosed second projects, the JDB would anpoint two additional assistant
rojec t officers  one as a condition of loan effectiveness, and the other by
December 31, 1974; also, no staCrf of the Agricultural Department, other than
the tanager, the agricultural economist and the livestock specialist, would
be assigned any SSFDP responsibilities. In view of the expanding volume and geo-
graphical coverage of JDB's agricultural lending, the JDB would consult from
time to time with the Bank during the period of disbursement of the Bank loan
on the need to open up a branch office outside Kingston (draft Loan Agreement;
sections 3.04 and 6.01).
Only limited experience and technical knowledge are available within
Jamaica for goat, sheep, mango and avocado farming. The project therefore
includes overseas training for a small n-iber of JDB staff; particulars of
the training and the candidates would be submitted to the Bank for its prior
approval.
Marketing and Producer Benefits
36.      Prospects for the milk industry are good following two price increases
granted by the government in 1972/73. However, there is need to improve and
augment arrangements for transporting, chilling and pasteurizing fresh milk,
and the provision in the project for agro-industries would help to finance
improved facilities.  Since April 1973, the prices of most beef cuts have been
decontrolled and are now attractive to producers. However, slaughterhouse
facilities will need to be improved to cope with the expanding supply expected
unde- this project and the previous one. For this reason the government agreed
in the context of the first project to take steps to help increase slaughter-
nouse facilities. Various alternative schemes have been proposed and the gov-
ernment presently has under consideration a proposal to establish two or three
small slaughterhouse units in different parts of the island. The government
has undertaken to send to the Bank by December 31, 1974 its decision oa pro-
posns tc imp-rove slaughterhouse facilities, together with a timetable for imple-
mentation and an indication of prospective sources of financing (draft Guarantee



Agreement; section 3.05).  Existing arrangements for marketing of coconut,
c- truc and other fruits are adequate, and prices, which are increasing,
are attractive to producers. The financial rates of return for the various
farm investments are expected to range from 19 per cent to 32 per cent and
h-culd provide sufficient incentives to farmers.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.      Since the items to be financed for on-farm investments are varied
and would be purchased over a three-year period they would not be suit-
a'le for international cor.petitive bidding and would therefore be procured
through existing commercial channels. For the agro-industrial units bidding
documents would permit quoting on the basis of a single contract for the com-
plete works (civil works and equipment) or for separate individual contracts.
It. is not expected that these contracts, which would be small in size and
estimated at about US$1.7 million in the aggregate, would be attracti-je to
manyr foreign bidders. Nevertheless, it is proposed that where the equipment
component of agro-industrial contracts is estimated at US$150,000 or more, such
contracts should be open to international competitive bidding, but that tender
notices should be advertised in Jamaica only and sent to local representatives
of foreign governments; for all other contracts for agro-industrial units at
lPaf-.2t three cuotations would be obtained.
Disbursement of the Bank loan would extend over about three and a
half ,years. Disbursements would be made for 60 percent of all sub-loans
disbursed by JDB and for the full foreign exchange expenditure incurred for
technical assistance.  It is proposed that retroactive financing be permitted
up to US$120,000 for expenditures incurred after October 1, 1973 on
studies nearing completion relating to the proposed sugar rehabilitation pro-
ject.  Such financing would also to permitted up to $250,000 in respect of
disbursements on subloans made before the date of loan signing but after May 1,
1 971f, provided that the sub-loans have been made on the terms and conditions
stmmarized in this Report and set out in more detail in Schedule A to the
Appraisal Report.
I;conomic Rate of Return
3~).   The proposed project would continue the impetus provided under the
firct project to the development of commercial farming and, thereby, both
directly, and indirectly through its demonstration effect, stimulate agricul-
tural production both for export and for import substitution.  It will thus
assist the country's balance of payments and it will also generate increased
emplo,ment and income in the rural areas. The sub-loans for agro-industries
F'hould help expand and improve facilities for marketing and processing and
az '-- help to promote and establish cooperatives so as to enable producers to



ern --ucl- facilities and thus ensure renunerative marketing of their produce.

fu2rantee Agreement between Jamaica and the BanXk the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III Section LA (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distri-
OLuted to the Executive Directors separately.

C. Projects in. ecutAor.
Ln No. 727 Second Educatlorn Project, US$13.5 aillion of March 25, 1971
Closin,g Date:  December 31, 1975
Managerial weaknesses in bo-vh the Education Ministry and the project
unit have caused delays in the implementation of the project; implementation is
about two y3ars behind appraisal schedlula. it is now expected that all the proj-
ect items w-ill be completed by December 1976. A postponement of the closing date
by a year and a haLf is likely to be -ecaired. Because of tuhe late implementation,
devaluation of the Uni'ted States dollar and iSitarnational inflation a cost overrun
of 20-25% is likely. Duiri.g the late3t supervision mission, in March 1974, some
improvement was noted in the perf'ormance and staffing of the project unit. The
vacant posts of architect and procuremenrr officer will 'De filled shortly. How-
ever, there is no candidate to replace the project directorg whose contract
expires in July, and there may be short-runs delaying effects in the implementa-
tion of the project from the recent transfers of the Minister of Education and
the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry.
La No. 719 Agricultural Credit Project; US$3.7 million of December 28,, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 19714
After a slow start the project has picked up momentum during the last
year and over US$3.0 million of the Bank loan has now been committed. Disburse-
ments have not improved equally but the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) has taken
steps to streamline and simplify procedures which have mainly accounted for the
delays. The Bank has recently agreed to a second reallocation of the loan pro-
ceeds to increase credit availability for beef and dairy production. It is
expected that the Bank loan will be fully comnitted by end-May 1974.
Ln No. 690 Population Project; US$200 million of June 18, 1970
Closing Date: March 31, 197$
There have been delays in the construction prograas for the
Victoria Jubilee Hospital (VJH) and ten rural maternity centers (FCs),
due primarily to problems of coordination, and weaknesses in the manage-
msnt of the family planning program. However, more recently improved
progress has been made in implementing some of the principal aspects of
the progr&im. Construction of all ten F Cs has been physically completed
although there have been delays in commissioning them. Construction has
started on the VJH expansion; however, the contractor has experienced a
number of serious on-site problems, including labor unrest. Progress
has been slow in implementing the training and homae encouragement aspects
of the family planning program, but intensified efforts are now being
made in thsse areas.
These notes are designed to inaform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, ana in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understEnding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln No. 598   Kingston Water Supply Pro,'iect; US$5.0 million of May 14, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 197k
After initial delays over the acquisition of land rights and in the
award of contracts implementation of the physical aspects of the project has
improved and the works are now partial_y in operation. Full service should be
in operation by July 1974 although opt'mum pressure will not be available until
after delivery of certain booster pumping ecuipment in about 6 months' time.
The loan closing date, originally June 30, 1972, has been postponed to
December 31, 1973 and again to December 31, 1974. However, the financial
position of the Water Commission remains weak and the annual rates of return over
the last three fiscal years were significantly below the 8% required in the Loan
Agreement. Substantial increases in water rates were introduced in June 1973,
but since then increased operating costs, largely due to higher wages, have
again eroded the Commission's financial position. However, consideration is
being given to measures to reduce the institution's operating costs and to
ensure the maintenance of adequate revenues from water tariffs. Measures to
remedy staffing and management weaknesses are currently under discussion
between the Bank and the Borrower.
Ln No. 899   Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million
of June 1, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This loan became effective August 31, 1973 and is progressing
satisfactorily. Consultants to carry out the technical assistance component
of the project have been appointed as have their government counl,erparts.
Bidding for the first phase of resealing went out for tender in early March
and work will commence in May 1974. A Number of roads to be resealed under
the project were damaged by recent floods. In order to get them back into
operation as quickly as possible and prevent further deterioration, the Bank
agreed that about 40 miles of the total 250 miles to be resealed under the
project should be repaired by force account rather than by contractors; this
work is under way.   Invitations to bid for equipment have been issued and
preparation is under way for the asphaltic concrete overlay.

JAYI-JGA - SECOND AGiTCILTUUkL C;REDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Suxmitry
Borrower:              Jamaica Development Bank (JDB)
Guarantor:             Jamaica
Amount:                US$5 .5 million equivalent in various currencies
Terms:                 Payable in 16 years, includingfour years of
grace with interest at 716 per anxnum.
Project Description:   The Bank loan would continue support for an
ongoing and expanded B.i*k a3Listed lending
program of JDB for on-farm investments. Sub-
loans would be made to about 200 coTmercial
farmers for increased production of beef,
dairy products, sheep, goats, coconuts, citrus,
mango and avocado. Agro-industrial investments
for marketing, processing and production of
agricultural inputs will also be eligible for
financing. Technical assistance, including
training abroad and on-going studies of the
sugar industry, will also be financed from
the loan.
Estimated Cost
and Financing Plan:    Total project costs are estimated at US$10.8
million which would be financed as follows:
the Bank loan of US$5.5 miillion would be
equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange
cost (51%); the JDB would contribute about
US$3.5 million (32%); and sub-borrowers would
contribute US$1.8 million (17%). Estimated
costs are as follows:
