COTONOU WATER/SANTTATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
CREDIT 1171-BEN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
l.        This report represents a review of the above Project  for which
Credit 1171-BEN of SDR 4.1 million (US$5.0 M) to the Government of Benin was
signed on October 26, 1981. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1987, two years
after the original closing date by which time it was fully disbursed. Physi-
cal works were completed by March 1987, 27 months later than expected at
appraisal.
2.         The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Infrastructure
Operations Division of the Africa Regional Office on the basis of the review
of the President's Report, the Loan Agreement and other reports related to the
project implementation.
3.         In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED Ptaff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower for comments, however,
none were received.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
COTONOU WATER/SANITATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
CREDIT 1171-BEN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project was based on the findings of surveys of the water supply
and sanitation sector carried out in 1978 and 1980 under the World Heatth
Organization/Bank Cooperative Program. Tt was designed to address the urgent
basic needs of the sector, contribute to the Government's efforts to define
coordinated and coherent policies and strategies, and help build viable sector
institutions (para 2.04).
2.        The project was financed by an !DA Credit in the amount of SDR4.1 M
(US$5.0 M equivalent). The Credit was approved on June 25, 1981, became
effective on April 11, 1983, and was closed on June 30, 1987 after two post-
ponements of the closing date.  These delays allowed financing of additional
consultant services and physical works (para 3.06).
3.        The Credit was originally divided into about US$2.8 M for water
sector related expenditures, and US$2.2 M for urban sector related activities.
This division was, however, somewhat arbitrary since there were studies and
activities in both groups that affected both sectors (mapping, surveys, and
tariff studies, for instance).
4.        The total cost of the project as implemented was US$6.3 M, that 4.s
the same amount as originally estimated in US dollar terms, but about 22%
higher than estimated at appraisal in terms of CFAF (para 3.07).
5.        The physical components of the project were completed satisfactorily
but with an overrun of about two years. However, the sanitation component was
not t!illy successful due to weakness of the institutions in charge of the
sub-sector, and inadequate definition of their responsibilities.   Moreover,
while the institutional study for the urban sanitation sub-sector was carried
out, no improvement or follow-up has been made by the Government in urban and
sanitation sector policies, and the appropriate institutional arrangement has
not yet been established. The project provided the basis for the preparation
of the ongoing Second Water Supply Project (para 4.01).
6.        The Bank should continue  to pursue its dialogue with Benin and
encourage it to introduce sound management practices in the urban sector
(para 5.02).



PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
COTONOU WATER/SANITATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
CREDIT 1171-BEN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project was the first Bank Group lending in the Benin vater
supply and sanitation sector.  The first identification mission vas made in
April 1980.  It was followed by a World Health Organization (WHO) mission il
June 1980, which was joined by a Bank urban planner.
1.02      The Borrower was the Government of the Republic of Benin.   The
executing agency was the power/water company, Societe BUninoise d'Electricitg
et d'Eau (SBEE), to which US$2.8 M were onlent to finance the foreign exchange
cost of improvement of the Cotonou water supply and sanitation system, as well
as consultant services for water supply studies and training activities. SBEE
was also the executing agencv for US$2.2 M worth of studies and Tarious
preparatory activiti3s in support of the country's urban sector.  Subsidiary
executing agencies in the urban sector were the "Institut National de
Cartographie (INC) (the National Mapping Agency); the Direction de la Voirie
Urbaine (DVU), the urban roads department of the Ministry of Public Works; the
Societe Nationale de Gestion Immobiliere (SONAGIM), a parastatal ir, charge of
land development; and the "Service de la Voirie," the technical department of
the Cotonou local Government.
1.03      This PCR was prepared by AFlIN on the basis of a review of Bank
files, including the President's Report, credit documents, supervision re-
ports, and information from SBEE. There was no staff appraisal report.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION
2.01      In October 1979,  the Government  requested  financing for a lars,e
urban infrastructure project in the capital city of Cotonou to include the
power, water,  sanitation, and urban sectors.   Because of lack of data and
absence of project preparation, the Association suggested to the Government
that it would be more appropriate to first carry out an engineering project as
a basis for preparing a future infrastructure project.
2.02      The project was identified by a Bank mission in April 1980.   In
June 1980, a WHO/Bank joint mission further analyzed water sanitation needs
and prepared TOR for the urban studies. SBEE actively participated in project
preparation.
2.03      The project was apptaised in November 1980.  The main issue raised
in the Issues Faper of December 11, 1981 was -he need to upgrade SBEE's
financial management by introducing a cost accounting system which would
provide information on the cost of water and power.  As SBEE's cash position
was being weakened by slow collection of customer arrears, especially from the
local and central Government agencies, a covenant was introduced in the Credit
Agreement requiring the Government to improve its payment performance.  Close
coordination between the urban study on one hand, and the water/sanitation



studies' an the other, was called for, possibly by using the same consultants
to dto both.  While  SBEE is primarily a power  company, the proiect  never
envisaged to address issues of this sector.  Negotiations were held in Wash-
ington in April 1981.  A Credit of STR 4.1 M was approved in June 1981 and
signed  on  October 26, 19°1.   Powever,  it  did  not  become  effective  until
April 11, 1983, that is 18 monthu later, mainly because of difficulties in
obtaining Government approval of the leoel dncuuents. although these did not
include any covenants difficult to comply with.
Project Objectives
2.04       rhe project objectives were to , -vide relief to the most urgent
water and sanitation needs ,o' Cotonou and to finance studies of these needs.
The studies would define loAg-term solutions to problems in the water, sanita-
tion and urban sectors of Cotonou related to the institutional, financial and
management aspacts of the sectors and prepare specific projects for possible
financing by the Bank Group and other lenders.
Project Components
2.05      The project comprised the following major components:
(a) Priority Works
(i)  drilling  of  four boreholes,  including  provisio'i  of pumping
equipment;
(ii)  rehabilitation and extension of the distribution system into
the poorer areas of Cotonou, including 92 km of pipeline,
30 standpipes and 17 fire hydrants;
(iii)  cleaning of existing drains and construction of 14 culverts;
and
(iv)  purchase of two dumptrucks, one mechanical shovel, two suct4on
trucks and one solid waste collection truck.
(b) Studies
(i)  preparation of a water supply master plan, feasibility studies,
detailed engineering and bidding documents for a first phase of
a water supply construction program;
(ii)  preparation of similar studies for the drainage, sewerage and
solid waste collection and disposal of Cotonou;
(iii)  aerial photographs  and preparation of detailed maps  of the
Cotonou region;
(iv)  preparation of an uiban development plan, including formulation
of an urban inve'tment program;
(v)  preparation  of  a  water/sanitation  tariff  study,  including
assessment of alternative modes for financing of houtL2 and yard
connectioni;



- 3 -
(vi)  execution  of  financial  studies  concerning  SBEE,  including
review of its accounting systems and procedures and its inter-
nal controls; sudit of its 1980/81 financial statements; review
of cost accounting with emphasis on separation of accounts fcr
water and power operations; review of the financial planning
and budgetary control systems; assistance in implementation of
the proposed improvements; and evaluation of training needs of
the financial and accounting staff;
(vil) implementation of a pilot plan for health education; and
(viii) a training program for SBEE's professional staff.
Project Financing and Onlending Arrangement
2.06      The total cost of the project was estimated at US$6.3 M equivalent
of which US$5.9 M were financed by IDA and US$1.3 M by the Government. Of the
IDA Credit, US$2.8 H werL to be onlent to SBEE on Bank terms to cover the cost
of the expansion of the Cotonou water supply as well as all the studies and
training activities r-lated to the urban water sector. During project imple-
mentation, however, it was agreed that the portion to be onlent to SBEE could
be reduced to US$0.8 M, which represented the expenditures on physical works.
The remaining US$2.0 M were granted from the Government to SBEE to cover the
costs  of  consultant  services  and  training  activities.   This modification
lessenned the financial burden on SBEE to the value of new fixed assets only.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Priority Works
3.01      Most of the bidding documents  for the supply of equipment were
submitted to the Bank for review in July 1981, and most of the contract awards
took place by mid 1982. Even through SBEE was not able to pay the suppliers,
most of the equipment was delivered in March 1983, that is, before Credit
effectiveness.
3.02      The drilling of boreholes started in mid 1983 under force account;
however, the boreholes were noc properly executed and, as a result, did not
produce the expected yield. The two remaining ones were drilled by a special-
ized contractor.  This required, in October 1985, an amendment to the Credit
Agreement which did not initially include a disbursement category for civil
works.  The rehabilitation and extension of the distribution network started
late in 1983 and was completed by the end of 1984; part of the works were
carried out under force account.  Additional civil works, in particular the
rehabilitation of the main transmission line, which had been agreed with the
Bank, were carried out in 1985 and 1986 by specialized contractors.  Also, a
few standpipes were installed after SBEE agreed to have private operators
resell water at tariffs agreed upon with SBEE. At the eaid of the project, the
total Cotonou water production and distribution capacity had been increased
from about 20,000 m3/d to 28,000 m3/d.
3.03      Most equipment for the Cotonou municipal services was supplied by
end 1983.  The maintenance of the major drains was undertaken during the
second part of 1985 by DVU with the assistance of the consultant in charge of



the  drainage  studies.   This  successful  operation  could  not,  however,  be
replicated o.'e year later due to 3VU's lack of financial resources. The con-
struction of culverts was completed by and 1985 after proper studies of the
very difficult drainage condition had been carried o.t.
Studies
3.04      All studies were successfully completed but led to different actions
from those originally envisaged.  They have been followed by an invest ent
nroject in the urban water sector (Credit 1721-BEN of June 1985) which,
inter alia, provides for expansion of the Cotonou and Porto Novo water supply
systems as well as a management support program to SBESE The Porto Novo water
supply component was prepared as part cf the project although this was not
initially included in the project description. The project also finaneed the
identification of a rural water supply project in the coastal region which was
later financed with bilateral funds.  Organizational studies helped defining
SBEE's detailed management support program and the tariff study was at the
origin of a major restructuring of the water rates.   Finally, due to the
assistance of consultants and auditors financed under the project, SBEE's
accounting system and procedures improved drastically. This good performance
has its roots in SBEE's excellent implementing capacity.
3.05      The absence of counterpart institutions in the urban and municipal
sector, combined with the Government reluctance to discuss allocation of
res-onsibilities and resource mobilization are the main reasons for the
failure of the extensive studies financed under the project in these sectors.
While the urban, drainage and sanitation master plans have been satisfactorily
completed, they could not be followed by a relevant investment program, since
the recommendations of the municipal institutional studies still have to be
debated with the Government.  Also, and for the same reason, the pilot plan
for health education could not be implemented.
Implementation Schedule and Credit Management
. 06      Two postponements of  the closing dete were  required because of
delays in Credit effectiveness and also to allow for implementation o. some
additional works and studies. The Credit Agreement had to be amended twice.
A first time to introduce a disbursement category for civil works (all the
works were initially to be carried out under force account by SBEE or the
other implementing agencies) and a second time to limit the amount onlent by
the Government to SBEE from the equivalent of US$2.8 M to US$0.8 M.
Project Costs and Credit Disbursement
3.07      The final project cost was US$6.3 M, that is the same as had been
estimated at the time of appraisal.  However, due to the strong appreciation
of the US$ vis-a-vis CFAF during project implementation (the exchange rate
went up to US$1.00 - CFAF 520), the project cost in CFAF at the time of
completion was 22% greater than at the time of appraisal (CFAF 1.82 billion
and CFAF 1.48 billion,  respectively).  This cost overrun is mainly due to
additional small works and studies not included in the initial project de-
scription.

Compliance with Credit Covenants
3.08      Among the major covenants of the Credit Agreement,  the only one
which was fully complied with was the recording of project expenditures. All
other covenants relating to proper budgeting and payment by the central and
local Government agencies for electricity and water consumption were only
partly complied with.  Actually, the Government indebtedness vis-A-vis SBEE
worsened regularly during project implementation and che only realistic
solution has been the regular offsetting by the Government and SBEE on mutual
arrears (power/water consumption versus various taxes). The power and water
tariffs were increased in May 1982 but the water tariff was not restructured
and  further  increased until May 1986,  that  is before negotiations of the
follow up investment project.
3.09      The major covenants of the Project Agreement were complied with.  In
particular,  cost  accounting procedures  have  enabled  SBEE to more  clearly
separate power and water expenses.   SBEE's accounts were regularly audited
from 1980/81 to 1986.
IV. PERFORMANCE OF BORROWERS, CONSULTANTS AND BANK
4.01      Altogether the Government performance in terms of project implemen-
tation was acceptable.   All the equipment has been supplied,  the priority
works implemented and the studies carried cut.  Its performance has, however,
been very different in terms of follow-up of the engineering project.  SBEE
has very rapidly been able to obtain financing for an investment program based
on the findings of the water supply master plan. But the absence of agreement
on the institutional set up of the municipal sector was the main explanation
fo: the impossibility for the Government to launch a project which would
address the very difficult drainage and sanitation conditions of  Cotonou.
The dialogue between the Bank and the Government still goes on and may be
boosted through a Structural Adjustment Program scheduled to be appraised
during summer 1988.
4.02      The  project  financed  extensive  urban,  water  supply,  drainage,
sanitation, institutional and financial studies.  They were carried out by a
joint venture of three consultants assisted whenever necessary by
specialized experts. Their performance was of good quality for the technical
aspects and acceptable for the institutional and financial aspects. Actually,
the consultants' performance was directly linked to their client's receptivity
and capability to address the issues. Again, the performance was much better
in the water sector managed by SBEE than in the municipal sector where the
consultants had to deal with several entities without clear responsibilities.
4.03      The Bank regularly supervised project implementation.  Part of the
missions were combined with the preparation of the follow-up water supply
project.  The emphasis, however, was always given to urban water, where the
possibility of follow up actions was clear as compared with the more difficult
to address municipal sector.

V. CONCLUSIONS AWM LESSONS LEARNED
5.01      The physical components of the project were completed satisfactorily
albeit with small delays and an overrun caused by the fluctuation of the
exchange rates. The covenants which were not complied (payment of Government
pover/water consumption) reflected a national economic situation which has
deteriorated  throughout  project  implementation.   A  sectoral  engineering
project was certainly not the appropriate vehicle to address such an issue.
5.02      The project provided for extensive studies In urban, water supply,
drainage and sanitation sectors; they have resulted In a follow-up investment
project which had to be limited to urban water supply due to the absence of
reliable institutions to adequately manage municl .l services. Retrospective-
ly, it appears that the institutional and resource mobilization issues should
have been addressed prior to launching ambitious technical studies.  Mean-
while, the dialogue on the municipal reform would be reactivated within the
framework of the Structural Adjustment Program the Government and the Bank
have agreed to launch in 1988.
