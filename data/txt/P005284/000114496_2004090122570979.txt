                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to reduce long-term
transport costs by: (i) upgrading the Desert Highway linking Amman
and the port of Aqaba; (ii) rehabilitating key road sections,
improving road maintenance and enforcing axle load limits; and (iii)
strengthening the technical, financial and managerial capabilities
of the Borrower's institutions responsible for the transport sector.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:     Highways
1.    Reconstruction and improvement of approximately 71 km of the
Desert Highway between Wadi Yutum and Ras El Naqab, including
upgrading of an existing detour on the escarpment section at Ras El
Naqab.
2.    Implementation of the Road Rehabilitation Program which shall
Page  9
include highway sections that satisfy the evaluation criteria
referred to in Section 3.03 of this Agreement.
3.    Design of a program to improve capacities and capabilities of
institutions in the highway sector to address policy issues related
to cost recovery and the rapid deterioration of the road system,
through:
      (a)   carrying out a road transport policy issues study to
assist the Borrower in identifying alternative cost recovery
strategies for financing the road sector, including an assessment of
options for a road transport regulatory regime that optimizes
revenues and economic benefits, including the administration of
licensing and import controls, mechanisms for setting tariffs,
analysis of optimum penalties for overloading and the impact of
deregulation of the trucking industry;
      (b)   carrying out an institutional study to assist the
Borrower in evaluating alternative institutional frameworks for the
planning, design and implementation of road construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance; and
      (c)   carrying out an implementation study to prepare detailed
plans and programs for road transport regulation and cost recovery,
including design of a detailed organizational structure and training
of staff for institution(s) selected to implement the Borrower's
road transport policy.
Part B:     Railway
1.    Carrying out a policy study to assist the Borrower to design
an appropriate corporate structure and supportive institutional
framework for ARC, consistent with fully commercial objectives.
2.    Provision of operational and management support to assist ARC
to: (a) institute improved maintenance systems and practices for its
locomotive fleet; (b) increase throughput through better equipment
utilization and improved customer service; (c) enhance financial
control systems and costing procedures; (d) improve information
management systems to enhance managerial control and decision-
making; and (e) prepare a long-term corporate and market development
plan.

invitation to bid referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines
shall provide that, when contract award is delayed beyond the
original bid validity period, the successufl bidder's bid price will
Page  11
be increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed correction

1.    For review by the Bank of prequalification decisions, the
procedures described in paragraph 1 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines
shall be followed.
2.    Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final
contracts:
      (a)   With respect to each contract for civil works estimated
to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more, the procedures set forth

prior to the making of the first payment out of the Special Account
in respect of such contract.
      (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the
preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4
of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, said procedures
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the
contract together with the other information required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished
pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 to this Agreement.
      (c)   The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b)shall

the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures,
letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts
shall not apply to contracts estimated to cost less than $100,000
equivalent each. However, this exception to prior Bank review shall
not apply to the terms of reference for such contracts nor to the
Page  12
employment of individuals, to single source selection of firms, to
assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the
Bank and to amendments of contracts raising the contract value to
$100,000 equivalent or above.

a report on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the
Project, in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request.
                            SCHEDULE 6
                          Special Account
1.    For the purposes of this Schedule:
      (a)   the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1) and
(2) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this
Agreement;
      (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
      (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to $2,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this
Schedule.
2.    Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule.
3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as
the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                  deposits into the Special Account at such
                  intervals as the Bank shall specify.
           (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
                  and other evidence required pursuant to
                  paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                  payments in respect of which replenishment is
Page  14
                  requested. On the basis of each such request, the
                  Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
                  from the Loan Account and deposit into the
                  Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall
                  have requested and as shall have been shown by
                  said documents and other evidence to have been
                  paid out of the Special Account for eligible
                  expenditures.
      All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
