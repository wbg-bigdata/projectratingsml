HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
THIRD TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:       Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
Beneficiary:    Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH), Ministry of Transport (MOT),
Aqaba Railway Corporation (ARC)
Loan Amount:   US$35.0 million
Terms:          20 years, including 5-year grace period at the Bank's standard variable interest
rates
Project Objectives
and Description:  The project would promote a viable and efficient transport sector by rehabilitating
and upgrading road arteries critical for foreign trade and transit traffic. The
project would also enhance service life for road investments by supporting lower
axle load limits for trucks, more appropriate and stronger road pavement
construction and better maintenance. Technical assistance to review institutional
arrangements and develop the capacity and capability of sector agencies to ensure
sustainable improvements of roads and operational efficiency and financial
viability of the railway will also be an important objective.
Benefits:       The roads selected under the project have deteriorated pavements with high road
roughness and excessive vehicle operating costs (VOC); in particular the 71-km
Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum section of the main north-south road where partially
the road pavement is in the process of disintegrating. The project components,
together with the technical assistance would permit a continued and increased
level of phosphate exports, reductions in domestic transport costs, particularly of
imports and exports, and increased revenues from the expected future revival of
the lucrative transit trade. The improvement of the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum
Road is critical to maintain the efficient transport of phosphate rock (Jordan's
primary export commodity), cement, most other exports and imports and transit
traffic, and therefore, absolutely critical to the functioning of the entire economy.
The economic rate of return, derived from savings in vehicle operating costs and
road maintenance costs, is estimated to be 14.2 percent. The road links in the
pavement rehabilitation program are expected to yield an economic rate of return
ranging from 33 - 57 percent. Benefits are derived from vehicle operating cost
savings and the avoidance of major reconstruction costs. In addition, the
rehabilitated roads will improve traffic safety.
Risks:          The proposed project is unlikely to be subject to any unusual risk, excepting, of
course, the Region's potential volatility. Although, with other projects, there have
been delays due to restrictions on local cost financing, these have always been
overcome within an acceptable time frame. Moreover, the Government places
high priority on this project, especially the reconstruction of the Ras El Naqab-
Wadi Yutum road, and in view of the critical nature of this transport artery to the
whole economy, the Government has confirmed that adequate local funds will be
made available. Special care has to be taken to maintain road traffic movements
during work on the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road by providing adequate
detours.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
THIRD TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I.    INTRODUCTION
A.    Macro-economic Situation
1.1   The economy of Jordan has traditionally relied upon five main sources of foreign exchange:
(i) remittances from Jordanian workers in other countries (particularly the Gulf states where, in
1988, an estimated 40 percent of the Jordanian work force was employed); (ii) exports of
manufactured goods and agricultural produce to regional markets; (iii) exports of phosphate, potash
and fertilizers to the world market; (iv) tourism (amounting to approximately 18 percent of foreign
currency earnings in 1989); and (v) grant aid, primarily from the region's oil-rich nations, which in
the past has financed about 30 percent of the country's imports and provided about 80 percent of
government revenues. During the 1970s and early 1980s, these sources were adequate to maintain
economic growth and internal and external financial stability. However, the regional recession,
largely caused by the decline in oil prices in the mid-1980s, led to a steep reduction in these sources
of income and resulted in sharp deteriorations in Jordan's balance of payments, public finances and
employment situation. By the end of 1988, the economy was in a very precarious position.
1.2   The Government responded to these difficulties by undertaking economic and financial
reforms in the context of a standby arrangement with the IMF and an adjustment program with the
Bank (Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan, 3142-JO). Throughout 1989 and 1990, until the
onset of the Gulf crisis, the Government's policy, focussing on measures to reduce macroeconomic
imbalances, stimulate export led growth and reduce unemployment, remained largely on track.
Monetary growth was moderate, inflation was receding and a number of cost recovery and subsidy
reduction measures limited pressures on the budget. The development program was also strictly
constrained. The onset of the Gulf crisis, however, posed severe difficulties for the adjustment
program. A World Bank analysis indicates that the negative impact upon Jordan's balance of
payments was US$1 billion in 1990 and about US$2.3 billion in 1991. Furthermore, the large
number of expatriate Jordanian workers returning from the Gulf region has swelled the ranks of the
unemployed. The overall unemployment rate was estimated to have risen to 25 percent, with about
20,000 unemployed within the transport sector alone, but has now declined somewhat to about 15
percent. Although priority in the immediate allocation of resources must be given to urgent, crisis-
related needs, the original adjustment objectives remain valid and are being pu;rsued through the
IMF standby arrangement and the Bank's program of structural reforms. The Government and the
Bank agree that achieving many of the adjustment objectives requires an efficient and responsive
transport system in view of the importance of the sector in generating foreign exchange earnings and
employment.
B.    Macro Objectives and TransRort Sector Strategy
1.3   Transport infrastructure and operations are a key element in the effective functioning of the
economy, internally and vis a vis external trade. Jordan's transport capability, by virtue of its
location on an important transit route, also provides a revenue-earning service that contributes
significantly to economic activity and growth. Both the Government and the private sector have
sought to develop this capability by building and maintaining efficient transport links with
neighboring countries; ensuring reliable and cost efficient export routes and facilities; and promoting
regional transport services such as transshipment. In major urban areas, especially Amman, the
road network has been upgraded to ease traffic flows and, thus, permit the cities to fulfil their
functions as major economic centers. Prior to the Gulf crisis, the transport industry directly
contributed about 11 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The overall impact of the



- 2 -
industry is reflected in the large proportion of investment expenditure that has been allocated to the
sector. The following table relates public investrnent in the transport sector to that in otier sectors
during the 1986-90 Five-Year Development Plan, and shows that transport accounted for about 9
percent of total public investment.

1.4   Transport also plays a major role in providing employment. It is estimated that direct
employment in the sector, prior to the crisis, was approximately 47,000, or 10 percent of the total
work force. Following the onset of the crisis, the sector's unemployment rate has been about 40
percent, with most unemployment occurring in the road freight industry, largely a result of the loss
of transit trade with Iraq.
1.5   Prior to the onset of the Gulf crisis, transport had been a major earner of foreign currency
based on the transit operations of Aqaba Port and the road transport industry. In 1989, these
earnings amounted to more than US$500 million. However, transit operations were not without cost
to the infrastructure and environment in Jordan. There was severe deterioration of long stretches of
the road system, especially on the road between Aqaba and the Iraqi border; the quality of life in the
small towns through which the road traffic passed has declined; and, in Aqaba, the heavy traffic
through the port caused both land and sea pollution. Some of these problems are already being
addressed through reconstruction of about 240-km of the main road between Amman and the Iraqi
border; completion of the new north-south road through the Eastern Desert; construction of a new
road parallel to the Dead Sea and the recently completed road to Aqaba port that bypasses the town
of Aqaba.
1.6   In the past, the emphasis in sector development has been on improving conditions along the
transit corridors, and considerable progress in this direction has already been achieved as discussed
above. However, much remains to be done if the transport system is to support socioeconomic
activity and contribute to solving the balance of payments problem. Pressing concerns in the sector
now are: to reduce the burden imposed on the Government's budget; to better regulate truck



operations; to improve design and construction practices in the road sector; and, to increase the
accountability and commercial orientation of public enterprises in the sector. Consequently, sector
strategy is now increasingly focussed upon: (i) improving cost recovery in the sector; (ii) improving
the efficiency of the sector through the organizational and financial restructuring of public revenue-
earning entities to make them more commercially-oriented; (iii) modernizing and rationalizing the
road freight industry; (iv) developing new markets for the services of Aqaba port; and, (v) giving
added emphasis to design and construction practices.
C.    Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.7   Past Bank involvement in the transport sector in Jordan has focussed on institutional and
policy reforms. Major initiatives have included: (i) the design and implementation of a road
maintenance planning and management system; (ii) the adoption of project evaluation techniques as
an integral part of project design; (iii) the drafting of vehicle axle-load legislation; and (iv) the
introduction of management tools in some of the parastatal agencies, especially the Aqaba Railway
Corporation (ARC). However, not all of these initiatives have been successful; more support is
needed to consolidate and develop these reforms in line with Jordan's changing economic and social
conditions.
1.8   With significant reductions in the budget deficit remaining a priority macro-objective, the
Government recognizes the need for increased efficiency in transport agencies such as ARC the
Public Transport Corporation (PTC), Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ), and the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA), in order to reduce the demands on public finance for subsidies, capital investmnent
and debt service. Furthermore, the authorities now accept the need for the largest sub-sector, road
transport, to recover the costs of provision of road infrastructure initially to cover avoidable costs
such as maintenance and eventually, depreciation and debt service. The renewed willingness of the
Government to address longstanding issues is evidenced by: the agreement to enforce axle load
limits, the acceptance of the need to review road pavement design and construction practices to
address quality issues, the phosphate transport contract with ARC, the increase in fuel prices and the
strengthened road maintenance management. Bank involvement would consolidate and deepen past
project achievements and recent policy and institutional reforms at a time when some major
transport sector donors are inactive. The achievement of these objectives, fundamental to Bank-
supported macroeconomic policy, will be facilitated through technical assistance to be provided
under the proposed project.
1.9   The main component of the proposed project is the reconstruction of the 71 -km Ras El
Naqab to Wadi Yutum section of the Desert Highway tying the Port of Aqaba to the rest of the
country. This road section, which has exceeded its design and economic life, represents a serious
and costly bottleneck in the country's major transport artery; maintenance is no longer a viable
alternative to reconstruction. Should the road fail, or even deteriorate much further, the effect upon
the economy would be severe, threatening the rest of the Government's Bank-supported adjustment
program. Bank support of this component is of importance not only in addressing institutional,
operational, engineering and environmental issues, but also in attracting cofinancing, which has been
difficult to obtain since the onset of the Gulf crisis.

II.    THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.    Description of the Sector
2.1    Most of the road transport industry is operated privately, and that part (e.g., the Iraq/Jordan
Land Transport Company, the Jordan/Syria Land Transport Company and the PTC) which is
government-controlled is constrained to operate according to commercial precepts. Aqaba Railway
Corporation, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Aqaba Port and the Civil Aviation Authority are autonomous
agencies of the Ministry of Transport (MOT). MOT, according to Law 42 of 1971, has overall
responsibility for the entire transport sector, including roads' and the regulation of private sector
transport operations. Traditionally, MOT has not been active in development matters, with road
sector investments being the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH).
Consequently, coordination between sector investments and operations has been weak. The major
function of MOT, with regard to roads, is to regulate private sector activity through licensing and
fare and tariff setting, carried out by the Road Transport Directorate of MOT. However, as the
administrative systems evolves, MOT is likely to take a more active role in sector development.
During loan negotiations, the Govermnent undertook to establish an inter-ministerial coordinating
committee to supervise and evaluate studies under the project, with arrangements that would allow
participation also by NGO's and stakeholders in the private sector.
2.2   During the past 10 years, major improvements have been made to all the transport mnodes in
the sector. Nearly all desirable links in the road system (approximately 3,500 km of main and
secondary roads and 4,550-km of village and agricultural roads) have been completed. Much of the
300-km narrow gauge, single-track railway line and the equipment of the Aqaba Railway
Corporation (ARC) serving the phosphate mines have been rehabilitated and upgraded. A new
international airport has been built at Amman (Queen Alia International Airport, QAIA) and the
Aqaba airport has been upgraded to international standards. Aqaba port has been significantly
expanded and is capable of handling more than 20 million tons of cargo a year, and additional port
facilities are being built to serve the fertilizer complex south of Aqaba. Relatively little new
construction is required for the road network: the emphasis must be on rehabilitation and upgrading
of existing roads, and on institutional and policy reform to improve operational efficiency and
maintenance. However, it should be emphasized that, with the current situation in the Middle East,
predictions of traffic trends, the basic information for transport planning and policy, can only be
tentative and the above assessments may need to be changed if transport needs grow unexpectedly.
The following sections describe the salient features of the four main transport subsectors: roads,
railways, ports and civil aviation.
B.    Roads and Road Transport Subsector
2.3   The Ministry of Public Works (MPWH) is responsible for the construction and maintenance
of the main, secondary and rural/village road networks. Municipalities are responsible for the roads
within their jurisdictions, unless they form links in the national road system. Traditionally one of
the most influential ministries, MPWH is generally efficient and staffed by well-trained and
experienced personnel. Although overall highway and transport planning is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Planning's Infrastructure Department, it is normally MPWH that undertakes feasibility
studies, most often by using Jordanian consulting firms. Highway and pavement design standards
are based on guidelines established by the US Federal Highway Administration and the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. These standards may not be optimal
given the heavy axle-loads in Jordan, the extreme diurnal temperature difference and available road
However, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing is responsible for road construction and
maintenance.

pavement construction materials. A road pavement study carried out by the MPWH with assistance
from foreign consultants is reviewing the appropriateness of these standards under Jordanian
conditions. Annex 2 gives more information about the organization of the sector.
2.4   The legal limit for a single axle-load was established at 13 tons in 1983 but could not be
enforced. New legislation introduced later allowed considerable truck overloading to take place but
required that an overloading fee be paid to the Ministry of Finance. As a result, the axle load limits
legislated in 1983 were ineffective in reducing actual axle loads. Inappropriate asphalt concrete
pavements prone to cracking or rutting in combination with high axle loads have accelerated
pavement deterioration on much of the main road network and especially on the Aqaba-Iraqi border
highway. The Government has recently revoked a cabinet order that a year ago stopped
implementation of the first step in a program of phased reduction in overloading over 2 years in 4
steps, i.e., a 25 percent reduction in overloading at each step, with each reduction being put into
effect on specific dates, about 8 months apart, until the equivalent of a 13-ton axle-load limit is
achieved (Annex 3). Regular axle load surveys would be required by the Bank during the
implementation of the project to confirm the enforcement of each step in lowering the axle-load
limit. MPWH has been provided with several portable "weigh-in-motion" axle load recording
instruments as part of a road pavement study which the Government of Japan financed. These
instruments would be used to verify compliance with changes in loading limits for trucks of different
axle configurations. The introduction of the first 25 percent reduction in excess axle loading was a
condition of loan negotiations, and during negotiations assurances were received on the continued
implementation of this phased program of axle load reductions.
Construction
2.5   Road construction in Jordan is normally executed under unit price contracts awarded after
international or local competitive bidding, although a small amount of force account work is also
undertaken. Depending on the size and nature of the contract, supervision is undertaken by MPWH
engineers or local consultants. The Jordanian civil works contractingindustry has developed
significantly during the past 10 years, although it has been hit hard by the economic downturn and
the Gulf crisis. There are 3 firms in the top class capable of undertaking major civil works; 8 firms
in the second class capable of carrying out most works, but requiring additional technical expertise
for complex works; and 12 smaller registered contractors.
Maintenance
2.6   Routine, emergency and some periodic road maintenance is undertaken by the MPWH force
account units while most periodic maintenance, including asphalt concrete overlay and strengthening,
is carried out under contract. Under the Multi-Mode Transport Project (Loan 2463-JO), a simple
road maintenance management system (RMMS) was developed and implemented with the assistance
of foreign consultants. However, since the onset of the economic crisis and subsequent austerity
measures, funds allocated for regular road maintenance have been below the annual amount
considered necessary by the RMMS. During loan negotiations, the Government agreed that road
maintenance budget allocations are to be adequate to the needs identified for the road sector based
also on the road sector policy studies to be carried out under the project. The Government further
agreed that it will inform the Bank of its annual allocation for road maintenance within the overall
budget for exchange of views with the Bank.
2.7   The Government recognizes that a large maintenance backlog exists and that additional
resources are needed to correct the situation. Approximately 50 percent of the funds earmarked or
spent under the category "Capital Investment" (Table 2.1) are for works to prevent pavement
deterioration beyond the stage where expensive reconstruction is required to bring the roads back to
a maintainable state. Recent decisions to strictly curtail the construction of new roads and to



increase fuel prices and transit fees are significant steps towards achieving full cost recovery from
road users and securing funding to preserve the road system. Technical assistance provided under
this project would assist the Goverrnent in determining road maintenance needs, institutional
arrangements and the future role of force account works in road maintenance.
Road Expenditures and Financing
2.8   Road expenditures are budgeted on a year-to-year basis, rather than within the context of a
multi-year plan, and the uncertain economic environment is partially responsible for the uncertainties
in road maintenance funding. When the economy is stabilized, multi-year programming of all road
works will be reinstituted, based upon road planning studies to be carried out under this project.
Table 2.1 gives expenditure and revenue figures for 1988 to 1991 and budgeted amounts for 1992.
Road maintenance funding at about JD 4 million per annum is low. The Maintenance Department
of MPWH estimates that, given the successful completion of a program of essential rehabilitation, an
annual maintenance budget of JD 10 million (1991 prices) will be required (JD 6 million more than
the 1992 level). Studies to be carried out under this project will determine appropriate levels of road
expenditures including maintenance and assess options for flnancing the road sector (see Annex 4).

Notes: a/ estimates.
b/ road reconstruction, rehabilitation and strengthening.
2.9   In line with the Government's macroeconomic strategy, which includes reducing public
expenditure and debt, the objective for road sector financing should be for revenues derived from
road users to be adequate to cover the costs not only of routine and periodic maintenance, but also of
capital investment necessary to preserve the road network and prevent decapitalization of the road
assets including reconstruction, rehabilitation and the debt service. Following the recent increases in
fuel prices and transit fees, the road user revenue figures in Table 2.1 show a significant increase. In
1992 it is estimated that road user charges will cover almost 60 percent of total road expenditures.
Present road-user charges are complicated due to their piecemeal evolution and neither reflect the
wear and tear to the network occasioned by different classes of road users nor provide incentives to
use more appropriate vehicles.



2.10   Commercial vehicles, particularly trucks, are the vehicles responsible for practically all of the
gradual breakdown of a road's superstructure over time; and will impose particularly high damage
costs during the temporary period when excess axle loads are permitted. However, even with full
enforcement of axle load limits, heavy trucks will be responsible for a very large proportion of
pavement wear and tear. Presently, diesel trucks not in transit traffic are hardly paying any fees to
cover the costs they impose. To encourage the import of vehicles that cause less damage to
pavements, and to achieve less overloading of existing vehicles, load- and distance-related user
charges and differential license fees and duties should be considered, along with higher diesel fuel
prices. Increasing diesel fuel prices is by far the most convenient, equitable and efficient way of
revenue collection; it also ensures that heavy trucks and other heavy vehicles contribute their fair
share towards financing the road sector, and this will also help reduce the budget deficit.
Implementation of a more efficient road-user charge structure will require further investigations
concentrating on the amount of additional revenue needed, the optimal structure of charges and the
methods of collection. This would be addressed in a Road Transport Policy Study under the project.
A five-year action plan for cost recovery based on a multi-year, sector financing plan would also be
developed (see Annex 4). The implementation of the action plan to achieve full cost recovery would
be monitored as part of an annual budget review with the Bank. Options such as toll roads and load-
and distance-related charges would be evaluated. In the policy study, all borrowing requirements
would be identified and financial flows made transparent to establish a clear linkage between
necessary annual expenditure on roads and the user charges needed to finance them. This policy
study would be completed by June 30, 1994 and would be financed under the proposed pro& Wt.
During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would initiate recruitment of the consultants
before the loan becomes effective and that further refinements of the terms of references will take
place before then in cooperation with the Bank.
2.11   While fuel prices at present cover economic costs, taking into account the advantageous
prices paid by Jordan for Iraqi crude, the differential between diesel and gasoline prices makes an
increase in diesel prices of 25 fils/It feasible. Regular petrol is priced at 170 fils/It (26 US¢/lt); super
petrol is priced at 300 fils/It (46 /Ilt); and diesel fuel is priced at 105 fils/It (16 ¢/lt). The Februarv
1992 cif prices in Italy (this is used as a proxy for Aqaba as Jordan's supply of oil products is
largely based on Iraqi crude obtained at an advantageous price) were: regular grade petrol priced at
US$183.28/ton (16 0/lt); super grade petrol, US$212.15/ton (18.3 0/lt); and diesel, US$170.28/ton
(14.6 0/1t). When local distribution costs are included, it is clear that petrol prices exceed economic
costs, and diesel prices just about cover economic costs. The Government is addressing the genieral
issue of energy prices in its dialogue with the IMF and in the context of a possible Bank-supported
Energy Sector Adjustment Loan.
Traffic and Road Transport
2.12   During the period 1980 to 1990, road traffic in Jordan experienced major fluctuations.
Central to these changes were the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, the cessation of hostilities in that
war and the onset of the Gulf crisis. Traffic passing through the port of Aqaba, which is one of the
country's major traffic generators is representative of all road traffic in Jordan during this time. In
1980, total traffic passing through Aqaba amounted to about 6.6 million tons, of which about 31
percent was transit traffic: in 1988, at the height of the war, the total had risen to 20.1 million tons.
of which 49 percent was transit traffic. Comparing the first nine months of 1990 with 1988, there
was a decline in traffic of about 20 percent as Iraqi demand declined. Although no national road
traffic census has been undertaken in recent years, it is clear that not only has port traffic been
affected but, as port traffic is indicative of a general economic malaise, traffic country-wide has also
probably declined. The economic evaluation of the proposed Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road
improvement takes account of these reduced levels of traffic (Annex 8).



2.13   The following table shows the growth in fuel consumption during the period 1980 to 1990.
The sudden jump in diesel consumption after 1980 is a reflection of the sharp increase in transit
traffic between Aqaba Port and Iraq resulting from the Iran-Iraq war.

Annual growth (%)       3.64%      5.03%
*) Approximately 15% of petrol consumption is super grade.
2.14     The Jordanian road transport industry is predominantly a private operation, ranging from
single owner/operators to large specialized carriers, and there is freedom of entry into the industry
although the tariffs are set and controlled by the Government (MOT). There are, in addition, three
autonomous state-owned road transport companies: (a) the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Company
with approximately 450 vehicles, operated on a 50:50 basis by the two Governments; (b) the
Jordanian-Syrian Land Transport Company with approximately 350 vehicles (most of which are
nearing the end of their economic lives), which, although jointly owned by the two Governments, is
limited almost entirely to operations within Jordan; and (c) the Public Transport Corporation, which
operates the Greater Amman bus service with a fleet of about 300 buses. The trucking fleet in
Jordan is dominated by private owner/operators providing about 60 percent of all transport capacity.
The effect of truck tariff regulation on the trucking industry, and in particular on the long-standing
problems of truck overloading, requires detailed attention. The policy study (Annex 4) to be carried
out under this project would explicitly consider this question, and will clearly establish a case for or
against eventual deregulation of freight rates in the road transport sector. During loan negotiations,
the Government agreed to include the issue of deregulation of the trucking industry in the transport
policy studies, and the terms of reference (Annex 4) will be further developed with this in mind.
2.15     Data on the size and composition of the vehicle fleets are generally unreliable in
developing countries, due to poor record keeping, the large proportion of unlicensed vehicles and
the failure to take into account vehicle scrapping. Generally, official figures tend to overestimate
the size of the vehicle population. With that caveat, the following table gives an estimate of the
vehicle fleet for 1986-90 based on figures provided by the Government.

C'.   Railwavs
2.16  The rail sector in Jordan comprises two railways although the Hedjaz Railway Corporation,
which originally ran from Syria, via Amman and Ma'an, to the Hedjaz region of Saudi Arabia, is
now essentially defunct and only operates an intermittent service to the Syrian border. The Aqaba
Railway Corporation (ARC) is a dedicated railway serving the needs of the Jordan Phosphate
Mining Company (JPMC) only, transporting phosphate from the mines at El Hasa and Al Abyad
approximately 300 km to Aqaba port. ARC started operations in 1975, using a single-line narrow-
gauge track (1050 mm) with a 16-ton axle load limitation. Originally designed to carry about 1.5
million tons of phosphate a year, the system was unable to keep up with increased demand and rail
transport has had to be heavily supplemented by private road transport. Under the Multi-Mode
Transport Project approved by the Board in 1984, much of the track has been upgraded; new
workshops have been built; and new rolling stock has been procured. After some initial setbacks,
productivity is showing clear signs of improvement: the quantity of phosphate transported to Aqaba
increased by nearly 18 percent in 1990, and, despite the impact of the Gulf crisis on ships calling at
Aqaba port, a further increase of 12 percent was achieved in 1991. In 1991 ARC carried a total of
2.9 million tons of phosphate.
2.17  The ARC's improved operating performance, together with the recently signed one-year
renegotiable contract with the JPMC and a 37 percent increase in tariffs, has led to a noticeable
improvement in the corporation's financial situation. The deterioration in the financial situation of
ARC appears to have been arrested and reversed; and there is scope for further improvements.
Based on a continuation of the present trends, Table 2.4 shows past financial performance together
with projections for 1992 to 1995.
2.18  Table 2.4 also provides details on phosphate carried, operating revenues, working expenses,
net operating income, debt service and net surplus (deficit) for the years 1986-95. Continued
upgrading of the infrastructure under the Multi-Mode Transport Project (Loan 2463-JO), supported
by technical assistance in management, operations and finance, has improved ARC's financial
performance. However, because of the devaluation of the Jordanian dinar, and because ARC has
borne the foreign exchange risk of the investments financed, financial performance has not, and will
not meet the financial targets agreed to under Loan 2463-JO. Operational inefficiencies have
exacerbated the situation. The devaluation of the JD is beyond the control of ARC, and it is
difficult for ARC to be responsible for the foreign currency transaction losses when its revenues are
in local currency. With close monitoring and better management, ARC should be able to increase
its productivity and carry the recently allocated guarantee of 3.5 million tons, possibly even 4.0
million tons per annum. Several studies have shown that the avoidable economic costs of ARC are

less than the corresponding costs of road transport, i.e., it is economical for the railway to continue
in operation. Further, international comparisons indicate that ARC tariffs are considerably lower
than rail freight tariffs elsewhere. The gradual enforcement of the axle-load limits for trucks, and
increases in diesel fuel prices and other load-related charges on heavy vehicles, should increase the
competitiveness of rail with road transport and enable rail tariffs to be raised to a level closer to
economic cost.
2.19  The issues of the ARC's linkage to its only customer, JPMC, its debt structure,
organizational restructuring, traffic levels and the transport needs of the El Shidiya mines would be
reviewed under this project in a policy study to precede the institutional development technical
assistance to be provided to ARC. This support to ARC would include preparation of a corporate
development plan and a multi-year financing plan for the railway which includes a contract plan
between ARC, JPMC and the government setting out the obligations and responsibilities of each.
The provision of appropriate operational and management technical assistance is designed to help
ARC carry out the necessary studies to cut costs, improve performance and achieve financial
viability. See Annex 5 for an outline of the terms of reference for the support to ARC.
D.    Aqaba Port
2.20  Port traffic has experienced large fluctuations during the past 10 years. However, on the
whole, as is shown in the following table, the financial position of Aqaba Port has remained strong
(although data concerning returns on revalued fixed assets are unavailable).

a' includes depreciation and debt service.
2.21   While the recent fluctuations in traffic have been larger than is common (see Table 2.6
below), and 1991 is likely to show a significant decline, ports frequently experience fluctuations due
to a variety of factors including (i) general economic conditions; (ii) regional politics and economic
groupings; and (iii) changes in technology and price and service competition. Whereas (i) and (ii)
above are largely outside the control of the port authorities, the last factor is something that should
be under continuous review by port management. The Port of Aqaba has, for the most part,
responded to traffic situations instead of developing action plans based on a well-researched
marketing policy. Bearing in mind the past and potential contribution of the port of Aqaba to
Jordanian trade and direct foreign exchange earnings, marketing and associated development
strategies deserve careful examination; the Port Authorities are planning to undertake such a study
with their own resources, independent of the proposed project.

E.    Civil Aviation
2.22   The two main organizations in the civil aviation subsector are Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ)
and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Both of these are autonomous entities responsible to
MOT.
Royal Jordanian Airlines
2.23   Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) founded in 1963, is an autonomous corporation required to
operate on a commercial basis. In addition to domestic, regional and international air services, there
are a number of subsidiaries: the Royal Jordanian Air Academy, travel and tourism services, hotels,
training and consultancy services. Like the rest of the economy, the company's operations have
been subjected to problems resulting from regional economic and political instability. Moreover, it
has had to operate for the most part in a very competitive market. Despite these challenges, until
recently RJ had developed a good reputation based on competent staff and sound marketing and
expansion policies. In 1987, RJ made a profit of JD 1.9 million on its operations after depreciation
and debt service; official results for 1989 and 1990 are not yet available, but net profit in 1989 was
estimated at JD 4.2 million.

2.24   At the beginning of 1990 several measures were taken to improve profitability, these
included dropping loss-making routes, entering into route sharing with other companies to optimize
load factors, selling part of the fleet on a lease-back arrangement and leasing out aircraft surplus to
needs. Based on these measures, it was expected that profits in 1990 would increase to about JD II
million. Unfortunately, with the onset of the Gulf crisis these expectations could not be achieved
and, currently, the airline is experiencing major operating and financial problems. The Jordanian
authorities and RJ management recognize the present difficulties and accept that a solution to these
problems lies in privatization. Before that can happen, however, the Government needs to address
the issues of RJ debt and the restoration of profitability. As an interim measure, the airline will
become 100 percent state-owned in order to be restructured prior to privatization, which is expected
within three years.
Civil Aviation Authority
2.25   The CAA, which is responsible for the management of Jordan's airports, air traffic control
and licensing, is well managed and efficient. A surplus was achieved on its recurrent budget from
1987 to 1990, which was more than enough to finance its program of capital expenditure. However,
overflying fees were the major source of revenue and the Gulf crisis, which caused a severe
reduction in civil aviation in the region, will undoubtedly have a large negative impact on the
financial position of CAA; there is, unfortunately, little that can be done to address this problem.

F.    Previous Bank Involvement
2.26   The proposed project would be the third operation in the transport sector. In June 1971,
IDA approved a credit (262-JO), in the amount of US$ 6 million equivalent, to finance the
construction of an 18-km dual carriageway road between Amman and Zarqa, as well as consultancy
services, the purchase of road maintenance equipment and an urban transport study of Amman. The
credit was closed and fully disbursed in December, 1974 with the road component being completed
two years later than expected with a 30 percent cost overrun. Considering that this was the first
transport sector project, and in an urban area, the delays were not excessive. Most of the delay was
occasioned by difficulties in obtaining the right-of-way and difficulties in contractor mobilization,
due to the Jordan-Syria border closure: these, in turn, gave rise to a significant claim being paid to
the contractor, which was the main reason for the cost overrun. Under the proposed project, the
planned Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road would be reconstructed and widened along the existing
road on land already acquired by the Government and acquiring right-of-way will not therefore
present problems.
2.27   The Multi-Mode Transport Project (Loan 2463-JO), with a Bank loan of US$30 million
equivalent, was approved by the Board in July 1984 and became effective in February 1985. The
project was extended three times due to project delays and, recently, the Gulf crisis, and the project
closed on December 31, 1992. The project had as its objectives:
(a)   easing bottlenecks on critical export/import routes through (i) improving highway
maintenance; (ii) upgrading the capacity and productivity of ARC; and (iii) improving cargo
handling operations at Aqaba port;
(b)   ensuring the implementation of axle-load legislation;
(c)   achieving financial viability for ARC;
(d)   strengthening transport sector institutions through training and technical assistance; and,
(e)   introducing and implementing better project preparation, implementation and monitoring.
2.28   Delays in implementing physical objectives were largely occasioned by differences between
the Government and the Bank on the procurement of civil works; in particular, on the use of price
variation in civil works contracts. All components have been fully committed and are in progress.
The achievement of institutional development objectives has not been quite so successful; however,
the recent economic crisis has led to a realization on the part of the Government of the need for
institutional reform. Key issues are: (i) MPWH and MOT, although making better use of project
feasibility studies and implementing a road maintenance management system, are still relatively



- 14 -
weak as regards the integration of planning; (ii) the enforcement of axle-load legislation is only now
being seriously attempted through a gradual reduction in overloading, and the 13-ton axle-load limit
will not be in effect for another two years; and (iii) ARC operations and finances have only just
started to show an improving trend (para. 2.18). However, the devaluation of the Jordanian dinar
has put debt servicing beyond the capacity of ARC and, therefore, the meeting of the financial
covenant is no longer feasible solely through operational efficiencies as had originally been
expected.
2.29   While ARC has made important strides in its program of infrastructure upgrading and
workshop and equipment procurement, improvements have been slower than anticipated, and, thus,
operations have continued to be affected by derailments and locomotive breakdowns. Consequently,
productivity improvements are only beginning to be realized. A policy of major tariff increases
alone *k ould probably not have been effective in remedying the ARC financial position either.
Traffic would have been diverted to competing road transport where, in the past, low user charges
and the overloading of trucks permitted lower truck tariffs to be stipulated by the Government for
phosphate. Despite these obstacles to increased rail tariffs, an overall tariff increase of 37 percent
has been negotiated with JPMC. Several factors now indicate that better performance is likely:
(i) rail traffic is expanding, and tariffs have been increased, although insufficiently; (ii) the gradual
enforcement of axle-load limits for roads and increases in user charges, including diesel fuel prices,
should increase the competitiveness of rail with road transport and enable rail tariffs to be raised to
a level closer to economic cost; (iii) technical assistance in the form of policy support proposed
under the project (to review, inter alia, cost recovery from road users, in particular the trucking
industry) should lead to recommendations on how to improve the competitiveness of rail; and
(iv) the institutional development technical assistance to ARC proposed under this project should
also improve efficiency and financial performance. The future role of ARC and the issues related to
the contractual arrangement between ARC and its only customer JPMC, ARC's debt structure, tariff
levels, and the transport needs of the new mine at El Shidiya will have to be reviewed as part of this
TA support.
III.   THE PROJECT
A.    Backeround and Objectives
3.1   In view of the country's macro-economic imbalances, the impact of the Gulf Crisis,
especially the loss of traditional regional export markets and transit trade, and limited natural
resources, the Government has decided to focus its efforts in infrastructure on a limited number of
actions that will support its socio-economic objectives. The project would promote an efficient and
economically and financially viable transport sector in line with the Government's short and
medium-term strategy by: adjusting the relative prices between rail tariffs and road haulage rates;
improving durability of road pavements; improving the quality of maintenance of roads; and
supporting the implementation of axle load regulations. Key objectives of the project are:
(a)    contributing to the economic adjustment program by continued upgrading of foreign trade
arteries, especially seriously substandard road sections;
(b)    cost effective preservation of past road investments and reduction of long term transport
costs by: (i) rehabilitation of key road sections; (ii) enforcement of legislation on axle-
load limits and improvments in pavement design and construction to extend the life of
road investments; (iii) securing sufficient funding for road maintenance; and
(c)    providing technical assistance for policy support and institutional development to:



- 15 -
(i)   enable GOJ to develop the organizational, administrative, technical and financial
capacity of the road agency to a level sufficient to ensure that the utility of the
roads to be reconstructed and rehabilitated is sustained over the long term;
(ii)  improve the operational efficiency and financial viability of ARC in a sustainable
way by strengthening the management and improving operations and
maintenance.
B.    Project Description
3.2   Based on the objectives outlined in para. 3.1 the proposed project components, designed to
assist in their achievement, are described in the following sections.
(i) Ras El-Nagab to Wadi Yutum Road
3.3   The north - south 327 km Desert Highway links the port of Aqaba, Jordan's only outlet to
the sea with Amman and the area north, and the phosphate mines at El Hasa, Al Abyad and El
Shidiya. Most of the road has been upgraded geometrically and the pavement rehabilitated and
strengthened. However, the 71 km section between Wadi Yutum and Ras El Naqab, which includes
the steep 12.6 kmn Ras El Naqab escarpment, has suffered severe deterioration over much of its
length. Consequently, vehicle operating costs have risen on this section (Project file and Annex 8)
which now requires major reconstruction and rehabilitation. On the escarpment section and on the
13-km long climb along the river (Wadi Yutum) at the Aqaba end of the project, the reconstruction
of the road will have to take place in the present alignment with widening to four lanes to improve
road safety and provide additional road space for slow moving trucks. This would require provision
of detour roads, and significant improvements would have to be made to the Ras El Naqab
Resthouse Road to act as a temporary detour during the estimated 30 months construction period of
the main road.
3.4   The estimated cost of this component (excluding quantity and price contingencies) is JD
33.90 million (US$48.04 m) divided into two contracts of JD 17.50 million (US$24.80 m) for the
road improvement between Wadi Yutum and the foot of the Ras El Naqab escarpment (43 km), and
JD 16.40 million (US$23.24 m) for the 28-km long Ras El Naqab escarpment section (including JD
2 million for road detours). Quantity and price contingencies and construction supervision will add
US$12.4 million to this estimate. The foreign cost component of these works is estimated at 70
percent. The design details of the proposed upgrading and detour are given in the Project File
(Annex 1) and the implementation schedule is given in Annex 6. Regarding the detours on the
escarpment section and other critical detours, the Government agreed at loan negotiations to
establish and staff a management group that would include users and the traffic police to oversee the
contractors' operation and ensure that the critical regulation of traffic through the works and on
detours with associated services are of sufficient standard during the construction period.
(ii) Road Rehabilitation Program
3.5   Although the MPWH is operating a road maintenance planning system the budget resources
allocated for road maintenance have been insufficient (para. 2.6) and, as a result, a backlog of
periodic maintenance has developed. The proposed project will address this problem by assisting in
the finance of a road pavement strengthening program. Four road links have been tentatively
identified for the 1993-95 rehabilitation program with a total cost estimated at JD 10.08 million
(US$14.29 m). Price contingencies and construction supervision would add about US$2.0 million to
this. Ongoing planning and design work in Jordan may identify other high priority road links with



- 16 -
better rate of return than some of the selected links, and it is understood that substitutions or
additions may take place in the program within the allocated amount for civil works in the loan
agreement. This is necessary because ongoing annual surveys of road pavement conditions may
identify deteriorated road sections where the base and subbase are in good condition and can be
preserved by a less expensive (asphalt concrete) surfacing operation that would yield higher returns
and save deeper layers from further deterioration. Annex 7 describes the first four road links in the
Government's present road rehabilitation program. During loan negotiations, an assurance was
obtained from the Government that the annual allocations for roads and in particular road
maintenance would be adequate and that exchange of views in this respect would take place with the
Bank prior to finalizing each year's budget. It was further agreed at loan negotiations that any
changes or additions to the rehabilitation program would be subject to individual economic analysis
based on guidelines provided by the Bank, and would need to satisfy a minimum rate of return of 15
percent and would be subject to prior approval by the Bank.
(iii) Technical Assistance Component
3.6    While the technical assistance component of the proposed project comprises less than 5
percent of the total estimated project cost, it will be instrumental in achieving government objectives
in the transport sector. There are two categories of technical assistance (TA) in the project: Policy
Support (PSTA); and Institutional Development (IDTA). For the road sector, the PSTA aims at
assisting the Government in reviewing key policy issues, developing related policy options, and
providing support for implementation of policy reforms within the road transport sector. For the
rail sub-sector, the technical assistance is aimed at facilitating restructuring of ARC and improving
the railway's corporate strategy, management performance, information and decision support
systems, and providing several forms of training assistance.
(a)    PSTA for Road Transport Sector
3.7    Outline terms of reference are presented in Annex 4 for a proposed program of studies for
the road sector. A two-phase approach to the studies has been adopted, the first phase being
concerned with resolving key policy and institutional issues in the road transport sector, while the
second phase focuses on devising detailed arrangements for the implementation of decisions reached
at the end of Phase 1. Phase 1 comprises, in turn, two interdependent studies; a Road Transport
Policy Issues Study and an Institutional Options Study. A study timetable is presented in Annex 4
for both Phase I and the implementation studies in Phase 2 indicating completion of the first phase
in six months. To facilitate a thoroughgoing debate and a full appreciation of the difficult policy
considerations connected with road transport, particularly during the Phase 1 study period, it is
proposed to organize two policy seminars and a Facilitation Specialist will be recruited to conduct
these seminars and facilitate the process of policy change. The cost of the Phase 1 studies is
estimated at US$0.5 million and the Phase 2 studies at about US$1.0 million, the latter depending
somewhat on the outcome of Phase 1. During loan negotiations, the Government agreed that prior
to the start of these studies a Coordinating Committee would be established comprising senior
government officials and representatives of the main interest groups in the road transport sector. At
loan negotiations it was also agreed that the establishment of the Coordinating Committee, and
initiation of recruitment of the consultant(s) for the Phase I studies would be a condition of
effectiveness.
(b)    PSTA for Agaba Railway Corporation
3.8    ARC has agreed to the necessity of recruiting a technical assistance team to assist in the
management of ARC's operation. But before that can take place, initial policy studies on Corporate
Development and Restructuring would be needed to address the policy and institutional issues and to



- 17 -
prepare action plans to make ARC a more commercially-oriented corporation. The studies would
assist in developing consensus for institutional and financial restructuring and assess the detailed
needs for implementation support. US$300,000 would be needed to carry out this first phase, which
would be managed by the Government and the outcome (Phase II) would be implemented using the
technical assistance team. Terms of Reference are attached in Annex 5. During loan negotiations,
it was agreed that the initial studies should be completed as soon as possible after effectiveness and
before June 30, 1994.
(c)   IDTA for Aqaba Railway Corporation (Phase II)
3.9   Based on the results of the policy study and the needs identification, a TA team would be
recruited for a period of up to two years, to carry out further analysis and assist in the
implementation of action plans for restructuring of operations, maintenance and general management
of ARC. A brief description and Terms of Reference are in Annex 5 and a more detailed version is
in the project files. The technical assistance team will be in place for up to 24 months and will
require approximately 102 man-months at a cost of about US$1.5 million. In providing the above
assistance to ARC, the Government at loan negotiations agreed that ARC would only undertake
investments in new railway facilities after the technical and financial viability of such investments
has been established on the basis of principles and arrangements agreed upon between the Bank and
ARC, including, i.a. the contractual arrangements to be concluded between ARC and JPMC for
covering the capital and financial costs of such investments.
C.    Cost Estimates and Financing
3.10  Project cost estimates and financing are summarized in the following two tables and was
confirmed at loan negotiations. The project cost estimates are based on December 1992 price levels.
The estimated foreign exchange component is JD 38.99 million (US$55.22 m).
3.11  Cost estimates for civil works are based on quantities from the final engineering design and
on unit rates based on construction contracts from 1992. A road pavement study with the objective
of reviewing general pavement design standards and other aspects related to existing and new road
pavements' performance and durability was completed by the end of November 1992. This study,
financed with a grant from the Japanese Government, concluded that the premature road pavement
failures in Jordan are primarily caused by weaknesses in the pavement design standards adopted by
the Government for use in Jordan. Furthermore, the study indicated that the existing base and sub-
base layers of the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road are in a better condition than previously
anticipated. During loan negotiations, the Government and the Bank agreed to make modification to
the detail design of the project to allow the recommendations of the pavement study to be rcelected
as options in the tender documents. It was also agreed at negotiations, that the construction
supervision consultant to be recruited under the project should review the design and make any
adjustments to the tender documents in order to be able to take full responsibility for the quality of
the works.
3.12  A 10 percent physical contingency is added to the base cost of the Desert Highway Project.
No physical contingency has been added to the base cost of the road rehabilitation program since the
theoretical volumes of resurfacing and asphalt overlays as well as other pavement layers are easy to
calculate with a high degree of accuracy. For the calculation of price contingencies it is assumed
that the foreign component will increase by 3.8 percent per year, and that the domestic inflation will
be 4.5 percent in 1993, 4.4 percent in 1994, 4.3 percent in 1995, and 4.0 percent in 1996 and 1997.
The foreign exchange component of the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road and the road rehabilitation
program is estimated at 70 percent. The average exchange rate for the construction period has been
assumed to be US$1 = 0.7057 Jordanian Dinars.

3.13  The Bank loan would amount to US$35 million or 43.5 percent of the total project cost.
The Bank would finance the foreign exchange element of the southern flat section of the Ras El
Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road (Section I), construction supervision, the road rehabilitation program and
the Road Transport Policy Studies (Phase I) and the Phase I studies to restructure and commercialize
ARC. Parallel financing of ECU 15 million (about US$19.85 million equivalent) would be provided
by the European Investment Bank which has expressed willingness to finance the foreign exchange
component of the escarpment section (Section II) of the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road.
ARC/GOJ will provide additional funding for the Phase II technical assistance. This leaves no
financing gap. However, the European Community and Canadian IDA have also indicated an
interest in grant funding of parts of the TA component including Phase I studies. If these or other
sources of financing for the Phase I TA materialize, the proceeds of the Bank loan would be
reallocated to cover more road pavement rehabilitation or parts of Phase II of the technical
assistance. It is expected that design modifications to the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum project would
lead to cost reductions and the savings would be utilized for the Road Rehabilitation components of



- 19 -
the project. Each financing agency would (unless agreed odierwise) administer procurement related
to its part of the project, and the Government would arrange regular exchanges of information
among cofinanciers and regular progress reports would include the status of all project components.
During loan negotiations, the Government agreed to provide the necessary counterpart funds.

D.   Implementation and Monitorine
3.14 The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan will be the borrower for the Bank loan of US$35.0
million, and the executing agencies would be MPWH for the two road works components; MOT for
the transport policy and ARC corporate development studies, and MPWH and ARC for other TA
activities. During loan negotiations, agreement was obtained from the Government that it would
retain consultants for construction supervision of the road sections to be reconstructed including the
Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. During loan
negotiations, the Implementation Schedule contained in Annex 6 was discussed and agreed with the
Government. The TOR and work program for the TA component contained in Annexes 4 and 5
was also reviewed by the Government. However, it was agreed during negotiations that final
review and endorsement of the TOR should take place once the Coordinating Committee is



- 20 -
established (para. 3.7).
3.15  In addition to supervision missions, the project would be monitored through quarterly
progress reports to be submitted by the MPWH to the Bank within 30 days after the end of each
quarter during the entire implementation period. The progress reports would review progress based
on the contractors' implementation plans and work program of the consultants for the TA
component. This was agreed at loan negotiations. These reports would focus on both the cumulative
and the incremental progress achieved during the reporting period in: (i) the physical progress of
both contracts for the main road reconstruction compared to the contractors work plans; (ii) all
supervision work including supervision of contractors' archaeological earthworks and new sites to be
excavated; (iii) the bidding process of all rehabilitation contracts for civil works to be procured
under this project; (iv) the physical progress of civil works contracts under the pavement
rehabilitation component compared with the contractors' work plans; (v) the technical assistance,
studies, policy support and institutional development assistance, and staff training to be provided
under the project; (vi) Bank disbursements and projected disbursement over the next 6 months;
(vii) fulfillment of the covenants and audits of accounts (SA and SOEs), and audit reporting; and,
(viii) actions taken for the resolution of issues raised by past supervision missions. A brief
summary should be added to the report explaining the reasons for any delays or shortcomings in any
of the above items and for actions taken to improve progress.
3.16 A mid-term review of all project activities would be conducted jointly by MPWH, MOT,
ARC and the Bank within two years of loan effectiveness (see also para 3.18 on project
supervision). To facilitate this review the GOJ would prepare a summary report covering all aspects
of the project and submit it to the Bank instead of the quarterly report preceding the joint review.
At loan negotiations, the Government also agreed to submit to the Bank Part II of the project
completion report, prepared in accordance with Bank Guidelines set out in Operational Directive
13.55, Annex A, within six months after the loan closing date.
3.17  Statistically valid transport sector implementation profiles are difficult to establish for Jordan.
However, civil works have generally been completed close to contract schedules; most time
overruns have been occasioned by start-up delays (especially associated with procurement issues).
Similarly, delays in technical assistance programs have frequently been due to delays in government
approval for the use of consultants, particularly where loan funds are concerned. The project is
being processed in such a way as to address and to resolve these potential issues prior to Board
approval so as to enable the project to start disbursing quickly. The Project Implementation
Schedule (Annex 6) shows road works for the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road and the first year's
periodic road maintenance program starting towards the end of 1993 with completion due end of
December 1997. Project closing is scheduled for June 30, 1999 allowing for a one year
maintenance period and 6 months for final disbursements. This would give a project duration of 78
months (6-1/2 years).
E.    Project Supervision
3.18  Two supervision missions each year would be sufficient for project implementation, except
for the first 2 years where three missions each year would be more appropriate. One of these
missions would take place in order to also review the subsequent year's road maintenance and
investment budget. Over the project execution period this would amount to 14 missions. For the
most part, the missions would be staffed by a civil engineer and a transport economist supported by
a railway specialist and a human resources and institutional development specialist initially. From
time to time additional specialists may be required. It is estimated that supervision missions will
require approximately 126 staff-weeks or 9 staff-weeks per mission (18 staff-weeks per year with



- 21 -
two missions) including home office preparation and back-to-office reporting.
3.19  Table 3.3 gives staff input in weeks in relation to supervision. In addition to the staff inputs
described above there are needs at headquarters for review of general progress reports, audit
reports, consultants' inception/draft final/final reports, preparation and participation in policy
seminars, procurement actions, correspondence, contact with cofinanciers and aid donors, etc. which
is estimated to take 3 staff-weeks each for the first two years and two weeks for the remaining years
totalling 14 staff-weeks. Total staff-weeks requirements would therefore be 140 staff-weeks. See
Annex 9 for a plan for all supervision missions.

F.    Procurement
3.20  The project components and their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the
elements to be financed by the Bank are summarized in Table 3.4. The Bank would finance
reconstruction works on Section I of the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road and several pavement
rehabilitation contracts as well as construction supervision and part of the technical assistance. The
other cofinancier (EIB) will have its own procurement requirements and would finance Section II of
the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road (escarpment section). For consultancy assignments under the
TA component the Bank would approve the short list of firms before the invitations for proposals
are sent out. Since the supervision consultants may be asked to review the design documents before
tendering, it was agreed at negotiations that the loan agreement would provide for retroactive
financing of up to US$500,000 to allow this and other activities to take place before loan
effectiveness.
3.21   All works to be financed from the proceeds of the Bank loan would be procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. The Jordanian authorities prefer not to allow price
adjustment for local labor in their civil works contracts, due to a number of technical reasons and
past experiences in Jordan. As the proposed project includes contracts estimated to cost over US$20
million including contingencies, it was agreed at negotiations that the project would provide an
appropriate price escalation clause for four other main inputs (fuel, steel, cement and bitumen).
Bidding documents used in the past for ICB in Jordan on civil works contracts are no longer
acceptable to the Bank, and several changes to the Jordanian 'Conditions of Contract' and
'Instructions to Tenderers' were discussed and agreed at negotiations. Consulting services financed
under the loan, would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. All documents
relating to procurement of consulting services financed under the Bank loan would be subject to the
Bank's prior review.



- 22 -
3.22   All civil works contracts exceeding US$500,000 would be subject to prior review and
approval by the Bank. No contracts below US$500,000 are foreseen, except for consulting services.
During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with the govermnent on the procurement
arrangements.

Note:  Figures in parenthesis are the amounts which will be financed by the proposed Bank loan.
3.23   Procurement for all items under the project would be carried out by the respective
beneficiaries (MPWH and ARC) as shown in Table 3.4 above. Both MPWH and ARC have carried
out procurement in a satisfactory manner according to ICB rules before (Multi-mode Transport
Project). In 1988, the Bank carried out a Local Procurement Assessment study and concluded that
Jordan's local competitive procurement rules are acceptable subject to some clarifications being
obtained. This was reviewed during negotiations and it was agreed to address current practice of
price adjustments and other issues in a Procurement Assessment Study to initiate discussions between
the Bank and the Government. There will be no local preference for LCB. Factors for evaluation
will be specified in the tender and quantified for comparison. LCB is justified for the road pavement
rehabilitation component because of relatively small contracts, scattered location and that the
investment that a foreign contractor would have to make in specialized work equipment for asphalt
resurfacing, strengthening and pavement reconstruction are already owned by local contractors.
However, road pavement rehabilitation contracts above US$5.0 million would utilize ICB procedures.
Procurement of consulting services for construction supervision would have to be initiated early to
allow the supervision team to review the design and contract documents, take part in tender
evaluation and monitor all initial site activities including excavations of archaeological sites.
Appointment of the supervision consultant has, therefore, been made a condition of effectiveness for
the loan, and this was agreed at loan negotiations. In order not to delay pre-construction activities it
was agreed at negotiations that retroactive financing of up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000
should be allowed for. The Project Implementation Schedule was also agreed at negotiations and is
presented in Annex 6.



- 23 -
3.24  Procurement information would be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)   prompt reporting of contract award information by the borrower;
(b)   comprehensive quarterly reports to the Bank by the borrower (assisted by consultants),
indicating:
(i)  revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including
best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingency;
(ii)  revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and
(iii)  compliance with specified methods of procurement.
G.   Disbursements
3.25  The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the project components as follows:

3.26    Withdrawal applications for contracts valued at more than US$100,000 would be fully
documented and presented in English for disbursements. Disbursement for contracts valued at
US$100,000 or less would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs). During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the government that documentation to support expenditures
financed under SOEs or otherwise will be maintained, in English, by MPWH and made available for
review by Bank supervision missions, and annual audit reports will be prepared and submitted in
English, by auditors acceptable to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
3.27    To facilitate disbursements, the Bank's share of the project would be disbursed through a



- 24 -
Special Account which would be opened in the Central Bank of Jordan by MPWH. The authorized
allocation for the Special Account would be US$2.5 million, equivalent to about four months of
project expenses financed under the Bank loan. Replenishment of the Special Account would follow
Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. The audit report, in English, would be submitted to the Bank for review and
approval within six months of the end of each financial year. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with the government on the establishment, operation and auditing of the Special Account.
3.28    A schedule of disbursements, based on a projected effectiveness date of September 1993 is
given in Annex 10. It is anticipated that the proposed project will be completed in 72 months from
the date of approval or by December 31, 1998 including a 12 months contractor's maintenance
period. The loan would be fully disbursed 6 months later or June 30, 1999.
H.    Environment
3.29  The proposed project components are not anticipated to occasion any adverse impact on the
environment, because the project will basically widen, reconstruct or rehabilitate main roads along
and mostly within existing rights-of-way, mainly in desert areas with minimal settlements in the
vicinity of the road. Only on the escarpment section of the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road will
there be minor straightening of sharp curves along the existing road but without departing from the
present general road alignment. On the remaining section; improvement works will be generally
close to the alignment of the existing road. Based on this, the proposed project has been placed in
the environmental category "B".
3.30  Archaeological surveys have been undertaken to identify problem areas, and five
archaeological sites were identified as in need of protective measures to be undertaken before the
contractor can start road works. Retroactive financing of site excavations within the amount of
US$500,000 agreed at negotiations for consulting work etc. would prevent unnecessary delays. All
five sites are located on an 8-km long section of the road at the northern end of the project (escarp-
ment section). To ensure that any other important sites not yet located will not be disturbed during
construction, it has been agreed that representatives of the Department of Antiquities shall be present
during major civil works. Excavation of sites, environmental monitoring and protection of any
cultural property discovered during construction will be carried out as part of the project and funds
will be made available by provisional items in the contracts' Bill of Quantities. In the case of a cost
over-run for archaeological excavation works, additional funding would be made available by GOJ
and this was confirmed during loan negotiations.
3.31   All archaeological rescue work would be included as provisional items in the Tender
Documents for the road contracts. The contractor would be responsible for the excavation works,
supervised by the Department of Antiquities. This would facilitate coordination and reduce claims
for delays. The archaeological surveys carried out by the Department of Antiquities have confirmed
that no in-situ conservation measures is required. One site is irreparably damaged by the existing
road. No sites are located in a way that would require the road alignment to be adjusted during
construction. To ensure adequate monitoring during construction, the Department of Antiquities will
be present during excavation and earthworks to ensure that road works stop on sections where
important discoveries are made and that appropriate actions to preserve cultural heritage are
undertaken. During loan negotiations, the Government agreed to implement the set of measures
recommended by the survey report, in particular:
(i)   ensure that the five sites discovered during the archaeological survey are excavated promptly,
and if necessary as part of the contractors work program, paid under the contract;
(ii)   ensure that a suitably qualified representative from the Department of Antiquities is present
during major excavation and earthworks;



- 25 -
(iii)  allocate sufficient funds from the government budget for such archaeological monitoring; and
(iv)   ensure that any items of archaeological or cultural importance affected by the project and
discovered during construction are protected in consultation with the Department of
Antiquities.
Any costs the contractor may incur related to works or delays caused by any unexpected find would
be a project cost and charged to the appropriate provisional item in the road construction contract.
3.32   There are no detailed accident data available on the individual road sections that will be
improved under this project. Therefore it is not possible to predict the size or magnitude of the
safety improvements the project will most definitely lead to. However, the reconstruction and
improvements to the Ras El Naqab to Wadi Yutum Road will eliminate one black spot (associated
with fatal accidents) and several safety features have been included in the design of the road. These
are the inclusion of climbing lanes to separate slow moving traffic from other vehicles, introduction
of a physical median (New Jersey type barrier) to separate traffic flowing in opposite directions and
metal guard rails with reflective markers on the escarpment section. Additional safety gains are
expected from the reductions in axle load limits that in the past made many of the heavy vehicles
unsafe on the road due to improper weight distribution on the axles and unexpected breakdowns.
I.    Accounting and Auditing
3.33   The MPWH, MOT and ARC keep separate accounts for all budget items and these provide
input for the accounts held by the Ministry of Planning which is responsible for the financial records
of those components involving loans and grants from non-government sources. Annual audits of
these accounts would be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and this was
agreed at negotiations. The financial record keeping would include a system of monitoring
submission of applications for withdrawal and for Special Commitments and the reconciliation of its
records with those of the Bank.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.    Introduction
4.1   The economic evaluation presented here covers the major components of the project for
which benefits are quantifiable. These comprise the reconstruction of the Ras El-Naqab to Wadi
Yutum Road (JD 38 million), and the rehabilitation of 93-km of priority roads (JD 12 million),
which together account for about 95 percent of the total project cost. Components for which no
economic evaluations have been carried out are for technical assistance to ARC (JD 1.5 million),
and to the road transport sector (JD 1.4 million). Details of the economic evaluation are in Annex 8
and the following summarizes the key results.
B.    Ras El Nagab to Wadi Yutum Road.
4.2   The 71-km Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum road section, which includes the steep and tortuous
Ras lz` Naqab escarpment, is part of the Desert Highway linking the port of Aqaba with most of the
rest of the country. As such it is crucial for much of Jordan's domestic transport but, above all, for
its international trade including the very important phosphate exports of which 50 percent are trans-
ported by road. Prior to the recent regional crisis the road also permitted the development of the
lucrative transit traffic between Aqaba and neighboring countries: it is possible that following the
resolution of the crisis, this traffic will again become important.
4.3    Due to a combination of several factors including inappropriate design, inadequate
maintenance and the very heavy axle loads, the road structure has been severely degraded. As a
result the road has reached a level of deterioration that in places may lead to a condition of virtual
impassability which would be disastrous from a commercial and economic point of view; exports of
phosphate would be reduced and costs of imported goods in most of the country would increase.
Furthermore, as long sections have now reached a stage where reconstruction is required, the road
capacity would be severely constrained by the road works during rehabilitation. Consequently, it
has been recommended by the consultants employed by the MPWH to undertake the feasibility study
and final design, that a new two lane road should be built parallel to the existing road over the
relatively flat 41-km from Wadi Yutum to the base of the escarpment, and a widening of the existing
two lane road, to provide additional lanes for slow moving traffic, be carried out on the 13-km
climb up the valley along Wadi Yutum and on the 14-km escarpment section. During construction
work in the escarpment section of the road and in the climb up the Wadi Yutum valley, detours will
have to be constructed in order to provide reasonable flows of traffic in both direction. Hence, the
old Ras El Naqab Resthouse Road will have to be improved and strengthened so that it may be used
as a detour during work on the main road.
Economic Evaluation
4.4    Details of the projected traffic flows, vehicle operating cost savings, and the estimation of
project economic costs are presented in Annex 8. It is estimated that the project will require 4 years
to implement; however, some benefits will begin to accrue by the third year when a significant
portion of the road will have been opened to traffic. The without project case, against which the
proposed investment is evaluated, is based on maintaining the road in its present form by carrying
out periodic overlays at 6-year intervals. It should be noted that these works do not improve the
geometrics or capacity of the road but merely prevent loss of the existing infrastructure. The
alternative of reconstructing the existing road was also evaluated and was found to have a lower rate
of return (8.8%) due to the cost of detours and the increased implementation time caused by the
need to reroute traffic and minimize disruptions during reconstruction works. Based on these
assumptions, the reconstruction of the Ras El-Naqab to Wadi Yutum Road is estimated to have an
expected internal rate of return of 14.2 percent, and a net present value of JD 15.1 million at the 10
percent discount rate.

Sensitivity Analyses
4.5    Changes in the project's expected rate of return with changes in key parameters were
investigated through both simple sensitivity analyses and through estimation of switching values for
key parameters which are subject to significant risk. The sensitivity of the rate of return to a 15
percent increase in cost, a 15 percent reduction in benefits, and a combination of these, is presented
in Table 4.1, and in the latter case the IRR is found to drop to 11.1 percent, which is acceptable
given the unquantified but substantial benefits deriving from safety improvements. Switching values
were computed for three key factors: success in the enforcement of axle load restrictions, diversion
of truck traffic to the Dead Sea Road in 1995, and diversion of light vehicle traffic to the same
route. The table below presents the results of the switching value analysis.
Parameter                              Expected Value                  Switchin2 Value

Load Restrictions                         95%                                 5%
Truck Traffic Diversion
to Dead Sea Road                          10%                                46%
Light Vehicle Diversion
to Dead Sea Road                          75%                                100%
4.6   The switching value of a parameter in the above table, is the value of that parameter which
causes the IRR for the project to drop to 10 percent. In the case of axle load restrictions, 100
percent success is defined as a level of enforcement which causes average truck payloads to decline
to below 22 tons from the present average of 37 tons, which is the 0 percent success level. On each
of these three parameters, the switching value analysis indicates that there is considerable latitude for
change in each taken individually; no analysis was carried out of the joint effect of risk in these
parameters as that would require a more exhaustive risk analysis of the project.
C.    Road Rehabilitation Progga
4.7    MPWH's road maintenance budget has been inadequate and as a result, insufficient resources
have been allocated to routine maintenance, light periodic maintenance such as resealing, and
periodic pavement strengthening to maintain the road system's load carrying capacity. In addition,
the relaxed axle-load policy has accelerated pavement deterioration. Consequently, a backlog of
deferred road works, including pavement strengthening and rehabilitation works, has developed over
the last 10 years. This must now be addressed in the form of a pavement rehabilitation program to
prevent a sharp increase in vehicle operating costs and avoid a more expensive reconstruction in the
future. The MPWH has through its Road Maintenance Management System (RMMS) so far identi-
fied approximately 175-kin of roads in this category which need immediate treatment at an estimated
average cost of US$150,000 per km. It is proposed to finance four high priority road links of this
program in the project. The program (Annex 7) is estimated to yield a high Economic Rate of
Return since the "do-nothing" alternative would involve an even higher reconstruction cost later to
gain basically the same benefits, while road users would continue to incur high operating costs due
to high road roughness until the road is reconstructed. This component is estimated to be
approximately 24 percent of the total project cost.
Economic Evaluation
4.8    Details on the economic evaluation of the road sections proposed to be rehabilitated under
the project are in Annex 8. Traffic on these roads are projected to grow at an annual rate of 2



- 28 -
percent. Based on vehicle operating costs estimated for these road sections, total VOC per annum is
computed for the with and without project cases. The without project case does not include the cost
of major reconstruction, and hence the evaluation is conservative in that the only benefits considered
are savings in vehicle operating costs. Rates of return computed for the three road segments and the
sensitivity analyses (15 percent increase in cost and 15 percent decrease in benefits) are summarized
in Table 4.1 below.

D.    Technical Assistance Component
4.9    No economic evaluation has been carried out for the proposed technical assistance
component which comprise approximately 5 percent of total project cost. However, the component
is critically important to improving the efficiency and viability of two important transport sector
agencies.
V.    PROJECT RISKS
5.1   It is clear from recent experience that external risks exist in the Region, and that no
allowance can sensibly be made to guard against delays caused by such factors. The present
construction boom in Jordan has increased the contract rates for civil engineering works
considerably judging from recently tendered road construction contracts. It is difficult to assess
whether this rate increase will continue and the effect on road costs. Present estimates are based on
the latest information available to the MPWH regarding contractor rates (Dec. 1992). Enforcement
of the axle load regulation is under the Ministry of the Interior, and the police and MPWH together
carry out regular axle load controls. However, there are uncertainties as to whether the
implementation of the reduction program will be suspended again as it was in January 1992, and for
that reason the government agreed during negotiations that continued implementation of the program
would be a condition of the loan.
5.2   The macroeconomic difficulties affecting Jordan have sometimes resulted in difficulties with
the availability of local counterpart funds. While there have been some delays, there have never
been major or long-lasting problems with the provision of counterpart funds. In the case of the Ras
El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road, the road is of such importance to the economy that we expect it to be
given priority by the Government in the allocation of counterpart funds. An assurance to this effect
was given by the Government at loan negotiations.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1    During loan negotiations, the Government and Beneficiaries agreed that the following actions
be taken prior to the proposed loan becoming effective:
(i)   consultants for the supervision of construction of the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road have
been appointed (para. 3.14);
(ii)   recruitment of the consultant for the studies of policy and institutional issues in the transport
sector has been initiated (paras. 2.10 and 3.7); and
(iii)  the Coordinating Committee for the technical assistance program for the transport sector has
been appointed (para. 3.7).
6.2    During loan negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and the Beneficiaries
on the following actions:
(i)   the borrower shall ensure a gradual reduction in the overloading of trucks according to a
phased reduction program that will make 13 tons the legal axle load limit by February 28,
1995;
(ii)  that evidence based on the results of regular axle-load surveys will be provided to the Bank
regularly in the quarterly progress reports of the project showing the status of the program
for enforcement of the 13-ton axle load limit (para 2.4);
(iii)   GOJ counterpart funding and other financing arrangements remain adequate as agreed (para.
3.13)
(iv)   ICB and LCB procurement procedures will be utilized as agreed and price adjustment clauses
satisfactory to the Bank are included in the civil works contracts for the Ras El Naqab-Wadi
Yutum Road improvement (para. 3.23);
(v)   terms of reference and work program of the technical assistance teams and construction
supervision consultants will be satisfactory to the Bank, and that the Bank shall approve short
list of consulting firms to provide technical assistance (paras. 3.6-3.9, 3.14, 3.20);
(vi)  studies of policy and institutional issues in the transport sector would not start before a
Coordinating Committee is in place and would be completed and presented to the Bank for
review by June 30, 1994. A plan of action based on the studies would be reviewed by the
Bank and Bank comments would be taken into account in the plan. Implementation of the
action plan would thereafter be reviewed annually as part of the Bank supervision of the
project (paras. 2.10, 3.7);
(vii)  the project implementation will be in full compliance with the recommendations of the
archaeological survey recently carried out by the Department of Antiquities, and that
appropriate monitoring procedures, general supervision and funding arrangements in this
respect would be put in place (paras. 3.30-3.31);
(viii)  a joint review by the Bank and government would be carried out annually of the proposed
road maintenance, investment and road rehabilitation programs for the following year to
identify road links in need of periodic maintenance or pavement strengthening and
rehabilitation, and to provide the Government with Bank views on the annual budget
allocations. The allocation of sufficient funding for maintenance is assured by GOJ (paras.



- 30 -
2.6-2. 10);
(ix)   a study of ARC including institutional and financial restructuring and the establishment of a
corporate development plan is to be completed and presented to the Bank for review by
June 30, 1994 (paras. 3.8, 3.9). A plan of action based on the study would be reviewed by
the Bank and Bank comments would be taken into account in the plan. The implementation
of the action plan would be reviewed anmally as part of the Bank's project supervision;
(x)   investments in new railway facilities beyond that needed for maintenance of existing facilities
will only take place after technical and financial viability has been established based on
principles and arrangements acceptable to the Bank including, i.a. contractual arrangements
between ARC and JPMC for covering the capital and operational costs of such investments
(para. 3.9);
iXi)   MPWH shall calculate the ERR for highway sections proposed to be financed under the
Road Rehabilitation Program and only proceed with final design and preparation of bidding
documents when the Bank agrees that such a return is expected to be no less than 15 percent;
and,
(xii)  GOJ will: (i) submit quarterly Project Progress Reports to the Bank (para 3.15); (ii) prepare
Part II of the Project Completion Report according to Bank Guidelines set out in Operational
Directive 13.55, Annex A (para. 3.16); and, (iii) furnish the Bank with financial accounts
and audits of ARC and MPWH Special Account annually no later than 6 months after the
end of the fiscal year (para. 3.15).
6.3   With the understanding indicated above in paras. 6.1 - 6.2, the project would be suitable for
a Bank loan of US$35.0 million to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan at the Bank's standard variable
interest rates for 20 years including a five-year grace period.

STAFlF APPRAISAL REPORT
THE ROAD TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.    Public Agencies Involved in the Roads Sector
(i)    Ministry of Public Works and Housing
. I   The MPWH is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the main (also referred to
as trunk and primary), secondary and rural roads throughout the country. This responsibility is
carried out under the direction of the Secretary General for Public Works. He is also responsible
for administering the construction of government buildings, and is involved in the formulation and
admiinlistration of building codes.
1.2   The Ministry has a separate semi-autonomous arm, the Housing Corporation, which deals
with the provision of housing. A third responsibility within the Ministry is the administration of
Governmrent tenders, which is carried out by a separate Government Tenders Department. This
division of responsibilities is illustrated in Figure 1. The three divisions operate quite
independently.

1.3   The Public Works Division is of the most relevance to road operations. The structure of
the Division is shown in Figure 2. Building construction responsibilities are largely confined to one
department, the Buildings Department (although the Administration, Finance and Follow-Up
Departments and Clerical Office will have some involvement). The other departments are
exclusively devoted to roads.



- 33 -                                    ANNEX 2
1.4    The Public Works Division is headed by a Secretary General. He is principally assisted by
an Under Secretary, to whom he delegates specific executive responsibilities, and a number of
Advisors, who provide him with specialist advice.

1.5    The Division contains 10 departments at headquarters level, each headed by a Director. The
allocation of functional responsibilities between departments for roads operations at headquarters - :s
shown in Figure 2 - is largely self-explanatory as far as the Financial Affairs, Administration,
Laboratories, Workshops, and Maintenance & Traffic Departments are concerned. The Highway
Construction Department is mainly concerned with construction supervision; Highway Studies are
responsible for design of roads; and the Follow-Up Department operates as a technical audit unit,
checking that operations have been carried out correctly.
-      District Organization
1.6    There are eight road districts in Jordan, each headed by a DE (District Engineer). The
structure of the district organization at Zarqa, which is believed to be typical of the other districts, is
shown in Figure 3.
1.7    DEs have an equal status to Directors of Departments at headquarters and report directly to
the Secretary General. Districts have responsibilities concerned with the construction of government
buildings as well as roads. These responsibilities are carried out by a separate Buildings Section.
1.8    DEs' roads duties are mainly connected with routine and periodic maintenance (R&PM) and
asphalt concrete overlays, and recurrent maintenance on rural roads. Force account workers
undertake routine maintenance on all categories of road, and R&PM on rural roads. Contractors are
used to carry out all other work. A workshop is located in each district to service vehicles and
equipment used for force account work. All work carried out by contractors is controlled by

headquarters. Some design work is undertaken for secondary and rural roads by the New
Construction Branch of the Roads Section in the districts.
1.9    Municipalities have responsibility for roads within their boundaries, except where these are
part of the national road system. It appears that some municipalities have difficulties in meeting
their responsibilities e.g. Zarqa, and MPWH voluntarily steps in to undertake maintenance in their
stead when requested, if the road is sufficiently important; the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is
responsible for overall control of planning and budgeting for expenditure for all operations of
MPWH. It also regulates imports, including the collection of import duties and transit fees; the
Ministry of Planning (MOP) is involved only with planning and budgeting for projects that have a
loan element i.e. normally new construction and rehabilitation of major highways; the Ministry of
Interior (MOI) is responsible for the licensing of vehicles, licensing of public transport routes,
issuing permits for public transport vehicles, and setting regulations for road safety; and the Public
Security Directorate is responsible for implementation of many regulations: driving tests and driving
licenses; traffic control; vehicle checks for overloading, safety etc.
(ii)    Ministry of Transport
1.10   The MOT (Ministry of Transport), according to Law 42 of 1971, has overall responsibility
for regulating the whole transport sector, including roads. The Ministry therefore has the
responsibility for setting policies concerning all transport modes and coordinating Government
investment. This planning role has not been actively pursued to date. This is due to some degree to
the fact that other ministries and agencies in the transport sector are autonomous, with MOT having
little or no direct authority over them. MOT therefore largely limits its role to that of regulating
private sector activity through licensing, fare and tariff setting, and to advising Cabinet on issues
such as the control of relevant imports e.g. trucks, or on axle-load legislation. Its responsibilities
concerning roads are carried out by a Road Transport Directorate, which has a complement of four
professional staff.
1.11   Its main contact with the road works execution agency, MPWH is in reviewing feasibility
studies. This is done through a committee containing representatives of MPWH, MOP (Ministry of
Planning) as well as MOT.

2.    The Private Sector
(i)    Consultants
2.1    MPWH uses consultants extensively to undertake feasibility studies, design and construction
supervision. Indeed, such work in connection with construction, rehabilitation and pavement
strengthening on trunk roads is undertaken almost exclusively by consultants, with only isolated
exceptions. MPWH confines itself to checking the work produced by consultants and undertaking
some design and construction supervision work itself for secondary and rural roads. There are some
five firms who are fully staffed, equipped and sufficiendy experienced to undertake all categories of
work mentioned above, although MPWH has expressed concern about the availability of senior staff
amongst consultants to undertake construction supervision. There are also specialist consultants who
are available to undertake simple geotechnical studies and materials testing.
(ii)   Contractors
2.2    MPWH uses contractors to undertake all new construction and rehabilitation on all categories
of roads. In addition periodic maintenance and overlays are carried out by contractors. There are a
large number of contractors registered with MPWH, being categorized by their resources to carry
out various types and scale of work. Many of the smaller contractors also undertake building work.
2.3    Of the most sophisticated contractors capable of undertaking the largest projects, only three
survive. Another one present on the most recent register but has failed recently. It is believed that
all three road contractors are currently financially viable and have sufficient profitable work to
sustain them.
3.    Financing the Roads Sector
3.1    Road users contribute to government revenues through a number of transport related taxes
and fees. These include:
*     fuel taxes on gasoline;
*     annual vehicle license fees;
*     transit fees (through traffic only);
*     vehicle import duties; and
*     overloading fines;
3.2   These charges are collected by a number of agencies (para. 1.9). It is not known how
rigorous or efficient these agencies are in the collection of charges. Full cost recovery is a major
element in all strategies for sustainable road operations. If road maintenance, road rehabilitation and
debt service costs cannot be met from road user charges, these charges will obviously have to be
either subsidized from general revenue, by borrowing, or some operations will ultimately have to be
left underfunded.
3.3    An important consequence of the lack of cost recovery in the roads sub-sector is that
maintenance is underfunded, although this linkage is not straightforward. For instance, distortions
and lack of rigor in the planning and budgetary process do not ensure that there is a transparent
relationship between maintenance needs and budgetary allocation. Nevertheless, it is clear that in
the competition for the severely constrained govermnent funds available, maintenance appears to be
the category of roads expenditure that loses out. A long term annual budgetary requirement for
road maintenance has been estimated by MPWH at JD 10 million, whereas the 1992 budget
allocation (after exceptional items have been excluded) is JD 4 million. However, the actual
estimate of road maintenance budgetary requirements, given the present accuracy of the Maintenance
Management System, must be regarded as indicative only.

THIRD TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Policy Support Technical Assistance for Road Tramport Sector
OUTLINE OF STUDIES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
1.    INTRODUCTION
1.1   This document gives an outline of the policy support technical assistance to the roads sector.
The objectives are to address a number of the policy issues related to cost recovery and the rapid
deterioration of the road system, and to design a TA program for improving the institutional
capacity and capability of the highway agency to deal with these issues. This constitutes one of the
objectives of the proposed Third Transport Project. The document provides, furthermore, outline
Terms of Reference for suggested studies to facilitate policy discussions, cost estimates for the
studies and proposes administrative arrangements for the technical assistance component of the
proposed project.
1.2   The logic underlying the proposed scheme of studies is that there are two distinct study
phases. The first phase has to resolve the key policy and institutional issues in the road transport
sector. Problems have to be identified and analyzed, options for action reviewed, and finally,
decisions made to select an integrated package to provide a solution. Decisions will probably
ultimately be required at a high political level and therefore mechanisms will be suggested to keep
those concerned in touch with study developments.
1.3   The second phase is concerned with devising detailed arrangements for the implementation
of the decisions made at the end of Phase 1. The scope of the work to be undertaken will depend to
a degree on the nature of the decisions taken, but a general guide can still be provided at this stage
as to the likely content.
2.    PHASE 1: POLICY ISSUES
2.1   There are two studies that comprise this phase. The Road Transport Policy Issues Study and
the Institutional Options Study. The studies are inter-dependant and there will have to be close
collaboration between the consultants.
(i)    Road Transport Policy Issues Study
2.2    Objectives: (i) Selection by GOJ of a cost recovery strategy that will finance the road
sector in a better way than is the case today; and, (ii) Selection by GOJ of a road transport
regulatory regime, which addresses issues of tariff setting, overloading and penalties, licensing and
import controls, and optimizes revenues and economic benefits.
2.3    Output: (i) An Inception Report reviewing: a) current systems of road transport regulation
and road sub-sector cost recovery; b) the implications for the road sub-sector of the current policy
environment and of ongoing dialogue between GOJ and the Bank; and, c) problems that need to be
addressed. (ii) A Draft Final Report, which would comprise:
-     estimates of the volume of revenue that has to be raised to cover all new construction,
rehabilitation, maintenance, debt service and administrative costs for roads;



- 39 -                                  ANNEX 4
alternatives for tax, tariff and toll structure, equitably distributed between different users,
differentiated as appropriate between the options considered in the Institutional Options
Study. Recommendations will encompass irnplications of axle load legislation in the
framework of the conclusions of the Road Pavement Study;
specific consideration of the impact of deregulation of the trucking industry on the national
economy;
recommendations on the most appropriate revenue raising and regulatory regime.
And a Final Report, entitled 4Road Transport Policy Report>, incorporating any adjustments
resulting from comments received.
2.4    Activities:
-      Separate road user charges from general tax revenues.
-      Review the current structure of road user charges, tariffs and other regulations (axle load
legislation, licensing etc.). Identify the objectives underlying that structure. Assess whether
objectives are achieved.
-      Investigate the impact on the trucking industry and economy as whole of current regulatory
regime. Particular attention to be paid to the impact of road regulations and road tax.:tion
system on alternative modes.
-      Identify problems associated with the system of charges and regulations
-      Estimate current receipts from road user charges.
-      Estimate external costs incurred by use of road infrastructure.
-      Estimate current road related expenditures and compare with receipts.
-      Identify and assess the efficacy of other cost recovery measures that are available to the
Government.
-      Project, through network modelling techniques, likely future road related expenditures
required over specified timescale.
-      Allocate expenditures required according to classification of road and type of expenditure.
-      Assess options for different cost recovery and regulatory regimes. Make explicit
assumptions underlying charging proposals. Under each option allocate all road user charges
to a)type of road and b) type of vehicle. Appraise each option, including specific
consideration of overall economic impact and public acceptability.

The GOJ will provide office space, equipment and furniture, and transport.
(ii)   Institutional Options Study
2.6    Objectives: To analyze all options and recommend alternatives of strengthening the GOJ's
road function in a sustainable way. Important considerations that need to be taken into account
include:
-     clearly defined accountability for policy formulation and implementation;
-     performance standards and budgeting for the roads organization are instituted and monitored;
-     terms and conditions of service to encourage motivation and achievement;
-     transparent accountability for managers;
-     all costs fully accounted for;
-     comprehensive network-based programming system in operation;
-     planning and budgeting for recurrent and capital spending fully integrated, regardless of
whether funds are loans, grants or regular budget funds;
-     effective human resource development programs devised and implemented.
Existing Institutions
2.7    One major issue to be addressed is whether the government machinery, essentially MPWH,
either in its current, or a suitably modified form, is able to address the issues that have been set out
above. Are the constraints imposed upon MPWH by its status as a government ministry, with its
externally prescribed rules and procedures governing almost all aspects of administration, too great
to allow these issues to be addressed? Is a government ministry the right institutional arrangement
for a productive and highly operational agency without a policy role?
2.8   It might be argued that the implications of the objectives set out above actually prescribe the
remedies that have to be adopted and that these remedies are contrary to the strengths of the public
service system. These strengths are: its tried and tested administrative practices; its commitmnent to
continuity of employment of its workers, thus earning their loyalty; and, the ideals of public service
and professionalism, irrespective of personal reward. Are these positive characteristics, as well as



-41-                                   ANNEX 4
the specific strong points of MPWH mentioned above, with sensible and practical modifications to
existing practices and organizational structures, sufficient to meet the stated objectives? The policy
reform consultants and the Government will have to consider the scope for modest institutional
reform of existing structures as one of the options for institutional change.
2.9    Another option suitable for consideration is the creation of a semi-independent Road
Corporation. The logic behind the creation of such a body is that it would have sufficient
organizational autonomy to introduce modern management methods and commercial accounting
practices. But GOJ, because of its responsibility for public goods (the road network), would need to
exercise ultimate control regarding such matters as it felt appropriate through the articles of
incorporation - it could make key appointments, approve the annual budgets, regulate charges,
appoint the Board etc. The maximization of use of private consultants and contractors, in the
context of the Corporation's freedom to select the most economical means of administration and
implementation, would be a likely outcome of the adoption of this option.
2.10   The final option is the creation of a fully autonomous Road Authority under the Ministry of
Public Works and Housing. The aim behind the establishment of such a body would be to bring the
disciplines of the private sector to the administration of the public road network. The Authority
would be fully self-financing. The GOJ would retain full ownership. Government would determine
overall objectives, and would appoint the Board to implement them. The Road Authority would
adopt all outstanding loans.
2.11   Objective: Selection by the GOJ of an institutional option for undertaking road operations
that meets the sub-sector objectives of optimum efficiency, cost recovery and sustainability.
2.12   Output: An Inception Report constituting a review of current institutional arrangements;
implications of the current policy environment; reconnaissance of issues; and plans for the next stage
of studies, and a Draft Final Report to GOJ which will comprise:
-   options for improvement of the institutional set-up;
-   analysis of all the options.
2.13  Particular attention will be paid to the role of the private sector, the potential for introducing
private sector disciplines into the public sector, coordination of the role of the various entities in
road operations, and the scope for the introduction of modern management practices which
emphasize accountability, transparency, decentralization and flexibility. In the selection of the
preferred institutional option a heavy weighing will be attached to the evaluation criterion concerned
with maximization of the opportunities for cost recovery. A Final Report, modified to incorporate
the views of the Government completes the reporting.
2.14   Activities:
-     Investigation of existing organizational arrangements within Government, including local
government, to ascertain the extent and nature of existing problems. Give particular
consideration to the case for having institutions dedicated to road operations only. Specify
the operational deficiencies that have resulted from organizational imperfections.
-     Review the skills and resources currently and potentially present in the private sector with a
view to estimating the possible extent of their contribution to institutional capacity.
-     Ascertain the extent to which problems are a result of inherent structural weaknesses. In
ascribing causality, care must be taken to distinguish failures in management that could have
occurred in any organization, from systemic problems.
-     Assess the quality of policy formulation and its relationship to implementation in the roads
sector.



-42 -                               ANNEX 4
-     Assess the current scope and adequacy of the MMS in the context of a comprehensive
network planning system. Appraise the capacity of MPWH to operate and respond to the
information that a comprehensive network planning system would generate.
-     Consider the scope for improving performance through modifications of existing institutions.
Gauge the 'room for manoeuvre' allowed by regulations and procedures prescribed by
Government.
-     Identify other institutional options that could cope with the institutional shortfalls identified.
-     Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each option according to quantified criteria.
In this context, the extent of the contribution of the private sector under each option should
be specifically examined.
-     Review the findings of the Road Transport Policy Issues Study regarding the extent of cost
recovery required and the efficacy of the specific measures available to collect revenue.
Specifically compare the opportunities for maximizing cost recovery under each option.
Give full consideration to the advantages and disadvantages of automatic linking, as
compared to earmarking, of revenues and expenditures.

TOTAL                                    190
The GOJ will provide office space, equipment and furniture, and transport.
3.    PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION STUDIES
3.1   It is proposed that if more than one entity is selected to implement Government policy, each
of the following study areas outlined below will be undertaken as a single contract package for each
institution. However, whatever institutional option is adopted for implementation, there are likely to
be elements of the road sub-sector and regulatory framework that are essential to the successful
operation of the concerned entity or entities, which will lie outside their control. Examples of this
are licensing arrangements, overloading charges, fuel taxes. If only a single organization is the
main implementing agency, then it is obvious that all implementation arrangements can be included
as a single consultancy package. If more than one entity is involved, a decision will have to be
made regarding the consultancy package which will deal with the aspects of the regulatory and cost
recovery framework not within the control of either organization.
3.2   The objective would be to implement decisions reached at the end of Phase 1 in a
satisfactory and expeditious manner. The outut would be report detailing plans and programs to
implement decisions reached at the end of Phase 1.

3.3    Activities:
a)    Road Transport Regulatory and Cost Recovery Framework
-   Determine road pricing principles and calculation methods.
-   Train relevant staff in road pricing procedures.
-   Calculate detailed prices for all road user charges not under direct control of road
agencies. Make explicit assumptions about dedicated revenues to be received by these
agencies.
-   Adjust details of regulatory framework regarding axle load limitation implementation,
licensing, import controls, etc. to reflect principles agreed in Phase 1.
-   Draft in outline any adjustments to legal instruments of regulation.
b)    Agency Cost Recovery and Financial Accounting Regime
-   Devise formula to be used for the calculation of charges by road agency. Make explicit
pricing principles.
- Devise financing plan, including details of any debts to be assumed. Make explicit
assumptions about any government subsidy or subvention, etc. and road user charge(s)
levied by the government from which they are derived. Specify any other external
financing required.
-   Devise financial accounting system and standards, and auditing arrangements, to be used
by road agency.
-   Develop initial operating budget for road agency.
(c)    Detailed Organizational Structure and Staffing
-   If direct private sector involvement in ownership or management is required, specify
nature of involvement and procedures for engagement with private entities.
-   Define in detail the objectives, targets, responsibilities and area of authority of road
agency.
-   If a new institution is to be created, prepare draft of the legal format defining the status
and responsibilities of the new institution.
- Define formal relationships (performance contracts if necessary) with external bodies,
especially Government, and incorporate in the relevant legal format, if appropriate.
Specify any relevant penalties that can be applied if not complied with.
-   Draw up detailed organizational plan, indicating manpower requirements and their
reporting relationships.
-   Outline details of conditions of service, stressing wherever possible, incentives,
performance contracts, and flexibility of deployment.
-   Specify the extent of private sector involvement additional to any direct participation in
ownership or management.
-   Specify manpower training needs for both road institution(s) and private sector
collaborators.
- Identify requirement, if any, for external management support or technical assistance.
-   Review accommodation needs and location of offices.
d)    Network Based Planning
- Conceptualize, design and prepare installation plan for comprehensive network based
planning system. The installed system must be capable of generating strategies, plans
and budgets which maximize achievement of the objectives of the agency. Single
project investment appraisal should be de-emphasized.



- 44 -                               ANNEX 4
-   Examine linkages to other relevant operations of the agency, for example, planning and
budgeting or cost accounting, and prepare implementation program.
- Identify data needs for operation of the system and devise collection freqluencies,
methods and systems.
-   Specify hardware and software requirements of the network based system.
-   Specify manpower requirements for operation of the system and any necessary training
requirements. Specifically consider scope for operation and maintenance of the system
by external consultants.
e)    Planning, Budgeting, and Monitoring
-   Identify the external agencies involved in the planning and budgeting process. Devise
procedures and measures which minimize their potentially negative impacts on the
operation of new systems.
-   Devise procedures which stress interlinkages with network based planning, accounting
(particularly cost accounting) and monitoring systems. Integral to system design should
be the concept of performance budgeting, that is, placing emphasis on the relationship
between financial inputs and physical outputs.
-   Prepare monitoring arrangements which should encompass cost accounting and
management information systems and thus reinforce performance budgeting. The
utilization of these systems should be a central feature of agency operations.
-   The format of an Annual Business Plan, which incorporates many of the outputs of the
above elements, should be prescribed.
-   Specify hardware, software, and installation requirements.
f)    Transitional Arrangements
-   Prepare budget catering for setup costs (if any) of either new or restructured agency.
-   Implementation program, indicating timescale for introduction of new arrangements.

equipment and training). The estimates for Phase 2 may change after execution of Phase 1 when
decisions are made on institutional options and policy issues.
4.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT
(i)    Road Transport Policy Seminars
4.1   Inception seminar: Discussions that took place in Jordan prior to preparation of this project
document revealed that decision makers had not been significantly involved in any thoroughgoing
debate on road transport policy issues. The implications of the recent changes in the macro-
economic environment occasioned by structural adjustment policies do not appear to be readily
comprehended, beyond a recognition that there is a serious budgetary squeeze. There does not
appear to be a wide appreciation of the implications of current systems of regulation or an
appreciation of the alternatives that are available. The Bank in its turn needs to understand the
particular factors operating in Jordan, and the broader political context within which decisions are
made.
4.2   It is therefore essential that a policy debate amongst the major actors commences. Phase 1 is
designed to enable this to happen, but the project management environment must provide the
conditions for engagement of the key actors. It is therefore proposed that a Road Transport Policy
Studies Inception Seminar is undertaken in Phase 1. The aim of the seminar will not be to arrive at
any conclusions but to sensitize all the actors to the policy considerations connected with road
transport. The relevant actors from the Government are the Ministers of Public Works and
Highways, Transport, Planning and Finance, together with their top officials. Key representatives of
the private sector, particularly from the trucking industry, users of trucking services, consultants,
and contractors should also participate. Representatives of the Bank and other major donors should
also attend.
4.3    The seminar should be problem orientated. The recommended format is that a series of
papers will be presented which are deliberately designed to highlight problems and prompt
discussion during a session that will follow each paper. It is anticipated that the seminar will last
for two days. Key issues unearthed in the Inception Reports, together with some preliminary
indications of alternative means of tackling them, will be presented to the seminar by the two teams
of consultants.
4.4    Representatives of the Government and the private sector will present their perception of key
issues. Bank staff will provide the Bank perception of its experience in dealing with similar road
transport problems, the lessons it has learned, and the implications for Jordan. Both the Bank and
Ministry will deal with the overall macro-economic problems and policies of the Government and
their sectoral implications, particularly for cost recovery.
4.5   Policy Action Seminar:  The second occasion for the concerted engagement of the actors
mentioned above is on the production of the Draft Final Reports by the consultants. The options
and the preferred recommendations produced by the consultants will be discussed at a seminar. The
objective will not be to achieve a final decision but to ensure that there is a full understanding of the
implications of the options on offer by all parties. It is not absolutely required that agreement is
reached regarding a preferred option, although it would obviously assist in the policy dialogue
process for a consensus to be achieved. The consultants will thus be appraised of the key concerns
of all actors so that Final Reports accommodate these considerations.
(ii)   Timetable for Studies
4.6    The study timetable is illustrated in Figure 1. Phase 1 studies will commence as soon as



-46 -                                 ANNEX 4
possible after loan commencement. An Inception Report will be produced three weeks after the
study has started. The findings of these issues-orientated reports will be used as the basis for
discussions at an Inception Seminar.
4.7    Work on both studies will then continue up to the production of the Draft Final Report at the
end of Week 9. Because of the interdependence of the two studies, it is essential that the teams
share information on the options they are prepare for consideration by the Government. Preferred
options will be recommended.
4.8    After consideration of the Draft Final Reports by the Government, this being assumed to
take two weeks to complete, one of which will involve seminars and meetings at which both study
teams attend. the teams will have a further two weeks to harmonize their recommendations and
incorporate GOJ's commnents.

studies, can commence. There may be one more contract packages of studies depending on the
option chosen. It is not possible at this stage to estimate the timescale because this will depend on
the options selected at the end of Stage 1. An indicative estimate would be at least six to twelve
months for any package.

-     Coordinating Committee
4.10  Although the Road Sector Seminars will provide the major mechanism for the discussion of
issues, there will be a need for consideration of more detailed matters than can be presented to such
fora. A Coordinating Committee is appropriate for such purposes. It would be chaired by a senior
officer from the Ministry of Planning, and composed of other senior officers from the Ministries of
Public Works and Housing, Transport, and Finance, together with representatives from the trucking
industry etc.
4.11   The first task of the Committee would be to review the Inception Report and prepare formal
comments following the Inception Seminar. During the production of the Draft Final Reports, the
Coordinating Committee would review informal working papers and other presentations prepared by
the consultants. After the Policy Action Seminar following the production of the Draft Final
Report, the Coordinating Committee would be responsible for production of written comments on
the draft. The Consultants would then proceed to the production of the Final Report. After the
production of the Final Report, it is anticipated that the Coordinating Committee, particularly its
public service members, will guide the process of gaining approval for the reports' recommendations
by Government, including any necessary references to Cabinet.

HASHEM1TE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
THIRD TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR AQABA RAILWAY CORPORATION
1.    BACKGROUND
1.1   The economic and competitive environment within which the phosphate railway operates, the
type of commodity it handles and the technology it uses should ensure a leading and dominant role for
the ARC as the most efficient and cost-effective mode of transport of bulk phosphate in Jordan. Such a
competitive position would likely be further enhanced when the truckers have to shoulder the real
economic cost of the road haul including the depreciation of the road system asset. While historically
the Railway has fallen short of living up to its full potential, its present annual throughput volume of
around 3.0 million tons remains a reasonable and credible achievement if the Railway's original 1.5
million ton per year design criteria and its imposed, somewhat isolated and low profile institutional
structure, unsupported by either JPMC or the Government are fully factored in. ARC's full value and
contribution to the phosphate industry would emerge immediately if its operations would be su, senly
interrupted (or allowed to deteriorate over time), as there would be no alternative mode which could
possibly accommodate this volume with any degree of cost-effectiveness.
1.2    While the Railway's potential is clearly displayed, immediate measures need to be undertaken
towards improvement of ARC's corporate structure, operational efficiency and financial performance to
attain its full potential. A review of ARC's operations, operations control, maintenance and management
structure reveal some weakness, largely based on lack of adequate managerial and technical skill and
experience.
2.    OBJECTIVE
2.1    Considering the above, a comprehensive technical and management assistance program is needed
for ARC with an objective to:
(i)    address its institutional issues and assist GOJ in developing a more appropriate corporate
structure fully responsive to a commercial mandate and financial viability;
(policy support technical assistance)
(ii)   enhance its operational and maintenance management capabilities;
(institutional development technical assistance)
2.2    While the recommended program will entail both short and long-term positions and could be
designed in various configurations, some of the policy-development, corporate structure related studies
on the one hand, and scope of identification and detailed need assessment related activities on the other,
should logically proceed the fielding of long-term positions in an IDTA program. The technical and
management assistance team consisting mostly of long-term positions in response to the most critical
areas of ARC's need, would follow. Although recent investments in infrastructure improvements are
paying dividends in the form of increased throughput volumes, the state of the Railway's equipment,
particularly that of the motive power fleet, with declining availability and increasing failure rates,
(indicators of both quantitative and qualitative shortcomings in equipment maintenance) present the most
critical area and the single biggest constraint in limiting the Railway's volume throughput.
2.3   In a declining order of priority, extensive input into equipment maintenance and related activities



- 50 -                                 ANNEX 5
(initially limited to 24 months, subject to review of progress and reassessment of need for follow-up) is
to be parallelled in a somewhat more modest involvement in transportation (operations) planning and
analysis (12 months) and in the management and financial control side, by financial systems development
activities supported by management information systems development at the end of the list (12 months).
2.4    To maximize the effectiveness and impact of the TA team's activities, short-term consultancy
requirements have been identified supportive of the Railway in developing or charting its best course in
the market place (development of a long-term, comprehensive corporate plan), or review its maintenance
practices and investment plans in its infrastructure. To ensure comprehensiveness and full capacity to
assist ARC, an additional 12 man-months is allocated for various short-term specialist assignments to
respond to emerging needs as identified.
3.    SUMMARY OF ASSISTANCE PROGRAM RECOMMENDED
3.1    The recommended technical and management program has been summarized below, with
indications of key objectives, durations and declining priorities. Phase I - Studies cover Parts (A) and
(B) below with a total of 18 staff-months at a cost of about US$300,000 including travel and subsistence.
Phase II - Implementation is assumed to take 102 staff-months, however, this is somewhat dependent on
the outcome of the studies in Phase I. The detailed terms of reference for the Phase I studies is included

Policy Support Technical Assistance
for Aqaba Railway Corporation
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT AND RESTRUCTURING
Terms of Reference
Background
1.    The Aqaba Railway Corporation (ARC) is a single purpose single commodity bulk carrier
serving the Jordanian phosphate industry. Its infrastructure extends from the mines of Jordan Phosphate
Mines Company, Ltd. (JPMC) at Al Abiad and El Hassa at the central planes of Jordan to the port of
Aqaba through a 293 km link providing direct rail movement of phosphate by unit trains from the mines
to export position.
2.    While the ARC is functioning reasonably, though perhaps only at a modest level of efficiency,
both operationally and administratively, it is not known for its dynamic, market and commercially
oriented thrust, nor as a profit center of the industry it serves, nor is it a money making organi7 iion
despite its potential, given its assured market. Despite the basic economic and financial health of the
industry it serves, ARC has amassed substantial annual deficits in the last few years, and as a result,
being essentially a parastatal organization, has proven to be a drain on the Jordanian Government's
(GOJ) resources.
3.    The ARC is a legal entity with financial and administrative autonomy under the Minister of
Transport and Communications of the GOJ. Its Board of Directors, chaired by the Minister, is appointed
by the Cabinet. Presently, its members representing various Ministries (Transport, Planning, Finance
and Islamic Wealth) also include one representative of JPMC and the private sector respectively. The
Director General of ARC, also a member of the Board, is appointed by the Minister.
4.    Inasmuch as ARC is serving a highly profitable industrial enterprise, and is doing it in a
competitive transport environment, its present government oriented institutional framework does not
represent the best mechanism for its management structure. The public sector's selection and
appointment criteria, stable but less assertive civil service mentality, government wage scales, etc., is not
the best source for and response to the needs of a production oriented, competitive industrial
organization, requiring dynamic, achievement oriented, commercially motivated operations demandiny
managerial accountability (and reward).
5.    Within the context of the Bank's appraisal of the Third Transport Project, the role, the operating
efficiency and financial viability of ARC has been reviewed and requirements for improvements
diagnosed. One key area for potential improvement was found to be the Railway's managerial,
organization, and above all its institutional structure, with a view to substantial changes in both its
structure and control mechanisms, as well as its underlying corporate outlook and philosophy.
Obiectives
6.     Consistent with the (desirable) long term corporate objectives of the ARC, i.e., a high level of
operating efficiency and fully commercial (financial) viability, the Consultant is to undertake all
necessary activities to facilitate the development of the best corporate structure responsive to these
objectives. In particular, the Consultant is to:
*     Review and develop various feasible alternative ways of institutional and financial
restructuring of ARC and select or suggest a possible optimal format best responding to



- 54-                                  ANNEX 5
corporate objectives.
*     Research, obtain, document and disseminate all necessary and relevant information, and
on that basis, initiate and sustain ongoing discussions at policy level amongst all parties,
ministries and institutions involved.
*     Facilitate a consensus building and negotiation process and ensure that a rational decision
is arrived at and is agreed to by all parties involved in an appropriately documented
fashion.
Scope of Work
7.    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Consultant shall, inter alia, undertake the
following tasks and activities:
Preliminaries
*      Review all available and relevant material on ARC, JPMC and the Jordanian phosphate
industry in general.

-55 -                                   ANNEX 5
particular. Visit all mines, loading and unloading sites including the port.
*      Visit and inspect all relevant facilities of ARC and observe operations of competing or
complimenting trucking firms, involved in phosphate transport.
*      Develop a full understanding of all existing institutional involvement, structure, formal
and informal economic and political interest at play.
*      Review and document all relevant operational and financial dimensions of the phosphate
transport sector, its competing modes and attempt to establish their respective economic
and financial costs in moving this commodity.
*      Explore other relevant issues, such as potential capacities, economies of scale, service
components, market expansion (for other commodities) particularly as they pertain to
ARC and its operating and financial position.
*      Considering optimal commercial results and maximizing financial position at both
industry (JPMC) and corporate (ARC) levels, develop corresponding organizational,
management and controlling institutional structures (likely to be based on principles of
private enterprise, and full managerial accountability) for consideration and adot,ion by
the industry.
*      VDevelop and document specific plans (and possible variants and alternatives) and institute
discussions on that basis by all involved.
*      Identify and list issues (economic, financial, organizational, social or political) which
appear to be inhibiting progress, or are not clearly perceived or fully understood and are
likely to impair the decision-making process.
*      Facilitate rational and informed discussions by organizing seminars and meetings with
senior professional staff of the ministries and organizations involved on subjects pertinent
to issues at hand.
*      Undertake any other professional work to enhance the quality of organizational review,

Policy Support Technical Assistance
for Aqaba Railway Corporation
Contract Plan. Enabling Action Plan and Corporate Development Plan
Terms of Reference
Background
1.    The Aqaba Railway Corporation (ARC) is a single purpose, single commodity bulk carrier
serving the Jordanian phosphate industry. Its infrastructure extends from the mines of Jordan Phosphate
Mines Company, Ltd. (JPMC) at Al Abiad and El Hassa at the central planes of Jordan to the port of
Aqaba through a 293 km link providing direct rail movement of phosphate by unit trains from the mines
to export position.
2.    While the ARC is functioning reasonably, though perhaps only at a modest level of efficiency,
both operationally and administratively, it is not known for its dynamic market and commercial-oriented
thrust, nor as a profit center of the industry it serves. It is not a money making organization despite its
potential and its assured market. In spite of the basic economic and financial health of the industry it
serves, ARC has amassed substantial annual deficits in the last few years, and as a result - being
essentially a parastatal organization - has proven to be a drain on the resources of the Jordanian
Government.
3.     Within the context of the Bank's appraisal of the Third Transport Project, the role, the operating
efficiency and financial viability and requirements for improvements diagnosed. Key areas of concern
were the need for improved operating efficiency through better control and management of operations
and maintenance practices. ARC's improved financial viability would however require greater
commercial orientation, improved financial controls and management and significant increase in ARC's
capacity to plan and develop its future, fully exploiting its inherent strength in the transport sector and
achieve its potential in the market place, both as a transport organization and a financially viable
enterprise.
Obiectives
4.     Consistent with long-term objectives of greater operating efficiency and financial viability, the
Corporate Planning and Development Specialist's (or the consultant) objectives for this assignment will
be to:
*     Review ARC's present position in the market place, and analyze and identify its full
economic potential given its competitive attributes in the sector.
*      Develop various scenarios and possible alternative corporate targets with appropriate
strategies to optimize its commercial position consistent with prevailing constraints.
*      Develop, recommend and ensure adoption of a set of viable corporate targets with
quantified objectives and defined financial impact.
*      Develop with ARC assistance an appropriate, comprehensive long-term corporate plan
including a Contract Plan between ARC, JPMC and the government setting out the
obligations and responsibilities of each.
*      Develop, recommend and ensure adoption of an Enabling Action Plan that gives the
specific steps which must be taken by the government to make good on each of its
obligations and responsibilities.



-58 -                                   ANNEX 5
*      Assist in the preparation of supporting Operational, Financial, Investment, Marketing and
Manpower Development Plans consistent with the dictates of the adopted Corporate Plan.
Scope of Work
5.     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporate Planning and Development
Specialist (the Consultant) shall, inter alia, undertake the following tasks and activities:
*      Review, at the macro level, the short and long-term prospects of the Jordanian economy,
with particular reference to its export generating sector and especially the key
commodities susceptible for bulk movement, i.e., phosphate, potash, cement, etc.
*      Review industry growth prospects through available forecasts.
*      Review the state of the bulk transport sector and the likely direction of its development.
*      Review and analyze the competitive position of the various modes establishing the
strengths and weaknesses of the rail sector.
*      Review various capacity constraints prevailing with the various modes.
*      Establish for the most likely range of market share for the railway for the given plant
sizes and investment alternative.
*      Establish potential market share for the railway, including possible other commodities
(cement, etc.) requiring plant expansion.
*      Assess, on an incremental basis, likely investment requirements to accommodate the
offered traffic and develop optimal investment opportunities, consistent with economic
and financial rate of return criteria.
*      Present findings, discuss alternative scenarios, and develop consensus for course to be
chosen to and by the Railway, Industry and government officials.
*      Consistent with the accepted and adopted role for the railway, formulate concise
corporate objectives and targets with quantified market share and financial bottom line
figures.
*      Develop, draft and prepare a Contract Plan (CP) between the government, ARC and
JPMC being a formal implementing agreement between the three parties setting out their
respective obligations and responsibilities. It states their mutual acceptance of the
entrepreneurial mission and corporate objectives of the railway, clarifies the new
authorities and responsibilities of the railway and stipulates the performance levels
expected. It specifies the commitments to be undertaken by the government, and details
the commitments by JPMc to among others to provide certain quantities of phosphate
annually to the railway for transport to Aqaba, and sets out the time frame for the CP (5
years).
*      Develop, draft and prepare an Enabling Action Plan that develops the program of specific
steps that must be undertaken to enable the government to make good on each of its
promises, and enable the railway to begin operating as a truly commercial enterprise:
necessary legislation must be identified for change or replacement, funding to be secured,
regulations need to be changed or replaced, directives to other relevant authorities must



- 59 -                                 ANNEX 5
be prepared, all in order to permanently remove ARC from the civil service.
*     Consistent with the accepted corporate objectives and targets, develop, draft and prepare
a comprehensive five-year Corporate Plan, which is to serve as a model for similar plans
in the future to be updated on a rolling two-year cyclical basis. Corporate plan is to be
detailed, analytical, fully quantitative in its description of all relevant components,
resources and factors of production.
*     Initiate and assist in the development and preparation of various departmental plans with
Divisional Directors for their respective Departments, to be consistent with and
supportive of the strategic Corporate Plan. These plans are to include operational,
financial, investment, manpower development and training and marketing plans.
*     Throughout the activities of the consulting work, develop and increase managerial
consciousness and skill level for quantitative analysis and planning by working with and
training managers in these endeavors.
Oualifications and Experience
6.     The successful candidate is to be a professional with extensive planning experience in the
transport sector. He is likely to have qualifications as a Transport Economist and Business
Administration, with experience in railway restructuring. He is to have a minimum of 15 years working
experience of which at least 10 years would have been spent with the railway industry.

Policy Support Technical Assistance
for Aqaba Railway Corporation
Short Term Consultancies for Detailed Review and Needs Identification
Terms of Reference
Review of Locomotive and Rolling Stock Maintenance and Workshop Practices
and
Assessment of Accident Damaged Equipment and Rehabilitation Requirements
Background
1.    The Aqaba Railway Corporation (ARC) has acquired a General Electric diesel electric
locomotive fleet manufactured between 1976 and 1981. Of the total 29 units procured (8 U-18-s, 3 U-
18-S, and 18 U-20-s) 25 units remain on ARC's list, although not all of them operational (four having
been either written off or awaiting accident damage assessment and repair while some others await parts
and heavy repair). As a result, daily availabilities are much lower and substantially below acceptable
industry standards and, of greater concern, below requirements of the traffic demand. Supplies of data
based on Traffic Department invoices indicate an availability range which was declining from 66% in
1987 to 56% in 1990, with only a slight improvement in 1991 (58.4%). Of equal concern is the
unusually high on line, in service failure rate experienced with the locomotive fleet which is increasing
and has reached an average monthly figure of 156 failures in the first four months of 1992, seriously
impeding the Railway's capacity to meet its operational throughput and revenue potential.
2.     While ARC's locomotive (and wagon) running shop facilities were located in Ma'an where all
maintenance work was performed, no overhaul was undertaken, as neither the need, (new fleet) nor the
facilities were available to ARC up to the late Eighties. To acquire such overhaul capability, which by
the end of the Eighties became overdue for all units, ARC has constructed a modern workshop in Aqaba
which should be fully equipped and fully operational for overhaul of GE locomotives.
3.     Although ostensibly fully operational for some time and despite its undertaking some overhaul
activity in the last year, to date, the Aqaba Workshop did not appear to arrest the declining trend in
locomotive availabilities and reliabilities.
4.     Despite the lack of experience and the absence of acquired expertise by ARC's Equipment
Department, no formal or informal training, technical assistance, or manufacturer's presence was evident
in the Workshop either at the technical, production planning and control, or at the managerial level.
Symptoms of deficiencies of the maintenance and overhaul process could not and are not dealt with in
any effective way, with serious impact on ARC's hauling capacity.
5.     Remedial action and the development of a framework for transfer of technology and training
programs at various levels of workshop activity are imperative if the Railway is to avoid further declines
in motive power availabilities.
6.     ARC's fleet of covered hopper wagons (4 different types and manufacture) are maintained in
Ma'an, apparently without a cyclical and documented preventive scheduled maintenance basis. The
wagon fleet has also displayed low availability ratios and increasing incidence of in service failures,
which has started to impair traffic flows and is beginning to constrain throughput volumes. One set of
the recently acquired wagon fleet has displayed some major structural problems and have been taken out
of service, subject to reinforcement of its structural elements. Since its French manufacturer has gone



- 61 -                                 ANNEX 5
out of business, ARC is attempting to undertake these modification within its own shops and facilities at
Ma'an.
Objectives
7.     The objectives of the short term study of ARC's mechanical department is to:
*     assess the state of repair of ARC's locomotive and wagon fleet
*      establish the prevailing shortcomings of the Railway's equipment maintenance system in
general and in particular, the working of the:
-      Locomotive Workshop (Aqaba)
-      Locomotive Running Shops (Ma'an)
-     Wagon Repair Shops (Ma'an)
-      supporting stores facilities (Aqaba, Ma'an)
8.    With the above framework and objectives, review the above maintenance facilities in terms of
adequacy of:
-      facilities, layout, workflow, etc.
-      machinery, tools and equipment
-      maintenance procedures and practices
-      production planning and control
-      assess the technical capabilities of maintenance personnel in quantitative and
qualitative terms
-      review the administrative and supervisory framework of the maintenance process,
including its planning and management endeavors
-      review any ongoing vocational and professional training endeavors of the
Mechanical Department and their responsiveness to the short and long term
requirements of the Railway's motive power and rolling stock maintenance
-      develop the dimensions of a TA program designed to improve the quantitative
and qualitative capabilities of ARC's equipment maintenance department, and
provide clear definition of all required components of such assistance, which is to
include its technical, administrative, planning and managerial endeavors.
-      consistent with the TA or any other program foreseen, review the outline TOR's
for appropriateness and expand its details in terms of specific objectives, range of
activities and scope. Develop and define specific input elements with measurable
and monitorable output indicators, targeted over the program's time horizon.
9.    Assess the state of the wrecked and accident damaged locomotives with a view to establishing
feasibility of rehabilitation and return to service of some of the wrecked units, while allowing the
scrapping and disposal of others, beyond economic repair. Within the context of this objective:
-      inspect in detail all units not operational
-      identify those units which could be rehabilitated within the limits of technical and
economic feasibility
-      identify the salvageable components of units beyond economic repair

rehabilitated
-      review ARC facilities (Aqaba Workshop) with a view of undertaking loco
rehabilitation and heavy repair in terms of:
-      shop floor and space requirements



-62 -                                  ANNEX 5
-     tools, equipment and machinery
-     appropriate store support and inventory control
review the Equipment Department's manpower capabilities (quantitatively and
qualitatively) to undertake such work, in terms of:
-     the various technical skill requirements
-     the availability of adequate production planning and control
list all requirements, including measures recommended to correct shortcomings,
to enable ARC to rehabilitate out of service units
develop a production plan, with schedules and completion dates
develop a detailed preliminary parts list and cost components accordingly
including cost of transport

THIRD TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Economic Evaluation
1.    The economic evaluation presented here covers the major components of the project for
which benefits are quantifiable. These comprise the reconstruction of the Ras El-Naqab to Wadi
Yutum Road (JD 38 million), and the rehabilitation of 93 km of priority roads (JD 12 million),
which together account for about 95 percent of total project cost. Components for which no
economic evaluations have been carried out are for technical assistance to Aqaba Railway
Corporation (JD 1.3 million), and to the road transport sector (JD 1.1 million).
A. Ras El Nagab to Wadi Yutum Road
2.    The 71 km Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum road section, which includes the steep and
tortuous Ras El Naqab escarpment, is part of the Desert Highway linking the port of Aqahl. with
most of the rest of the country. As such it is crucial for much of Jordan's domestic transport
but, above all, for its international trade including the very important phosphate exports of which
50% are transported by road. Prior to the recent regional crisis the road also permitted the
development of the lucrative transit traffic between Aqaba and neighboring countries: it is
possible that, following the resolution of the crisis, this traffic will again become important.
3.    Due to a combination of several factors including inappropriate design, inadequate
maintenance, and the very heavy axle loads which resulted from the growth in transit traffic, the
road structure has been severely degraded. As a result the road has reached a level of
deterioration that in places may lead to a condition of virtual impassability which would be
disastrous from a commercial and economic point of view; exports of phosphate would be
reduced and costs of imported goods in most of the country would increase. Furthermore. as
most of the section has now reached a stage where reconstruction is required, the section capacitv
would be severely constrained during the period of rehabilitation. Consequently, it has beeni
recommended by the consultants employed by the MPWH to undertake the feasibility study and
final design, that a new two lane road should be built parallel to the existing road over the
relatively flat 41 km from Wadi Yutum to the base of the escarpment, and a widening of the
existing two lane road to provide additional lanes for slow moving traffic should be built on the
13 km climb up the valley along Wadi Yutum and on the 14 km escarpment section. During
construction, the existing escarpment section of the road could not continue to carry all traffic
and, hence, the old Ras El Naqab Resthouse road will also have to be improved and strengthened
so that it may be used as a detour during work on the main road.
Existing Road Conditions
4.    Analysis of various options for improving the Ras El Naqab-Wadi Yutum Road was
carried out using the Highway Design and Maintenance Model, Version 3.0 (HDM-III), Table
8.1 shows a summary of the input data on existing road conditions. A detailed set of input data
are provided in the project files (Annex 1: "Results of HDM Analysis for Ras El Naqab-Wadi
Yutum Road"). Key aspects of the present situation is a fairly high roughness, particularly in the
escarpment section and a high degree of cracking of the bituminous surfacing.



- 68 -                               ANNEX 8
Projected Traffic Flows
5.    Estimates of traffic to the year 2015 are presented in Table 8.2, which shows the
projected evolution of various types of vehicular traffic in vehicles per day (vpd). Future traffic,
beyond 1995, on the project road, is strongly dependent on two parameters which could
significantly affect the projection. These are: a) diversion of traffic to the alternative Dead Sea
Road which is expected to open to traffic in 1995 and would provide another route from Amman
to the port of Aqaba; and b) enforcement of the axle load restrictions which would increase truck
traffic by reducing average payloads from 37t. to 22t. For the purposes of assessing the expected
rate of return for the project it has been assumed that 75% of light vehicle traffic and 10% of
heavy vehicles would divert to the Dead Sea Road in 1995. The latter value is low owing to the
large majority of truck traffic being for points which are more accessible via the project road.
On the likely success of the axle load reductions, it has been assumed that only 5 % of the truck
traffic will exceed the new axle load limits as a result of strong enforcement measures adopted by
the Government. Both of these parameters have been subjected to a switching value analysis
which is presented below.
Vehicle Operating Costs
6.    Table 8.3 presents the pararneters used in estimating vehicle operating costs (voc) using
the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM-III). VOC estimates are made for
three sections of the road that have significantly different characteristics (gradients, curvatures),
and for the major vehicle types. Since the HDM-III model does not permit the calculation of
congestion costs, which are the main benefits from providing four lanes in the two climbing
sections. The benefits evaluated only consider savings in vehicle operating costs. Key
assumptions made are as follows:
a)    the economic price of fuel is taken to be 165 fils/liter, based on a crude oil price
of US$146.5 per ton;
b)    no value of time costs for passengers or cargo is considered; and
c)    average load factors for trucks, based on observed empty movements, were taken
to be 0.8 northbound and 0.7 southbound.
Details on other assumptions are in the consultants reports in the project files.
Project Economic Costs
7.    Financial costs have been converted to economic costs and this essentially required an
adjustment to the foreign cost component to reflect the differential between official and market
exchange rates, and removal of import duties and taxes. No shadow pricing of labor or other
inputs was considered necessary since the Jordanian economy is largely an open economy with
considerable mobility of these inputs among the countries of the region. The opportunity cost of
capital for Jordan is presently believed to be below 10 % in view of the relatively easy access to
European and Middle-Eastern capital markets, and for the purpose of this analysis a 10 %
discount rate has been assumed.



- 69 -                              ANNEX 8
Economic Evaluation
8.    The economic evaluation of the project involved analysis of three scenarios:
(a) continuing to utilize the existing road by applying an asphalt concrete overlay at 6-year
intervals (designated ALT 1) - the without project case; (b) reconstructing the existing road (ALT
2); and (c) constructing the road on a parallel alignment (ALT 3). Tables 8.4 (a), (b) and (c)
show sample outputs of the road condition and maintenance strategy over the 20-year analysis
period under each of these three scenarios. The implementation time for the reconstruction
option (ALT 2) is taken to be longer than for the new construction option (ALT 3) owing to the
additional complexity of the works involving rerouting of traffic on detours; ALT 2 is assumed to
take 5 years to implement, while ALT 3 is assumed to take 4 years. The without project case,
which is ALT 1, assumes an immediate overlay to reduce the present high roughness, and
subsequently at 6-year intervals with patching and routine maintenance activities being carried out
each year as necessary. Based on these assumptions, ALT 3 was found to have the highest
internal rate of return (IRR) which was 14.2%, as compared with ALT 2 which had an IRR of
8.8%. Tables 8.5 (a), (b) and (c) present the cost streams for each of the three scenarios, and
Table 8.5(d) shows the comparison of the two project alternatives, ALT 2 and ALT 3, with the
without project alternative ALT 1. The new construction alternative, ALT 3, is therefore the
most cost effective solution. It should be noted that the investment costs of ALT 2 are alr ist as
high as ALT 3 due to the high cost of providing and operating detours during the construction
period. The proposed project's IRR is therefore 14.2%, and its net present value at a 10%
discount rate is estimated to be JD 15.1 million.
Sensitivity Analyses
9.    Changes in the project's expected rate of return with changes in key parameters were
investigated through both simple sensitivity analyses and through estimation of switching values
for key parameters which are subject to significant risk. The sensitivity of the rate of return to a
15% increase in cost, a 15% reduction in benefits, and a combination of these, was calculated
and in the latter case the IRR is found to drop to 11. 1%. Switching values were computed for
three key factors: success in the enforcement of axle load restrictions, diversion of truck traffic to
the Dead Sea road in 1995, and diversion of light vehicle traffic to the same route. The
following table presents the results of the switching value analysis.
Parameter                             Expected Value    Switching Value
Percent success of Axle
Load Restrictions                         95%                 5%
Truck Traffic Diversion
to Dead Sea Road                          10%                46%
Light Vehicle Diversion
to Dead Sea Road                          75%               100%
The switching value of a parameter in the above table, is the value of that parameter which
causes the IRR for the project to drop to 10%. In the case of axle load restrictions, 100%
success is defined as a level of enforcement which causes average truck payloads to decline to
below 22 tons from the present average of 37 tons, which is the 0% success level. On each of



- 70 -                              ANNEX 8
these three parameters, the switching value analysis indicates that there is considerable latitude
for change in each taken individually; no analysis was carried out of the joint effect of risk in
these parameters as that would require a more exhaustive risk analysis of the project.
B. Road Rehabilitation Program
10.   MPWH's road maintenance budget has been inadequate and as a result, insufficient
resources have been allocated to routine maintenance, light periodic maintenance such as reseal-
ing, and periodic pavement strengthening to maintain the road system's load carrying capacity.
In addition, the relaxed axle load policy has accelerated pavement deterioration. Consequently, a
backlog of deferred road works, including pavement strengthening and rehabilitation works, has
developed over the last 10 years. This must now be addressed in the form of a pavement
rehabilitation program to prevent a sharp increase in vehicle operating costs and to avoid an
expensive reconstruction program. The MPWH has through its Road Maintenance Management
System (RMMS) identified approximately 175 km of roads in this category which need immediate
treatment at an estimated average cost of US$125,000 per km. It is proposed to finance 93 km
of this program in the project. The program (Annex 6) is estimated to yield a high Economic
Rate of Return since the "do-nothing" alternative would involve an even higher reconstruction
cost later to gain basically the same benefits, while road users would continue to incur hig'
operating costs due to high road roughness until the road is reconstructed. This component is
estimated to be approximately 24% of the total project cost.
Economic Evaluation
11.   Tables 8.6 and 8.7 present the economic evaluation of the three road sections proposed to
be rehabilitated under the project. Traffic on these roads are projected to grow at an annual rate
of 2%. Based on vehicle operating costs estimated for these road sections, total VOC per annum
is computed for the with and without project cases. The without project case does not include the
cost of major reconstruction, and hence the evaluation is conservative in that the only benefits
considered are savings in vehicle operating costs. Rates of return computed for the three road
segments range between 33% and 57%; sensitivity analyses (15% increase in cost and 15%
decrease in benefits) indicate that the rate of return is likely to be above 27%.

THRD TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
BANK SUPERVISION PLAN
The following table give staff input in weeks in relation to supervision missions only. In addition
there are needs at headquarters for review of general progress reports, audit reports, consultants'
inception/draft fmal/final reports, preparation and participation in policy seminars, procurement
actions, correspondence, contact with cofinanciers and aid donors, etc. which is estimated to take
3 staff-weeks each for the two first years and two weeks for the remaining years in all 12 staff-
weeks. The total input is higher than usual in the past, but is dictated by the complex TA
component and the relatively compressed implementation schedule for the works components
which are partly traversing difficult terrain with relocation of traffic during construction and
archaeological sites in need of excavation and general attention in addition to pavement durability
problems.   All these factors contribute to a requirement for considerable input from specialists.
