3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The overall objective of the project was to: strengthen management and operation of AQUA,
upgrade water supply and wastewater collection services, improve the living standard and protect
the health of the people of Bielsko-Biala, and expand wastewater treatment to contribute to the
clean up of the region's water resources.

The specific objectives of the project were to:

       a)       Improve the safety, reliability and quality of water supply services of Bielsko-Biala
                by upgrading the functioning of water treatment plants and the water transmission
                and distribution networks;
       b)       Improve the efficiency of water production, transmission and distribution systems
                and lower operating costs through operational improvements, reduction of
                unaccounted for water, and demand management;
       c)       Improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of the wastewater collection system
                including pumping stations through works rehabilitation/replacement and
                inflow/infiltration reduction;
       d)       Reduce pollution of: local surface water by reductions in combined wastewater
                overflows, and the Biala river by providing full biological treatment to all
                wastewater generated in the AQUA service area; and
       e)       Enhance the Borrower's institutional capabilities.

The key performance indicators for the project were:

       l Reduction of unaccounted for water
       l Increase of wastewater treatment capacity
       l Reduction of the employees per thousand population served ratio
       l Adjustment of residential and industrial water and wastewater tariffs as necessary to
            cover operating costs
       l Working ratio to be not higher than 0.65 in any financial year.

The project objectives were consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) with
its emphasis on: decentralization, public sector strengthening, fiscal responsibility, environmental
protection and private sector participation. As was not uncommon when preparing Bank-financed
projects more than a decade ago (when correspondence between project objectives and outcomes
was less rigorously maintained), the project objective statement was both too general and too
specific. It was too general in that the overall objective included improving the living standard
and protecting the health of the people of Bielsko-Biala, while the project generated no data to
support these broad claims. It also was too specific in that at least five project objectives were
detailed, each with several sub-objectives--a level of precision now understood to be more
appropriate for project performance indicators.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of the following four major components and their sub-components:

Water Supply

       l Expand/improve service to Zlote Lany area
       l Upgrade existing Wapienica, Szczyrk and Sola (also referred to as Kobiernice) water
             treatment plants
       l Undertake a program including leak detection for rehabilitating and improving
             efficiency of transmission-storage-distribution systems.

Wastewater

       l Expand Wapienica and Industrial wastewater collectors
       l Expand Komorowice treatment plant capacity by 60,000 m3/day and complete
             Wapienica (capacity 8,000 m3/day) treatment plant including primary as well as
             secondary treatment
       l Undertake a program for improving the efficiency of the wastewater collection system
             including:    rehabilitation and replacement, inflow/infiltration reduction, pumping
             station refurbishment and reduction of combined wastewater overflows.

Technical Assistance and Training

         Institutional strengthening through introduction/improvement of:           organizational
         structures, cost accounting systems, management information and control systems, tariff
         setting and management, demand management, commercial operations, personnel
         management, business planning and asset management.

Engineering Design and Construction Supervision

   l Identification, design and implementation of cost effective programs for water and
         wastewater system rehabilitation and operations improvement
   l Preparation of studies, final designs, tender documents and supervision of construction for
         all investment components.

3.4 Revised Components:
The project components were not revised but to various degrees extended.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
There was no QAG (Quality Assurance Group) review conducted for this project at entry.
QAG/QAE began in 1997, and the project was approved in June 1996. OED's 1997 ECON III
review rated the project as unsatisfactory in four specific dimensions: cost benefit analysis,
institutional risk analysis, poverty analysis and economic performance based on OED's "Criteria
Definitions". The ICR rates the project's quality at entry as satisfactory based on: (a) the
consistency of its objectives with Government priorities and the Bank CAS; (b) the prioritization



                                                 - 3 -

of work components including institutional strengthening; and (c) the adequacy in addressing
Bank safeguard policies.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:


Objective (a):      Improve the safety, reliability and quality of water supply services of
Bielsko-Biala by upgrading the functioning of water treatment plants and water transmission and
distribution networks.

The outcome has been:

       l The performance of the water treatment works has been improved through changes
           made to the filter tanks and regarding disinfection through installation of standby
           equipment. The monitoring of water quality has been improved through extended
           laboratory capacity (EU certification is expected) and introduction of a SCADA
           system as well as of a system indicating raw water parameters. The quality of water
           supplied has from 1995-2005 improved regarding: turbidity has decreased from 5 to 1
           NTU; color from 20 to 15 true color units; iron from 0.5 to 0.2 mg/l; and manganese
           from 0.1 to 0.05 mg/l. To put these accomplishments in a global context, AQUA's
           drinking water quality meets all WHO guidelines and US EPA standards, except the
           recently tightened (January 2002) US standard for turbidity; a standard which is also
           difficult for many US utilities to meet.
       l The reliability of water supply has been improved regarding frequency of service
           interruptions and better preparedness made possible through organizational changes,
           training of staff and provision of additional equipment for repairing breakages. In 1995
           the incidence of interruptions was 2970 in 1298 km pipeline (or 2.29 interruptions per
           km) compared to 2004 when 2287 interruptions occurred in 1784 km pipeline (or 1.28
           interruptions per km). Rules have been established prescribing that any service
           interruption should be no longer than 3 hours, and in case this cannot be complied with
           water should be delivered by truck. Based on experience, the latter rarely takes place.
           International benchmarks for this reliability parameter are not readily available, or
           directly comparable to AQUA, but the improvement in reliability has been significant.

Objective (b):     Improve the efficiency of water production, transmission and distribution
systems, and lower operating costs through operational improvements, reduction of unaccounted
for water and demand management.

The outcome has been:

   l Operational improvements through increased automation and introduction of better
       control systems have resulted in a reduction in the number of employees from 2.8 to 1.4
       per 1000 people served, compared to 2.5 as projected.
   l The projected reduction in unaccounted for water has not been achieved despite
       significant investments in distribution system rehabilitation which, particularly, has focused



                                                - 4 -

       on replacement of old unprotected steel pipes. AQUA has guided this pipe replacement
       with an advanced system for monitoring and management of leakage in its water
       distribution area. Despite these efforts, unaccounted for water remains high at 47%
       compared to projected 25%, although actual physical water losses (in m3 per day) have
       been reduced by about 25%. For comparison, IBNET reports England and Wales' non
       revenue water in 2000 was 17%. The major reasons for AQUA's high unaccounted for
       water are the very low quality of distribution mains (unprotected steel and cast iron pipes)
       laid in the past and improved pressure conditions in the distribution networks. The need
       for distribution system rehabilitation is more extensive than originally envisaged, and any
       significant reduction in unaccounted for water will be reached only as a medium-term
       objective. Targets have been set on future annual replacements of about 60 km of pipes,
       which are more than double what was achieved under the project. AQUA's new (2003)
       top management is committed to increasing investment in utility infrastructure.         For
       example, investment in 2004 was three times (PLN 46 million) that made the previous
       year.
   l Achievements under demand management are reflected in the per capita water demand
       that has decreased by about 60 percent or from about 180 to about 105 liters per day.

Objective (c): Improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of the wastewater collection system
including pumping stations through works rehabilitation/replacement and inflow/infiltration
reduction.

       l Wastewater collection coverage, in percentage of population served, has increased to
           89%, as targeted, for the service area covered by AQUA at the time of project
           appraisal, AQUA's wastewater collection coverage is 82% for its current service area.
           To offset declining water sales, AQUA's service area has expanded as the company has
           secured new customers in outlying low density areas, where on-site sanitation facilities
           currently predominate.     To comply with current regulations, extensions of the
           collection networks are projected to take place, gradually, for reaching a rate of
           coverage of about 92% by 2010.
       l Inflow/infiltration, as percentage of total flow, has been reduced from about 74% in
           1998 to about 47% in 2003 as concluded through measurement of incoming flows to
           the wastewater treatment works. US EPA surveys indicate infiltration and inflow are
           widespread problems. Louisiana for example, reports domestic wastewater flow plus
           groundwater infiltration of 120 gallons per capita per day (gpcd), of which 80 gpcd is
           infiltration.

Objective (d): Reduce pollution of: local surface water by reductions in combined wastewater
overflows; and the Biala river by providing full biological treatment to all wastewater generated
in the AQUA service area;

The outcome has been:

       l The original wastewater collection networks were built as a combined system but with
           extensions and rehabilitations, the networks increasingly have developed into separate



                                                - 5 -

            systems. The annual occurrence of combined wastewater overflows has been reduced
            from over 20 to less than 10 (according to current regulations, up to 10 overflows per
            year are acceptable as stipulated in a permit issued by the Municipality). This has been
            made possible through reductions in inflow/infiltration but also through improved
            operation and design/structural changes of overflow chambers.
      l Full biological treatment has been extended from 38% to 100% of wastewater
            collected in the service area. The performance of the treatment works complies with
            relevant specifications and requirements for treated wastewater as prescribed under
            EU regulations and stipulated in a water permit. The quality of the Biala river water
            has improved as evidenced by, on the average, a decrease in BOD5 from about 50
            mg/l in 1994 to about 4.2 mg/l in 2004 (after completion of wastewater treatment
            works extensions) as measured by an independent Government Agency.

Objective (e): Enhance the Borrower's institutional capabilities and its customer services;

The outcome has been:

The Borrower now operates water supply and wastewater systems of higher complexity with
fewer staff, and it has successfully introduced new accounting and management systems and
procedures.     Its customer service has been computerized regarding applications, service
agreements and complaints.

4.2 Outputs by components:

Water Supply           (US$9.53 million/US$12.31 million (appraisal/actual) or 27%/28%
                (appraisal/actual) of total costs)

       ·        Expand/improve service to Zlote Lany area.
       ·        Upgrade existing Wapienica, Szczyrk and Sola water treatment plants.
       ·        Undertake    a    program    of    rehabilitating and   improving     efficiency  of
                transmission-storage-distribution system including programs of leak detection and
                repair and water main rehabilitation/replacement.

The outputs have been:

       ·        A 5.8 km 300-400 mm ductile iron transmission main has been laid connecting the
                pumping station, Zlote Lany, to an existing trunk main.
       ·        Comprehensive rehabilitation and modernization of treatment processes have been
                carried out for Wapienica and Szczyrk treatment. works. Sola filter tanks have
                been rebuilt and for the treated water pumping station, four pumps have been
                replaced, resulting in increased efficiency and lower energy costs.
       ·        The Wapienica masonry dam has been sealed, which reduced water leakage and
                increased safety of operation.
       ·        About 140 km of steel water pipes, or about 10% of the total network operated by
                AQUA, have been replaced.          However, during the project AQUA's network
                increased from 1396 km to 1541 km, through taking over housing association and


                                                  - 6 -

              neighboring community distribution systems. These additional 145 km of water
              mains, in general, were in poor conditions.        To increase emphasis on leak
              detection, a Network Measurement and Inspection Department was established
              March 1, 2004. AQUA's medium-term objective is to replace an additional 600
              km of steel pipes and 50 km of cast iron pipes to further reduce water losses.
      ·       The water storage capacities as well as locations are adequate for AQUA's
              requirements.

Wastewater (US$19.80 million/US$25.96 million or 56%/59% of total costs)

      ·       Expand Wapienica and Industrial wastewater collectors.
      ·       Expand Komorowice treatment plant capacity by 60,000 m3/day and complete
              Wapienica (capacity 8,000 m3/day) treatment plant including primary as well as
              secondary treatment.
      ·       Undertake a program of improving the efficiency of wastewater collection system
              including: rehabilitation and replacements, inflow/infiltration reductions, pumping
              station refurbishments and reduction of combined wastewater overflows.

The outputs have been:

      ·       About 32 km of sewer mains have been laid in the Wapienica district with
              additional connection of 500 buildings and collection of 90 m3/day of wastewater
              from the neighboring Jaworze community.
      ·       The Komorowice wastewater treatment works (WWTW) was extended to 90,000
              m3/day through rehabilitation of pre-treatment facilities and construction of
              activated sludge aerated tanks (biological treatment) and secondary settling tanks.
              By adding dosing of ferric sulphate at the inlet to the secondary settling tanks
              tertiary treatment is partially achieved through a reduction in the phosphorous
              content. Existing active sludge aeration tanks with a capacity of 30,000 m3/day
              have also been rehabilitated, although this was not, initially, included under the
              project.   The Komorowice WWTW extension and construction of additional
              collection systems and pumping stations have made it possible to connect
              additional neighboring communities.
      ·       Completion of the Wapienica WWTW, with 8,000 m3/day biological treatment
              capacity, has enabled connection of wastewater collection systems from the
              Wapienica district, the western areas of Bielsko-Biala and Jaworze community.
              Wastewater previously discharged into the Wapienica watercourse now is
              collected and treated.
      ·       The Rybarzowice WWTW has been taken out of service and its wastewater is now
              conveyed through pumping and new pressure/gravity mains to the Komorowice
              WWTW.       The new pumping station has been constructed at the site for the
              Rybarzowice WWTW with previous aeration tanks rehabilitated and serving as
              retention tanks for wet weather flows. The works have also included replacement
              of a 2 km leaking collector for industrial wastewater and the connection of
              neighboring communities. Additional wastewater conveyed to the Komorowice



                                              - 7 -

              WWTW averages about 3,400 m3/day, which can be accommodated within its
              design capacity since reductions have taken place in inflow/infiltration and in per
              capita wastewater generation.
      ·       Komorowice and Wapienica WWTWs comply with treated wastewater
              requirements on reductions in BOD5, COD and SS (less than 15 mg/l, 125 mg/l
              and 35 mg/l respectively) and also regarding nitrogen and phosphorous (less than
              15 mg/l and 1.5 mg/l respectively). Penalties, previously paid in the amounts of
              3.5 million PLN for Komorowice WWTW during 1996-2000 and 0.8 million PLN
              for Wapienica WWTW during 2002-2005, imposed for noncompliance with
              requirements on the quality of treated wastewater, no longer apply.

Technical Assistance and Training (US$1.03 million/US$1.53 million or 3%/3.5% of total
              costs)

      ·       Institutional strengthening through introduction/improvements of: organizational
              structure, a cost accounting system, management information and control systems,
              tariff setting and management, demand management, commercial operations,
              personnel management, business planning and asset management.

The outputs have been:

      ·       Based on recommendations from a study prepared by Welsh Water International,
              AQUA has revised its organizational structure and established units for customer
              service, public relations and marketing, controlling and auditing.       Engineering
              design, building services, housekeeping and security have been outsourced.
      ·       SAP R/3, an integrated IT system, was implemented in 2000. The system includes
              modules for finance, fixed assets, material management, and project management.
              The system enables full cost control through monitoring of revenues and
              expenditures.
      ·       Introduction of management information and control systems enable AQUA to
              monitor its financial position including incurred and budgeted costs.
      ·       Annual Business Planning was introduced in 2000 and has become AQUA's overall
              planning tool for identification and scheduling of activities to be implemented.

Engineering Design and Construction Supervision            (US$5.02 million/US$3.80 million or
              14%/8.5% of total costs)

      ·       Identification, design and implementation of cost effective programs for water and
              wastewater system rehabilitation and operations improvements; and
      ·       Preparation of studies, final designs, tender documents, tendering and supervision
              of construction for all investment components.

The outputs have been:

      ·       Programs were prepared by international consultants and applied for water and



                                                - 8 -

                 wastewater system rehabilitation, protection against corrosion and energy
                 conservation. This includes the installation of Mouse and Netbase programs.
         ·       Consultants have carried out studies, detailed engineering design and construction
                 supervision. This has included a "Water Main and Sewer System Rehabilitation
                 Study" completed in April 1997 that guided subsequent network investments.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

An economic rate of return calculation had been determined not to be possible at appraisal
because (i) project investments involved rehabilitation and operational improvement of existing
systems, and (ii) detailed information quantifying the environmental impact of existing pollution
from wastewater, and consequent benefits from improved wastewater treatment, was not
available.

Considerable improvement in safe water provision and wastewater treatment has been made by
upgrading existing Wapienica, Szczyrk and Sola water treatment plants; expanding Wapienica and
industrial wastewater collectors; and expanding Komorowice and completing Wapienica
wastewater treatment plants. These investments resulted in improved drinking water quality,
additional wastewater network connections, and full biological treatment of wastewater at
Komorowice (90,000 m3/day) and Wapienica (8,000 m3/day).               Because project health and
environmental amenity benefits are difficult to measure, as at appraisal, the ICR assessment
evaluates only financial benefits of the project.


4.4 Financial rate of return:

The Financial Rate of Return (FRR) at appraisal was estimated at 23 percent, but the
end-of-project analysis shows a much higher FRR­ 36 percent. More capital than projected was
invested in the project--AQUA's contribution was twice that planned at appraisal--and the return
from these additional investments more than offset the increased expenditure.           Additional
investments were possible because AQUA generated more revenue than anticipated at appraisal.
The company increased tariffs significantly throughout project implementation, and households
now pay tariffs 51 percent higher for water and 68 percent higher for wastewater than appraisal
projections. The greater than projected increase in tariffs was both the cause and result of a
greater than forecast decline in water consumption.

Water consumption gradually decreased throughout the implementation period to about 105 lcd
currently. Consumption at appraisal (180 lcd) already was substantially below levels observed in
the former Soviet Union, and the scope for further reduction in Bielsko-Biala therefore was
underestimated at appraisal. Economic conditions in Poland also improved more than projected
at appraisal, such that the average working household in 2003 had an income 27 percent higher
than forecast. Despite unanticipated changes in major affordability parameters, current water
services affordability approximates that projected at appraisal--the average water and wastewater
bill is 1.2 percent of working household income versus 1.4 percent forecast at appraisal.

AQUA has expanded its service area to offset declining sales and has controlled its expenses. The



                                                 - 9 -

current service population is 255,000 compared to 205,000 projected at appraisal. Because of
this increase and reductions in staff, AQUA's labor efficiency now is 1.4 employees per thousand
population served, instead of 2.5 planned at appraisal. Project investments also have reduced
AQUA's energy expense; for example, Kobiernice water treatment plant pump rehabilitation
resulted in a 15 percent energy reduction.

4.5 Institutional development impact:


The institutional development impact is summarized as:

        ·         The relationship between AQUA and the Municipal Government has been well
                  established through an annually negotiated Performance Agreement.
        ·         AQUA, with its major shareholder the Municipality of Bielsko-Biala, also has a
                  foreign investor as shareholder, United Utilities International, Ltd. United Utilities
                  (previously with International Water) has been AQUA's strategic partner since
                  November 1999. Since January 1998, AQUA has been a public company quoted
                  on Poland's secondary trading market.
        ·         AQUA     has    been   significantly  strengthened    through    implementation     of
                  recommendations made in studies prepared by Welsh Water (discussed in
                  paragraph 4.2). AQUA's Business Planning cycle, which has gone through annual
                  improvements, now has been firmly established. Customer Service has continued
                  to improve and staff motivation has been enhanced through training and a bonus
                  scheme.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

None identified.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Delays have occurred in the execution of pipeline laying contracts, because pipes cannot be laid in
public areas, only on private property. This matter first arose during project supervision, and the
Bank has recommended establishing procedures for laying pipes on public land. Although laying
of pipes under public streets and sidewalks can cause traffic congestion and disruption of other
public services, it would be preferable to negotiating agreements with a number of individual
property owners. This issue is recommended for reconsideration by relevant authorities.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

The level of unaccounted for water has remained high and the related project objective has not
been realized. While significant progress has been made in network rehabilitation, additional
funding available under the Bank loan and through internally generated cash could have been
used, to a larger extent, for further network rehabilitation to reduce physical water losses.
However, this issue has been receiving increased emphasis and further progress is expected in
reducing physical water losses to acceptable levels.

5.4 Costs and financing:


Costs: The total project costs, shown in Annex 2, amount to US$43.60 million or 23 percent
higher than the appraisal estimate of US$35.38 million. This is because AQUA has been able to
self-finance more investments than were anticipated at project appraisal. All major components,
except engineering services and construction supervision, have received additional funding, which
has included:

       l Under "Water Supply": for the Szczyrk treatment plant more works than, initially,
            envisaged were covered; and for Wapienice treatment plant additional works included
            a retention tank for backwash water and laying of a 1.6 km pipeline for its discharge
            into the wastewater network.
       l Under "Wastewater": construction of pumping station and trunkmains for conveying
            wastewater from the site for Rybarzowice WWTP to the Komorowice WWTP; and
            modernization of the old part of the Komorowice WWTP.
       l Under both "Water Supply" and "Wastewater" the investment costs, financed locally,
            have been increased by about 14.3 million PLN (about US$4.5 million) covering
            engineering and supervision, interest during construction, and losses relevant to
            fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Costs under "Engineering Services" have been less
            than, initially, estimated is partly due to their inclusion under investment costs.




                                                     - 11 -

Financing: As shown in Annex 3, Financing Plan:

       l Disbursements under the Bank loan have amounted to US$16.75 million or 79 percent
            of the appraisal estimate of US$21.09 million. Because of AQUA's strong financial
            position, it has elected not to utilize all Bank funds available.
       l Contributions from AQUA, US$20.43 million, have exceeded the appraisal estimate,
            US$7.29 million, by 180 percent, again because of AQUA's stronger than anticipated
            cash flow.
       l Contributions from NFEP were about the same as projected.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The technical sustainability of investments under the project has been ensured by: appropriate
prioritization of investment components; well prepared detailed engineering design; satisfactory
standard and quality of equipment supplied and works executed; and final acceptance of works
completed and equipment installed in full compliance with technical specifications.

Financial sustainability has been assessed according to April 2004 guidelines for World Bank
Group Staff. According to the Bank's Water and Sanitation Sector Board definition of financial
sustainability, operators must receive sufficient revenues from user fees and government transfers
to cover operation and maintenance costs and to finance rehabilitation of new investments.
AQUA's revenue generation during the project has funded significant capital works investments,
which confirms the soundness and viability of its financial situation. Additional evidence of the
project's financial sustainability is that its working ratio always remained below the targeted
maximum of 0.65, reaching 0.51 at end-2004. Because of AQUA's strong cash generation, in
June 2005 the company initiated prepayment of the USD tranche (USD11.5 million) of its World
Bank loan.

AQUA's institutional sustainability has been established through organizational improvements and
pertinent systems implementation.

Environmental sustainability has been assured through improved water supply treatment, by
providing biological (secondary) wastewater treatment in compliance with EU requirements, and
by reducing the frequency of combined wastewater overflows.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

Not applicable.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:


The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation and appraisal of the project is rated as
satisfactory. Each of these activities was carried out in accordance with the Government and


                                                   - 12 -

Bank priorities for the sector. Although ECON III found specific gaps, the identification focused
on major issues in operation and maintenance, shortcomings in water treatment and inadequate
wastewater treatment. The need for improving the institutional capacity already in place was
adequately emphasized.        Bank safeguard policies and relevant technical and financial
considerations also were adequately addressed during project preparation and appraisal.
Although the appraisal underestimated the project's reduction in water demand, the project design
was sufficiently robust to ensure a highly successful outcome. The Bank team consisted of two
core team members and two specialists, covering various aspects of project preparation. The
costs for preparing the project amounted to US$802,000.

7.2 Supervision:

Bank supervision of the project is rated as satisfactory, as demonstrated by supervision records
and Borrower statements. Supervision reports were well written, issues were constructively
addressed, and realistic assessments of project performance and progress were given. The cost
for supervision, including nine supervision missions, amounted to US$334,000.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:


Overall Bank performance for the project is rated as satisfactory. The project has met its
development targets, has achieved highly satisfactory ratings for both its development objective
and implementation progress, and has prepared AQUA for realizing further improvements in
water loss reduction and environmental protection. The Bank assisted AQUA in initial project
design, lent funds at a time when it had no other access to long-term borrowing, and provided
support when needed during project implementation.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

In the early 1990s, similar projects were prepared for four other Polish cities, but only
Bielsko-Biala chose to implement a Bank-financed project. Borrower performance during project
preparation is rated as highly satisfactory.     The Borrower fully understood the benefits of
enhanced autonomy for a water supply and wastewater service provider, and used this autonomy,
together with expert international advice, to design an innovative and well-structured project.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

The Government implementation performance is rated as satisfactory. National Government
contributed to the project by providing a sovereign guarantee for the Bank loan to AQUA.
Municipal government provided support with planned tariff adjustments permitting full operation
and maintenance cost recovery and funds for capital works investments. Municipal government's
participation was guided by a Bank-advised innovative five-year "performance agreement"
between AQUA and the municipality.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

Performance of the implementing agency (AQUA) and its PIU (a department within the company)



                                               - 13 -

is rated as highly satisfactory.     A major investment program that included state-of-the-art
technology was designed and implemented under AQUA's supervision. All procurement was
managed professionally and with high integrity. The company's top management had a clear
vision of where it wanted AQUA to be, and steadfastly put its plan into action. The result is that
AQUA has progressed very commendably from where it was when the project was appraised a
decade ago.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:


Overall performance of the Borrower has been highly satisfactory, which has resulted in a
successful project that provides a solid basis for further improvement in AQUA's service delivery.


8. Lessons Learned

Lesson One: Public-private partnerships can be a good model for building successful water
utilities. AQUA created a sound financial basis and took advantage of the knowledge and
experience of international firms to strengthen the utility and prioritize and design its investment
program. Although private sector involvement had not been envisaged when the project was
appraised, in 1999 United Utilities (then with International Water) became a strategic investor in
AQUA. The majority of shares remained owned by the City of Bielsko-Biala. AQUA's already
good performance was further strengthened by its association with United Utilities. This is
evidenced in its annually reviewed business plan, its level of customer service and empowerment,
training and development of its employees. Technological aspects of its water and wastewater
treatment and network operations continue to improve toward best practice in line with EU
regulations. The "AQUA experience" can be replicated and is recommended for application
elsewhere.

Lesson Two: A "Soviet bloc" legacy of unprotected steel water pipes requires expensive,
long-term replacement. The past practice of using unprotected steel pipes (even small sizes
were not galvanized) has resulted in badly corroded water distribution networks with high levels
of physical water losses. Correcting this problem will be costly and require replacement of major
portions of the water networks. Because AQUA's high unaccounted for water is mainly due to
physical losses, in hindsight UFW reductions projected at appraisal were unrealistic.

monitoring invoices submitted for payment - for their compliance with credit objectives.
The tasks were attained and the material and ecological targets were achieved, which was
evidenced with the following documents:
-       reports of acceptance and commissioning prepared within timescales specified in the loan
agreements;
-       water permits for treated waste water discharge;
-       Decisions of the President of Bielsko-Bia·a City accepting the investments for use
according to building regulations;
-       analysis results of treated waste water made by the accredited laboratory.
Credit servicing is always on time, both concerning credit instalments and the interest.
Our cooperation with your company in terms of investment crediting and also debt service is very
good in the opinion of our Bank.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

An appraisal economic rate of return calculation had been determined not to be possible because
(i) project investments involved rehabilitation and operational improvement of existing systems,
and (ii) detailed information quantifying the environmental impact of existing pollution from
wastewater, and consequent benefits from improved wastewater treatment, was not available.

Considerable improvement in safe water provision and wastewater treatment has been made by
upgrading existing Wapienica, Szczyrk and Sola water treatment plants; expanding Wapienica and
industrial wastewater collectors; and expanding Komorowice and completing Wapienica
wastewater treatment plants. These investments resulted in improved drinking water quality,
additional wastewater network connections, and full biological treatment of wastewater at
Komorowice (90,000 m3/day) and Wapienica (8,000 m3/day). Economic gains include health
benefits from improved water quality and environmental amenity benefits, but because these
benefits are difficult to quantify, as at appraisal, the ICR assessment evaluates only financial
benefits of the project.

Financial Analysis

The Financial Rate of Return (FRR) at appraisal was estimated at 23 percent, but the
end-of-project analysis shows a much higher FRR­ 36 percent. More capital than projected was
invested in the project--AQUA's contribution was twice that planned at appraisal--and the return
from these additional investments more than offset the increased expenditure.          Additional
investments were possible because AQUA generated more revenue than anticipated at appraisal.
The company increased tariffs significantly throughout project implementation, and households
now pay tariffs 51 percent higher for water and 68 percent higher for wastewater than appraisal
projections. The greater than projected increase in tariffs was both the cause and result of a
greater than forecast decline in water consumption.

Water consumption gradually decreased throughout the implementation period to about 110 lcd
currently, much less than the 162 lcd projected. Consumption at appraisal (180 lcd) already was
substantially below levels observed in the former Soviet Union, and the scope of further reduction
in Bielsko-Biala therefore was underestimated at appraisal. Economic conditions in Poland also
improved more than projected at appraisal, such that the average working household in 2003 had
an income 27 percent higher than forecast. Despite unanticipated changes in major affordability
parameters, current water services affordability approximates that projected at appraisal--the
average water and wastewater bill is 1.2 percent of working household income versus 1.4 percent
forecast at appraisal.

AQUA expanded its service area to offset declining sales and controlled its expenses. The current
service population is 255,000 compared to 205,000 projected at appraisal. Because of this
increase and reductions in staff, AQUA's labor efficiency now is 1.4 employees per thousand
population served, instead of 2.5 planned at appraisal. Project investments also have reduced
AQUA's energy expense; for example, Kobiernice water treatment plant pump rehabilitation
resulted in a 15 percent energy reduction.
