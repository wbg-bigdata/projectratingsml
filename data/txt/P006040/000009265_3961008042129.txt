MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Argentine Republic for the
equivalent of US$16.0 million to help finance a forestry development project.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.    Sector Background. Argentina's forest plantations have clear natural
advantages compared with those in many countries. These advantages stem
mainly from: (a) the fast growth rates of trees in Argentina resulting from
relatively rich soils and favorable temperatures and rainfall; and (b) an
abundance of land with few alternative uses. In spite of these advantages,
forest plantations in earlier decades were not developed in line with the
potential, principally because of unfavorable macroeconomic, trade, and
other policies. In recent years many of these policies have been adjusted
appropriately, and the improved economic and policy environment now
encourages investment.
3.    The forest resources of Argentina are made up of both plantations and
native forests. Land with woody vegetation is estimated at about 64 million
hectares (23 percent of the total area of the country), of which forested land
is estimated at between 35 and 45 million hectares. The area of native forest
with commercial potential is estimated at about 15 million hectares; it
produces about 7.3 million m3 of wood per annum, equal to about 40 percent
of the country's annual production. The remainder comes from plantations,
whose area is estimated at about 900,000 hectares.
4.    The forestry sector in Argentina contributes just under 2 percent of
GDP and had a positive trade balance of US$132.1 million in 1989. While it
now contributes positively to the trade balance, this was achieved only by
1988. The contrast between the perfornance of the forestry sectors in
Argentina and Chile could hardly be more striking. While Argentina is about
3.7 times the size of Chile in area, and about 3 times its size in terms of
GDP, Chile's exports of forest products, at about US$1.0 billion annually,
are almost 4 times greater than Argentina's.
5.    From 1980 to 1989, the area under plantations in Argentina grew only
7.5 percent. From. 1970 to 1990, Argentina planted about 1 million hectares
of forests; over the same period, Brazil planted about 6 million hectares, and
between 1978 and 1990, Chile planted 1.3 million hectares. Chile developed
an export-oriented industry which enabled it to develop well beyond the



- 2 -
requirements of the domestic economy. Brazil suffered from macroeconomic
and policy distortions similar to those of Argentina, but the size of the
domestic market was much larger, enabling its forestry sector to expand
rapidly. Argentina was constrained both by macroeconomic and sector
policy distortions and by the small size of its domestic market. In comparing
Argentina with Chile in particular, it becomes clear that a substantial gap
exists in Argentina between the actual and potential levels of forest plantation
production. Furthermore, much of the past growth in forest plantations in
Argentina has not been efficient.
6.     The Argentinean National Forestry Institute (IFONA), an
autonomous institute under the institutional umbrella of the Secretariat of
Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (SAGyP), was responsible for overall
management of the forest sector until late 1991 when it was dismantled.
IFONA's functions were divided between the SAGyP's Directorate for
Forestry Production (DPF), which was given responsibility for forest
plantations, timber processing industries and agroforestry, and the newly-
created Secretariat of Natural Resources and Human Environment
(SRNyAH), which was given responsibility for native forests, protected
areas, and green environmental issues. SAGyP is responsible for two semi-
autonomous agencies: (a) the National Seed Institute (INASE); and (b) the
National Institute for Agricultural Research (INTA), which has responsibility,
inter alia, for forestry research and extension. DPF, INASE, and INTA,
which would be directly involved with the implementation of the project, are
relatively capable and efficient institutions, but in need of some further
strengthening.
7.    While the names of the administrative units dealing with the forest
sector may differ in the 23 Argentinean provinces, the general institutional
design is relatively simple. The focal point is a provincial Forestry
Directorate with responsibility for coordinating the forestry-related activities
of all entities, including national, for both native and planted forests.
8.    In the Government strategy for developing forest plantations and
timber processing industries, fostering agroforestry, and dealing with the
prevention of desertification in Patagonia, responsibility for the production
and marketing of commercial goods and services is assigned to the private
sector while the role of the state is limited mainly to the creation of a
supportive policy, legal and regulatory framework, the production of goods
and services with a high public good content, and support of agroforestry in
selected areas to alleviate rural poverty. Examples of public goods would be:
(a) producing public information on the stock of trees in the nation's forest
plantations; (b) producing market and price information; (c) developing
genetically-improved seed and promoting the production and use of improved
seedlings; and (d) generating and disseminating information about improved
technical packages for the establishment and management of plantations. The
proposed project would help the Government implement the public sector
role outlined here.



- 3 -
9.    Project Objectives. The objectives of the project would be to
contribute to efficient and sustainable growth of forest plantations and timber
processing industries, to alleviate rural poverty, and to develop a strategy and
consensus for addressing the desertification and soil erosion problems in
Patagonia.
10.   Project Description. To achieve these objectives, the project would:
(a) help to create a supportive institutional, policy, legal and regulatory
framework; (b) produce and disseminate information which would enable all
actors, both public and private, to contribute to narrowing the gap between
actual and potential levels of output from forest plantations and timber
processing industries; (c) target directly with technical assistance and grants,
groups of small farmers in which the incidence of poverty is high,
agroforestry can play a central role in improving farming practices, and, as a
consequence, alleviate rural poverty and better protect important resources of
nearby native forests; and (d) complete a comprehensive study on the
Patagonia region, focussing on the development of an appropriate role for the
state to help prevent soil erosion and destruction of natural habitat.
11.   The project would have three components: (a) institutional
strengthening, including reform of the policy, legal, and regulatory
frameworks affecting forest plantations and timber processing industries; (b)
research and information generation and dissemination; and (c) support to
poor farmers in about five areas adjoining important native forests to help
them improve their farming practices partly through the use of agroforestry.
12.   The Institutional Strengthening Component (13 percent of project
costs) would: (a) analyze and strengthen the policy, legal, and regulatory
frameworks; and (b) address identified weaknesses in the principal public
sector institutions supporting forest plantations and timber processing
industries: the Directorate for Forestry Production (DPF), the National Seed
Institute (INASE), and the National Institute for Agricultural Research
(INTA), all within the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries
(SAGyP). The project would provide the necessary technical assistance and
training for selected staff of SAGyP, and, where appropriate, cooperating
staff at other institutions involved directly in project implementation. The
baseline cost of the component would be US$3.0 million, and would include
expenditures for the acquisition of vehicles, equipment, training, studies, and
technical assistance.
13.   The Research and Information Generation and Dissemination
Component (56 percent of project costs) would support the following actions
and investments aimed at generating information with a high public good
content: (a) a national inventory of forest plantations and a related database;
(b) studies on export markets and adoption of grading systems for mechanical
wood products; (c) the development of a breeding program to achieve a
higher level of species domestication; (d) the production and marketing of
better seedlings; (e) plantation management research and extension; and (f)



- 4 -
strengthening of the information base available for improved management of
the Patagonia region. The baseline cost of the component would be US$13.2
million, and would include expenditures for remote imagery, equipment,
technical assistance, studies, and training.
14.   The Small Farmer Component (31 percent of project costs) would:
(a) provide direct support in the form of technical assistance and grants to
poor farm families in about five areas adjoining important native forests to
help them improve their farming practices partly through the use of
agroforestry and, as a consequence, alleviate their poverty and contribute to
relieving the pressure on these native forests; (b) develop improved
technologies adapted to small farming systems; and (c) increase small
farmers' and their families' sensitivity toward environmental values,
environmental degradation, and the need to conserve native forests.
Activities would expand and sustain the participation of effective local groups
to facilitate the adoption of technological alternatives that could not be easily
absorbed by individual farmers. Farmers' groups or associations -- formed
spontaneously or promoted by public and private institutions or by non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) -- would be the main vehicles for the
implementation of the component. The baseline cost would be US$7.2
million, and would include expenditures for technical assistance, research,
farm inputs, and training.
15.   The estimated project costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the
proposed disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Argentina
are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 14314-AR, dated September 22, 1995, has also been prepared.
16.   Project Implementation. Overall responsibility for project
implementation would rest with SAGyP, and authority to make most
decisions affecting the project would be delegated to the Sub-Secretary of
Production. The Sub-Secretary would make maximum use of existing
SAGyP capacity for project implementation but, in addition, would receive
administrative and technical assistance from a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) which would be established under the project. The PIU would include
a project coordinator, a technical manager, a procurement specialist, and an
accountant. The Directors of DPF and INASE would work closely with the
Sub-Secretary of Production in implementing the Institutional Strengthening
Component in their respective areas of responsibility. Under the Research
and Information Generation and Dissemination Component, the Sub-Secretary
of Production would: (a) directly manage the study of the Patagonia region
working in close cooperation with other interested parties in the federal
government, provincial governments concerned, the private sector, and
NGOs; (b) implement, with the assistance of INTA, two sub-components,
namely, tree selection and breeding, and plantation management research and
extension; and (c) delegate to DPF authority: (i) to complete the national



- 5 -
inventory of forest plantations and to manage the related database; (ii) to
manage the study on export markets and the adoption of grading systems for
mechanical wood products; and (iii) to manage, with the assistance of INASE
(which would be responsible for certification), the program for promoting the
production and marketing of improved seedlings. In implementing the Small
Farmer Component, the Sub-Secretary would use: (a) the assistance of INTA
to carry out applied research on small farmer issues; and (b) the institution
with the best proven record in each of the approximately five areas affected
(whether an NGO or local government) to provide technical assistance and
other support to poor farmers.
17.   Proiect Sustainability. Project sustainability would be enhanced
through the strengthening of the implementing agencies, particularly DPF and
INASE, and the reform of the incentive structure that affects forest
plantations, timber processing industries, and desertification and soil erosion
in Patagonia. Research-generated information would make possible more
efficient plantations which, in turn, would help to make project activities
more sustainable. The incremental recurrent cost after project completion
would be modest, at about US$1.1 million per annum.
18.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Only one
Project Completion Report (Haiti Forestry Project (C1257-HA), Report No.
9399, dated March 7, 1991), and no Project Audit Report (PAR), exists for a
forestry project in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. Lessons
learned are derived from Bank studies of sectoral experience. The proposed
project represents an appropriate set of public sector interventions aimed at
boosting the productivity of plantation forests and timber processing
industries while being sensitive to environmental issues. It heeds lessons
from Bank and non-Bank projects that the government has a critical role to
play in encouraging and facilitating the use of improved technology in
plantation forests, and that forestry and agroforestry can play a key role in
alleviating rural poverty in selected locations while also helping to protect
native forests.
19.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is fully
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was discussed
by the Board on May 4, 1995. The CAS highlights three broad objectives:
(a) consolidating structural reform; (b) poverty reduction and strengthening
social services; and (c) rebuilding infrastructure. The proposed project
would be the Bank's first forestry project in Argentina. It would provide a
vehicle for the Bank to pursue CAS objective (a) by enhancing the
competitiveness of forest-plantation based industries through policy. legal and
regulatory reform, and by strengthening public sector institutions and applied
research and extension systems; objective (b) by improving the incomes of
poor small farmers through the use of agroforestry in selected rural areas
where the incidence of poverty is high; and objective (c) by promoting soil
conservation through a study to identify the causes of, and to develop
remedies for, desertification in the Patagonia region.



- 6 -
20.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached between
the Government and the Bank on the following: (a) that SAGyP would pursue
the least-cost option of inputting into its database raw statistics collected by
other agencies, and would concentrate on collecting only the unavailable raw
data required by its unique mandate; (b) that for plantation owners to be
eligible for participation in any government grant-assisted plantation
program, they would be required, when establishing a new forest plantation,
to use INASE-certified improved seedlings; (c) that under the Small Farmer
Component, the target population would be limited to farm families having
legal title to the land they farm, family incomes of less than two minimum
rural salaries, total assets (excluding land) of less than Arg$20,000, and
potential and motivation, in the opinion of the collaborating institution, to
increase farm income while also contributing to protecting adjoining native
forests; (d) that under the Small Farmer Component, the cumulative amount
of grants paid to any farm family over the life of the project would not
exceed US$1,000 equivalent; (e) that prior to the commencement of activities
to be financed under the Small Farmer Component in any selected area,
SAGyP would enter into a collaboration agreement for such selected area
with a well qualified and experienced public or private institution in order to
ensure the provision of extension/technology transfer services and
environmental education to beneficiaries, and monitoring of the use of the
agroforestry fund; (f) a draft of the contractual agreement between SAGyP
and INTA, which includes the provision that SAGyP, with the assistance of
INTA, would carry out the proposed plantation forestry management and
small farmer research programs jointly with private sector research
organizations or universities; (g} timing for the submission of the Annual
Operating Plan and reporting procedures; and (h) timing and scope of the
Mid-Term Review.
21.   Before the effectiveness of the proposed loan, the following
conditions would be met by the Borrower: (a) the PIU would be established
and staffed with a project coordinator, a technical manager, a procurement
specialist, and an accountant; and (b) a contractual agreement would be in
effect between SAGyP and INTA.
22.   Poverty Category. The Small Farmer Component would be targeted
at the Northeast and Northwest, the two regions of Argentina which have the
highest concentration of poor farmers and between them contain 53 percent
of the country's rural poor. Within these regions, the level of family income
would be used along with other criteria to select beneficiaries and to ensure
that they all would come from the population of rural poor.
23.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project would have no adverse
environmental impact; the small farmer component is specifically designed to
have a positive impact on adjoining native forests. The project has an
Environmental Assessment category B because of the need to ensure that
reform of the policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting forest



plantations and timber processing industries would avoid negative
consequences for the environment.
24.   Program Objective Categories. The program objective categories
affected by the project would be private sector development, poverty
reduction, and environmentally sustainable development. The emphasis
would be on private sector development and poverty reduction.
25.   Participatory Approach. The proposed implementing agencies for
the project were closely involved in project preparation. Producer
associations and plantation and timber processing operators and owners were
consulted on all aspects of the proposed project affecting their interests. In
the case of the Small Farmer Component, the NGOs which developed the
pilot schemes upon which that component is based were involved directly in
project preparation. There was also widespread consultation with small
farmers and their organizations in the proposed project areas.
26.   Project Benefits. The project would contribute to efficient and
sustainable growth in forest plantations and timber processing industries by
reorienting the role of government toward its core functions of providing
appropriate public sector support to the private sector. The rural economy
would be strengthened by improved resource allocation and by the increased
competitiveness of forest plantations and timber processing industries. About
3,000 poor rural families would benefit directly from efforts to alleviate
poverty. As a result of studies to be completed under the project, the
government would be better positioned to play an appropriate role in
addressing problems stemming from the destruction of the Patagonia region's
natural resources and habitats.
27.   Risks. The major risk is that the key institution charged with
executing the project, namely SAGyP, would not be up to the task. This risk
stems mainly from the changed demands the project would place on SAGyP's
DPF, INASE, and INTA. The source of these new demands is the changed
role of the state in forest plantations and timber processing industries which
underlies and has guided project design. In response to this concern, great
emphasis would be placed on institutional strengthening as part of the
project. There is also a risk that a complementary project which is under
preparation with SRNyAH, dealing with native forests and protected areas
may not proceed as scheduled. Should this occur, the benefits from the
Forestry Development Project would be unaffected, but the issues confronting
native forests, protected areas, and related green environmental issues would
receive inadequate attention. However, this outcome is unlikely since
preparation of the complementary project with SRNyAH is proceeding on
schedule.

28.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that
the Executive Directors approve it.
