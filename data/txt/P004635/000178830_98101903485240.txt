APPRAISAL OF THE PORT OF SINGAPORE
EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT PFRJECT
(Supplementary Report)
1.        The Bank on August 9, 1965 was on the verge of completing a loan,
guaranteed by Malaysia, for the expansion of the port of Singapore - the
project having been submitted to and approved by the Board - when the poli-
tical separation of Singapore from Malaysia required its postponement until
Singapore became a member of the Bank in its own right. A subsequent Bank
mission consisting of Messrs. A. J. Carmichael and S. Y. Park visited Singa-
pore in March 1966 to determine the effect that the separation of Singapore
from Malaysia may have had on the trade and prospects of the port, and to
update the information contained in Appraisal Report (TO-483a) on the port of
Singapore project.
2.        The latest information indicates that the justification of the
project has not been affected by recent events and remains sound.
A. General
3.        The new port at Jurong, to serve the needs of the new industrial
estate and satellite town being developed west of Singapore, is scheduled
for completion in 1966. The first berth was commissioned in January 1966
and the other four deep-water berths and 1,260 feet of coastal berths are
nearing completion. The completed berth has stiarted to handle general cargo
and, up to March 12, 1966, six vessels had used the facility.  As an interim
measure, the Port of Singapore Authority's (PSA staff and equipment are
being used to operate Jurong poit and the situation is being reviewed in tile
light of experience during the first six months of operations. The Govern-
ment of Singapore has informed the Bank that its policy is to co-ordinate
development to avoid unnecessary duplication of port facilities and to ensure
that the rates charged are such as to prevent wasteful competition and subsi-
dization of one port at the expense of the other.
4.        The Telok Ayer Basin area deals mainly with the traffic lightered
to and from deep-sea vessels at the "Roads", and that from coastal vessels
using the shallow-water, artificial basin itself. Discussions between PSA
and the Government are still under way regarding the taking over of the area,
and the terms and conditions of the take-over have yet to be determined.
B. Operations
5.        From discussions with Government officials and representatives of
private firms specializing in the entrepot trades, it appears that there hias
been no discernible adverse effect on Singapore's port traffic as a result
of the political separation from Malaysia in August 1965.



6.        The long-range intentions of the Malaysian Government with respect
to the port of Singapore are not known. The Government of MIalaysia is in a
position to introduce measures to divert the Singapore port's Malaysian
traffic to Port Swettenham or other Mlalaysian ports. However, such measures
would be disadvantageous on economic grounds as new port facilities would
have to be provided in Malaysia. In any event, the provision of adequate
alternative port facilities in Malaysia would take several years and there
is therefore no immediate threat to this portion of Singapore's trade.
7.        In the meantime, Singapore's officials hope that a workable arrange-
ment for economic cooperation with Malaysia will be established and that a
common tariff zone for Malaysia and Singapore will result.  Recently, the
Singapore Government proposed that negotiations for the establishment of a
common tariff zone for Malaysia and Singapore should be re-opened in the near
future and the Plalaysian Government agreed that this should be done. Rapid
progress in such negotiations is, however, not expected.
8.        The continuation of Indonesian "confrontation" led to a sharp
decrease in the volume of Singapore's traffic in 1964 but this was followed
by a modest recovery during 1965. The total PSA wharf traffic (excluding
bulk mineral oil) increased by nearly 8 per cent to about 4.6 million tons in
1965 as compared with a 13 per cent decrease in 1964. The volume of traffic
in 1965 was almost exactly as anticipated by the Bank's 1964 appraisal mission,
in spite of the decrease during 1964 having been somewhat more than estimated.
(See updated traffic and operational statistics in Appendices 1 - 4.) Recent
reports indicate that the effect of "confrontation" is diminishing and that
Indonesia is gradually resuming use of Singapore's facilities for trade.
9.        The traffic forecast for PSA wharves in the Appraisal Report
envisaged an average annual rate of growth of slightly less than 5 per cent
from 4.4 million tons in 1964 to 5.5 million tons in 1969. From the latest
information, it appears that the growth rate of PSA's wharf traffic assumed
in the original Appraisal Report is still reasonable.  In fact, on the basi-s
of the actual results for 1964-1965 and the improved prospects for trade
with Indonesia, it appears possible that the projected rate of growth will be
surpassed.
10.       The updated traffic and operational statistics are given in Appen-
dices 1 to 4 which correspond to the Appendices with the same numbers in the
Appraisal Report.
C. The Project
11.       PSA has requested that a few changes be made in the project.  These
are of a minor nature and do not affect the total amount of foreign exchange
involved.
12.       Details of the original and the present project are given in Appen-
dix 5.  The total cost is now N$ 72.7 million (US$ 24.2 million equivalent);
the foreign exchange cost remaining the same at N$ 45.0 million (U'S$ 15.0
million equivalent) and the local currency cost being M$ 27.7 million (US$ 9.2
million equivalent). The main item of the project - the East Lagoon Scheme



- 3 -
for the construction of h new deep-water berths - is unchanged and its cost
now represents 70 per cent of the total cost of the project. The port
engineer's plantyard item, preliminary work on which has already started,
also remains the same.
13.       Of the floating craft, PSA has decided to procure only the large
fire float and no longer intends to purchase the small fire-fighting vessel
as seven of PSA's tugs have been fitted with fire-fighting equipment and ara
now on 24.hour service. This is an acceptable arrangement. Accepting the
advice of its consultants, PSA has decided to buy its own self-propelled,
diesel-electric, bucket ladder dredger and to transport dredged material by
means of locally-hired barges. Consequently, the two 300-ton steel hopper
barges and the attendant tug have been deleted from the project and the
"dredging unit" item replaced by the bucket ladder dredger, the estimated
cost of which is M$ 2.5 million. A review of PSA's obligations for the supply
of water to vessels and to the outer islands and an assessment of its exist-
ing five waterboats have caused PSA to revise its waterboat replacement pro-
gram and to order three vessels at this time instead of the one originally
intended. As before, three harbour tugs are to be procured.
14.       The item for the procurement of data processing equipment remains
the same. PSA expected to complete an investigation of the best type of
equipment for its needs by July 1966.
15.       Regarding cargo-handling equipment, orders have been placed, after
international competitive bidding, for 38 of the 1h9 forklift trucks. The
price offered was lower than anticipated and the total for this item has
been reduced from M$ 3.9 to M$ 3.7 million.  An order for nine mobile cranes
has also been placed. The total cost for mechanical equipment has been
reduced from M$ 6.2 to M$ 6.0 million.
16.       It is now possible that a technical college building on part of
PSA's estate will be made available at some time in the future for conversion
into a head office. In view of this possibility, PSA has docided to
delete this item from the project.
17.       The amounts included in the original appraisal report estimate for
engineering services, including supervision, remain the same and the 7 per
cent contingency item added to the 10 per cent already. included in the East
Lagoon Scheme figure is considered adequate for the project.
D. Finance
18.       Past Income and Expenditure Accounts and Balance Sheets were given
in Appendices 6 and 7 of the original Appraisal Report. The latest financial
information is given in Appendices 8 to 12 which provide:-
Appendix 8 - Statement of Present Debt
Appendix 9 - Forecast Revenue and Expenditure Accounts -
Actual 1964 and 1965, Forecast for 1966-1971
Appendix 10 - Forecast of Cash Flow 1966-1971



- 4 -
Appendix 11  - Summary Balance Sheets - Actual 1964 and 1965,
Estimated 1966 - 1971
Appendix 12  - Forecast of Debt Service 1966 - 1971.
For all practical purposes, the financial projections remain as
forecast in the original Appraisal Report and PSA is confident that at least
a 6 per cent rate of return on net fixed assets can be attained in the current,
year and maintained in the future.
