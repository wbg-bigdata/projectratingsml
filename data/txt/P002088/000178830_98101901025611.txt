NIGERIA
LAGOS SOLID WASTE AND STORMDRAINAGE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Federal Republic of Nigeria
Beneficiary:       Lagos State Government
Amount:            US$72.0 million equivalent
Terms:             Repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate.
Relending Terms:  The Federal Government would on-lend the full amount of the
loan to the Lagos State Government (LSG), on the same terms
as the Bank loan. The LSG would carry the foreign exchange
risk.
Project
Description:    The primary stormdrainage network of the Lagos metropolitan
area would be extended to ameliorate wasteful and costly
problems of flooding. Solid waste disposal services would
be expanded and improved, thereby also enhancing the
effectiveness of the drainage system by unblocking drains
while, at the same time, improving environmental health
conditions. Technical assistance and training would be
provided to strengthen the management of solid waste
disposal and stormdrainage services. Assistance would also
be furnished to the Lagos State Government to increase the
revenue potential of the property tax by updating and
revaluing tax rolls. Finance would be provided for the
preparation of future projects in Lagos.
Benefits and
Risks:           While the project would have a citywide impact, most of the
project beneficiaries will be industries, commerce, and
residents of areas at present deficient in drainage and
waste collection, mostly urban poor. About 50% of project
investments would directly benefit families with incomes
below the relative poverty level. Most of the estimated
2.5 million direct beneficiaries suffer from lack of
drainage and inadequate or non-existent waste disposal
services. The registration, listing and valuation of an
additional 100,000 taxable properties, plus the increase in
taxable assessment, will undoubtedly have a considerable
positive impact on the State's financial position by the end
of the project implementation period.
Although this is the first project dealing with a large,
complex city in Nigeria, the most significant risks are



- vii -
implementing difficulties that are generally prevalent in
Nigeria--procurement and contracting delays, staff short-
ages, administrative problems, etc.--that could hinder
implementation and increase costs. However, most of the
project is an expansion of ongoing programs and is
technically simple. In addition, technical and management
assistance to LSG and the Lagos State Waste Disposal Board
during project execution is intended to minimize the risks
that may otherwise stem from procurement difficulties,
management weaknesses, and staffing shortages. Virtually
all of the detailed engineering and tender documentation is
completed.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
A.   Background
1.01     As one of the eight states of the Nigerian States Urban Development
Program (NSUDP), 1/ the Federal Military Government of Nigeria (FMGN) and the
Lagos State Government (LSG) have requested Bank assistance in financing a
five-year solid waste management and stormdrainage project for the Lagos
Metropolitan Area, at an estimated cost of US$164.3 million. The project
would include three components intended to address high priority urban manage-
ment problems: (a) improvement and expansion of solid waste (refuse) collec-
tion and disposal services; (b) expansion and rehabilitation of the primary
stormdrainage network to reduce disruptive and costly flooding of large parts
of the city; and (c) assistance to LSG in the establishment of a Lagos State
Valuation Office (LSVO) which is to carry out comprehensive and unified valua-
tion/revaluation and rating of properties for improved taxation. Institu-
tional support and funds for future project preparation would also be
included. This would be the first urban development project in Nigeria
focusing on citywide infrastructure/services and management.
1.02     The project was identified by LSG and a Bank urban sector mission in
March 1982. The project was prepared by the Lagos State Waste Disposal Board
(LSWDB) and the then Lagos State Ministry of Works and Housing (MOW), with the
assistance of consultancy services financed in part by project preparation
funds available to LSG through the Bank's First Urban Development project
(Bauchi). This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which
visited Lagos in November/December 1982, and on the agreements reached during
negotiations at headquarters in June 1983. The Nigerian delegation was headed
by Dr. R. Mowoe of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Dr. R. 0. Ojikutu of the
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, and Mr. R. B. Fanimokun, Permanent
Secretary, Economics, Office of the Governor of Lagos State, representing LSG.
The project has been updated following discussions with the Military Govern-
ment of Lagos State in March 1984 to reflect the new administration's sugges-
tions.
B.   Urbanization:  Nigeria and Lagos
1.03     General country and urban sector background information is contained
in the President's Report No. P-3522-UNI, in the Staff Appraisal Report
No. 3295-UNI dated June 28, 1985 (Second Urban Development Project (Imo)) and,
for Metropolitan Lagos, the Lagos Urban Sector Review, dated September 26,
1983. Sector information in this report is therefore limited to a brief
summary.
1/   Launched with Bank assistance in 1979 as a way of providing
infrastructure and shelter to the lower income urban population.



-2-
1.04     Nigeria's annual population growth rate 1/ of 3.3% is one of the
highest in Western Africa.  The urban population of about 29 million (some 30%
of the total) has been growing at a rate of at least twice the national growth
rate. This trend is expected to continue despite efforts to stem migration
such as those called for in the Fourth National Development Plan (1981-1985),
which included a much greater effort to increase agricultural production and
develop rural communities. By the turn of the century, half of Nigeria's
population will be living in urban areas and more than 15 cities will have
over one million inhabitants. Lagos, which now has over five million inhabit-
ants and growing at a rate in excess of 9% each year, will then be straining
to accommodate over 13 million residents.
1.05     The demand for urban land, infrastructure, and associated services
will continue to expand at twice the pace of overall population growth nation-
ally, and at over three times that pace in certain urban centers such as Lagos.
Even taking into account the initiatives to relieve urban pressure, such as
the relocation of the capital to Abuja (now scheduled to begin in 1986),
promotion of industrial dispersion, and the rural development program,
economic agglomeration and existing facilities ensure that Lagos will remain
the central magnet for migration and industrial investment, continuing to
outgrow its already inadequate infrastructure at an alarming rate.
C.   Constraints and Development Trends
1.06     In 20 years, Lagos has grown from a city of 350,000 to a vast urban
sprawl of nearly 5 million inhabitants on a poorly drained swamp plain,
factors which have placed heavy demands on administration, infrastructure and
services. Apart from recent substantial investments in primary networks such
as highways, the construction of secondary and tertiary infrastructure to
complement these have lagged far behind demand. To compound the problem,
inadequate or non-existent maintenance has caused existing networks to
deteriorate. The result is that:
(a) poor drainage causes recurrent, severe and costly flooding;
(b) human waste disposal facilities are primitive and constitute a major
health hazard, making access and traffic circulation difficult;
1/   There are no reliable national demographic data.  The last
officially approved census was 1963; the Federal Government decreed that
population forecasts be set at a constant 2.5% per annum and urban areas
at 5% per annum from that base figure. However, many unofficial
estimates have been made by the UN, the Ford Foundation and others. The
Federal Government has only recently, in 1985, adopted the higher 3.4%
figure for its own estimation purposes. The figures presented here are
our best estimates extrapolated from these various sources.



- 3 -
(c)  secondary and tertiary roads are unpaved and inadequate for the
traffic volume;
(d)  water supply is intermittent or non-existent in many areas;
(e)  solid waste collection and street cleaning are inadequate and, as a
result, traffic is impeded by garbage-strewn streets and abandoned
cars, while stormwater drains are choked with refuse;
(f)  inadequate telephone services increase traffic and frustration; and
(g)  power supply is unreliable, and public lighting does not meet minimum
standards for security and safety.
The worst deficiencies are in the most densely populated areas, where the
lowest income groups live. The photographs at the end of this report illus-
trate these existing conditions and problems.
1.07     These deficiencies seriously impede productivity and result in clear
reductions in efficiency. Inadequate transportation, communications and the
lack of effective traffic management alone contribute to enormous waste of
fuel. In spite of these problems, Lagos has continued to attract sizeable
private and public industrial investments, largely because of its market
potential, locational advantages, labor pool and services facilities. To
offset public sector inefficiencies and deficiencies, industries have often
resorted to substantial investments in standby power generation facilities,
independent water supplies, corporate transportation support services for
employees, radiocall services and waste disposal/treatment, all driving up
production costs as much as 30%, making Lagos, even with such a poor environ-
ment, one of the most expensive cities in the world.
1.08     The concentration of industry and commerce in Lagos, whose manufac-
turing sector accounts for more than half of the value added in that sector in
Nigeria, attests to its economic importance within the national context. It
is estimated that over half of the proportion of manufacturing capital is
invested in Lagos, and that over 40% of the skilled manpower in Nigeria is
employed there. As a result, the average per capita income in Lagos is higher
than in other urban centers and substantially higher than rural incomes.
While the national relative urban poverty threshold is estimated to be about
US$550, the higher cost of living in Lagos increases the poverty threshold
there to about US$660 per capita per annum. And, although the infrastructure
and services deficiencies are greater and concentrated in those parts of the
city where the poor live, the physical problems and hardships are shared among
all income groups who have to live and do business with constant traffic
snarls, costly flooding, power failure, massive uncollected refuse, water
shortages and a generally poor, inefficient, and unhealthy environment.



-4-
Institutional Framework
1.09     Metropolitan Lagos, which accounts for 90% of the State's popula-
tion, is administered by the Lagos State Government. The Lagos State Ministry
of Local Government serves as the link between the State and the Local Govern-
ment Councils. Its existing institutions, although improving, still lack the
management skills, manpower, financial resources, and investment planning
capacity to deal efficiently with the city's ongoing and growing needs. An
unusually wide range of agencies and administrative entities at all levels
operate more or less independently in Lagos, with resultant overlapping func-
tions and an inefficient use of resources.
1.10     There are five Local Government Councils within the Lagos Metropol-
itan Area (LMA). The local government system is still in a period of forma-
tion. Reorganized in 1984, the councils are inexperienced and often unable to
perform the maintenance services mandated to them, tasks which then revert to
an already overstretched Lagos State Government (LSG). Within LMA, some
councils are relatively well-equipped to deal with most tasks; others need
substantial assistance. LSG is actively helping the Local Governments. It
does this, however, acknowledging that the Councils need to assume an in-
creasing share of responsibility as mandated to them under the 1979 constitu-
tion, especially in the area of maintenance and fiscal discipline (expenditure
control, revenue generation and cost recovery).
D.   Recent Actions and New Policy Directions
1.11     In Lagos, both Federal and State governments have undertaken large
capital investments focused on a few highly-visible and very expensive
projects, i.e., primary road systems, a new international airport, port facil-
ities, etc. Many of these investments have been a consequence of Lagos being
the major port, commercial, cultural and communications center, as well as the
administrative capital of Nigeria. These investments, however, have not
overcome the infrastructure deficiencies. There is still an acute need for
related investments in secondary and tertiary infrastructure and service
systems and their maintenance, so that those primary facilities can be used to
their full capacity. This lack of sufficient secondary streets, for example,
increases congestion on the few available major roads. The tertiary (local)
roads, mostly unpaved and rutted, are always difficult to traverse and, in the
wet season, often impassable. The resulting excessive travel time to and from
work (averaging 1 1/2 hours each way) reduces worker efficiency and further
raises the costs of production.
1.12     The LSG has in the last decade broadened its areas of responsibility
and created state boards to tackle the most troubled areas of stormdrainage
rehabilitation, solid waste management, and local government revenues.



- 5 -
Further, it has taken important initiatives toward better investment manage-
ment through its five-year plans and the 1981 Master Plan for Metropolitan
Lagos (MPML). 1/
1.13     The emphasis of the Master Plan for Metropolitan Lagos is on the
physical needs and on calculating the cost of an investment program to respond
to those needs. It gives little attention to the development of an implemen-
tation strategy and, therefore, does not serve as a guide to intersectoral
allocations of resources. To fill this gap, the Government of Lagos asked for
Bank assistance in (a) formulating a priority investment strategy, and
(b) financing those urban investments. Bank urban sector missions have
reviewed and discussed possible investment strategies with Government
(para 1.17). Solid waste management and drain rehabilitation were identified
as areas of overriding priority since strategic investments in those areas
could control flooding and thereby arrest the deterioration of existing infra-
structure while, at the same time, establishing the physical prerequisites for
further investment in tertiary infrastructure.
Resource Position of LSG
1.14     Lagos State's fiscal situation, compared to other states, is good
and its creditworthiness strong, with its debt service being just 4.7% in 1985
(para 4.04). The State is weathering the reduced oil revenue situation well,
and in spite of shortfalls for capital expenditures, it managed to avoid the
serious financial crisis that beset other states, many of which had trouble
covering their recurrent expenditures. The key to Lagos State's financial
position is that over 70% of its total revenue is generated internally,
compared to 10-30% elsewhere in Nigeria. On a per capita basis, the State
generates ten times or more revenue from internal sources than other states,
making it less vulnerable to shifts in the world oil market. LSG's internal
revenue comes mainly from personal income taxes, followed by land transaction
taxes, licenses, fees, interest on short-term fixed deposits, and the new
sales tax. In addition, LSG receives about 25% of its total revenue from the
Federal Government, through the revenue sharing formula.
1.15     However, in spite of its relatively sound financial position, LSG has
been unable to finance its entire Fourth Plan, much less the substantially
larger capital investments proposed by the MPML (table, page 7). When
recurrent expenditures (requiring about 65% of total revenues in recent years)
are subtracted from the five-year state revenues of about N 2,800 million,
only about N 850 million were left for capital expenditure versus N 2,000
million required by the Fourth Plan and N 3,182 million recommended by the
MPML.
1/   The UNDP- and LSG-financed MPML was started in 1978 and completed in
1981. It is an in-depth analysis of the city that identifies in detail
the physical problems confronting Lagos and provides a guideline for the
future growth of the city, as well as proposing short-term (1985) and
long-term (2000) investments.



- 6 -
1.16     Thus, if LSG is to fund its priority capital investments over the
next five-year plan period, it must reduce its funding shortfall through
improved mobilization of internal resources both directly and through the local
governments. The weakness of local government councils is reflected in their
generally poor record of revenue collection: less than 50% of total budgeted
revenues were collected in 1983. The Local Government Revenue Board has
somewhat improved, but not significantly altered, this situation and revenue
collection responsibility has now (1985) been given back to the Local Govern-
ments. Property taxation, a potentially rich source of additional revenues,
suffers from serious defects. There is, for instance, no consistent unified
statewide basis for rating and there has been no statewide property revalua-
tion for over 25 years.
Strategy for Bank Assistance
1.17     An IBRD urban sector mission reviewed the MPML and discussed possible
investment strategies 1/ with Government. A sequence of possible Bank inter-
ventions for Lagos was recommended: the first, a solid waste management and
drain rehabilitation project and, the second, a water rehabilitation project
(which is under preparation), followed closely by an area infrastructure
improvements project. Subsequent operations should include transporta-
tion/traffic management and other projects geared to further improve the func-
tioning of the city.
1.18     Two main factors suggest this sequence.  The first is related to
basic physical interrelationships: uncollected refuse clogs the open drains
throughout the city and needs to be removed to eliminate flooding before other
infrastructure improvements are started. The proposed sequence assures that
this necessary first-stage maintenance would be underway while the capacity to
extend secondary and tertiary infrastructure is developed. Also, improved
drainage is required to introduce a greater water supply. The second factor
is that LSG has already established a solid waste management and drain
rehabilitation program which only needs to be supported by investments in
equipment and plant in order to be made more effective.
1.19     Bank assistance to Lagos would extend earlier involvements in
Nigeria's urban sector, specifically its help in launching the Nigerian States
Urban Development Program (NSUDP) in 1979, aimed at developing projects for
Nigeria's lower income urban population. The first urban project, Bauchi
State (FY80), is serving as one example of how basic services can be provided

in an affordable manner. The project is progressing well and is not substan-
tially behind schedule. There were some start-up delays due to project
management and disbursement problems. These, however, have been largely over-
come and the project is expected to be completed by mid 1986. The Bauchi
project included funds for feasibility studies in an additional seven states,
two of which have been completed (Imo and Benue), with the others in
progress. Those funds were also used to help prepare this Lagos State
project. The second IBRD-supported urban development project for Imo State
(Loan No. 2607-UNI) was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors in
July 1985. While the focus of the NSUDP, as originally conceived, was toward
the newly-created states with emerging urban problems (such as shelter pro-
vision in smaller secondary cities), the present thrust is towards addressing
citywide services and infrastructure constraints in the larger, most economi-
cally active urban centers. Linkages between these urban centers and compli-
menting investments in other sectors is a key factor, as is the potential to
mobilize resources. For those reasons, particular attention is being given to
Lagos where immense problems will need to be dealt with over the next
decade. At the same time, IBRD lending will focus more on funding the insti-
tutional and financial mechanisms for providing the basic infrastructure,
services and maintenance in such areas as water supply, drainage, solid waste
removal, street improvement and urban transport, the objective being to
improve the functional efficiency of Nigeria's productive centers.
1.20     The proposed project falls within the strategy outlined above and
will enable LSG to accelerate and expand urgently needed infrastructure and
services. In the process, key institutions dealing with urban management will
benefit from improvements in financial and administrative procedures, better
budgeting and planning, and interagency coordination. The loan will assist
LSG to respond more quickly and effectively in overcoming critical bottlenecks
in the functions of Metropolitan Lagos. In so doing, it will enable LSG to
deal with subsequent infrastructure service investments (para 1.18).
11. PROJECT OBJECTIVES, COMPONENTS, COST AND FINANCING
A. The Project
2.01     In February 1982, the Lagos State Waste Disposal Board (LSWDB) pre-
sented a detailed and well-prepared proposal for a Solid Waste Management and
Drain Rehabilitation Project, and this was the basis for project identifica-
tion. LSG retained consultants to finalize engineering and tender documents
for all civil works, as well as tender documents and evaluation guidelines for
the procurement of equipment.
2.02     Building upon the basic institutional mechanisms that are already in
place, the project has the following objectives:



- 9 -
(a) to strengthen the administrative, technical and financial capacity of
key Lagos State institutions and reorient their existing programs
toward a larger scale provision of infrastructure and maintenance;
(b) to support the ongoing solid waste operations of LSWDB and stormwater
drainage of MOWT by expanding and improving services rendered by both
agencies, which would, in turn, lead to better functioning of the
city and increased productivity; and
(c) to assist LSG in mobilizing the additional resources needed to
provide future infrastructure, services and maintenance to Metro-
politan Lagos by revising and reactivating the rating system for
property tax valuation.
Summary Project Description
2.03     This project is primarily aimed at strengthening three critical in-
stitutions of Lagos State Government: the LSWDB, charged with waste manage-
ment and secondary stormdrainage maintenance; the Ministry of Works and
Transport's primary drainage construction and maintenance program; and the
State's property valuation system through the Ministry of Local Government and
Chieftaincy Affairs (LSMLG). These institutions are responsible for opera-
tions which are prerequisites for most other urban infrastructure and
services' investments. The strategy for assisting LSG in systematically
improving the functioning of the city is to provide the resources to bring
these three functions up to capacity, not only by making available the
necessary capital requirements, but also by providing the required training
and institutional support to assure timely implementation and to transfer this
capacity to Lagos State personnel. The project's approach for this is to take
a five-year time-slice of these ongoing LSG operations and bring their insti-
tutions to a sustainable level of efficient operation by providing the
resources described below.
2.04     As further detailed in paras 2.13 to 2.50, the project will consist
of the following four components:
(a) Solid Waste Management, estimated to cost approximately
US$111.8 million (including physical and price contingencies, and
certain training and implementation assistance costs allocable to
LSWDB operations), amounts to about 67% of total project costs. The
project will finance equipment, new maintenance and depot facilities
(and refurbishing of existing physical plant), and related civil
works necessary for LSWDB to improve all aspects of its operations
(domestic and industrial waste collections, disposal, abandoned
vehicle management, and secondary and tertiary stormdrainage network
cleaning and maintenance). Included are the following items needed
to consolidate and expand citywide collection services and landfill
operations and increase LSWDB efficiency in operations and manage-
ment:
(i) equipment for refuse collection and disposal and for drain
cleaning operations (about US$63.7 million);



- 10 -
(ii)  construction of transfer stations together with long-haul
vehicles (about US$7.8 million);
(iii) civil works for existing and new controlled sanitary landfill
sites and new vehicle depots and maintenance workshops, as well
as improvements to existing facilities to improve efficiency of
operations and maintenance (about US$22.5 million);
(iv)  bulk bin hardstandings for refuse containers throughout the
city (US$2.3 million); and
(v) funds to assist implementation of small demonstration projects
by a LSWDB Research Development team and for a study to facili-
tate the transfer of secondary stormdrain maintenance to local
governments and advisory services for training of LSWDB staff
and strengthening of its management and operations over four
years; improvement of LSWDB financial complex; establishment of
proper financial accounting systems and a comprehensive
specialized staff training program; and the establishment of a
research and development group for long-term programming of its
operations (about US$15.5 million);
(b)  Main Stormwater Drainage, costing about US$42.5 million, will provide
for the dredging and construction of about 26 km of essential addi-
tions to the MOWT main drainage system that will reduce flooding of
the western half of the city. Also included is a program for the
rehabilitation of the existing primary system of earth channels.
These works will improve drainage in high density residential and
industrial areas covering about 3,400 ha and directly benefit an
estimated 1.4 million inhabitants and over half of Lagos' commer-
cial/industrial installations;
(c)  Rating and Valuation, costing approximately US$7.4 million, will
assist LSG in revising the present property tax law, identify proper-
ties incorrectly omitted from the valuation lists at present, and
carry out a statewide property revaluation; and
(d)  Institutional Support, costing about US$2.8 million, will provide:
(i)  advisory and contractual services for project coordination,
implementation and monitoring in the Ministry of Works and
Transport, and preparation of future main drainage and area
infrastructure improvement projects; and
(ii)  advisory services to selected local government councils to make
recommendations on improvement of administration, financial
management, and maintenance operations.



- 11 -
B.  Costs
2.05     The total estimated cost of the project, including physical and price
contingencies, is N 123.2 million (US$164.3 million), of which US$83.6 million
(51%) is foreign exchange. Taxes and duties are estimated to account for
about N 4.7 million (US$6.3 million) of the total cost. Project cost
estimates are summarized in the table on the following page, and detailed in
the Project File, item C3. Base costs were calculated in January 1983 prices
and have been updated in March 1984.
2.06     Estimates for infrastructure were based on detailed engineering
designs for the LSWDB civil works and final designs for drainage channels, and
the costs of similar, recently completed MOWT programs. Cost estimates for
workshop and depot construction were based on standard modules and for civil
works of depots and tip sites on unit costs of similar works constructed
during 1983. Design and tender documents for all civil works (except transfer
stations) were completed at the time of loan negotiations. Cost estimates for
vehicles, equipment, maintenance, tools and spare parts are based on costs of
recent procurement and quotes from international and local suppliers. An
average physical contingency of 10% has been allowed for all items to be
financed. Drainage engineers within the Ministry of Works and Transport, with
assistance from consultants, have prepared preliminary engineering and cost
estimates for the channels and conduits to be included in the project. All
detailed engineering, bills of quantities, specifications and cost estimates,
and respective tender documents were completed by consultants at the time of
negotiations.
2.07     General price inflation in Lagos is estimated to have been about 37%
in 1984 and no less than 20% in 1985. However, because of the depressed state
of construction activity in Nigeria generally, price contingencies for the
local cost component used are 14% in 1985 and thereafter. Price contingencies
for the foreign cost component of the project were estimated at 8% in 1985,
9% in 1986 to 1988, and 7.5% in 1989 and thereafter as prevailing at the time
post-negotiations update. Total price contingencies amount to 28% of total
project costs.
C. Financing
2.08     An IBRD loan of US$72.0 million is proposed.  The loan will bear a
standard variable rate of interest and will be amortized over 20 years, in-
cluding a grace period of five years. Some US$11.6 million of vehicles and
equipment would be cofinanced by suppliers. As shown in the financing plan
table and the project flow of funds chart (Chart 24958, page 29), the entire
balance of project costs for LSG would be financed from LSG's own resources.

2.09     Retroactive Financing.  Civil works contracts for about 3 kms of
storm drains totaling about US$3 million have been tendered as of July 1985.
In addition, LSWDB has procured about US$1 million worth of emergency spare
parts for its fleet. These items would be eligible for retroactive financ-
ing. Thus, retroactive financing of US$4.0 million has been recommended.
This amount of advance contracting and retroactive financing would maintain
the momentum of project preparation.
2.10     Cofinancing.  Sources for cofinancing are being investigated and LSG
has requested IBRD assistance in this process. The most likely sources are
suppliers' credits; there continues to be strong interest in cofinancing from
several sources. The items to be cofinanced have been grouped into a package
that will facilitate such financing (para 3.15). Until the financing
source is determined, assumptions as to the likely terms and conditions
(US$11.6 million at 11% for eight years) have been made so as to allow an
analysis of the impact of such cofinancing. The financial implications of
this for the five years of project construction (1986 to 1990) and the projec-
tions to 1992 are as follows:
Debt Service       Loan Outstanding
to 1992    a/    at December 1992

Financing                      42.2                  72.4
a! Includes principal, interest and commitment charges.
With cofinancing, the debt service payments are about US$6.9 million higher
during the period 1986 to 1992 but, on the other hand, the loans outstanding
at December 1992 are about US$7.5 million lower. This is detailed in Annex 2.
It is probable that satisfactory cofinancing would be available. However, LSG
confirmed that it would cover whatever financing gap might arise.

2.11     The Federal Military Government of Nigeria (FMGN) will be the borrower
and will onlend the funds to LSG at the same terms and conditions as the Bank
loan. LSG obligations for project execution will be included in the loan
agreement. The Bank will have a project agreement with LSG and, as a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the loan, FMGN will enter into a subsidiary loan
agreement with LSG (para 6.01(a)). The terms of the subsidiary loan agreement
will include Lagos State Government's absorption of the foreign exchange risk.
2.12     LSG will establish project accounts in a commercial bank (para 6.01(b))
by depositing N 660,000 in each account for MOWT and LSWDB, and N 330,000 in
the account of the LSMLG, and will thereafter deposit, in advance, the amounts
estimated for each quarter's expenditures for each component of the project.
This will assure that each of the four project components has operational
funds. In addition, a special account in a commercial bank will be estab-
lished into which loan proceeds in the amount of US$1 million would be
deposited as a revolving fund, once the loan becomes effective, to cover three
months of the Bank's share of the foreign expenditures, in order to relieve
LSG from prefinancing these costs (para 6.01(c)).  The revolving fund would be
replenished on the basis of applications supported by appropriate documenta-
tion (bank statements, statements of expenditures, etc.) submitted quarterly
or when cumulative withdrawals exceed US$500,000.  The project coordinating
and monitoring team will facilitate the processing of project expenditures,
and will manage the accounts.
D.   Detailed Project Description
2.13     The project will support the ongoing solid waste operations (LSWDB)
and stormwater drainage (Lagos State Ministry of Works and Transport--MOWT)
and improve services rendered by both agencies. The project will also assist
LSG in mobilizing additional internal resources needed to provide infrastruc-
ture, services, and maintenance.
Solid Waste Management and Drain Cleaning Component
2.14     In Metropolitan Lagos there is a direct relationship between the
collection of solid wastes and the efficient functioning of other services,
infrastructure, and productive activities. For example, providing a basic
level of citywide solid waste management is a prerequisite to making the
stormwater network (which doubles as a rudimentary sewerage system for vast
parts of the city) flow freely and reduce flooding; abandoned vehicles and
mounds of uncollected refuse impede the flow of traffic, etc. However, Metro-
politan Lagos' extremely dense population, traffic congestion, poor road
conditions and heavy rainfall 1/ make refuse collection/disposal and drain
cleaning extremely difficult. These problems, coupled over a short period
with an accelerating population growth and urban sprawl, make it impossible
for local authorities to provide adequate waste collection and disposal
1/   Average annual rainfall is 72" with 85% falling in the period from
April to October.

services.   Prior to 1977, when the Lagos State Refuse Disposal Board (later
renamed the Lagos State Waste Disposal Board--LSWDB) was created, little
attention had been paid to solid waste collection and disposal. The rapidly
deteriorating environment, with mounds of garbage and abandoned vehicles
accumulating in the streets, and the failure of local government councils to
tackle the problem effectively, prompted its establishment. It has broad
powers to plan and operate a citywide refuse collection system. A workshop,
depots, tip sites and refuse vehicles were transferred to LSWDB from the local
councils. New vehicles were procured and expert technical assistance was
engaged to manage LSWDB operations. With these first massive street cleaning
efforts, improvement of the environment was dramatic and soon led to pressures
from the LSG for expansion of LSWDB activities. For example, because of its
demonstrated capability, LSWDB was charged with an emergency cleaning of the
stormdrains on Lagos Island. The direct relationship between solid waste
removal and drain maintenance has made LSWDB extend this service to other
local government areas. These programs have been very successful in reducing
flooding, especially in the central business district. However, LSWDB is not
equipped to sustain this effort on a citywide basis, and, although its powers
are wide-ranging, its operations are limited to the funds made available by
the LSG. Services are provided mainly for the local government councils
(which are legally responsible for domestic collection), but they contribute
little to LSWDB revenues. In spite of charges collected from industrial and
commercial establishments, LSWDB relies heavily on grants from LSG.
2.15     At present, it is estimated that just over one-half of the domestic
refuse generated daily in Metropolitan Lagos is collected. 1/ There are
substantial areas, and almost one-third of the population of the city, that
have no refuse collection service. Even within the serviced areas only a
portion of the generated refuse is being collected. The pressing problems of
solid waste management in the Lagos Metropolitan Area (LMA) are:
(a) lack of adequate street storage (holding) containers for refuse;
(b) inadequate disposal sites and management of landfill operations;
(c) shortage of refuse equipment and vehicle maintenance;
(d) inefficiencies caused by physical and climatic conditions (flooding
of streets, traffic congestion, inadequate communications, etc.); and
(c) staffing shortages and weak administrative procedures of LSWDB.
The main deficiency of the existing LSWDB program is the limited scope of its
service, which is determined by its operation budget. It is estimated that
within the presently serviced area of Metropolitan Lagos, with present LSWDB
capacity and resources, the percentage of waste collected as a proportion of
waste generated would decline from about 55% in 1984 to 38% in 1988. Taken as
1/   This does not take into account removal of the accumulating backlog.



- 16 -
a proportion of the waste generated in the total metropolitan area, these per-
centages would be about 46% and 33% respectively. In addition, the increasing
quantities of uncollected wastes would have a "snowball" effect. 1/ There is
an urgent need for corrective action to prevent the complete collapse of the
service.
2.16     Only about 18% of the industrial and commercial premises of LMA
are being served. The estimated potential revenue for LSWDB from the in-
dustrial/commercial sector is over N 10 million annually. With its present
capacity, LSWDB can cover only about 370 premises that pay about N 3.6 million
annually for the service.
2.17     In addition to domestic and industrial waste collection, LSWDB is
also responsible for the removal and disposal of abandoned vehicles. In 1983,
there were an estimated 15,000 abandoned vehicles on vacant land, footpaths,
road shoulders, and medians. 2/ Some progress was made in tackling the
clearance problem but again budget constraints and storage problems have
reduced the effectiveness of this operation. Because local governments were
unable to clean and maintain secondary stormdrains, the LSWDB was also given
this task. A successful rehabilitation program was initiated on Lagos
Island. However, the success of the program created pressures for
expansion. Directives to LSWDB to work on five other areas were not matched
by additional funding for labor and equipment, which has reduced the efficien-
cy of these operations.
2.18     In its first seven years of operation, the LSWDB has made consider-
able progress in providing these services. However, it
(a) has overreached its resources in finance, management, and equipment;
(b) was forced to neglect longer term development plans;
(c) had to temporarily abandon proposals for workshop and depot renova-
tion;
(d) was not able to install proper location points for bulk containers;
(e) was not able to introduce proper sanitary landfill disposal tips and
operations;
(f) was not able to reinstate carriageways and footways following drain
cleaning;
1/   Conservative estimates of refuse generated (by weight) in LMA is an
increase of about 11% per year. About 1,050,000 tons of refuse were
generated in 1984.
2/   There is no formal or informal recycling industry for used vehicle
parts or scrap metal. Recently, however, LSWDB has entered into agree-
ment with the new steel processing plant for the purchase of abandoned
vehicles, and many of these have now been cleared.



- 17 -
(g) was not able to adequately replace equipment;
(h) was not able to expand the program for dealing with abandoned
vehicles; and
(i) was not able to expand the industrial waste collection service to
increase revenues.
LSWDB has reached a threshold in its operations and is now in decline. Unless
there is a major investment to address the mounting solid waste problem, the
decline in service will probably accelerate and the positive work done by the
LSWDB in the recent past could be wasted. For example, existing tip sites are
dangerously unsanitary, are burning uncontrollably, and are inefficient be-
cause funds for the purchase of ash, lime and topsoil for cover are not avail-
able. New, better located, tip sites and transfer stations need to be built
that will increase the operating life of the collection vehicles. Investments
in depots and workshops for equipment repair could pay for themselves with
cost savings in a very short time. Not only should LSWDB operations be
expanded to maximize income from the industrial/commercial operations and
provide wider coverage of the city's domestic collection, they should also be
reinforced to increase efficiency, to gradually improve service standards, and
to cope with the spiraling demands that will be placed on LSWDB in the
future. Additional investments in the solid waste disposal program would have
a large impact throughout the city and would not only improve the level of
waste removal and disposal, but would also benefit other subsectors such as
stormdrainage, transportation, etc. The expansion of activities in this
subsector would reactivate many of the stormwater drainage systems, which
would not only reduce the incidence of flooding, but would become an important
factor in implementing water supply as well as sanitation solutions in subse-
quent area upgrading programs.
The Project's Response
2.19     The basic institutional mechanism for expanding the existing solid
waste program and for more broadly spreading its benefits is in place. The
project will provide:
(a) more efficient removal of solid waste from currently served areas,
increasing the level of this service and extending this service to a
greater part of the city;
(b) control of flooding caused by blockage of drains with solid waste by
expanding the drain cleaning and maintenance operation to cover the
entire metropolitan area (currently all secondary streets and roads
are seriously damaged every year by persistent flooding);
(c) strengthening of the institutional capacity of solid waste management,
including financial management and revenue generation; and



- 18 -
(d)  assistance in strengthening local government's capabilities and make
recommendations on the institutional, financial, management, and
technical requirements for strengthening councils in order that
routine maintenance of drains and streets can be taken over by the
councils in the near future.
The following items will be financed under the project (details in item C2 of
the Project File):
(a) specialized refuse collection and handling vehicles and equipment
(requiring standardized chassis);
(b) two solid waste transfer stations;
(c) vehicle maintenance, spares, training, and depots;
(d) rehabilitation and expansion of LSWDB facilities, including the
administrative complex, and the construction of hard standings
(concrete bases) for bulk containers throughout the city;
(e) research and development, including equipment and specialized
advisory assistance; and
(f) staff training, financial and management assistance.
2.20     With the resources proposed above, the Project is designed to provide
considerable improvements in efficiency and service so that by the third year
of the program, within the areas presently served by LSWDB, at least 90% of
refuse then generated could be handled (this is almost a two-fold improvement
over the present service level). In addition to the improved performance in
the areas currently served, the program will extend services to the balance of
Metropolitan Lagos, with varying degrees of service standards. Although it is
difficult to estimate and quantify, the program should provide a basic minimum
service to virtually all of Metropolitan Lagos by the fourth year, and at
least a considerable improvement of service within the densely populated core
area. By adopting new operational systems, substantially improved efficiency
and collection capacity can be expected. A research and development program
to test alternatives for improving future and ongoing unit performance is
expected to further extend the capacity and longevity of the new fleet and the
LSWDB operations in general.
2.21     Collection of Industrial Wastes.  The LSWDB has been collecting solid
industrial wastes since February 1979. By February 1984, 369 premises were
being serviced. LSWDB estimates that by expanding its fleet and capacity,
another 1,500 premises can be brought into the scheme over a four-year period.
The actual revenue from the present industrial collection service was
N 3.4 million in 1984. The LSWDB also estimates the potential income from the
remaining 1,500 premises by the third and fourth year of the project to be
about N 12.4 million. The project includes the equipment and vehicles
required to upgrade industrial waste collection to this maximum potential.

2.22     Private Waste Collection Contractors.  LSWDB subcontracts about
7% of its industrial waste collection to about 16 small-scale contractors
(almost all those that operate in Lagos): In preparing this project, a
detailed analysis of the private sector capability was carried out. The
results show that these private contractors are few, small, and
disorganized. Their operations range from fleets of two to eight vehicles.
There are only two or three of these contractors that have the potential to
efficiently expand their operations. 1/  LSWDB proposes to continue the sub-
contracting arrangements with those firms which demonstrate sound and satis-
factory operating practices. This will be monitored with a view to possibly
expanding the role of these contractors and developing means of increasing
their capability as well as strengthening and expanding their participation.
2.23     Waste Disposal - Transfer Stations.  The LSWDB proposes to install
two transfer points for the haulage of wastes from collection areas to long
distance landfill sites; one would be in Lagos Island to serve Region 1,
Zone 1, and one at Iganiu/Surulere to serve Region 2, Zone 4 (Map 16934 and
item Cl in Project File detailing cost-benefit analysis for this arrangement).
2.24     Physical Plant.  The project will finance depots and workshops in
each of the eight zones in the four proposed regions, and the upgrading of the
existing Iddo Yard headquarters and main workshop. Six proposed new depots or
subdepots are to be constructed and eight existing depots and workshops in-
cluding LSWDB administrative offices are to be refurbished. (The project file
lists the depots, general space requirements, costs, etc.) LSWDB staff pre-
pared preliminary ideas, design briefs and cost estimates for physical re-
quirements; detailed engineering, bills of quantities, specifications and all
bid documents have been completed.
2.25     Drain Cleaning and Maintenance Subcomponent.  Since 1979, when the
LSWDB was first given the responsibility for cleaning and maintaining the
drains of Lagos, it has attempted to offer a service with constantly de-
creasing budgets and increasing demands to extend such service over a wider
area of the city. 2/ Financial constraints prevented LSWDB from purchasing
necessary equipment and engaging sufficient manpower, thereby limiting its
effectiveness. The subcomponent will enable LSWDB to extend service so that
by the fourth year of the project the whole of Metropolitan Lagos will be
covered by a drain maintenance service that should provide appropriate flows
of stormwater. The stormdrain network will have received an initial cleaning
(which requires a major effort because drains are so badly clogged that sub-
1/   The constraints facing these firms are not financial, but rather the
lack of satisfactory management capacity to increase operations. There
have also been serious problems with improper operating practices,
disposal at unauthorized sites, etc.
2/   The predominant type of stormwater drain in Metropolitan Lagos is
the open channel which drains run-off and household sullage. In the more
densely populated areas and business districts, these drains are often
covered with either concrete slabs, iron gratings or timber.

stantial excavation to remove silt and debris built up over years is
necessary).
2.26     The drain cleaning and maintenance program proposed by LSWDB is
considered to be the best way to quickly provide drain cleaning and mainte-
nance for Metropolitan Lagos over a four-year period. However, a gradual
hand-over of the drainage maintenance function to local government councils is
planned. The capabilities of the Local Government Councils are to be assessed
with a view to a phased transfer of drainage maintenance functions, along with
the necessary equipment and manpower, to the councils which could maintain an
acceptable level of service.
2.27     In view of the large proportion of unpaved streets, it is premature
to consider a comprehensive street sweeping service. Also, there is a juris-
dictional question in that many of the main roads are the responsibility of
the Federal Government which operates such a service (although it is, for the
most part, limited to elevated expressways). However, as part of the drain
cleaning program, the maintenance gangs will be made responsible for ensuring
that areas immediately adjacent to drains are kept cleared to enable unre-
stricted flow of water to the drains. Item C2 in the Project File summarizes
costs, equipment and manpower requirements, and indicates the sequence of
drain cleaning operations.
2.28     In the past, drain cleaning operations have involved drastic measures
such as breaking up roads to get access to covered drains and culverts for
cleansing. Once cleansing operations have been completed, little or no rein-
statement works have followed. 1/ The original concept was that reinstatement
would be carried out by the MOWT or the Works Management Board. However, this
has not happened. With current financial and manpower constraints within most
ministries and parastatal agencies, it seems highly unlikely that in the
immediate future proper reinstatement and rehabilitation of drains, will be
carried out unless appropriate capabilities are established within the LSWDB
to undertake such work. To enable proper reinstatement of drains as well as
to monitor construction work on new and existing depots, workshops and
landfill sites, the proposed management structure for the LSWDB includes a
separate Civil Engineering Division (para 3.03) with the capability for doing
most of this work until other ministries can do so.
Stormdrainage Component
2.29     Lagos' topography, heavy rainfall, poor soil infiltration, and high
water table demand that special attention be given to drainage. However, much
of Lagos is inadequately drained or not drained at all. Many of the storm-
drains that do exist are not maintained and are therefore inoperative.
Flooding is also caused by a lack of attention given to drainage in the design
and construction of development projects. Illegal buildings often obstruct
drainage flows. Another factor is institutional: there are a number of
government agencies involved in drainage, but without a clear definition of
responsibilities. Lack of funds and irregular cash flow to ongoing projects
have hindered progress in implementing drainage programs. The result is that
about 8,400 ha (38%) of the city are subject to frequent and often severe
1/   Reconstruction of damaged gutters, grates, paving, etc.

flooding. This results in extremely high recurring damage, expense, congested
pedestrian and vehicular circulation, and hardships for the city's population.
2.30     In 1974, a Master Plan for the stormwater drainage of mainland Lagos
recommended that the existing natural channels draining either to Lagos Lagoon
or the coastal creeks be enlarged and utilized to drain the city. 1/ The plan
proposed six main systems. The then Ministry of Environment and subsequently
MOWT have followed this plan, but progress on its implementation has been slow
mainly because of financial constraints. Works have yet to benefit densely
populated areas such as Mushin and Ajegunle which have severe flooding
problems. Little attention has been given to secondary and tertiary networks
discharging into the primary system. 2/ What maintenance and rehabilitation
of existing drains does take place is sporadic, limited, and without a clear
plan defining responsibilities, especially between local governments and
MOWT. In summary, the drainage needs and priorities for Metropolitan Lagos
are:
(a) early completion of the six major primary systems;
(b)  planned expansion of the drain cleaning and repair program; and
(c)  a program of secondary and tertiary drainage construction.
2.31     The project will assist in the construction of about 26 km of addi-
tions to the basic stormwater drainage network. These primary drains are an
integral part of the overall and ongoing Lagos flood prevention program of the
MOWT and will provide relief to areas of the city now subject to frequent
flooding. The proposal includes the dredging and construction of drains as
detailed and designed by the Mainland Lagos Stormwater Drainage Plan as well
as a rehabilitation program leading to the long-term maintenance of dredged-
earth channels. 3/ The main works are currently being built by MOWT based on
the drainage master plan but only within the limitations of its current bud-
get. This component will serve to accelerate completion of certain essential
parts of the system and help establish the rehabilitation/maintenance
program. These will improve drainage in poorly serviced, high density slum
areas, and will be an important forerunner to secondary and tertiary drainage
works in future area infrastructure projects throughout the city.
2.32     Design and construction work on parts of the major primary system
is ongoing (Map 16934). Parts of the western system (system 6) have been
improved but extensions 6A, 6B, and 6C still have to be completed. Work has

not started on the G/F system serving Ajegunle, a densely populated area which
suffers from severe flooding. Work is proceeding on systems 2.and 5, the
Igbobi Channel, and the Iganmu/Surulere Channel. Detailed designs have been
completed for systems 3 and 4, the Yaba Channel and the Surulere/Ebute-Metta
Channel. In the less critical northern areas, the Ikeja/Shomolu (system 1)
Channel has yet to be built. The fourth five-year plan of LSG calls for the
construction of systems 3, 4, 6A and an additional length of 6E. The project
will finance the most urgently needed segments of the total system that have
not been started. It will also cover only the western half of the city as
follows:
Cost Estimate
System                     Name                   Length (km)   US$ Million
6F                 Ajegunle Channels                   10.75         13.3

Mushin-Odo-Asimowu Channel          10.50         12.3
6A and 6B          Oshodi-Isolo Channels                5.30         13.6
Total                                              26.55        39.2
This represents the balance of main drain construction carried over from the
1981-1985 period, plus system 6A which was part of the 1986-1990 program. The
project will also finance detailed engineering for the other systems scheduled
for that period. By the end of the project, main drains providing flood
relief to over 65% of the city would be built. Funds (about US$3.1 million)
have also been included to provide rehabilitation and desilting of the
existing channels so that the whole system is functional. All the above
include physical and price contingencies.
2.33     Secondary and tertiary stormdrainage networks are also in urgent need
of attention. However, in view of the deficiencies of other infrastructure
and services, such as local street paving and water supply, it is more appro-
priate and economic to have any large-scale program of secondary drainage
provision closely coordinated with programs of integrated improvements. If
done separately, there would be inefficiencies in planning and construction,
as well as disruption caused by construction over a long period. Integrated
infrastructure improvements carried out area-by-area according to need is the
optimal solution to provision of drainage as well as other infrastructure.
However, early completion of the primary systems is a prerequisite to many
other investments and will lead to more efficient operation of existing and
proposed secondary and tertiary networks. Technical assistance funds are
intended to assist LSG in achieving the citywide intersectoral coordination,
more detailed examination of points raised by the MPML, and the design of
future projects, including an integrated infrastructure improvement program.
Rating and Valuation Component
2.34     The property rate is the only major instrument for revenue generation
available to local government councils (LGCs) in Lagos State. Reliable yields
are needed to enable local governments to meet their operations and mainte-
nance responsibilities. Despite a high volume of construction and generally



- 23 -
rising property values in Lagos, the property rate has performed poorly as a
revenue source. Per capita yields in 1984 were only about N 3.
2.35     Poor collection performance has historically been a contributing
factor. In April 1980, LSG established the Lagos State Local Government
Revenue Board (LSLGRB) which absorbed the billing and collection function from
the then 23 LGCs. Property tax collections increased 9% in LSLGRB's first
year of operations but stagnated thereafter. The LSG in July 1985 renamed
LSLGRB the Lagos State Rating Authority (LSRA), giving it overall rating and
valuation responsibilities, while giving back revenue collection responsibil-
ity to the LGCs.
2.36     The principal impediment to increased property tax yields is now the
obsolesence of the fiscal cadastre. The last general revaluation of proper-
ties in central Lagos occurred in 1955, and in the suburban Lagos LGCs in
1973. Due to the state's rapid growth, the majority of properties are not on
the tax rolls. Those that are on the rolls are grossly undervalued. Local
governments have not proven equal to the task of valuation. Among the LGCs
imposing property rates, there are only six qualified valuers (Chartered
Surveyors or equivalent). No standardized criteria for valuation exists.
Assessments are therefore easily challenged and denied.
2.37     As a precondition of the project rating and valuation component, LSG
has agreed to establish the Lagos State Valuation Office (LSVO) within LSRA.
LSVO will assume the valuation functions of all local governments. As a
permanent institution, LSVO will undertake a general revaluation of all urban
properties over a five-year period, and will be responsible for regular up-
dating and periodic general revaluations thereafter.
2.38     LSVO's staff will be drawn from the valuation offices of the LGCs,
with some additional local recruitment as required. Due to the lack of
trained valuers in Lagos, and the inadequacies of existing valuation legisla-
tion and procedures, substantial technical assistance will be required during
LSVO's initial years of operation. Suitably experienced assistance is there-
fore needed to advise on and perform the following tasks:
(a) prepare an organization plan, including job descriptions and skill
requirements for each category of staff;
(b) devise a standardized valuation system, and prepare a procedures
manual and drafts of any legislation required to implement it;
(c) devise and implement a training program for staff to be transferred
or locally hired;
(d) advise on the selection of computer hardware and software required by
the LSVO; and
(e) perform operational functions during the first four years of the
valuation process.



- 24 -
2.39     LSG has agreed that advisory services would be organized under an
acting Chief Valuation Officer who would occupy the LSVO's executive position
over the first four years of LSVO operations. A Chief Valuation officer will
be appointed by January 1, 1986 (para 6.02(b)). A Deputy Chief Valuation
Officer will be in training to assume the executive position at the end of
that period.
Costs and Estimated Yields
2.40     The staffing requirements of the general valuation were estimated
during preappraisal. There are an estimated 160,000 taxable properties in the
State. Sixty thousand of these are now on the rolls but need to be revalued.
The remainder are missing from the rolls and need to be both surveyed and
valued. Based upon estimates of the number of staff days required to survey
and/or value each property, it is estimated that LSVO will require a total of
about 150 staff, with an annual payroll of N 740,000. Approximately 85 staff
will be available for transfer from LGC valuation offices. The majority are
in low-skill positions. Though the net increase in positions should not
exceed 64, the net increase in annual payroll will therefore be about
N 500,000. Once the general valuation is completed, it should be possible to
reduce employment. Lagos' continued rapid growth, along with the need to
perform general revaluations for each LGC at intervals of no greater than five
years, suggest that major reductions would not occur, however.

2.41     Cost of local staff, offices, and office equipment will be borne by
LSG. The loan will finance (a) costs of technical assistance, and (b) foreign
exchange costs of training and equipment required by the LSVO. A total of
250 person-months of local and foreign training and advisory assistance,
representing the equivalent of 5.9 full-time positions over the four year
period, is budgeted. Allocation of manpower within this budget would be left
to the discretion of the chief valuation officer (para 2.39), acting under
detailed terms of reference (Project File, item C10). Details of the compo-
nent's design, proposed organizational structure of the LSVO, and implementa-
tion details are presented in item C2 of the Project File.
2.42     Training costs consist of tuition for staff at local and, in some
instances, foreign institutions, and costs of correspondence courses and
purchase of training materials for middle level staff. Equipment to be
financed for the project consists of vehicles (and spare parts) required to
transport the valuers. Total base costs to be financed by the project are
shown below.

Total                  2.105        3.630      5.735
2.43     The increase in yield resulting from the revaluation will depend upon
the rate imposed and the collection rate achieved by the LGCs. Property rates
are presently 70% of assessed rental value in central Lagos, a rate that
reflects efforts to increase revenues from the 1955 valuations. It is un-
likely that the 70% rate would be politically acceptable if applied to current
values. Using a hypothetical rate of 10% of rental value, a common rate for
recently revalued cities in Nigeria, it is estimated that annual property tax
billings would equal N 56 million. Assuming the LGCs achieved a 75% collec-
tion rate, this would represent an increase in annual property tax collections
of about N 45 million.
Other Training and Institutional Strengthening Components
2.44     The project will include (a) training, management (para 3.03) and
specialized assistance to the LSWDB financial complex to ensure that appro-
priate systems and procedures are installed and made operational; (b) a com-
prehensive training program for its staff; and (c) provisions for the
establishment of a research and development unit. There will be assistance to



- 26 -
the MOWT for preparation of localidrainage plans as well as final engineering
designs and bid documents for other parts of the city's drainage system and
construction supervision. Assistance to Local Governments will be for general
institutional and financial management strengthening, and preparation of
future upgrading projects, including small demonstration projects and pro-
grams. Assistance to the project monitoring team of the Ministry of Works and
Transportation will be for project financial and technical supervision and
preparation of future projects.
2.45     Training.  LSWDB staff and the LSVO staff will benefit from training
programs designed to systematically strengthen staff capacity and incentives.
For LSWDB, training facilities at the administrative offices are to be
improved and professional and subprofessional training programs will be pro-
vided. (Additional technical training, such as vehicle maintenance, will be
included with vehicle and spare parts procurement.) Included are external
and in-house training for managerial, intermediate and clerical/operational
levels, and a system of annual cadetship for junior staff. 1/ These programs
are detailed in item Cll of the Project File. Because of the critical nature
of the financial complex (Accounting and Audit Department), emphasis of the
program will be on strengthening the LSWDB's financial capacity in parallel
with the special financial contractual services that have been proposed to
review the existing financial system and to install modifications (item C7 of
the Project File).
2.46     Funds will be provided for a Training Officer and a full-time
Assistant Training Officer. A total of 49 person-years will be provided for
staff at senior, intermediate, and junior levels to pursue, on a full-time
basis, training courses in Nigeria and, to a limited extent, outside Nigeria
to attain professional and subprofessional qualifications. Most of these
resources will be directed at junior level staff to attain the Ordinary
National Diploma in Accounting at Nigeria Polytechnics. Intermediate level
staff will train at local Polytechnics for the Higher National Diploma while
senior level staff will train abroad or in Nigeria for full professional
qualification in Accounting/Auditing. Training will be provided on the basis
of merit, seniority, and need, and will be between 18 and 24 months in each
case. Full tuition, accommodations and boarding would be provided for
trainees. One senior level, two intermediate level and three clerical level
staff will be eligible for training each year. Two-thirds of the trainees
should be in accounting, and one-third in auditing. Financing will also-be
provided for one senior staff member to attend a brief seminar/refresher
course for a few weeks each year.
2.47     Partially to fill the void to be created by the annual departure of
three clerical staff during the project period, a cadetship program will be
1/   Most training will be done through a number of Nigerian polytechnic
institutes such as the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON)
and the training facilities of LSG.



- 27 -
financed to permit annual recruitment of three lower level staff. Benefi-
ciaries of the program should have a minimum of one G.C.E. "O" level qualifi-
cation and should be clearly interested in accounting or audit work. Cadets
should be admitted to an in-house induction course and closely monitored on
the job and assisted in developing skills.
2.48     In addition, funds for general in-house training in finance, opera-
tions and administration are included. As far as possible, suitable external
trainers will be recruited from time to time to conduct these short training
courses for relevant staff, to supplement training to be arranged by the per-
manent training staff. A minimum of two in-house courses should be held each
year for each of the three areas. From time to time, technical assistance
personnel will also assist in brief teaching assignments as part of their
terms of reference.
2.49     It is anticipated that the quality of staff in LSWDB should improve
significantly, particularly in the financial area, and by 1989 there should be
at least three additional senior level, six intermediate level and nine
clerical level professional and subprofessional trained Nigerian staff. In
addition, the overall quality of accounting systems and procedures should be
improved, as should be the case in other areas of LSWDB operations.
III. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Coordination and Communication.  An area of relative institutional
weakness within LSG is coordination. To help ensure timely implementation
and reporting of all project components, a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) in
the Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT) has been established and will be
maintained for the project's implementation period (para 6.02(a)). This small
team will consist of a project coordinator, a project accountant, a technical
advisor and support staff, all transferred to MOWT from other parts of LSG
(Chart 24957 on page 28). Its objectives are to monitor implementation
progress and assure completion of required tasks/procedures (auditing, timely
completion of loan covenants, etc.) by the implementing agencies and to facil-
itate a coordinated flow of information from these to LSG and IBRD. Procure-
ment and contracting will be monitored by the PCU and it will keep con-
solidated project accounts. Chart 24958 on page 29 illustrates the role of
the PCU in the arrangements for transfer of project funds. The coordinator
will monitor project implementation. To assist the PCU in these tasks, a
Project Implementation Committee will be established with representatives of
the Lagos State implementing agencies. This committee would have the ability
to resolve implementation problems should they arise and provide the PCU with
assistance in specific areas as needed. In addition, a Monitoring Committee
will oversee implementation of the project. The PCU's main job will be to
keep the project on schedule, ensure adequate supervision, and oversee the
preparation of future project proposals. Direct implementing responsibility,
however, will be with LSWDB (solid waste), MOWT (main drainage), and MLG
(rating and revaluation).

A.   The Lagos State Waste Disposal Board
3.02     The LSWDB executive function rests withi the Chairman, who reports to
the Commissioner of the MOWT. The LSWDB has four divisions headed by
directors as follows: (a) operations; (b) maintenance; (c) finance; and
(d) administration, and a present staff of about 2,900. The project will
substantially increase its operations. To do so, the LSWDB proposes a con-
siderable reorganization and a new management approach which will strengthen
the LSWDB staffing (para 6.02(c)). It has also agreed that all the necessary
staff to efficiently implement the proposed project will be contracted over
the five year period. 1/ Under a previous management contract between 12 and
24 key positions were staffed by expatriate specialists. But while LSWDB has
had difficulty in recruiting qualified staff for certain specialized positions
in the past, it has recently appointed a new Board of Directors and is taking
a more aggresive approach to finding qualified Nigerian managers. These will,
however, require expert assistance in the early phases of the project and
considerable specialized training. For example, the main weaknesses of the
financial complex are the lack of systems and the staff (accountants) to
implement them. However, there have been recent improvements in this area.
Following the IBRD recommendation during preparation, a vigorous recruitment
program was started and five mid-level positions within the financial complex
have been filled. Through the project, the Finance Division will be further
strengthened so that it may properly manage the financial affairs of LSWDB,
monitor project implementation, and carry out full financial management of the
Board. In addition, it was agreed with LSG that sufficient staff vacancies
would be filled by January 1, 1986, to carry out the project efficiently
(para 6.02(c)). The technical assistance component has also been designed to
improve the accounting systems to a minimum acceptable standard of financial
performance.
3.03     Proposed LSWDB Organization.  The appraisal and renegotiation
missions discussed these management/staffing requirements and agreed that a
new management and staffing proposal would be presented to the Bank, for
implementation by January 1, 1986 (para 6.02(d)). A draft organization and
staffing plan has already been received (July 1985). Among the features of a
new management and staffing plan, it is expected that a Corporate Planning
Department will be established to strengthen planning and evaluation and to
develop LSWDB policy-making functions; a Civil Engineering Division will be
established to improve maintenance performance and generate a set of drainage
records. The division will be headed by a qualified civil engineer as an
assistant general manager, with suitable support staff, namely a director of
civil engineering, an assistant director, and experienced technicians/clerks
of works. Two subdivisions are envisaged, one being responsible for drainage
matters and the other for depots, workshops, etc. In addition, each division
will be supported by a small survey section whose primary tasks will be to set
1/   The majority of this staff increment is for the expanded industrial
waste operations (640) and drain cleaning (690). The latter is planned
to be transferred from LSWDB to local councils.

up a system of drainage records by surveying and recording drainage details on
record plans as drains are identified and cleaned, as well as to render assis-
tance, as necessary, in identifying, surveying and supervising works at new
and existing LSWDB sites. The Civil Engineering Division will maintain close
contact with the drain cleaning section within the Operations Division to
ensure that reinstatement and recording of drains is coordinated with prior
cleaning. A further task of the Civil Engineering Division will be to advise
the Operations Division on dredging and possible engineering requirements for
main drainage channels to ensure that the two dredgers recently acquired by
the LSWDB are used effectively. The new structure constitutes a major reor-
ganization and a substantial strengthening of the middle management staff.
This is expected to provide on-the-job training of next-in-line managers so
that they may be phased into the management positions. A preliminary draft of
the proposed LSWDB reorganization and its implementation plan were reviewed at
negotiations. The proposed reorganization and reforms should strengthen some
of LSWDB's past weaknesses: its dependence on monthly budgetary allocations;
its failure to go beyond stop-gap actions; and its lack of operation planning,
appraisal, and evaluation.
3.04     LSWDB has already established new departments (in line with the re-
structuring plan) to manage collections and arrears more effectively and to
improve operating procedures. These reforms are sensible and appropriate
improvements.
3.05     LSWDB Personnel.  While the administrative areas, especially in the
financial complex, are understaffed, the number and quality of operational
staff appear adequate in relation to current operational volumes. The total
number of regular personnel in LSWDB is 2,870, and of these about 160 are pro-
fessional staff, mostly engineers, managers, and inspectors. LSWDB also con-
tracts additional part-time personnel. In the past, a substantial number of
permanent lower-level staff were kept on contract, but nearly all have been
integrated into the regular personnel system over the last two years.
3.06     LSWDB, as a parastatal, is bound by civil service salary restrictions
and cannot pay fully competitive salaries. It may, however, have to resort to
a system of bonuses to attract good staff despite relatively low nominal sal-
aries. Even with bonuses, salaries would probably be below those of the pri-
vate sector, thus adversely affecting recruitment possibilities. As part of
LSWDB's current restructuring, proposals are to be developed with a view to
improvement in this area.
B.   The Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT)
3.07     The MOWT is charged with all water, sewerage, and drainage (storm-
water and flood prevention) service for the State. MOWT undertakes planning,
policy, design, implementation and maintenance of programs and projects. Two
main parastatal boards have been established to do this: the Lagos State
Waste Disposal Board and the Lagos State Water Corporation. The two main
sections of MOWT are Water Operations/Projects, which is a support function to
the Water Corporation, and Sewerage and Drainage Section, which has as its
main responsibility implementation of the Drainage and Deflooding Program.



- 32 -
The entire MOWT including this section is undergoing a reorganization. At
present it is understaffed. However, for the short-term (and for the imple-
mentation of the stormdrainage component of this project), the MOWT can and
will continue to operate under this structure. Although there are staffing
constraints, these should not adversely affect the components' implementa-
tion. All engineering and tendering documents have been completed, using
external consultants. Provisions have been made for contracting works' super-
vision to consultants and the PCU will include technical assistance to help
MOWT oversee and monitor the components' implementation. Similarly, mainte-
nance of primary and secondary drains are done by contracting firms.
3.08     Organization and Operations.  A contributory factor to the flooding
and general drainage problems in the city is the fact that the many agencies
involved in drainage neither coordinate activities nor follow a comprehensive
drainage plan. Although the MOWT has overall responsibility for drainage,
flood relief and erosion control, and it designs and supervises implementation
of projects, Local Government Councils are responsible for maintenance of
drains and also carry out minor drainage works. However, they have neither
the technical nor financial capacity to do so effectively. The Federal
Government also carries out some drainage works in Lagos.
3.09     An integrated Metropolitan Drainage Authority under the Commissioner
of Works has been suggested so that a clear definition of drainage responsi-
bilities would be established. This Drainage Authority would develop appro-
priate legislation regarding drainage of new (and existing) development pro-
jects, together with guidelines and standards for this drainage. The creation
and development of such an authority will be studied as part of the project.
C.   Implementation Schedule
3.10     The project will be implemented over a five-year period:  FY86-
FY91. Monitoring targets, key indicators, and key implementation dates (which
were revised and confirmed by LSWDB management during loan negotiations) are
in C14 of the Project File. A "project launch" exercise would be programmed
when implementation starts, where all participating agencies and relevant
State and Federal Authorities would be brought together to agree on their
respective roles, responsibilities, and a timetable of critical steps.
3.11     A letter of allocation for the land for the project's depots, trans-
fer stations and tip sites was presented by LSG at negotiations indicating
that certificates of occupancy are being prepared and will be issued. 1/ De-
tailed engineering and contract documents for all civil works is to be com-
pleted.
1/   All land for the project is presently State-owned, most tracts to be
used by LSWDB for the project have already been transferred to LSWDB.



- 33 -
3.12     Status of Project Preparation and Implementation.  Despite initial
delays due primarily to a change in government in December 1983, and the
subsequent reassessment of state investment priorities, preparation for the
proposed project is now well-advanced. A Project Coordination Unit has been
formally established in the MOWT and a Project Coordinator appointed in
July 1985. Additional technical staff are to be appointed before
January 1, 1986. LSWDB is, since November 1984, fully staffed by Nigerians
and performing well despite financial constraints. A draft management and
staffing plan was submitted to the Bank in July 1985, outlining key organiza-
tional restructuring needs and staff vacancies which will form the basis of a
training and technical assistance needs assessment. Detailed designs and
tender documents for stormdrainage and building works have been prepared and
reviewed by the Bank and, with only minor modifications, can be tendered.
Land for the various project sites has either been acquired or is in the
process of being surveyed prior to final conveyance (estimated by
October 1985). Bidding documents for the bulk of vehicles and other equipment
to be procured have been reviewed and revised. LSWDB has placed orders for
emergency spare parts which are eligible for retroactive financing. Terms of
reference for key personnel and assignments have been drafted and agreed. In
addition the Nigerian Management of the LSWDB has, since November 1984, done
an impressive job of maintaining operations and standards of collection,
especially in light of the deteriorating fleet of vehicles. In addition to
the actions described above, as of July, 1985, LSG has made progress on
meeting the dates specified in paras 6.01 and 6.02: candidates for Chief
Valuation Officer have been short-listed; LSWDB has been recruiting additional
staff; and has started staffing the Project Coordinating Unit
D.   Procurement
3.13     In the past, MOWT did most of its construction by force account but,
recently, the institution's procurement policies have been reformulated. The
present preference is to rely primarily on local competitive bidding and MOWT
has agreed to comply with the Bank's ICB procedures where appropriate. The
Bank's procurement norms will apply to the whole project. Procurement ar-
rangements are summarized on the following pages.
3.14     The project consists of goods, works and services; no financial cost of
land acquisition is involved. The total cost amounting to US$164.3 million
comprises goods and equipment totaling approximately US$63.7 million; civil works
US$75.1 million, including transfer station equipment; and institutional support
US$25.5 million. These estimates include physical and price contingencies.
3.15     Goods.  Vehicles and equipment to the value of US$63.7 million will
be procured by LSWDB on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with IBRD guidelines. Civil engineering equipment and a car
crusher (approximately US$3.6 million) will be divided into three contracts,
but the balance of the equipment consisting mainly of refuse collection
vehicles will be bid in larger packages. LSWDB, for reasons based on opera-
tional experience, would like to confine the vehicle chassis to no more

than two manufacturers. Accordingly, three separate contract bids will
probably be called for the first one (small) to test the market, followed by
two additional packages incorporating the experience gained in the first round
of bidding. The documents will be flexible and allow for (a) chassis manufac-
turers to bid incorporating vehicle bodies obtained from other suppliers; or
(b) vehicle body manufacturers to bid including chassis obtained from another
supplier. Alternatively, bids may be submitted separately based on chassis or
bodies only, with assembly left to the discretion of the body builders.
Domestic manufacturers will be given a preference margin of 15% or the appli-
cable customs duties only, whichever is the lowest. A package of equipment
totaling US$11.6 million has been identified as equipment which is suitable
for cofinancing. Tenders will be called along with proposals for cofinancing.
Both price and financing terms will be evaluated to select the most suitable
contract.
3.16     Light cars and motorcycles, estimated to cost US$1.7 million, will be
tendered on the basis of international competitive bidding; however, it is
likely that these would be won by domestic manufacturers. Miscellaneous
equipment, totaling estimated US$0.8 million and required for the research and
development program, will be purchased by local procedures acceptable to IBRD.
3.17     Works.  Contracts for the construction of the two transfer stations
(US$7.8 million) and drainage works, estimated to cost approximately
US$39.2 million, will be let under ICB procedures in accordance with IBRD
guidelines. The other civil engineering works required by LSWDB (depots,
landfill sites and hardstandings) amounting to US$24.8 million and the earth
drain rehabilitation component, amounting to approximately US$3.2 million (to
be bid biannually) will be procured in accordance with local bidding proce-
dures acceptable to IBRD. Seven to eight contracts will be let in this way.
These comprise a large number of the contracts over the four-year period which
are not likely to exceed US$300,000 each. There are a large number of local
contractors capable of successfully bidding on these and it is unlikely that
foreign bidders will be interested. However, local procedures do not exclude
foreign contractors. The stormdrain cleaning and maintenance program will be
carried out by LSWDB under force account, using permanent departmental forces
that have been doing this work over the past two years.
3.18     Institutional Support.  The main thrust of the project is to bring
three of LSG key institutions to an appropriate level of operations and to
provide the support to sustain that level of output. The support provided
through the project is of three types: (a) advisory and training services
(totaling about 770 months of foreign and local expertise); (b) the costs of
local and overseas training programs; and (c) contractual services to supple-
ment implementation activities of the participating agencies. The latter
includes detailed design engineering and supervision of future drainage
systems and future project design which would be more efficient to contract to
the private sector. The total cost of this support and related equipment,
vehicles and studies, is US$25.5 million including all contingencies (Procure-
ment Table on previous page). Advisory and contractual services would be pro-
cured either individually or collectively through firms, on terms and condi-
tions acceptable to the Bank. Item C15 of the Project File details the
breakdown of assistance and its cost.



- 36 -
3.19     Undoubtedly, the sum of US$25.5 million for institutional support is
high. However, US$21.8 million (72%) of this is for just two items: the
LSWDB management training and implementing the rating and valuation compo-
nent. Both of these items relate to the core aspects of both training and
running the operations, rather than the more usual peripheral assistance.
However, local capability has to be built up in a learn-by-doing approach to
carry out these two vital services which will collapse completely (solid
waste) or never get started (revaluation) without substantial expert
support. This need for support is acknowledged by LSG, but has been scaled
back to the minimum, even at the risk of being too lean. At the same time,
substantial training is the fundamental objective.
3.20     Contract Prior Review.  All bidding packages for ICB contracts or
works estimated to cost more than US$2.0 million equivalent, and bidding
packages for goods over US$500,000 equivalent, will be subject to the Bank's
prior review of procurement documentation. The balance of contracts would be
subject to ex-post review by the Bank after contract award.

3.21     Proceeds of the Bank loan will be disbursed as follows:
(a)  42% of total expenditures for materials and civil works for depots
and workshops, transfer stations and tip sites including engineering
design and supervision, and 18% of expenditures for civil works for
main stormdrainage;
(b) 70% of total expenditure for technical assistance and training;
(c) 100% of the CIF cost of directly imported vehicles, equipment and
spare parts; and
(d) 80% of ex-factory costs of locally manufactured goods procured
through local shopping or local bidding.
3.22     Disbursements in respect to expenditures incurred for (a) civil works
under contracts, (b) technical assistance, and (c) training will be made
against fully documented withdrawal applications. Disbursements in respect to
expenditures incurred for (i) civil works under force account and (ii) engi-
neering design and supervision carried out by in-house staff will be made
against Statements of Expenditures certified by LSWDB, MOWT, or the PCU.
Documentation supporting the Statements of Expenditures will be retained by
LSWDB, MOWT, and PCU, and made available for inspection by the Bank during the
course of supervision missions.
3.23     A schedule of estimated disbursements is presented as Annex 3.  It
assumes a normal average lag of six months between expenditures and Bank
reimbursement. The closing date of the loan would be December 31, 1990,
assuming, on the basis of other projects in Nigeria, that final disbursements
would be made up to a year after the expected completion date of the project.



- 37 -
Retroactive financing of US$4.0 million would cover some stormdrainage and
equipment expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness (para 2.09).
3.24     The estimated disbursement period of five years is shorter than the
average for urban projects Bankwide (eight years), or for all projects in
Nigeria (eight and one-half years). 1/ The proposed project was designed,
taking these past experiences into account, to be implemented in less time.
The disbursement profile of the proposed project is similar to that for com-
parable project components (civil works, equipment) in the Bauchi Urban
Project (Loan 1767-UNI), as indicated in Annex 3. It is relatively uncom-
plicated and risk-free compared to many of the Bank's earlier urban
projects. Two major components (90% of the loan) are extensions of ongoing
programs by established institutions. About 45% of the loan is for procure-
ment of goods; 15% for consultants. Start-up delays, which have been frequent
in other projects, should be largely avoided by the use of a "project launch
exercise" (para 3.10), and the Project Coordinator and implementation con-
sultants (para 3.01) should help to minimize disbursement delay. Recent
experience in Nigeria is that projects like this one, which rely on local
counterpart finances, have been substantially delayed. However, LSG's
financial position is relatively strong (para 4.04) and measures such as the
quarterly counterpart advance deposits into project accounts and the revolving
fund (para 2.12) have been taken to ensure timely availability of project
funds. In addition, 90% of civil engineering design and tender documents have
been finalized.
F.   Accounting and External Audit
3.25     At present, there is limited accounting information for LSWDB.
Income and expenditure statements are prepared at irregular intervals by the
Financial Controller and budgets are prepared annually. Audited financial
statements for the year to March 31, 1979, were prepared in September 1979,
and for the nine months to December 31, 1980, were prepared in August 1982.
The Government's financial year-end was changed in 1980 from March 31 to
December 31, hence the odd period of nine months in 1980. The 1982 auditors'
reports were critical of the state of the accounts, indicating that they were
inadequate and that the bank statements were not being reconciled. LSWDB
accounts were last reviewed by a Bank mission in July 1985.
3.26     Billings and Collections.  Total billings for the industrial wastes'
collection service were about N 3.6 million in 1982. At the end of October
1982, total arrears were N 0.7 million, of which about 70% appeared to be
collectible. Arrears have since declined, but so have actual revenue collec-
tions, to N 3.4 million in 1984. This is a reasonable situation which will be
kept under review both as part of the proposed management reporting system and
normal project monitoring. The billing and collection system will itself be
reviewed under the proposed review of all accounting systems.
1/   The ongoing Bauchi urban project in Nigeria, (FY80) estimated to be
completed in five years, is not substantially behind schedule,
considering initial delays prior to disbursements.



- 38 -
3.27     Financial Control.  At the present time, there is a serious
deficiency in financial control brought about largely by a deficiency in
financial staff and systems. In December 1984, 32 out of 67 positions in the
finance division were vacant. Five of these were recently filled including
that of Chief Accountant and three section heads. In due course, all of these
positions should be filled. In addition to this, LSWDB is proposing to fill
five additional positions from the management contract for periods of 24 to 36
months (para 3.03). It has been agreed that a technical assistance program is
to be started consisting of 48 consultant-months of accounting and financial
management system design, implementation and training. This program will
assist in project implementation and produce a full management reporting
system for the proper monitoring of operations, as well as project progress.
Draft terms of reference for this are Item C7 of the Project File.
3.28     External Audit.  MOWT, MLG and LSWDB will keep separate accounts for
project components under their respective responsibilities. LSG would arrange
for the accounts of these bodies to be audited by auditors acceptable to the
Bank (para 6.02(g)). The Project Coordination Unit of the MOWT would also
keep separate accounts of all project expenditures which will be reconciled
with those of the respective implementing authorities and be audited by
auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audited accounts, together with the
auditors' report, will be submitted to the Bank within four months of the
close of the financial year. These audits would explicitly include a review
of the Statements of Expenditures (SOE) submitted to the Bank conveying the
auditors' opinion on the methodology employed in the compilation of the SOE,
and on their accuracy, the relevance of the supporting documents, eligibility
for financing in terms of the project's legal agreements, and the standard of
record keeping and internal controls.
G.   Planning and Budgeting
3.29     Planning is an area of institutional weakness for LSWDB and MOWT.
Traditionally, both institutions have only maintained annual budgets, with
virtually no forward financial planning. However, this is the case for all
LSG agencies. Individual projects seem to have been launched by top manage-
ment without much preliminary planning or appraisal. While this approach may
be more feasible as a priority for keeping costs down, it has, in the past,
occasioned several significant implementation constraints.
3.30     Perhaps the most important aspect of project preparation was the
elaboration of reliable financial projections that have allowed LSWDB and LSG,
in consultation with IBRD, to identify several financial problems and appro-
priate steps that will ensure their financial stability during this period of
transition.
3.31     Two covenants of the loan agreement will support further improvements
in LSWDB/LSG planning. First, LSWDB has agreed to establish an adequate
system of financial management information by January 1, 1986, and exchange
views with the IBRD, at least annually thereafter, about any changes in
LSWDB's financial projections and measures being taken to maintain a healthy



- 39 -
financial position (para 6.02(f).  Second, it will, by March 31, 1986, provide
IBRD with a financial policy for the institution as a whole (para 6.02(e)).
The ultimate objective is to make LSWDB self-finanicng. However, this may not
be possible before 1991 and in the interim period LSWDB must be assured of
adequate financial resources from LSG to meet both capital and recurrent
expenditures and debt servicing requirements.
H. Monitoring and Evaluation
Project Execution
3.32     On the basis of monthly reports for MOWT, LSWDB, and MLG, the project
coordinator of the PCU would prepare an overall reports on the project each
month, to be distributed to relevant officials within LSG. He would also
prepare quarterly reports to IBRD, comparing actual progress to physical and
financial targets agreed during loan negotiations (item C14 in Project File).
Project Impact Evaluation
3.33     Monitoring of project will be primarily the responsibility of the
project coordinator and technical staff of the PCU and the MOWT, which will be
assisted by the implementation committee. This group will take the lead in
evaluating the impact of this project in relation to its stated objectives
(Key Indicators, item C14 in Project File). Preliminary terms of reference
for project impact evaluation are included in item C14 of the Project File.
Evaluation reports will be forwarded to the Bank, at least annually, reviewing
the project's impact and perhaps suggesting modifications in project design.
Together, the implementing agencies and the project manager's team will,
within six months of the last IBRD disbursement, prepare a project completion
report.
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Introduction
4.01     The financial analysis of this project is dependent upon a perception
of appropriate operational and financial responsibility for the services
concerned. Legally, solid wastes and drainage services are Local Government
Councils' responsibilities, to be carried out under State law. The sharing of
financial responsibility for these services is also a matter for State law.
It is appropriate and customary for financial responsibility for these
services to be wholly or mainly that of the local authorities. Industrial and
commercial waste collection is usually charged for, with the remaining costs
falling upon general revenues.
4.02     In practice, neither the operational nor the financial responsibility
is being borne by local councils in Lagos (para 1.10). Thus, the principal
operational and financial burden is falling upon the State, either directly or



- 40 -
through LSWDB. Charges are, however, being levied for the removal of indus-
trial and commercial wastes.
4.03     Because the residual financial burden of present operations and of
the project will be borne by the State government for the foreseeable future,
it is first necessary to examine the financial position of the State govern-
ment. Following this, an analysis will be made of the financial situation of
the local councils and of the LSWDB.
B.   Lagos State Finances
4.04     Primarily because almost 75% of its total revenue is generated
locally (proportionally ten times or more than other States), Lagos State has
weathered well the recent declines in oil prices and fall in revenues. With
total actual revenues of N 508 million in 1984, the State was able to cover
all its recurrent expenditures and had N 88 million for capital expendi-
tures. Personal income taxes have consistently accounted for the bulk of its
resources, amounting to under 35% on average. A decision in 1983 to implement
a sales tax of 10% statewide increased revenues somewhat (by about 5%).
Approximately 65% of total revenues have financed recurrent expenditures over
the past five years (mainly in education and health). The bulk of capital
outlays have been on education, urban development and planning, health and
sewerage/drainage. Since 1983, capital expenditures have declined dramati-
cally, from N 189 million to N 88 million in 1984, and projected to be
N 110 million in 1985.
4.05     Financial prospects for Lagos State are good, especially since the
introduction of the sales tax. Total capital expenditures under the Fourth
Economic Plan are likely to be in the order of N 2,000 million between 1981
and 1985 (table on page 8). Water supply is expected to account for almost
one quarter of this expenditure, followed by transport (about 21%). The State
has not been able to finance its entire Fourth Plan, nor has it done so in
previous planning periods. The State's actual capital expenditure has ranged
from 20% to 70% of its planned expenditure in the recent past. This has come
about in two ways: first, logistical impediments have delayed implementation
of individual projects, and second, implementable projects have been scaled
down or delayed to match the availability of funds. This will probably prove
to be the case during the Fifth Plan period as well. Since 1984, State
budgeting has been more realistic in estimating capital expenditures. Thus,
the State should have funds to cover its recurrent expenditures and its most
important capital projects. The scope of these expenditures will, to a large
extent, depend on oil revenues and the State's ability to continue to sustain
its high rate of internal resource generation.
4.06     The solid waste and drainage project is likely to have a significant
impact on the State's finances. The project is estimated to require a total
State contribution of approximately N 110 million between 1985 and 1990. This
includes capital costs of N 60.5 million and incremental recurrent expendi-
tures of N 48.2 million. Much of the incremental recurrent expenditures
represent depreciation costs for assets to be replaced (vehicles, equipment,
buildings). However, these projections do not take into account incremental
revenues (on the order of N 45 million per year) from the rating and valuation



- 41 -
component. In the most likely scenario, this would require a commitment of
5.5% of the State's and Local Government's combined surpluses for capital
expenditures during the project construction years of 1986 to 1990. The
project is likely to have its major cost impact in 1988 when about 10% of the
surplus for capital expenditures would be required. However, given the policy
and institutional significance the project will have for State and Local
Governments in the State, and the prospects for an even larger generation of
internal finance, the project's payoff would more than warrant the temporary
strains that may result in the initial years of implementation. The table on
the following page details the most likely scenario for the State and Local
Governments' finances. During negotiations, it was agreed that LSG will
provide the necessary funds to LSWDB to enable its operating account to break
even and to provide the local capital cost financing of the project (para
6.02(h).
4.07     Local Government Finances.  Local authorities are financed from State
and Federal grants and from locally generated resources. Approximately one-
third of total revenues is being generated from each source. Local revenues
have been derived mainly from property taxes, trading licenses, and market
fees. Property taxes have consistently accounted for 35% of total local
revenues. Public works (mainly roads) and health have accounted for the bulk
of capital expenditure, while personnel emoluments have represented about 25%
of total recurrent outlays in the last several years. The effect of the
project on local government finances is minimal during the project construc-
tion period despite higher project local government contributions to LSWDB.
These are more than offset by the projected transfers of 10% of the Lagos
State's internally generated revenues to LGAs beginning in 1986 (see table on
following page).
4.08     No account is taken of financial benefits resulting from improvements
and updating of the present Valuation Lists which would occur at the same time
as (and as a result of) preparation work for the revaluation. The rating and
revaluation exercise might well generate some N 70 to N 100 million of
incremental revenues for local authorities between 1988 and 1992, depending on
the level of the rate struck and the promptness with which the exercise is
carried out. If timely, the cost of the exercise might be fully recovered as
early as 1988. 1/ This improved financial base would provide the stepping-
stone for the provision of better services to be provided by local authorities
in subsequent operations, with appropriate LSG assistance, including possible
improvements in infrastructure and area upgrading.
C.   Lagos State Waste Disposal Board
4.09     LSWDB has been established and is run in the manner of a public util-
ity enterprise. However, because much of the revenue for the LSWDB services
comes from taxes and grants, standard public utility financial analysis is
1/   New rolls will probably not come into use until 1987-88; however,
some areas could be rated earlier (para 2.35(d)).

inappropriate. In particular, measures customarily applied to monitor revenue
earning performance (e.g., rates of return or cash generation indicators) are
virtually meaningless. What must be done, instead, is to establish the funds
requirements for LSWDB to operate efficiently and to continually replace and
expand its equipment. Following this, objective measures can be established
as targets which must be maintained by the timely allocation of appropriate
funds. The ultimate objective is to make LSWDB self-financing, but this may
not be possible before 1991.
4.10     Because of the above constraints, a useful way of looking at LSWDB
finances would be to consider operational revenues as comprising only the
direct service charges and the contributions from local councils. State
Government subventions would thus be considered as non-operational revenues.
This somewhat arbitrary framework will at least serve to highlight the extent
to which local councils are meeting their implied financial obligations, stem-
ming from their legal responsibilities, after allowing for direct user charges.
LSWDB: Past Performance and Present Position
4.11     LSWDB's total assets had grown from zero in 1978 to about
N 10.7 million by year-end 1982. Its major source of income has consistently
been State grants. A relatively minor source has been local government con-
tributions which were diverted and paid by the State for services rendered.
Revenues from these two sources have generally accounted for the largest part
of total LSWDB income. Since 1980, user charges have been imposed for the
collection of industrial wastes. These totaled N 1.4 million in 1980,
N 3.6 million in 1982, and N 3.4 million in 1984. The Board's major item of
expenditure has always been personnel emoluments, accounting for some 50% to
60% of operating costs on average over the past three years. Costs of opera-
tions totaled N 8.3 million in 1982, N 11.4 million in 1983, and
N 10.6 million in 1984. LSWDB has to date been unable to make a net profit in
Any year of its operations, and had a negative cash balance of N 1 million at
the beginning of 1985.
4.12     The level of future performance will depend upon the extent to which
LSG carries out the necessary remedial measures. The most important of these
are (a) to review the accounting systems, to design a financial management
system, and to implement these as soon as possible, and (b) to appoint staff
of the right quality and in sufficient quantity to be trained to carry out
these systems.
4.13     The table on the following page presents a summary analysis of
LSWDB's projected financial statements with and without the project over and
beyond the project period. This shows that the project will cause increasing
strains on the Board's financial resources, although the rate of increase
starts decreasing in 1988. While it is expected to sustain a loss each year
through 1990, LSWDB's capacity to generate internal resources between 1984 and
1990 will increase almost sixfold as a result of the expanded flow of income
resulting from the project. Total revenues are expected to increase from
N 5.7 million in 1984 to N 31.6 million in 1990. Total annual operating costs
should, however, nearly double from N 10.6 million to N 19.8 million over the
project period, primarily as a result of the increased level of operations
induced by the project. Therefore, LSWDB will continue to depend heavily on
State grants until at least 1992 to cover recurrent costs which will range

Future Financial Performance
4.14     Detailed Financial Projections of LSWDB.  Income Statements, Flow of
Funds, Balance Sheets, and Assumptions for Financial Analysis are shown in
Annex 4. These include historical information for 1981, budgeted information
for 1985, estimates for 1983 and 1984, and forecasts through 1992, as
discussed below.
4.15     Income Statement.  There are two main sources of income, as follows:
(a) Operating Revenues which consist of:
(i)   Local Government Contributions.  These are grant monies payable
by Lagos State Government (LSG) to local governments which are
diverted by LSG and paid to the Board as a contribution towards
the cost of domestic waste collection;
(ii)  Industrial Wastes' Billings  (Service Charges).  These are
described in para I of Annex 4 and are making an increasing
contribution to the Board's revenues in excess of the cost of
service; and
(iii) Other Operational Revenue. These incomes include charges for
dumping and other services.
(b)  Non-Operating Revenue (State Grants).  This is the State grant
payable each year to LSWDB to balance its operating costs. It is an
increasingly large amount each year although, in real terms, at pro-
jected rates of inflation, it remains fairly constant (see following
table).

4.16     Operating Costs.  These have been assessed by the Board and analyzed
under suitable headings with appropriate adjustments to allow for an increased
and more efficient level of operations, and with an overall growth of 15%
decreasing to 10% in 1988 and onwards. Taking the large LSG grants into
account, LSWDB is projected to operate at just over a break-even point.

4.17     In 1990, at the end of the project construction period and on the
basis of numbers of staff, the following table shows the cost of services and
level of payments:

Total                   49.9        100     50.7        100
This table demonstrates that the industrial waste service will collect 40% of
the income as opposed to 18% of expenditure, whereas the domestic waste and
drainage service will collect 21% of the income from local governments as
opposed to 82% of expenditure. The LSG grant will provide the other 39% of
income. It is therefore towards the local governments that attention is being
directed to obtain a much higher cost recovery. Chapter II of this report
discusses assistance to local governments in the valuation of properties,
updating of valuation rolls, and better collection of a more realistic pro-
perty tax to assist in higher cost recovery.
4.18     To the extent that it is meaningful, the rate of return on average
revalued net fixed assets is negative throughout, but this merely reflects the
low level of direct contributions from the local governments. In the event
that the LSG grant could be replaced by payments by local governments for the
domestic waste and the drainage services, the rate of return in 1990, the last
year of project construction, would be positive. A covenant on revaluation of
assets by the LSWDB was agreed to at negotiations (para 6.02(i)). While local
governments are not in a financial position at present to significantly con-
tribute to LSWDB operations, they should be by the end of the project period
if the reforms instituted in the project are successful. The operating ratio
is unsatisfactory throughout, due to the low level of operational revenues,
defined as excluding State grants.
4.19     Flow of Funds.  Given the arbitrary structure of the income statement
and allowing for State grants as an incoming funds flow, including coverage
for depreciation, the following three indicators are all satisfactory as
follows:
(a) Debt Service Ratio. This should be at a minimum of 1.5%. After
project construction, it is always in excess of this, indicating
adequate resources from which to pay the debt service; and
(b) Percent Contribution to Investment. Because of the high annual
depreciation rate, 20% for vehicles and plant, which covers about 80%
of the assets, there is a high level of internal cash generation and
this provides all the investment needs in the years after 1989 when
project construction is completed. Most of this future investment is
for the replacement of vehicles and the cash generated must be kept
for this purpose.



- 47 -
(c) Balance Sheet. The current ratio and the debt-to-debt plus equity
ratio are both satisfactory.
4.20     Financing Plan.  About 53% of the LSWDB project cost will be financed
by the Bank loan, approximately 12% by cofinancing, and 35% by LSG capital
grants. The Bank loan would be onlent to the Board for 20 years with a five
year grace period, variable interest rate (currently 8.82%) and a commitment
charge of 0.75%. Details of the loan are shown in Annex 4, Table 7. The
cofinancing loan is assumed to be lent for eight years at 11%. Details are
shown in Annex 4, Table 8.
4.21     Monitoring Indicators.  These are indicators which will assist in the
monitoring of project implementation and the Board's performance and are shown
in Annex 4.
V. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
5.01     While the principal benefits to be derived from the project will be
improvements in the overall efficiency of waste management (better collection
and disposal of refuse) and drainage (reduced flooding) in Metropolitan Lagos,
a number of other distinct benefits will also accrue. These include reduc-
tions in health hazards, in flood damage to private and public property, and
in erosion, particularly to roads. Removal of waste from public right-of-ways
will also reduce traffic, accidents, and delays.  The technical assistance and
training package is designed to strengthen the institutions charged with
implementation and to provide improved service and maintenance even as the
city grows and demands placed on these institutions increase. By improving
the management and operating capacity of LSWDB and MOWT, the project would be
crucial to the State's ability to upgrade other services in the future
(e.g., public transport, water supply), and to strengthen its presently
serious lack of capacity to maintain its physical investments. While incre-
mental direct employment is not likely to be high, the generally improved
access in the city and the removal of threats of flooding, stagnant sullage
water and concentrations of waste should stimulate private development.
5.02     The revalued property roll and revised rating structure will provide
a major increment to internally generated State and local government resources.
Improved services, particularly in the areas of education and health, are
likely to be accorded high priority in the utilization of the additional
resources to be raised. Above all, financially stronger Local Governments are
likely to improve the State's capacity for improving badly needed basic infra-
structure and poorly provided maintenance services under subsequent operations.
A.   Economic Evaluation
5.03     While it is obvious that a project of this nature will have a very
high economic rate of return, the measurement of aggregate benefits is quite
difficult, requiring a major study and comparison of baseline conditions with
conditions after project execution. Nevertheless, it is possible to estimate
the order of magnitude of the rate of return for the solid waste and drainage



- 48 -
elements of the project package. No attempt was made to estimate the ERRs for
the Rating and Valuation component or for technical assistance for future
project preparation, both of which are independent of the solid waste and
drainage components. Therefore, a study was made of those two main components
and all related technical assistance and training which have relatively
discrete and measurable benefits and costs and attempt to assess their likely
economic impact. These two components represent over 90% of total project
costs. With respect to the solid waste management component (68% of project
costs), the major benefits that will arise out of the project are increased
values of residential, commercial and industrial property, due to removal of a
major nuisance. Better waste disposal is also a precondition for improved
drainage. For the drainage component (22% of project cost), health improve-
ments, better access, removal of nuisance water and savings in maintenance
costs represent the major streams of benefits.
5.04     By comparison of property and rental values in areas that are not
presently subject to drainage and waste disposal nuisance problems with other
areas presently subject to these features, one is able to arrive at some proxy
measure of benefits that the project is likely to confer to property owners.
Savings in flood damage to roads and other public infrastructure that will be
realized as a result of the project are further benefits. Unfortunately, data
could not be obtained for the latter with any reasonable degree of reliability
or accuracy.
5.05     Joint estimates were made of the likely benefits and costs to be
derived only from the drainage and solid waste management components of the
project from three distinct sources: (a) a survey was carried out in two of
the most adversely affected areas at present (the most densely populated parts
of Metropolitan Lagos--Ajegunle and Mushin). Estimates were obtained of the
amount of increments to present rentals for various types of housing the area
resident would be willing to pay and could afford if existing poor drainage
and waste disposal problems were alleviated under the proposed project;
(b) a comparison of present rentals where the problems are not as severe
(e.g., Lagos Island) with those in other areas where the problems are very
acute (e.g., Ajegunle and Mushin) for dwellings of similar types; and
(c) comparisons within the Ajegunle and Mushin areas themselves among sections
with varying degrees of adverse physical conditions. In all these cases, the
differential in likely rental increases as a result of improvements ranged
from 15% to 30%, with the average being consistently around a 20% increase.
The analysis thus assumes a 20% increase in unit rentals for residential
properties resulting from project improvements, although the sensitivity
analysis (para 5.08) also demonstrates the likely impact of increases of the
extremities of the survey range (i.e., 15% and 30% respectively). There are
at the moment 7,000 residential units in Ajegunle and 5,100 in Mushin and an
estimated 160,000 statewide. The Lagos State Master Plan has stated that 80%
of these gradable residential units are of the rooming house type, with an
average of 8, 16 and 24 rooms respectively for single, two- and three-storied



- 49 -
types. Fifty percent of these were assumed to be one story, and 25% each two-
and three-storied. I/
5.06     Cost streams utilized in the analysis were (a) the investment cost as
built up over and beyond the project period, including physical contingencies;
(b) estimated costs of maintenance averaging about 3% of total investments on
a weighted basis over the 30-year period of the analysis; (c) technical assis-
tance directly benefiting these components; (d) applicable costs of project
coordination and monitoring during implementation; 2/ and (e) an estimate of
the proportional share of the economic cost of land utilized by LSWDB for the
new transfer stations, tip sites, depots, etc. Total costs for the Ajegunle
and Mushin areas, assigned mainly on the basis of the number of properties in
the two areas (para 5.05) and other directly allocatable costs (drainage),
amount to some 10% of total project costs.
5.07     It is generally accepted by analysts that the Nigerian currency is
currently seriously overvalued and that there is significant underemployment
of labor in Lagos State, mainly on account of the intense urbanization trends
and their effects in recent years. As a result, foreign exchange and labor
have been shadow priced to adjust for relevant distortions in domestic prices.
For foreign exchange shadow pricing, a standard conversion factor of 0.45 was
applied against the foreign costs of the stormdrainage and solid waste com-
ponents. It was estimated that labor accounted for some 45% of total local
costs of the project, while unskilled labor represented about 70% of total
labor costs.
B.   Economic Rates of Return
5.08     On the basis of the above, the drainage and solid waste management
components for the Ajegunle and Mushin areas alone are estimated jointly to
have a positive economic rate of return of about 25% per annum over the 30-
year period reviewed. The table on the following page indicates that if
benefits are reduced or costs increased by as much as 50%, the ERR would range
from a low of about 11% to a high of just over 22% under alternate
scenarios. Given the intensity of demand for shelter and improved related
infrastructure, and the particular nature of the project itself, it is highly
unlikely that these extreme scenarios would develop in reality (paras 5.09 -
5.10). A delay in project implementation would not affect the ERR, because
the project represents a time-slice of ongoing operations and both costs and
benefits would be similarly delayed.
1/   The remaining 20% of residential units are single and duplex units
and apartment flats. Only residential units are used in the analysis on
account of estimation difficulties for non-residential properties.
2/   Theoretically, all incremental operating costs arising in the LSWDB
should also be included as a cost stream. Since, however, the project is
financing the services contracts, spare parts, costs of drain cleaning,
and training and advisory services for the institution during the project
period, and since post-implementation amounts are unlikely to be
significant, a specific item for incremental costs was not included.

b/   Costs remaining constant.
c/   Benefits remaining constant.
5.09     By virtually any yardstick, the Ajegunle and Mushin areas could be
considered representative of other areas in the State benefiting from the
proposed project investments. As in a number of other areas, problems of
drainage are particularly acute, while in several areas in Ajegunle, in parti-
cular refuse collection is presently non-existent. As in a number of other
parts of the State, population densities in these two townships are extremely
high, while infrastructure continues to deteriorate rapidly. It is highly
likely that the economic rates of return indicated in the analysis of these
two areas closely approximate situations in most other parts of the city
affected by the project.
5.10     More importantly, owing to severe data constraints, the analysis has
only utilized private benefits and costs for these two representative areas,
without capturing the full impact of relevant public sector and social exter-
nalities. For instance, the savings in project investments from checks in
persistent deterioration of public infrastructure and other property, reduced
and lost output as a result of work stoppages, and employee illness and
absenteeism, are likely to be enormous. Thus, the indicated rates of return
for Ajegunle and Mushin under the alternative scenario would be considered not
only theoretically lower limits for these and other project areas, but would
in practice also be significantly higher than these estimates. By implica-
tion, the project itself would have an enormous economic impact on Lagos State
as a whole.
C.   Poverty Impact
5.11     The 1984 relative poverty threshold for Nigeria's urban areas was
estimated to be about US$550 per annum. Some 50% of the urban population is
below this poverty threshold. It is estimated that the poverty line for
Metropolitan Lagos is US$660. Given the citywide scope of the project, it is
impossible to quantify the direct benefits to the poor, but it is the poorer



- 51 -
areas which presently suffer most from lack of drainage and inadequate or non-
existent waste disposal services. A conservative estimate indicates some two
and one-half million people will directly benefit from those improvements.
Through the rating and valuation exercise, indirect benefits to the poor are
likely to be even greater in the long run as local authorities improve their
financial position and become capable of seriously addressing the existing
physical and organizational deficiencies affecting the quality of life in
Lagos.
D.   Risks and Replicability
Risks
5.12     An urban maintenance and infrastructure project in a city as large,
complex, and topographically difficult as Lagos inevitably involves risks.
This is the Bank's first operational experience with an urban project in a
city of this size in Nigeria. However, the most significant risks that remain
are the project implementing difficulties generally prevalent in Nigeria, such
as institutional weakness, shortages of staff, contract delays, procurement
difficulties, etc.
5.13     The LSWDB has, for the past four years, benefited from international
management expertise brought to Nigeria by the LSG (para 3.02). This approach
has yielded good results and was extended to November 1984 and has been the
basis for developing a core of local need level management staff. The present
Nigerian LSWDB management has demonstrated a capacity to maintain, and in some
cases improve, the level of collection services despite the financial and
equipment constraints. The project has been designed to benefit from the
experience and techniques already in place and does not rely on new or
radically different methods for the LSWDB operations. The risks associated
with the introduction of an expanded operation are therefore minimized.
Techniques, vehicle types, etc., are well known and have been tested. Also,
while the project's implementation period is relatively short (para 3.25), the
project is a time-slice of an ongoing operation. The rate of increased
service capacity, area of coverage and level of service standards have all
been carefully estimated and are considered optimum. The bulk of the loan is
for vehicles and equipment in large contracting packages which should be
procured and disbursed quickly.
5.14     LSWDB might experience difficulties in the procurement of equip-
ment. However, tendering packages for equipment and civil works have been
completed and reviewed by IBRD. The use of ICB should also minimize problems
and delays. A second risk would be that LSWDB would have difficulty in
collecting charges from new industrial/commercial premises. This could cause
LSG to increase the levels of subsidy. However, recently LSWDB performance in
this area and the current level of arrears (para 3.29) indicate a capacity for
dealing with the increased difficulties of collecting from a larger number of
new clients. A third risk, that local government maintenance for certain
drainage improvement might be inadequate, has been minimized by having LSWDB
organize the citywide maintenance system and train local councils to gradully
take over the task.



- 52 -
5.15     A small project monitoring and coordination unit within the Ministry
of Works and Transport (para 3.01) is intended to assist in supervision of
implementation and procurement and provide the necessary vehicle for problem
solving.
Replicability
5.16     The main thrust of this project is to build institutional capacity
within LSG to better deal with the infrastructure and maintenance requirements
of such a huge metropolis. Therefore, it could be considered to be akin to a
technical assistance project that aims at strengthening urban management. The
heavy technical assistance elements are intended not merely to provide imple-
mentation assistance, but to train and put in place the locai capacity
required.
5.17     As described above, the project would strengthen the capacity of
LSWDB/MOWT to facilitate repetition in other programs' objectives and accom-
plishments under this project. The somewhat innovative approaches to rating
and valuation would be continued in LSMLG's other programs; but most
importantly, other cities throughout Nigeria look to Lagos for a lead in urban
management. LSWDB is already assisting other cities, and this project would
develop good models for waste, drainage, and revenue collection nationwide.
5.18     Even though this project is fully replicable, it is not expected that
simply repeating it over and over could, by itself, solve the infrastructure
and maintenance problems of Lagos. The task is too great to be met by the
expansion of any one public institution. The Bank has thus already raised
issues about other Lagos State institutions which are in need of reform: the
Local Government Councils, the Rating Authority and possibly the State
financial institutions. If the maintenance and infrastructure needs of Lagos
are to be adequately addressed, the budgeting system should also, in time, be
redirected to include the financing of more comprehensive citywide programs,
and Local Government Councils should become more efficient in providing basic
urban services.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Federal and
Lagos State Governments, and recorded in the loan documents that, as con-
ditions of effectiveness of the loan:
(a)  FMGN and LSG shall enter into a subsidiary loan agreement satisfac-
tory to the Bank (para 2.11), under which FMGN shall onlend the
proceeds of the loan to LSG on the same terms and conditions as the
Bank (Section 3.01(b) of the Loan Agreement);
(b)  commercial bank accounts shall be opened for LSWDB and MOWT, each
with an initial deposit of N 660,000. Similarly, an account shall be
opened for the Valuation Office in the LSMLG with an initial deposit
of N 330,000 (para 2.12, Section 2.03(b) of the Project Agreement and
Section 6.01(b) of the Loan Agreement); and



- 53 -
(c)  FMGN shall establish a revolving fund in the form of a Special
Account in foreign exchange, in a commercial bank, to be managed by
the Project Coordinating Unit, and an amount of US$1 million out of
the loan proceeds would be deposited in the Special Account (to
relieve LSG from prefinancing the foreign expenditures eligible for
reimbursement) (para 2.12 and Sections 2.02(b) and 6.01(c) of the
Loan Agreement).
6.02     As conditions of the loan, LSG shall:
(a) establish and maintain a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) in a form
and with staffing satisfactory to the Bank to ensure timely execution
and supervision of the project and to prepare future project pro-
posals (Section 2.01(b) of the Project Agreement); and shall appoint

Note: Assumes an initial disbursement of US$1.0 million to establish the
revolving fund in the third quarter of FY86 and retroactively finance eligible
items; also, generally assumes an average lag of 12 months between expenditure
and disbursement. The pace of project disbursement is still expected to
exceed the urban and regional averages because the project represents a time-
slice of ongoing operations. The disbursement profile is similar to that for
similar project components disbursed under the Bauchi Urban Project (Loan
1767-UNI), as shown in the chart on the following page.

LAGOS SOLID WASTE AND STORMDRAINAGE PROJECT
LAGOS STATE WASTE DISPOSAL BOARD
Assuiptions for Financial Analysis
Income Statement Table
1.       Lagos Government Contributions.  This is the mission's best estimate
of the funds available from the local governments and it will be reviewed in
the light of the proposals to improve the local government's rating and valua-
tion law and rate collection systems. The State Governor is of the opinion
that local governments should pay the cost of the domestic waste disposal ser-
vice and, in this event, the payments should increase with the possible
complete elimination of the State Grant described in paragraph below. Local
Government Councils are willing to make larger contributions provided service
improves. In 1985, the payment is expected to be about 3.5% of total internal
local government revenues, mostly property tax. Future payments have been
assumed at 5% of future local government revenues, as shown in the Forecast
Financial Profiles.
2.       Service Charges.  These are the Board's calculations of industrial
waste income from the service.   However, charges will need to be increased to
cover increased costs and 10% has been allowed for this from 1986 onwards. On
the other hand, it is doubtful if all billings will be collected and a bad
debts' allowance of 10% has been made from 1985 onwards. From 1989 onwards,
the Board anticipates that if there is any further increase in service the
income and expenditure will be largely self-balancing. For this reason, no
further increase in either real income or real expenditure has been provided.
3.       Wages, Power, Materials, Buildings and Administration.  These are the
Board's figures calculated at 1984 prices and escalated at 14% a year, from
1985 onwards.
4.       Depreciation.  The average life of all vehicles and plant has been
calculated as five years so that for accounting purposes the total of revalued
vehicle assets should be depreciated by 20% each year. Also, every year about
one-fifth of the vehicles and plant is scrapped. To ensure that total asset
and depreciation values represent the true value of the vehicles and plant,
20% of the total value of vehicles and plant is deleted both from the total of
assets and the total of depreciation each year. Civil works have been
estimated to have an average life of 20 years and should thus be depreciated
at 5% a year. In future, about 70% of all assets will be in the form of
vehicles and plant, and the balance of 30% of assets will be civil works. For
the purposes of financial projections, an overall depreciation rate of 15.5%
has been calculated as follows:

Page 7 of 9
Vehicles and Plant            70% x 20%   14.0%
Civil Works                   30% x  5% =  1.5%
Total                      100%          15.5%
5.       Interest.  This is interest on debt.
6.       State Recurrent Grant.  This is an amount required to make up the
deficiency of revenues in the income statement in order to bring it near to a
break-even situation. This could be reduced or eliminated in the event that
local governments increase their contributions for domestic waste (para 1).
7.       Operating Ratio.  This is total costs (excluding depreciation)
divided by total revenues and is a percentage in excess of 100 because costs
exceed revenues and are largely balanced only by the State Grant.
Flow of Funds Table
8.       Income Before Depreciation.  This is brought: forward from the Income
Statement Table.
9.       State Recurrent Grant (para 6).
10.      State Capital Grants.  These are grants for capital expenditure both
before and during the project construction period. It is expected that the
annual depreciation provision should provide sufficietnt funds to finance
future capital expenditure after 1990, which will be mostly for replacement of
vehicles and plant. The grants made during the project construction period of
1986 to 1990 are the counterpart funds to the IBRD and cofinancing loans.
11.      IBRD Loan.  This is the part of the proposed loan which will be on-
lent to LSWDB. It is 53.4% of the cost of the LSWDB component of the project
at N 46.3 million or US$61.7 million.
12.      Cofinancing.  This is the whole of the cofinancing loan of
N 8.7 million or US$11.6 million.
13.      Investment in Project.  This is the capital work component of the
project applicable to LSWDB. It is N 83.4 million or 68% of a total project
of N 123.2 million.
14.      Previous Works.  This is capital expenditure in past years.
15.      Future Works.  This is capital expenditure aLfter the project con-
struction period. It is mostly replacement of vehicles and plant and will be
financed from monies set aside from depreciation provisions in the form of
investments (para 24).
16.      Other Works.  This is capital expenditure to take place before the
project implementation starts in 1986

17.      Foreign Loans Amortization.  These are repayments of the IBRD and
cofinancing loans. These and the interest have been calculated on the basis
of a 20 year loan with a five year grace period, a 0.75% commitment fee, an
8.82% rate of interest for the IBRD loan, and an 11% interest rate for eight
years for the cofinancing loan.
18.      Operational Interest Long-term Debt.  'This is interest on the IBRD
and cofinancing loans as described in para 17.
19.      Increase in Working Capital.  This is the additional working capital
used in operations each year. It is made up of increases in Total Current
Assets in Table 3 less increases in Accounts Payable in Table 3.
20.      Debt Service Ratio.  This is income before depreciation less the
increase in working capital (para 19) divided by the debt service payments
(paras 17 and 18). A minimum of 1.5 is expected and these ratios indicate
that there is sufficient cash to make debt service payments.
21.      Percent Contribution to Investment.  This is income before
depreciation less debt service and increase in working capital as a percentage
of the years capital investment. A minimum of 30% to 40% is normally expected
but in the case of the Board with heavy depreciation allowances of 20% on all
vehicles and plant each year, there will be sufficient funds available to
contribute 100% of future investments from 1989 to 1990.
22.      Fixed Assets in Operation, Minus Accumulated Depreciation, Net Fixed
Assets and Work'in Progress. These are combined figures for vehicles and
plant and civil works; the depreciation is described in para 4 above and work
in progress is 10% of the year's capital expenditure.
23.      Cash, Bank, and Investments.  This is the total of cash and the
investment of depreciation provisions at year-end.
24.      Accounts Receivable.  These are monies due to the Board at year-end
and calculated on the basis of two months' bills.
25.      Inventories.  Because of the long lead time for materials in Lagos,
the inventory total is the equivalent of one year's usage.
26.      Contributions.  These are the combined values of the initial input by
the State plus further grants for capital purposes.
27.      Revaluation Surplus.  Assets and depreciation are inflated at a
targeted rate of local inflation of and 14% in 1985 and thereafter. The rate
of 8% each year and the amount of this revaluation goes to the revaluati6n
surplus account. There are two basic reasons for doing this: first, to
ensure that the value of assets recorded in the accounts reflects as
accurately as possible the full replacement cost of such assets, and second,
to ensure that the net value of assets for a rate of return calculation would
be as correct as possible. In the case of LSWDB, where so many of the assets
are in the form of short life vehicles and plant with an average life of five
years, the revaluation of assets assumes an even greater importance. This



- 66 -                          ANNEX 4
Page 9 of 9
will ensure not only that the value of assets is as close as possible to full
replacement cost, but also that the depreciation provision will ensure that
adequate funds are available for asset renewal on the basis of updated costs.
28.      Operational Surplus/Loss.  This is an accumulation of annual sur-
pluses and annual losses from the bottom of the Income Statement Table.
29.      Long-term Debt.  This is the balance of debi: outstanding.
30.      Accounts Payable.  These are bills to be paid at year-end and the
total is calculated as 20% of the capital expenditure.
31.      Current Maturities.  This is the amount of long-term debt to be
repaid in the immediately following year.
32.      Current Ratio.  This is the ratio between current assets and current
liabilities and should always exceed i.o.
33.      Percent Debt/Debt + Equity.  The percentage of debt to debt plus
equity normally increases as debt increases and reduces as debt is repaid.
Because of the continuing loss of LSWDB, the total of equity does not increase
each year very rapidly so that despite reductions in debt, the percentage does
not improve very rapidly until 1990. Such increases in equity, as do occur,
result mainly from fixed asset revaluations.

LAGOS SOLID WASTE AND STORMDRAINAGE PROJECT
PHOTOGRAPHS OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
Examples of recent, large-scale investments in primary infrastructure -a major East-West Expressway built by the Federal Government-and housing project built by Lagos State
Government. The entire expressway system, as seen in the photograph. is prone to traffic snarls ceused mainly by the poor conditions of secondary streets that are inadequate to receive
the exit flows. Bus stops and traffic management also need improvements. The recently completed housing project is an example of the substantial implementing capacity of LSG.

Most of Lagos is prone to flooding because its stormdrainage system is inadequate ond poorly maintained. Vehicles stall excerba ting traffic
problems and causing widespread inconvenience.

Vast parts of Lagos are high densityareas thatdo not have basic infrastructureorservices such as refusecollection. Some local governments
have attempted to build infrastructure networks like the stormdrain above. However, because the main drainage network it feeds into is not
functioning properly, in the rainy season this drain will overflow and cause additional local flooding.

Even In the more developed parts of the city where major private Investments such as these commercial buildings have been made, the
secondary and tertiary infrastructure system, (i.e., street paving and drains) has not been adequately developed. The potential revenues from
property taxes in these areas is large, but until services are improved, commensurate tax rate increases cannot be levied.
