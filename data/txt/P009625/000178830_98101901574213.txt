APPRAISAL OF PROPOSED FIFTH LOAN TO
INLUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTiENT CORPORATrION OF INDIA
SUM"4IARBY
i.       The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)
has requested a '30 million loan from the Bank in order to replenish its
foreign exchange resources. The Bank has made four previous loans to ICICI
in the total amount of "j60 million.
ii.      ICICI is the largest development finance corporation with which the
Bank has been associated. Its total outstanding and available resources are
about Rs. 580 million. This figure cormiprises share capital oi Rs. 50 million;
reserves and suplus of Rs. 16 million; rupee borrowings, both committed and
uncommitted, of Rs. 175 million; and foreign exchange borrowings, committed
and uncommitted, equivalent to Rs. 339 million (417 million). The corpora-
tion has 1,814 shareholders; the principal shareholders are commqercial banks
and insurance companies located both in India and abroad.
iii.     In addition to its financial size, ICICI has a large and well
trained staff headed by an experienced, capable Management. The Board of
Directors is composed of distinguished nen from industry, finance and law.
The number of ICICIts total staff and 1Nanagement was 99 on December 31, 1962.
ICICI's project appraisals are of high quality, and it is expected that its
project follow-up activity, having been reorganized and emphasized by NIanage-
ment, will soon be equally good.
iv.      By the end of December 1962, ICICI had approved financial assistance
of as. 601 million for 199 industrial projects. This assistance was in the
form of foreign exchange loans (Rs. 284 million), rupee loans (Rs. 136
million), underwritings (Rs. 133 million) and direct subscriptions of indus-
trial securities (Rs, 48 million). To al approvals have groin over the
past three years at an avera;e rate of about 30% per year. Against the
approvals of Rs. 601 million, ICICI had disbursed Rs. 283 million by December
31, 1962. Its disbursements are now growing faster than approvals as many
of the previously approved projects are coming into construction.
v.       ICICI's projects are well diversified as to industrial category,
are fairly well distributed geographically, and vary considerably as to the
amount of assistance received from ICICI. Of the 199 projects, approved as
of December 1962, 73 were completed, all except 4 or 5 were operating success-
fully, 81 were under construction, and 45 were to ice started.  A number of
projects have been delayed because of difficulties in obtaining import
permits, land titles, building materials, etc.  A few projects suffer from
inadequate project rmana-ement, and a s-mall number might be co sidered
marginal as to economic size and cost of production. ICICI's management is
following these few cases closely.
vi.      In a side agreement to the previous Bank loan, ICICI has had the
right to commit sub-loans of C500,000 or less per project without the prior
approval of the Bank.  The limit on the aggregate amount of such discretionary
sub-loans was set at i6 million. In view of ICICIts accumulated experience



- ii -
in project appraisal and the ever increasing care devoted to project appraisal
by ICICI's management and staff, the Bank has agreed to increase the dis-
cretionary limit to 42 million per project, with no limit on the aggregate
amount of such commitments.
vii.     ICICI's financial position as of December 31, 1962 was very strong.
The quality of its loan and investment portfolios was gool wjith only one
project, out of 37 having maturing debt, being in arrears. Reserves have
risen to Rs. 16 million equal to 6.-5 of its loans and investments. Total
income has risen substantially, but net profit from inco e in 1962 of
Rs. 4.6 million was only slightly more than in 1961, as ICICI incurred a
lar-e increase in interest expense on increased borrowings. The debt-equity
ratio on December 31, 1962 was only 1.7:1. The price of ICICI's shares rose
in 1962 from Rs. 82 per share to Rs. 94, and by the end of April, 1963 the
slhares were being quoted at par.
viii.    ICICI expects that a strong demand for its financial assitance will
continue through 1967. It estimates that total approvals by that time will
have increased by Rs. 795 million, having grown at rates of about jp20 million
per year in foreign exchange and Rs. 65 million per year in local currency.
As of December 31, 1962, ICICI had available resources of *Pll.5 million in
foreign exchange, of which 4h million remained under the Bank's loans, and
Rs. 12 million in local currency. (By the end of Iharch 1963, the amount
available under the Bank's loans had shrunk to 'a50,000.)  In order to
obtain the additional amounts required, ICICI plans to increase both its
foreign exchange and rupee borrowings substantially. The proposed loan of
?S30 million, plus the  11.5 million in foreign exchange available at the
end of December, 1962, should cover ICICI's foreign exchange loan approvals
into the early nart of 1965. The increase in borrowings will raise the debt/
equity ratio beyond the present limit of 3:1 in 1965. Because of the high
quality of ICICIts loan and investment portfolios and its sound operational
policies and practices, the Bank has agreed to an increase in the debt
limit to four times equity.
ix.      ICICI has grown to become a major financial institution in India.
Its investments have been instrumental in bringing about an increase in direct
private investments in industry by over Rs. 3,000 million. ICICI has con-
tributed greatly to the Cjrowth of the capital market through its underwriting
and direct subscription activities and through the sale of its investments
in the market. In addition, ICICI is beginning to pass its experience and skill
to other new developmert finance institutions in Asia and Africa through
technical assistance.
x.       In view of ICICI's satisfactory performance and good business pros-
pects, it would be appropriate for the Bank to make the requested loan on
terms similar to those of the previous loan.



APPRAISAoL OF P.OPOISED FIFTH LOAN TO INDUbTRIAL
CREDIT AND I      AVVST,ENT COR?POP,T--0N OF INDIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited
(ICICI) has requested a loan of 630 million from the Bank to replenish its
foreign exchange resources. The proposed loan would be the fifth Bank loan
to ICICI. The four previous loans were made as follows:
Loan No.           Date of Loan Agreement           Amount
109                 March 14, 1955            $10 million
232                 July 15, 1959             $10 million
269                 October 28, 1960          $20 million
312                 February 28, 1962         $20 million
2.        The following appraisal is based on information submitted by ICICI
and upon an investigation of ICICI's operations, prospects, and economic
contribution, performed in the field by IFC staff members in March 1963.
To a large extent the appraisal emphasizes an analysis of ICICI's performance
since the previous appraisal.
II. THE CORPORATION
Purpose and Ceoital Structure
3.        ICICI caine into operition on Mlarch 1, 1955.  It was created to
assi,st i.n the develonment of p-rivate industry in India, to e;..co'wage local
and foreign private capital participation in its financing, and to assist
in the exoansion of the Indian capital market.
h.        The Cornoration's authorized capital is Rs. 250 million ($52.5 mil-
lion) comprising 2.5 million ordinary shares of Rs. 100 each. Its sub-
scribed and paid-in capital is Rs. 50 million ($10.5 million) of which 71.6%
was held by Indian investors on December 31, 1962. The balance was held by
British (17.9%), United States (6.1%), German (Lt,o%), and Japanese (o.4%)
investors. A listing of ICICI's principal shareholders is shown in Annex 1.
In March 1963 the Japanese shareholdings in ICICI increased as a result of
purchases through the stock market of 340 shares by the Bank of Tokyo and
450 shares by Mitsui Bank. Of ICICI's 1,814 shareholders, 1,793 shareholders.
each owning less than 1% of the total shares, collectively owned 31% of the
total on December 31, 1962. The 21 large shareholders, primarily commercial
banks and insurance companies, owned the balance of 69%.  The largest single
shareholding, of 17%, is owned by the Life Insurance Corporation of India,
which is wholly-owned by the Government.  This holding was the result of the
nationalization of life insurance whereby ICICI's shares held by life in-
surance companies passed to the Govermnent corporation.
5.        ICICI's local currency debt resources consist of two rupee loans on
long terms from the Government of India totaling Rs. 175 million. Its debt
resources in foreign exchange consist of the Bank loans of 060 million and
a line of credit of $5 million from the United States Agency for International
Development (AID). In addition to these loans ICICI has negotiated a loan



- 2 -
with Kreditanstalt fur -vTiederaufbau involving a line of credit of DM 20
million. An earlier line of credit of DM 5 million from the same institu-
tion has not yet become effective.
6.        In addition to its share capital and debt resources, ICICI had
accumulated by December 31, 1962 surplus and reserves of Rs. 15.8 million.
This amount added to the share capital and debt resources, including the
Kreditanstalt loan, gives ICICI total long-term resources of Rs. 580.2 mil-
lion, of which Rs. 339.5 million (071.3 million) is in foreign exchange.
With this level of resources ICICI is by far the largest of the development
finance institutions with which the Bank has been associated.
Board of Directors, Mllanagement and Staff
7.        The Board of Directors of ICICI continues to draw upon distinguished
men from industry, finance and law for its membership. The names and busi-
ness backgrounds of the Directors are shown in Annex 2. The leadership of
1i4r. G. L. Mehta, Chairman of the Board, who has become one of the principal
spokesmen in India for the role of private enterprise in the Indian economy,
has been instrumental in attracting distinguished and capable men to ICICI's
Board. The composition of the Board will be slightly changed in ilay.
Sir J.D.K. Brown has stated his intention to retire at that time and his
position will be filled by Mr. C.B.C. Pilkington, a prominent British busi-
nessman and a resident of Calcutta. Following his election to the Presidency
of the Bank, Mr. Woods resigned his directorshiD in ICICI.
8.        The workload at the monthlyr meetings of the Board has been increasing
with ICICI's increasing business. In 1962, the Board considered 99 applica-
tions, approving 92, denying 4, and deferring 3. In addition to considering
applications for assistance, the Board is active in formulating ICICI's
policies and reviewing its overall operations. In this respect, ICICI is
fortunate in having a close working relationship between the Board of Direc-
tors and the Mianagement of the Corporation. This close relationship is en-
hanced by Mr. G. L. ivIehta exercising executive powers on a full time basis.
His intimate knowledge of the operations and administration of the Corpora-
tion provides an ideal basis of understanding between the two bodies.
9.        The responsibility for daily operations and administration continues
with Hr. H.T. Parekh, General i4anager, and }Mr. J.S. Raj, Deputy General Manager.
Although HIr. Parekh retains overall responsibility for the management of the
Corporation, he and A1r. Raj follow an informal division of responsibility where-
by iMlr. Parekh oversees investment operations with respect to new business and
the investmenit portfolio. Mr. Raj, on the other hand, is primarily concerned
with the administrative operations following the Boardts approval of a pro-
ject. These operations involve legal arrangen.ents, accounting, disbursements,
and follow-up.  This practice has been very successful, and it has facilitated
access to Hlanagement by the heads of ICICIts departments.
10.       ICICI's formal organization chart is shown in Annex 3.  A recent
change in the organization was a transfer of follow-up functions from the Ac-
counts and Disbursements Department to a Follow-up Section reporting directly
to the Deputy General ilanager. The organization, administration, and em-
phasis of a formal follow-up prograni has been a continuing problem for ICICI



and the subject of much ciscassion with the Bank.  In reorganizing this ac-
tivity with increased personnel and with direct responsibility to M4anagement,
ICICI's Management is giving follow-up the support and emphasis it deserves.
11.       As of December 31, 1962, the number of Management and staff person-
nel in ICICI was 99.  Outside of adding a total of about nine more profes-
sionals in the Legal and Project Departments, in the Follow-up Section, and
in an office to be set up in Calcutta, VIanagement believes that ICICI has
reached its optimum employment for its near-term level of operations. The
number of employees increased by only 8 over the past 18 months, whereas
about 30 people were added to the staff in the Dreceding 18-month period.
12.       ICICI is continuing to send a few of its officers to the Bank and
IFC for training in operational methods.  To date, two department heads and
one section chief havre completed this training; the chief of the Disburse-
ments Section is now in training, and an officer from the Project Department
is scheduled to come in August. Since a large part of ICICI's operations
involve Bank funds, this training has been beneficial to the Bank in facili-
tating the proper administration of these funds, as well as helpful to ICICI.
It is interesting to note that IGICI itself has begun to receive visitors
from other development institutions, both foreign and domestic coming to
study its procedures and organization.
13.       In its eight years of existence IGICI has become an efficient,
smoothly operating organizatcon.  A high decree of morale iE obvious among
all olf the staff, and both the staff and qianegement show considerable pride
in their organization and  in the high level of skill which it has attained.
ICIC-Ls  Aoraisal and Supervii-ion of Projects
14.       As of December 31, 1962, the Project Departrment staff had eight
analysts, including a marketing officer. The staff is divided into four
teams each composed of one engineer and one financial analyst. The market
research officer was added to the Department in 1962. His work has resulted
in improving the quality of the mqrketing section contained in each appraisal
report. In 1962, the staff processed for submission to the Board 99 applica-
tions; on the average each tear nrocessed about two proposals per month.  The
amount of preparation needed varies greatly from one project to another, but
on the whole, the workload in the Project Denartment is heavy. In 1959, the
total strength of the Project DeDartment was four; the staff has therefore
increased 100%, which is about the same as the increase in the number of
appraisals and notes placed before the Board.  However, the amount of work
required in the preparation of each project appraisal has gone un consider-
ably in the last three y,ears or so, and, in spite of an increase in productiv-
ity per man, the Project Department has not been able to build up spare capa-
city.  ICICI is of the opinion that the total strength of the Department should
be increased by at least four, especially if the staff is to be involved in
the supervision of projects, as unci,er the present follow-up program.
15.       The quality of ICICI appraisals is high and ever improving.  However,
some imoortant aspects of the projects, such as technical management, possible
technical and financial collaborations with foreign concerns, and the economic
size of projects and comparative cost studies, could perhaps be covered more
thoroughly.



16.       The Follow-UD Section. is curre t)1  star'fed with two officers and
one clerk, and another clerk is to be adfed.  When a problem arises, such as
cost overruns or delays in construction schedule, the follow-up staff reports
to the Managernent and also to the appraisal team who originally was respon-
sible for the project.  A decision is then taken as to what course of action
is required and as to who wiil be responsible for working the problem out with
sponsors.  According to the nature and the urgency of the problem, this respon-
sibility may lie either with the original project officer or with a member of
the follow-up team. This syster' has a double advantage of throwing the respon-
sibility for a difficulty arising with the Droject back to the original pro-
ject officer, and of not burdening the Project Department with the time con-
sumiing review of detailed date.
17.       ICICI currently knows of the few troublesome projects in commercial
ooeration; it is mainly with the large number of projects still under con-
struction that supervision work needs to be strengthened. ICICI has in the
past relied too heavily on progress reports submitted bv the sponsors.
Although the number of end-use visits made by the Project Department, the end-
use team and the Management has increased considerably, the number of visits
is still insufficient for effective supervision. The Management expects to be
able to schedule more frequent visits to projects under construction.
External Relations
18.       ICTOI  is held in high esteei. both by the Goveri-s.ent and by other
financial institutions.  ICiC_I's favorable relationship with the Government
is based on lautual resnect, and it is aided by good communication through the
Chairman, the Management, an. through the Government representative on ICICI's
Board of Directors.  In view Df iis posit -on as Permanent Secreo ary in the
Ministr- of Commerce and Industry, the Government Director has been of con-
siderable assistance to ICICI.
19.       The Corporationts relationships %ith other financial institutions
have grown strong as a result of its practice of encouraging the growth of
the capital market in India.  In 1962, ICICI helped to manage ten large
financings, involving particinations by foreign and domestic financial insti-
tutions.  Included in these operations was a As. 300 million debenture issue
for Oil India Ltd., which was the largest issue floated to date in the Indian
capital market. In these operations ICIC0 has demonstrated good judgment of
market conditions and good project a-praisal, both of which have helped to
increase its stature in the financial community.
20.       The Corporation has also developed relations with development finance
corporations outside India. Towards the end of Miarch 1962, ICICI convened a
Regional Conference of Development Corporations in Asia. In 1962, visitors
from Vietnam, Nepal and Thailand spent some time with ICICI, and a trainee
from Liberia is expected later this year. Inasmuch as the Corporation has
achieved a high degree of maturityT and skill as a development finance corpora-
tion and has become a standard-bearer in this field, it is conscious of its
responsibilities in extending technical assistance to younger and struggling
institutions of this type.  It is hozed that its program of technical assist-
ance will even be enlarged.

III. OPERATIONS TO DATE
21.       A summary of ICICI's operations from the start of operations through
1962 is contained in Annex 4. Since 1955 to December 31, 1962, ICICIts Board
had approved assistance to 199 separate projects involving 183 industrial con-
cerns for a total value of Rs. 601.7 million or US $127 million.
--------- Rs. in Iilllons --------
Board Approvals       Disbursements
(net of cancellations)
Foreign Currency loans                284.3                113.0
Local Currency loans                  135.6                 77.0
Underwritings                         133.4                 50.8
Direct Subscriptions                   48.[                41.8
Total            601.7                 282.6
22.       Thus foreign currency loans constitute just under half the total
approvals and the rupee operations are nearly equally divided between rupee
loans on the one hand and underwritings and direct subscriptions on the other.
23.       In 1962, the Board approved loans and investments in the total amount
of Rs. 174.6 million, broken down as follows: Rs. 90.1 million in foreign
currency loans; Rs. 3.5 million in rupee loans; Rs. 31.2 million in under-
&mr4ting5and Rs. 9.8 million in direct subscription of shares.  (In the two
months ending February 28, 1963, ICICI had given additional approvals of
Rs. 19.3 million in foreign exchange loans, Rs. 14.7 million in rupee loans,
Rs. 1.5 million in underwritings, and Rs. 1.1 million in direct subscriptions.
i,oreover, as of the latter date, ICICI was engaged in serious discussions
with industrial concerns for projects involving tentatively an assistance of
Rs. 13.1 million, including Rs. 7.6 million for foreign currency. The nature
of inquiries indicates a growing demand on ICICI's facilities for equity par-
ticipation and underwriting.)
2h.       In general, there is a time lag of one year to 18 months between
Board anproval and signing of an agreement with the borrower.  This is because
the issue of foreign exchange license, firming of any agreement with foreign
collaborators, arrangements for the acquisition of land, the relevant legal
procedures and sometimes a market issue have to follow Board approvals. The
lag between signing of the agreement (commitment) and disbursement averages
also about one and a half years.
25.       Since 1960, which might be considered the coming of age of ICICI,
its operations took a long stride. Total approvals, commitments and disburse-
ments for the three years 1960 to 1962 are about twice the same totals for the
first five years. Annex 5 shows the annual volume of approvals, commitments
and disburserments since 1955. For the last three years the total operations
have, on the average, shown an annual increase of some 30% over the previous
ye-ar. Disbursements, however, have been increasing even faster, i.e. at the
rate of LOJ to 50% reflecting the previous year's jumps in approvals and com-
m itments.



- 6 -
26.       The trend in rupee loan approvals follows closely that of foreign
exchange loan approvals, rupee loans constituting one quarter and foreign
exchange loans half of the total. On the other hand, underwritings and out-
right participations have not followed a definite pattern and have depended
on the situation of the stock market, response of other underwriting institu-
tions and the effect of unusually large operations.
Foreign Currency Lending
27.       Foreign currency loans approved at the end of December 1962 amounted
to Rs. 284.3 million, a little less than half the total ICICI operations. Dis-
bursements as at that date amounted to Rs. 113.0 million or just about 40% of
approvals. As in the past three years the demand for foreign currency loans
remained strong in 1962, and loans approved amounted to Rs. 90 million, or just
over half the total of Rs. 174.6 million for that year.  Due to the continuing
difficult balance of payments situation, the bulk of foreign exchange require-
ments of private industry are met, as in the last few years, by the Industrial
Finance Corporation of India, w^hich has received most of the bilateral loans
extended by the U.S.A., the U.K., Germany, France, Japan and by ICICI, which
uses IBHP loans and smaller amounts of U.S. and German loans.
28.       In 1962 there were a large number of inquiries for loans for pur-
chasin; bal.ancing or ancillary equipment from established units.  Twenty such
applications for, Rs. 7.5 mill-on in foreign currency equivalen_ were approved
out of i:n?cO of credit negotiated with the German Kreditanstalt ffr
Ieiederaufbau (Kfwi).
29.       A list of ICICI's fu-ei-n exchange loans is shomwn inA nnex 6.  Of the
Rs. 281.3 million equivalent for 124 foreign exchange loans approved, by the
end of 1962, about Rs. 266.5 million were for 97 projects out of the IBRD loans,
Rs. 10.3 million for 7 projects out of the AID loan and Rs. 7.5 million for 20
projects out of the KfU loans.  The following summary shows the utilization of

Rupee Lending
30.       Total approvals as at the end of December 1962 amounted to Rs. 135.6
million or one-fourth of all approvals. Of this amount Rs. 77.0 million or
57% had been disbursed by that date. This is a larger percentage than in the
case of foreign exchange loans and is explained by the wider time lag between
approvals and signing of agreements in the case of foreign exchange loans.
31.       The demand for local currency loans, which had picked uP by a sudden
spurt in 1960, remained strong in 1962. In that year alone, ICICI approved
nearly a third of its total approvals to that date, which were Rs. 148.6 mil-
lion to 58 companies.  This is in spite of increasing activity of the commer-
cial banks and other financial institutions in long-term financing of industry,
which resulted from the continuation of the rising demand for rupee credit
because of high level of investment and increasing availability of capital
goods produced in India.
Terms and Conditions of Lending
32.       With the flexibility in the amortization schedule introduced under
the fourth line of credit from the Bank to ICICI, ICICI has had greater room
to tailor the amortization schedule for its borrowers to the needs of the
project and repayment capacity. Under the fourth line of credit, the periods
of amortization of the various loans have varied from 10 to 15 years with a
grace period of two to four years - depending upon the particular requiremen'ts
of each project.
33.       ICICI increased the lending rate on foreign currency loans from
7-3/h% to 8% in the middle of 1962, at the same time discontinuing the pr*ctice
of charging an examination fee of 4%. The rate of interest on rupee loans was
also raised from 6 e1 to 7% in line with rates charged by commercial banks and
other financial institutions in India. The commitment charge remains at 1%
on undrawn amounts.
34.       ICICI orefers as security the first mortgage of all fixed assets,
though, to suit the convenience of its borrowers, it is willing to accept
other forms of security like a bank g7uarantee. In the case of mortgages,
ICICI does not finance more than half of fixed assets. Where ICICI carries
out joint lending operations with other institutions like IFC of India or
co-imercial banks, it accepts a joint mortgage ranking pari passu.
35.       ICICI imposes various restrictive covenants on its borrowers, the
most frequent being that no further expansion requiring additional term loans
will be allow!ed to be undertaken without the prior approval of ICICI.  To
safeguard its interests and also foster healthy development, ICICI sometimes
requires the promoters to make proper technical ^nd managerial arrangements
for their projects and has, in some cases, felt it necessary to exercise its
right to appoint a director on the Boards of borrowing concerns. ICICI may
require, when the project involves foreign technical collaborators, that the
technical collaboration will continue to be provided so long as any amount
under the ICICI loan is outstanding. It may also require the borrowers to



- 8 -
agree to take immediate steps, as suggested by ICICI, to improve their finan-
cial structure, and to consult with IC.CI, at a later date during the period
of the loan, on the debt/equity and current positions. Another covenant also
found in ICICI loans is that the sponsors v3ill undertake to bring in, in the
form of unsecured loans, additional funds to cover any shortfall that may
arise in financing the project (financing of overrun).
Underwriting
36.       ICICI approved underwriting for an amount of Rs. 31.2 million in
10 companies in 1962. This represents a considerable increase over the
previous years. These operations included the flotation of the largest
debenture issue on the Indian market by an oil concern, for which ICICIts
underwriting amounted to Rs. 10 million to-ether with a direct eauity sub-
scription to Rs. 5 million. More generally, the revival of the underwriting
business is explained by the fact that the market conditions for new issues
were much less favorable than in previous years, and as a result, ICICI was
confronted -with more requests than ever before. This trend may be expected
to continue for some time in the future.  The underwriting commission remains
at 2-1/2?' on the entire issue and a brokerage fee of 1  is charged on shares
that ICICI is left  irth.  Of the approved underwriting of Rs. 133.4 million
to the end of December 1962, (representing over 20" of ICICIts overall oper-
ations) ICICI had alreadr carried out oDerations for an amount of Rs. 117.2
million, of which it took up Rs. 56.9 million (almost hale of the amount
underwritten).  Of the amount subscribed, Rs. 50.8 million had already been
disbursed.
37.       As a development finance institution, ICICI follows the policy of
underwrintinc sound projects and companies, even though the market con-
ditions might not be ideal or the companies not wiJell-knowm to the market.
For this reason, ICICI often has to take up large portions of its underwritings.
In many cases, ICICI has subsequently been able to dispose of these shares
with substantial profits.
Direct Subscriptions
38.       Apart from underwriting operations, ICI0I is making investments
through direct subscription and exercise of rights.  In 1962, ICICI approved
the purchase of shares totaling B's. 9.8 million for four companies as against
Rs. 3 million for eight companies in 1961.  The increase in the volume of
operations in this field is explained, in part, by the subdued conditions in
the market during most of 1962, which induced ICICI to take up out of under-
writing pronosals a part as direct subscriptions, thus reducing the load on
the market.  By December 1962, IC0CI had approved Rs. 48.4 million in direct
subscriptions, eoual to 8'A of ICICI's overall operations.  By that date, the
amount disbursed was Rs. 41.8 million.

Evaluation of ICICI Operations
39.       By December 31, 1962, of the total of 199 projects anproved by ICICI,
73 wiere in commercial production, 81 were in various stages of construction
and work on 45 projects was still to begin.  For a comparison of ICICI opera-
tions by geographic distribution, industry, type of project, and size,
reference is made to Annex 7.
[0.       Geographical distribution of ICICI operations has remained about
the same as previously reported. In 1961 and 1962, however, ICICI extended
its project activity into Rajasthan and Kerala for the first time. ICICI
projects still show heavy concentration in the Bombay area and in the
industrial centers of Madras and Calcutta.  Close to one-fourth of all projects
are around Bombay, near ICTCI headquarters, and approximately half of all
projects are within a three hundred mile range of Bombay. One reason for
their concentration is that the Bombay area has attracted the new types of
industry in which ICICI has been inve-.ting.  ICICI is aTwJare of the desir-
ability for a more even geographical spread of its projects and has already
taken steps to open an office in Calcutta in the near future which should
improve its publicity in that area.
41.       The distribution by major industrial grouping, given in Annex 7,
shows that the percentage of projects in the metal and metal products and
chemicals group has increased markedly over the last three years or so and
now represents in value 3h4) of total approvals.  The shares of projects in
the electrical group and the machinery group have also gone up and altogether
account for another 20, of all approvals. Half of the loans approved by ICICI
for financing from the proceeds of the IBRD loans have gone into the metal,
electrical and machinery industries. On the whole, the ICICI portfolio is
fairly iwell diversified. wJithin the various industrial categori es, there are
a certain number of industries for which ICICI feels that it has made a
sufficient amount of investments and new projects should only be considered
if they present exceptional merits: this is the case, for example, of paper,
steel tubes, cast iron spun pipes, wire ropes and cables.
42.       By the end of December, 1962, about two-thirds of 199 projects
approved were for new enterprises. In the early years of ICICI operations,
however, the percentage of operations in new enterprises was less.  Approvals
in respect of new projects included about forty cases where the borrowers are
entering the industrial field for the first time. ICICI thus has helped to
broaden industrial entrepreneurship.
43.       Wilth regard to the size of maximum investments, ICICI is following
the principles of: (i) restricting its investments in all forms in any one
company to Rs. 10 million; (ii) limiting its foreign currency loans for all
companies in any one group to Rs. 10 million.  In a few instances, however, these
limits have been exceeded due to special circumstances.
4h.       Wjith regard to the minimum size of its investments, ICICI Management
is definitely discouraging rupee loans below Rs. 500,000 and foreign exchange
loans below Rs. 100,000. At these two levels, an operation is likely to be



- 10 -
uneconomical from ICICI's point o-' view, i.e., the administrative expenses of
apnraising and administering the loan plus the financial expenses are not
equalled over the life of the loan by the interest and fees accruing from the
project.  ICICI 1anagement, however, feels that it is necessary under special
circumstances and when the project offers particular merits to provide loans
or other assistance even if the size of the loan makes the operation un-
profitable. However, the number of operations approved by ICICI which are
likely to be too small to be profitable, is small. By the end of 1962 only
5. of ICICI operations were below Rs. 1 million.  The number of such opera-
tions need not be large, India having other institutions at both the central
and state levels designed to assist small industries. The foreign exchange
loans under AID and KfHi were mostly for smaller amounts, the largest being
around USè, 800,000 and one loan even as small as US$ 14,000. The small loans
are mostly for special balancing items of equipment, often carry a bank
guarantee and therefore are not so costly to ICICI as one would expect for
such small loans.
45.       There has been no significant change in recent years in the size
of approvals. The average assistance to each company works out at Rs. 3.3
million and per project au Rs. 3.0 million, although as much as Rs. 15
million has been granted to a company over the years and one company has
received but Bs. 67,000.  Only 5-% of the loans are under Rs. 1,000,000; 17%
from Rs. 1,000,000 to Rs. 2,50C,000; 34i from Rs. 2,500,000 to Rs. 5,000,000
and 44-i. above -s. 5,000,000.
Problems
46.       A number of projects have been delayed.  The major dclays occur
after Board approval and in many cases are the result of difficulties in
obtaining the necessary government permits, especially ,,hen the issue of an
import license is recuired. Tlere are other causes of delay wThich also lie
outside ICICI's control, such as difficulties in acquiring the land, in
getting the security cleared and in obtainin,j allocation of such building
materials as cement and steel. Even projects itrth efficient management have
experienced delays; the longest delays, however, are likely to be found among
projects with inadequate managerial support.
47.       iAupee cost overruns have appeared in many projects.  In the large
majority of the cases these overruns are small; there are some large overruns
but their number is limited. The main causes for overruns are increases
in costs of building constructiorn and start-un delays. Only in a few cases
has ICIGI had to make a second loan to allow completion of a project, and
this has only occurred in the case of small comrpanies.  The staff of the
project department has gradually gained more experience in estimating costs
of projects and there seem to be feTwer and smaller overruns in the more
recent projects than in the projects approved in the early years of ICICI's
operations.
48.       Some projects have experienced problems in getting raw materials,
especially when the materials have to be imported and also when the project
manufactures a product new in India Thich renuires new sources of raw material



- 11 -
(i.e., steel tube and steel skelp).  ,,hen raw materials are not available
locally, the government may end up by issuing temporary import licences which
may not cover all of the company's renuirements; this usually means delay in
operation and a lower level of plant utilization. OLtside of raw materials,
the general shortages of electricity and transportation have also been sources
of difficulties.
49.       A review of all IBRD financed projects now in commercial operation
shows that on the whole, the most efficient projects are found among the
firms with foreign equity participation or with adequate foreign technical
collaboration.  There are, howfrever, exceptions in the case of projects for
which technical know-how is available locally or in the case of firms with
particularly experienced management.  Several of the projects which have run
into difficulties have weak technical collaboration arrangements as well as
inadeouate management.  Annex 8 showTs the number of ICICI's projects which
have contracted for foreign technical assistance.  ICICI tries to use its
influence in the early stages of discussions with the sponsors to insure that
the project will have proper technical management.
5o.       Actual project results are fairly well in line with ICICI appraisal
estimates, particularly for the mcre recent projects. A review of operating
projects and the result of the end-use team visit show that ICICI projects
follow the -eneral pattern of industrial conditions in India: they have a
rate of plant efficiency lower than in more advanced industrial countries,
are hioh cost producers, enjoy protected markets and hiji selling prices and
earn good profit.  A number of projects seem to be too sinall for efficient
economic production, which raises the product cost.  Selling prices are
generally from 25,/ to 505 above European countries and can go as high as
75< to 109,QQ% The uneconomic size of plant is somewhat attributable to the
industry licensing policies favoring a geographic distribution of industry
and relatively small producers to encourage future competition. It is
expected that future increased demand will justify plant enlargement.
51.       The number of projects which have run into difficulties either
during construction or in operations is small in comparison to the large
number of firms assisted and the size of ICICI operations. Some of them were
undertaken in the early years of operations and perhaps would not be assisted
now that ICICI apnraisal methods have improved considerably.  Some of them,
howgever, by their very risky nature are the type of projects which one expects
to find in the portfolio of a financing institution of the character of ICICI.
Of the twenty-six projects financed by I3TID funds now in commercial operation,
only four, representing about 10% of the total investments on these twenty-six
projects can be considered as marginal projects.  In the rupee loan operations,
two projects, representing 15!,; of the total investment in the fourteen pro-
jects now in commercial operation, can be put in the same category. Only one
project, involving a rupee loan and investment, out of 37 which have maturing
debt, is in arrears in payment of principal and interest.
Discretionary Investment Limit
52.       In a side agreement to the Bank's previous loan, ICICI has had the
right to commit sub-loans of xj500,000 or less per project without seeking the



- 12 -
Bank's prior approval. The total amount of such discretionary sub-loans is
limited to tB5 million. In view of the accumulated experience in I0ICI in
project appraisal, the ever increasing care devoted to project appraisal by
the management and staff, and the successful manner in which it has conducted
its operations, the discretionary limit of ,500,000 per project is unnecessari-
ly restrictive.  Of the 97 sub-loans totaling ;56 million approved under the
Bank's loans nearly 50% of the number and 80% of the amount have been sub-
loans in excess of $500,000. Consequently, the Bank has agreed to increase
the limit to $2 million per project, with no limit on the aggregate amount
of such comnitments.

IV.  F11THArCIAL POSITION
53.       ICICI's comparative summary balance sheets for December 31, 1959,
thlrough 1962 are shown in Annex 9. For easier reference, the balance sheet
for December 31, 1962 is condensed in the following table:
(Rs. million)          %
Liquid Assets                          74.1               23
Loans                                 166.5               52
Investments                            75.9               24
Other Assets                            2.3                1
Total Assets                    318.8             100
Current Liabilities                     7.1                2
Foreign Exchange Loans                 70.9               22
Rupee Loans (including the
Government Subordinate Advance)    175.0                 56
Share Capital                          50.0               16
Reserves and Surplus                   15.8                4
Total Canital & Liabilities    318.8               100
Assets
$h.       As shown ahove, total assets as of December 31, 1962 were
Rs. 318.8 million of which loans outstanding and industrial investments
totaled Rs. 242.4 million. Loans and indubtrial investments have grown
rapidly at an avera:èe annual rate of 33'; per year since the end of 1959,
and thev have reoresented an increas-ng nortion of I5ICI's total as-zets,
growing from 511'5 in 1959 to 75% in 1962, as ICICI's disbursements have
riasen.
55.       The quality of ICICI's loan portfolio is good.  Only one loan
on the rupec  account is delinquent, and none is delinquent on the _oreign
exchange account.  The rupee loan in difficulty has a princioal amount cf
Rs. 1.7 million; (ayments of Pus. 450,000 in principal and Rs. 130,000 in
interest are past due. ICICI also holds Rs. 5iaL,5oo in the ordinary shares
of tne same company. It is expected that the comDany will be liquidated with
little or not loss on the loan account, but with nearly a complete loss on
equity.  This hnoldin-, reoresents less than 1X, of the cost value of the
industrial portfolio and only 3`5 of ICICI's reserves and surplus.
56.       As of December 31, 1962, ICICI's portfolio of industrial invest-
ments, for which market quotations were available, hnad a market -ralue of
Ω. 67.25 m.llion comoared to a cost value of F's. 63.77 million.  T'he un-
quoted nortion of the oortfolio iwas 7s. 12.17 million at cost.  At the end



- 14 -
of 1961, the market value of' the qmt+ed portion of the portfolio was
Rs. 56.99 million with a cost value of Rs. 48.84 million. The decline in
the margin of market over cost from 16.4% to 5.5% of cost from 1961 to 1962
can be attributed to the external influences wqhich caused a decline in the
markets in 1962.
57.       ICICIts liquid assets have been consistently large, being largely
compoeed of cash and temporary investments held available for disbursement
in loans and long-term industrial investments. In 1961 and 1962 these funds
were entirely disbursed, and ICICI's liquid position would have contracted
accordingly, except that ICICI drew a large portion of the Government 4.2%5
loan for some large expected disbursements which did not occur before -the
year end. It is expected that ICICI's liquid assets will be considerably
reduced in 1963 and the followring years.
Borrowings
58.       ICICIts borrowings in foreign exchange through 1961 were entirely
from the Bank under the first three loans. In 1962, the Corporation drew on
the fourth loan and also began to draw on the AID loan of $5 million, which
was authorized in Ilarch, 1961. The terms of the four Bank loans have
differed as to interest rate, repayment p)eriod and discretionary investment
limit.  The terms of the fourth loan are the most flexibl- int that the rate
of interest is dependent on the Bank's rate at the time each sub-project is
credited, ard the repayment schedule is to ;e the composite of the various
schedl-es for the sub-projectsn  The final maturity date, ho, ever, is to be
no later than April 15, 1977, about 15 years from the date effective. The
discretionary limit has been raised to 2` 2 million per project wi^th no limit
on the total amount of the discretionary loans.  The terms of the AID loan
include an interest rate of 5% per annum on the outstanding amount and repay-
ments, in rupees under a maintenance of value clause, over a 14-year period
commencing in December, 1963. The loan is to be used for capital goods
imports and related services for industrial projects; amounts in excess of
$100,000 per project are tied to U.S. procurement. The loan agreement gives
ICICI a discretionary investrient limit of $250,000 in foreign exchange per
project, from all sources, in which AID funds are involved without submitting
to AID for prior approval.  The Kreditanstalt loan will bear interest at a rate
of 5'21% per annum on outstanding balances and a commitment fee of 4 of 1%
per annum on undisbursed commitments. It will be repayable in semi-annual
installments ending no later than December 31, 1982. The loan is to be
pari passu i^rith ICICI's other foreign exchange debt in payment and liquida-
tion. ICICI has been permitted a discretionary investment limit of
Di4 500,000 ($125,ooo) per project.
59.       ICICI's rupee borrowings through 1961 were almost entirely from
the Government of India advance of Rs. 75 million, which was made available
in cash in 1955. This loan is subordinate to all of ICICI's outstanding
debt and share capital; it is interest free and repayable in 15 annual
installments commencing in 1970. Due to the subordination of this advance
and its other generous terms, it can be considered to be part of ICICIs
equity. In the latter part of 1961 and in 1962, ICICI began to draw dowun
the second Government loan made available in 1959 under a Rs. 100 miLlioll



- 15 -
line of credit. This loan bears interest at the rate of 41% per annum on
amounts outstanding and is repayable in 10 annual installments commencing
in 1972. The loan is subordinate only to ICICI's foreign borrowings.
Reserves
50,       By the end of 1962, ICICI had accumulated Rs. 15.78 million in
reserves and surplus, eoual to 6.5%; of its loans and investments. The pre-
dominant portion of the reserves and surplus is attributable to the Capital
Reserve, which is the accumulation of capital gains, after a 30% capital
gains tax, on the sale of investments. This profit is not carried in the
income statement, and it is not available for dividends.  Commencing in 1959,
ICICI began to show appreciable capital gains on its sales of investments.
The sales and gains, before tax, are shown in the following table:
No. of                                   Capital gains           %

Total      18          Rs. 16.4 million         Rs. 12.6 million          77%
The after tax return on these gains was approximately Rs. 8.0 million repre-
senting an after tax profit of 49%. ICICITs current portfolio position,
described in paragraph 56 above, reveals that gains of this magnitude are not
general for the whole portfolio, at this time. Nevertheless, ICICIts
portfolio contained, on December 31, 1962, 14 issues out of 71 on which the
unrealized gain exceeded the cost price by more than 50%.  The total cost
price of these issues was Rs. 8.2 million with a market value of Rs, 13.1
million representing 13% of the cost value of the portfolio and 19% of the
market value. Consequently, ICICI could continue for a while to show a
similar gain on its sales of investments, assuming that the market remains
steady at its current and relatively deflated level. But short of an
appreciable recovery in the market, both ICICI's sales of investments and
the gains realized will probably decline over the near future. This will
have its obvious effect in reducing the build-up of reserves. The remain-
ing portions of reserves and surplus are allocations of net profits from
income before dividends. The Corporation is obligated under its Articles of
Association to set aside 25%O of net annual profit available for dividends in
a Special Reserve until the Reserve is equal to the still outstanding balance
of the Government's subordinated advance.
Income and Expenses
61.       ICICI's income, as shown in the comparative summary income state-
ments in Annex 10, has been growing at an average annual rate of about 3C%
per annum since 1959, which is nearly as large as the rate of growth in
loans and industrial investments. Total income grew even faster than the



- 16 -
average from 1961 to 1962, but profit before income tax in 1962 was only
slightly more than in 1961. As a percentage of inccme, profit before in-
come tax in 1961 was 64%; in 1962 it was 47%. The decline in the profit
to income ratio was principally due to increased financial charges on
foreign exchange borrowings and on the second Government loan, which bears
interest at 414% per year. moreover, ICICI was not able to disburse as large
an amount of the rupee borrowing in 1962 as had been anticipated. Consecuent-
ly, its large holding of liquid assets in 1962 cost more than was earned.
The average earnings on its temporary investments was about 3-3/L% per annum
in 1962.
62.       Administrative expenses have been well controlled in spite of thn
apparent large increase from 1961 to 1962. Of the Rs. 1.13 million shown in
the income statement for other administration expenses in 1962, Rs. 0.h0
million were non-recurring expenses involving a contribution to the National
Defense Fund and a funding of the Staff Gratuity Fund for prior years.
Except for these items, other administration expenses would have been about
Rs. 0.73 million and in line with the expenses in prior years.
63.       The return on net worth, as shown at the bottom of Annex 10, has
been satisfactoi'y, but these figures do not fully reveal ICCTCs profit-
ability because capital gains on the sale of investments are not reflected
in the income statement.  If the capital gains, shown in Annex 9, Note 2,
were added to the net profit from income the return on net worth would be
as follows:
(Rs. million)- - - - -
1959     1960      1961     1962
Net Profit on income           2.80      3.77     4.65      4.64
Capital gains after tax        1.37      2.49     2.43      1.68
Total Profit                   4.17      6.26     7.o8      6.32
Total Profit/Net Worth         7.7%    10.9%    11.3%       9.7%
6h.       In years prior to 1961, ICICI had no significant debt service re-
quirements to meet. In 1961 and 1962, however, its interest expense began
to have an effect on its profits. Principal repayment has not yet become a
large cash requirement. In 1962, ICICIts cash available for debt service
covered its debt service requirements of principal and interest by a factor
of 1.68:1. As rupee principal payments become due, commencing in 1970, the
ratio will more closely approach 1:1.
65.       In the years 1959 through 1962 ICICI paid in dividends 75% of its
net profit from income. This is the maximum amount permissible under its
Articles of Association. Except for the facts that ICICI has built up
sizable reserves from capital gains and that its loan and investment
portfolios are strong, its dividend policy would appear to be rather
-anerous as a percentage of profit on income.  Its current annual dividend



- 17 -
of Rs. 6.5 per Rs. 100 share is not high, however, compared to those of
other Indian financial institutions, especially commercial banks.
66.       The price of ICICIts shares in the market has shoim a recent
strength. The price range for ICICI shares had been from Rs. 69 to Rs. 88
up to 1961. In the early part of 1962, the price rose from Rs. 82 to Rs. 94,
as a result of a general rise in the market and a strong demand for indus-
trial shares. ICICI0s portfolio of industrial shares and its unrealized
capital gain of about Rs. 16 per share attracted some attention. But in the
subsequent market decline the price of ICICI's shares did not fall in
proportion to the general level. The index of industrial shares, reported
by the Government of India Economic Survey, fell from 194 to 168 from Nlay to
November, whereas ICICI's share price only declined to around Rs. 92 over
the same period.  (Y ith the recent rally in the market the quotations on
ICICI's shares rose to par by the end of April, 1963, for the first time
since the date of issue in 1955.) iuch of this strength can be attributed
to a very small turnover of ICICI's shares which, exclusive of large block
transfers, has been on the average of 5,000 to 7,500 shares per year or 1
to l!f<o' of the total.  The shareholders are obviously holding their shares
for the anticipated growth in both dividends and price and because the
snares are of good quality.

V. FUTURE PROSPECTS
Demand for ICICI Assistance
67.       ICICI1s projections of net approvals for all its financing opera-
tions show a total of Rs. 795 million for the 5 years 1963 through 1967,
compared to the total of Rs. 601 million approved in the 8 years since the
Corporation was created in 1955.
68.       In preparing the projection, ICICI assumed that its share of total
investments in private industry will be about 9% through the end of the
Third Plan in 1965. As estimates of total private investments beyond the
current Plan do not exist at present, the rate of ICICI approvals in 1966
and 1967 was conservatively assumed to remain at the 1965 level.
69.       ICICI has considered the impact of higher corporate taxation on
the future of its investments. Although business circles reacted un-
favorably to the prospect of a surtax on profits under the National Emergency
Budget, ICICI does not believe that the surtax will materially reduce the
demand for its services. The need for institutional finance, particularly
in foreign exchange, may even increase if private funds become scarce.
Approvals in the next five years are expected to be as follows:
Ö -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  (Rs.  Million)   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
Actual               Projected

The estimates for 1963 through 1967 are smaller than actual figures for 1962;
as approvals were abnormally high in 1962 due to a few large underwritings,
ICICI has based its annual growth on an average of earlier years. The
figures are very conservative in comparison with the historical pattern of
approvals shown in Annex 5.
Resources
70.       Against the projected approvals of Rs. 474 million in foreign ex-
change and Rs. 321 million in rupees, ICICI had, as of December 31, 1962,
available resources of only Rs. 55 million (:11.5 million) in foreign ex-
change, of which only $4 million was under existing IBRD loans, and Rs. 12
million in local currency.  (At the end of  March   1963, the amount availablke



19 -
for approvals under the Bank's loans had shrunk to  1450,000.) Annex 10 shows
a statement of ICICIts available resources, including the Kreditanstalt loan,
as of the end of December 1962.
71.       The proposed Bank loan of ";30 million, plus the available foreign
exchange resources of >ll.5 million under the AID, Kreditanstalt and previous
Bank loans, are expected to cover ICICI's estimated foreign exchange
approvals up to the early part of 1965. ICICI will have to arrange for
additional foreign exchange resources in 1964 to meet its requirements from
early 1965 on.
72.       ICICI expects to cover its requiremients in rupees from new borrow-
ings and internally generated funds, as shown below:

ICICI intends to obtain new rupee loans of at least Rs. S'K miil-:onr from the
Government of India or one of its agencies, but at the pn: i-i; -  arrange-
ments have been made. Since the cash flow projections in Anne- 12 indicate
that these funds will commence to be disbursed in 1964, ICICI should begin
negotiations with the Government as soon as possible.
Fuature Income, Expense and Profits
73.       The proforma income statements in Annex 13, show that ICICI's
profits from income will grow from Rs. 4.6 million in 1962 to Rs. 11.1
/  Undisbursed rupee approvals as shown in Annex 11.



- 20 -
million in 1967. Over the five year period, it is expected to total Rs. 43
million. The largest source of income will be interest received on foreign
exchange and rupee loans which will grow from Rs. 11.0 million to Rs. 15.3
million reflecting the large increase in loan disbursements. Interest ex-
pense will also grow over the period both absolutely and as a percentage of
total income, with the result that net profit on income, although increas-
ing in amount, declines as a percentage of total income. As ICICI employs
a higher proportion of borrowed and interest bearing funds in its opera-
tions, it is to be expected that its percentage of income in net profit
would be reduced.
74.       The after tax profit in capital gains from the sale of securities
has been conservatively estimated at Rs. 4.6 million over the five year
period compared with Rs. 8.0 million in the period from 1959 to 1962. Conse-
quently, ICICIts total expected profits of Rs. 48 million, as showm in the
summary statement above, appears to be a reasonable expectation over the
period. It is equal to a return of 12% on the average net wgorth which is
comparable to the average return of 9.9%J during the earlier period. The
surtax on profits under the National Emergency Budget wAill tend to reduce
the projected levels of ICICI's net profit, but it is not yet possible to
determine the full effect of the surtax on ICICIts projected profits.
Future Financial Position
75.       The estimates of ICICI's future financial position are shown in
the summary proforma balance sheets in Annex 14. The proforma balance
sheets show a growth in total assets and total liabilities and capital of
over Rs. 400 million from 1962 through 1967. This growth will more than
double the financial size of ICICI over the five-year period. On the asset
side of the balance sheet, the growth is dominated by a projected increase
in net loans and investments of Rs. 457 million. The average rate of this
increase is 35, per annum, which is only slightly faster than loans and in-
vestments grew during the period from 1959 through 1962.  l4oreover, a break-
down of the loans and investments in 1967 into the sub categories shows that
the current trends in foreign exchange loans, rupee loans and investments
will continue in the future.  Foreign exchange loans will grow from 43% to
52% of the total, rupee loans from 26% to 31% and investments from under-
*,ritings and direct subscriptions will decline from 31% to 17% of the total.
76.       ICICI's cash and temporary investments will be drawn down from
Rs. 69.3 million in 1962 to Rs. 14.6 million in 1967 to meet the cash re-
quirements for loans and investments. This decrease, of nearly 80%, indi-
cates a significant change in ICICI's liauidity. 'Ohereas, in 1962 and prior
years, I&ICI maintained its liquid or current assets at 23% or higher of
total assets and from two to six times the current annual rate of net rupee
disbursements, the changes proposed through 1967 would reduce liouid assets
to V% of total assets and equal to 100% of net annual rupee disbursements.
The proposed change will be more in line with liquidity reouirements and
will reduce the burden of idle funds on earnings.



- 21 -
77.       ICICI1s reserves are expected to more than double over the period,
growing from Rs. 15.8 million in 1962 to Rs. 44.1 million in 1967. The
largest increase will be in the reserves from profit on income since ICICI
expects to allocate a larger share of profits to reserves than has been true
of the past. The increase in the Capital Reserve from capital gains, on the
other hand, is relatively small.  In 1967, total reserves are expected to
equal 6.3% of total loans and investments, approximately the same as in 1962
(6.5%).
Debt/Equity
78.       ICICI's debt/equity position is expected to rise from 1.7:1 in
1962 to nearly 4:1 in 1967, as its proposed debt becomes committed over the
next few years. Annex 15 shows a yearly forecast of ICICI's debt/equity
position through 1967. It is expected that the ratio of debt to equity will
exceed the current limit of 3:1 in 1965.11 Therefore, ICICI has requested
that the Bank permit an increase in the limit from 3:1 to 4:1. The alterna-
tive to this request would be to require ICICI to raise additional equity in
order to stay within the present 3:1 limit, The amount of equity required
to accomplish this in 1967 would be Rs. 53 million, rhich exceeds ICICI's
present share capital of Rs. 50 million. With ICICI's shares having just
reached par, and the currently sensitive state of the share market, an issue
of this magnitude would be difficult and costly to sell. Moreover, ICICI
would not be able to maintain the current dividend rate, Tihich wrould further
depress the share prices.
79.       An increase in the debt/equity limit to 4:1 would not significantly
raise the risk of lending to IICI. ICICI has 8 years of successful opera-
tions behind it, years of continuous growth and improvement. Its lending
policies are sound and the high caliber of its organization and management
assures the continuation of these policies. ICICI has maintained a proper
balance between its loan and investments Which are well diversified over
groups of companies and industries and fairly widely distributed geographi-
cally. ICICI's loans and investments constitute on the average only about
20% of total project investments. ICICI maintains a high and ever improving
standard of appraisal technique and follow-up for its investment projects.
Furthermore, the Rs. 100 million Government loan wihich is included in debt
is subordinated to foreign debt. Consequently, the Bank has agreed to
raise the debt/equity limit to 4:1.
1/ Debt is defined as rupees borrowed plus the portion of foreign exchange
lines of credit committed under agreement with the ultimate borrowers.

VI. ECONO'MIC JUSTIFICATION
80.       ICICI continues to fulfill its three basic objectives of assisting
the development of private industry, encouraging both local and foreign
private capital participation in its financing and assisting the expansion
of the capital market in India.
81).      It is estimated that as a result of its operations to date, ICICI
would bring about a total capital mobilization of Rs. 3,144 million or five
times its total approved investments, an increase in gross domestic product
of Rs. 2,074 million and a direct increase of some 60,000 additional jobs.
82.       The following figures show that for the three types of institutions
specialized in providing long-term finance to industry, ICICI's disbursements
formed 18% of the total for the 1955-1960 period and jumped to 35$  of total
for 1961/62.
Disbursements
State
Finance
IFC - India   Corporations   ICICT   Total
1955-196o            378.4          170.7        124.6   673.7
1961-1962            174.1          128.2       158.O   460.3
83.       During the Second Plan (1955-60) some Rs. 6,500-7,000 million was
the estimated investment in private industrT, Of this amount,almost half
Tay be assumed to have been industry's sel--enerated or self-provided funds
and just over 20% direct foreign investment. Of the balance of some
Rs. 2,000 million, financed through credit institutions, ICICIts approved
investment provided around 13%.
84.       Private investment in industry during the Third Plan (1961-66)
which was estimated at Rs. 10,000 million is, in view of recent events,
likely to be more of the order of Hs. 8,500 million, of which some 65% may
again be presumed to come from industryts self-enerated funds and direct
foreign investment.  The balance of Rs. 2,500 million would be financed
through credit institutions. Of this sum ICICI's approvals during this
period are estimated to form one third.
85.       Even in quantitative terms this would be considered impressive.  A
major part of ICICI's contribution to the economy of India, however, is in
the quality of its investments. These investments have come to be more con-
centrated in newer types of industries such as paper and paperboard, wire
ropes, electric cables, steel tubes, electric lamps and many others for which,
if imported, scarce foreign exchange would have been required. Also much of
recent ICICI investments have been male in the basic industries of engineeriic
and heavy chemicals which stimulate further industrialization.  It is in these
non-traditional and non-familiar industries wehere the high standard of
appraisal carried out by ICICI has been valuable in developing Sound nrojects.



- 23 -
It is also in these industries that foreign technical know-how and capital
have been necessary and have been encouraged to participate.
86.       During the eight years of ICICI operation the development of the
capital market in India has undergone striking development. Shareholding
has become widespread, reaching close to one million of which just over 975l
have holdings of less than Rs. 10,000. The stock exchanges, until the
present emergency starting with the Chinese invasion last fall depressed the
market, have been doing a brisk business.
87.       Many institutions, new and old, public as well as private, have
taken greater interest in participating in industry through investment in
shares and debentures. Commercial banks, finding their foreign exchange
business curtailed through exchange stringency and trade restrictions have
gone cautiously but increasingly into term financing for industry. They have
been encouraged in this by the Reserve Bank and by the Refinance Corporation
for Industry Limited, which in the last few years has approved some Rs. 270
million of refinancing. A large number of brokers, commercial banks, and the
Life Insurance Company of India participate in underwriting. ICICI, however,
still holds a very important place among these institutions. In its pains-
taking and competent appraisal of projects it sets a high standard fcr all to
follow. In the early days, ICICI set the pace for other institutions in
underwriting and, more recently, it has more and more participated with The
Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Life Insurance Corporation,
commercial banks, and brokers, in underwriting large issues. Furthermore,
by making available to the market every year a small but attractive number
of securities from its portfolio, it has aided the development of the
capital market and has spread its assistance over a wAder base.
88.       ICICI's share of total underwriting, which was over a third at the
beginning of its operations, was reduced wthen capital market development and
boom attracted many other institutions to underwriting. The recent emergency
and the consequent taxation measures which may affect the availability of risk
capital will provide a new challenge and opportunity for ICICI to assist
sound new capital issues which may not find such ready takers in the present
state of the market. ICICI is able and wqilling to provide the necessary
support for such issues.

VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND -.CnI ;DNT)1ATIONS
89.       In its eight years of operation, ICICI has become a mature
development finance institution with a strong organization and a sound
financial position. Its oDerations over this period have brought it a
long way towards fulfilling the objectives for which it was created.
Through its assistance to industry, its participations with local and
foreign capital in industrial financing and its role in the growth of
the capital market, ICICI has made a significant contribution to the
economy of India.
90.       ICICI has maintained its high level of management and has
continued to improve the quality and number of its operational staff.
It has followed sound operational nolicies and has exercised great care
in the appraisal of the projects it has financed. It has taken steps to
improve its follow-up procedures and has set up a special section for
this purpose. ICICI's investment portfolio is properly diversified and
is of high quality. Its earning capacity and reserve position are good.
91.       ICICI0s operations are expected to remain at a high level over
the next five years.  It is estimated that its annual approvals of foreign
exchange loans will be the equivalent of about ¢20 million and approvals of
rupee loans and investments will be about Rs. 65 million. ICICI's cur-
rently  rvailable resources, including the $450,000 remaining unsder the
Bankls lcans as of the end o" Piarch, 1963, are inadequate to meet this
demand. The Corporation will, therefore, have to borrow amounts of about
10O nmillion in foreign exch&nge and Rs. 90 million in local currency to
cover its requ-rements.  It is not proposed that ICICI should now attempt
to raise additional share capital because of the currently sensitive state
of the market. The proposed Bank loan of .30 million, together with the
resources available under existing loans, is expected to meet ICICI's
foreign exchange needs until the early part of 1965. For the remainder,
ICICI will have to seek additional foreign exchange funds. ICICI has
plans to increase its rupee resources through borrowings in India. Since
it appears that ICICI will need rupee funds for disbursement in 1964, it
should commence negotiations very soon.
92.       As ICICI commits its increased borrowings over the next five
years, its ratio of committed debt to equity is expected to exceed the
current limit of 3:1 during 1965, and to rise to 4:1 in 1967. Due to the
high quality of its loan and investment portfolios, and its sound operat-
ing policies and practices, an increase in its debt to four times equity
is justified.
93.       ICICI is a suitable institution for a Bank loan of $30 million.
The amortization schedule should be a composite of the repayment schedules
of the sub-loans, but with the final payment falling due approximately 15
years after the date of sining. The interest rate should vary according
to the Bank's rate at the time sub-loans are credited to the loan account.
