1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country and Sector Background. In 2007, Nigeria had a population of around 140
million, with a decentralized structure, comprising 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory
(FCT) and 774 Local Government Authorities. Responsibility for the education sector is
generally divided among LGAs (primary), States (Secondary), and the Federal Government
(Tertiary). At the time, Nigeria’s education sector faced a wide array of challenges, mainly
inequitable access; poor education quality and relevance, weak management, planning and
monitoring capacity; and inadequate and inefficient funding. Nigeria was significantly behind
in its goals to achieve universal basic education, with low primary enrollment rates in 2007 of
only 64 percent for boys and 57 percent for girls, and the situation was more severe in low-
income areas and the Northern areas. The magnitude of Nigeria’s educational participation
problem is conveyed by the fact that the Global Monitoring Report for the MDGs estimates that
Nigeria contributes about 30-40 percent of the world’s total number of out-of-school children.

2.      Reliable measures of student achievement learning outcomes point to low education
quality with wide differences across the country. The system was characterized by a high level
of unqualified teachers, and a skewed distribution of teachers (fewer female) in favor of urban
areas. As a result, teacher-student ratios varied widely across regions, ranging, for example,
from 1:36 in Kwara State to 1:100 in Kaduna. Policy-making, planning, management and
monitoring suffered from fragmented decision-making compounded by the lack of clarity of
roles and responsibilities across Federal, State and LGA levels, and parastatals. Public
spending on education by the federal government was estimated around 20 percent of total
education expenditures, with the remainder financed mostly by the state and local governments.
Despite increases in public funding for education, the education system suffered from low
internal and external efficiency. These challenges were common across the States of Kaduna,
Kano and Kwara, whose selection was based on the following key criteria: (a) demonstrated
commitment and ownership of the State Governments to the development of the education
sector; (b) quality of the Education Sector Plan; and (c) poor educational indicators.

3.      Economic and country context. Educational interventions to address the above issues
were deemed crucial to ensure a higher level of human capital development for effective
service delivery, and catalyzing non-oil growth, along with the need for transparency and
accountability for better governance. This focus became even more important in light of
Nigeria’s young population forming the majority. In 2007, despite being the world sixth largest
exported of oil and relatively good economic growth, its per capita income of less than US$500
positioned Nigeria as one of the poorest countries in the world. Thus, given States and LGAs’
responsibilities for education as mentioned above, the SESP was launched, with a state-based
focus and deeper involvement of LGAs, in recognition of the urgent need to improve the
quality of primary and lower secondary education in the three states as indispensable to
creating a stronger work force. In the context of a renewed emphasis on democracy, the
“whole school? approach was adopted to address education quality through greater school
autonomy and accountability, availability of a larger and qualified teaching force,



                                              1
teaching/learning materials, and management strengthening and capacity-building. SESP,
though, had to operate in a most difficult and highly challenging environment to bring about
educational improvements.

4.       Rationale for Bank Assistance. In 2003, the Federal Government adopted a National
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), which emphasized educational
reforms as a vital tool for socioeconomic empowerment, followed by a strategy focused on
prioritizing education provision at state level. Accordingly, the SESP was anchored in the
Country Program Strategy (CPS) aiming at accelerating progress towards the key education
MDGs, creating the basis for sustainable development, with emphasis on the areas with low
schooling participation levels, particularly for girls. This was also operationalized in the
education focused objectives of the Bank’s Strategy through the Africa Action Plan. Given its
strong history of involvement in the sector, the Bank was able to lead the SESP, working
closely with other development partners to support state-specific education programs. The
Bank also provided institutional capacity-building at all levels of the federal system,
specifically to improve management, planning, monitoring and evaluation, including learning
assessment. By targeting three of the poorest states in the Northern region, the SESP sought to
create a “test bed? for the implementation of cost-effective quality improvement programs and
activities in basic education (primary and junior secondary) through a “whole school
development? strategy. Thus, the shift in focus to a few states, and devolution of resources
directly to schools, represented a paradigm shift, given the States’ strong leadership, ownership,
and commitment. In addition to basic education, the Bank was also supporting the Government
on design of policy options in areas fundamental to the promotion of economic growth, such as
science and technology education.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      The project development objective was to improve the quality of basic education
(primary and junior secondary school) in targeted Local Government Areas (LGAs) in
participating states (Kaduna, Kano and Kwara), focusing particularly on the education of girls.
The key outcome indicators agreed between the Government and the World Bank to measure
achievement of this development objective were:

       Increased primary completion rates for boys and girls in targeted LGAs;
       Increased junior secondary completion rates for boys and girls in targeted LGAs;
       Increased transition rates from primary to junior secondary for boys and girls in targeted
       LGAs; and
       Improved learning conditions in project schools based on 2007 baseline benchmarks.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.      There were no revisions to the project development objective.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      Based on the project development objective and investment activities, the intended
direct beneficiaries of project financing can be identified as: (a) primary and junior secondary
school-aged children, particularly in remote project LGAs, who would benefit from lower
school-related costs, and more instructional materials, and improved physical learning
environment (about 599,000 children, of which 44 percent girls); (b) junior secondary school-
aged youth, particularly in poor LGAs, who would benefit from increased opportunity to attend
secondary school (about 53,300; of which 34 percent girls); and (c) about 16,240 teachers in
about 1,520 primary and junior secondary schools, 21 LGEAs in the States of Kaduna, Kano
and Kwara targeted on the basis of poverty, demonstrated commitment and ownership in the
education sector, the quality of education sector plans, and poor education indicators, especially
girl’s participation. Indirect project beneficiaries were communities (parents and members of
the school-based management committees, whose children benefited from the improved
learning environment), staff of public agencies at state, local and government levels, who
would benefit from institutional capacity-building activities. For two pilots introduced after the
MTR, the number of direct beneficiaries was about: (i) 10,000 girls under the Conditional
Cash Transfer pilot; and (ii) 1,000 households and 30 personnel who obtained diplomas in ECD
under the Early Childhood Education pilot. Indirect beneficiaries from these pilots included
State, LGA, and school personnel in terms of institutional capacity-building to implement these
pilots.

LGAs; (2) Quality Improvement in Basic Education in targeted LGAs; (3) Institutional
Development; and (4) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.

9.       Component 1: The School Development Scheme (US$19.5 million). The objective
was to: (a) empower and support School-Based Management Committees to plan for and
improve teaching, learning, and participation in their schools, especially for girls and the poor;
and (b) provide innovative grants to the SBMCs to help them achieve their improvement plans
within some flexible parameters balancing the need for both improvement in education quality
and the physical learning environment, including a requirement of at least 35 percent of
activities under the annual grant to benefit girls. This component, aimed at decentralizing
resources to schools and communities (SBMCs), adopted a phased approach starting with only
470 schools out of 1,500 as recipients of these grants in the first year. This was determined by
a funding formula, comprising a base amount for all schools and a per-student amount up to a
maximum ceiling. Grants were disbursed directly to schools’ bank accounts. The underlying
principles, guidelines and procedures formed part of an agreed School Development Scheme
Grant Manual (SDSGM). In addition, technical assistance was provided to build capacity
among schools and LGEAs in school development planning, school leadership and
management, and to support implementation of school development plans and grants (including
training in procurement, financial management and accountability).

10.      Component 2: Quality Improvement in Basic Education in targeted LGAs
(US$32.4 million). The objective was to improve the quality of education by enhancing the
environment for teaching and learning through targeted activities relating to (i) teacher training,
(ii) learning materials and equipment, and (iii) physical facilities (e.g. classrooms, sanitation
and water). The design was such that schools would benefit, depending on needs, either from
all three interventions or the first two. It was expected that these combined activities would
lead to a more coordinated approach to meeting the minimum conditions for a conducive
school learning environment, with appropriately trained teachers, sufficient textbooks and
teaching/learning materials, adequate classroom space, sufficient furniture, adequate water and
sanitation facilities for both boys and girls. The sub-components were:

     Sub-component 1: Teacher Professional Development (US$5.34 million). This sub-
     component financed activities to: (a) support teachers in implementing the basic
     education curriculum, using textbooks and a variety of teaching and assessment methods;
     (b) develop professional leadership and mentoring capabilities of head teachers, principals,
     and school supervisors; and (c) develop teacher educators’ capacity for effective delivery
     and mentoring of teachers in their classrooms. The target for general support in project
     LGAs was about 18,900 primary and JSS teachers and head teachers/principals, 8,800 for
     training in teacher professional development. This model of school-based in-service
     teacher development, supported by mentoring and school visits was to be evaluated by
     experienced monitors on in-classroom interaction analysis. Provision was also made for
     an annual evaluation study to provide feedback into design and implementation.

     Sub-component 2: Textbooks, Instructional Materials and Equipment (US$7.1
     million). This sub-component aimed at improving student learning by: (a) improving the
     availability of textbooks for students, and teachers’ guides, workbooks and textbooks for
     teachers according to agreed ratios; (b) providing supplementary instructional materials
     and equipment to primary and junior secondary schools in the targeted LGAs; (c)
     strengthening the Textbook Unit or Textbooks and Instructional Materials Unit in each
     State; and (d) ensuring adequate, secure and clean storage for books and other
     instructional materials. While the focus was on textbook provision, core materials,
     instructional materials, including laboratory/science equipment were also procured. In
     addition, capacity-building was provided to State Governments’ textbooks and materials
     units. Support was also provided to each State in adopting a comprehensive and relevant
     textbook policy.

     Sub-component 3: Expansion, Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Basic School
     Facilities in target LGAs (US$19.98 million). This sub-component supported school
     improvements to increase access to quality basic education to the neediest schools in
     selected LGAs. Schools with the greatest needs for infrastructure upgrading were
     selected for improvements in order to meet the UBEC Minimum Standards for Planning
     of Basic Education Infrastructure (June 2006), with some modification to minimize
     construction costs and to suit local needs. A total of 98 primary and junior secondary
     schools were targeted in 21 LGAs in the three States. The project financed classroom
     rehabilitation, additional classrooms in overcrowded schools, toilet blocks for girls and
     boys, provision of potable/drinking water to all selected schools by means of boreholes,


                                                4
     basic standard school furniture, general science laboratories, and school library, and
     office space.

11.     Component 3: Institutional Development for Key Functions of the State Ministries
of Education and LGEAs (US$4.98 million). This component aimed at strengthening the
capacity of SMOEs and LGEAs in participating States to plan, manage, and monitor the
delivery of education services. More specifically, the project supported the implementation of
key reforms and capacity development activities, which included: (a) the design and
establishment of an effective education management information system (EMIS) in the SMOEs
and SUBEBs, including the development of the ability of the SMOEs to collect, analyze and
disseminate information related to inputs, processes, outputs and other performance, including
management information systems; (b) the development of policy and planning capacities at the
state and LGA levels, including key policy studies, administration and coordination capacities
of LGEAs and educational leadership at the school level; and (c) reform of the Inspectorate.

     Sub-component 1: Strengthening Education Management Information Systems
     (EMIS)(US$1.62 million). This sub-component sought to equip the states with an
     integrated EMIS system in order to increase organizational efficiency and effectiveness
     through data collection and analysis of education data. Support was provided to establish
     an EMIS unit, in addition to technical assistance, training equipment, testing and
     operationalizing the EMIS in each of the participating States.

     Sub-component 2: Capacity Development for Management and Planning (US$1.87
     million – financed by DfID). This sub-component aimed at: (a) strengthening strategic
     planning, budgeting and financial management; (b) improving staff performance and
     teacher recruitment, deployment and management; and (c) improving public
     accountability. Activities supported included key policy studies, management training
     and establishment of a system/mechanism to publicize education budgets, performance
     targets and outputs, and results of inspections and annual education reviews.
     Implementation of this sub-component was financed by DfID through parallel financing
     arrangements, with joint supervisions with the World Bank.

     Sub-component 3: Reform of the Inspectorate (US$1.49 million of which IDA:
     US$0.49 million and DfID: US$1 million). Financed activities aimed at revamping the
     existing education inspection services and introducing quality inspector standards training.
     Other activities included institutional analysis of inspectorate services across each State to
     establish a quality assurance inspection system. In addition, workshops were also carried
     out to build capacity for inspectors and school supervisors.

12.    Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.5 million).
This component supported project coordination, management, financial management,
procurement, and monitoring and evaluation, and the implementation of an information
communications strategy.

     Sub-component 1: Project Coordination (US$1.36 million). While the SESP was
     implemented by the State Ministry of Education in close coordination with the relevant


                                                5
     LGEAs, parastatals (e.g. SUBEB, the FMOE, and federal agencies - UBEC, ETF), a
     Project Support Unit was established under the SMOE to provide greater project focus.
     The project financed investment and non-salary operating costs of the PSU, and an
     information and communications strategy to inform the general public about the project’s
     activities, to highlight the benefits of education, especially for girls, and to build support
     from among key beneficiary/stakeholder groups.

     Sub-component 2: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.14 million). This sub-
     component aimed at supporting the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation
     system at the State level to monitor and evaluate project outcomes and broader
     educational trends. The purpose was two-fold: (a) to monitor and evaluate project
     progress and provide continuous feedback to improve performance; and (b) to build the
     capacity of the SMOEs to monitor and evaluate progress towards achieving the objectives
     of the States’ Education Sector Plans and associated operational plans. A key role of the
     SMOEs was to update data regularly to facilitate reporting on key performance indicators
     as identified in their Results Framework. This sub-component also financed various
     policy and evaluation studies on key education issues such as access, quality, financing,
     teacher effectiveness, annual reviews and impact assessments.

1.6 Revised Components

     The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

13.     Project Restructuring. The project was formally re-structured and the Credit re-
allocated in October 2010. The restructuring initiated the detailed design process for two
related and innovative pilot projects, to be introduced in Kano State, the poorest of the three
project states. The Early Childhood Education program (approximately US$560,000) was
designed to give children a “head start? before entry to primary school, with measures designed
to improve parenting skills, leading to a more supportive household learning environment.
Under the school development program, the Conditional Cash Transfer Program (CCT) (about
US$1.53 million) was introduced to improve girls’ attendance in basic education and promote
the transition of girls from primary to secondary school, i.e. lowering the risk of dropping out.

14.    Both pilots fully reflected the project development objective and the federal
government’s strategy for advancing girls education through CCTs and ECE. They were a
response to the need to be more proactive in addressing girls’ education resulting from the
Human Development Sector Workshop in Abuja, when the need to reach MDG for girls’
education was flagged, where Kano and Northern Nigeria considerably lagged behind.
Additionally, extra funding for the existing School Development Grant Scheme (SDS) was
included, which was made possible by budget space created by the large savings in textbook
and classroom construction costs from adopting World Bank procurement guidelines.

15.   The US$20 million unallocated category (plus savings from exchange rate fluctuations
of approximately US$5 million, and the large savings from classroom construction and


                                                6
textbooks) was re-distributed among project components and credit categories through a formal
letter of agreement. This reallocation reflected revised state work plans, which included an
expansion of the SDS, of capacity building and the new pilot programs (CCTs and ECE).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     Detailed project preparation, guided by the shift in 2005 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) to “lead states,? took place over 13 months. This approach provided greater focus than
national interventions, given the strong commitment and ownership by States, LGAs, and
schools. Project design was thorough and based on extensive studies and institutional analyses.
While it was not complex, it had to take account of lessons of experience in a sector that had a
poor track record in past Bank operations, and a difficult institutional climate. However, as
pointed out by the Quality of Supervision Assessment, inadequate arrangements were made to
deal with potential timeliness or effectiveness difficulties related to parallel financing. The
Project Development Objective was relevant and appropriate, and the baselines and targets for
components were generally reasonable, though a few of them, including some development
outcome indicators, had to be re-calibrated during implementation on the basis of more reliable
data. This caused initial measurement difficulties of progress against indicators. For example,
there were no baseline data on learning assessment, one of the main development objective
indicators. Technically, the design reflected international good practice, and provided enough
details to ensure smooth implementation by each State. Moreover, the selection criteria for
LGAs and schools were sound focusing on poverty, gender, readiness and willingness to
implement education reforms. The project preparation team had the right skills mix, which is
reflected in the diverse tasks undertaken to meet readiness criteria.

17.     A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) carried out in November 2006 endorsed the
state-based approach as potentially viable for improving education in Nigeria, and the project
content, and recognized the process of state-based engagement and ownership. It indicated the
need for greater clarity on the “whole school? approach, particularly how various inputs would
be integrated into packages at school level, and what would be the relationship between
demand-driven school grants and major funding by state governments through centralized
procurement.

18.     The project team endeavored to incorporate most of the QER’s recommendations on the
re-formulation of the project development objective in light of what can be realistically
achieved over a period of 3-4 years, strong focus on implementation, with streamlined
responsibilities at all levels, and addressing implementation readiness challenges, except in the
area of monitoring and evaluation. The task team was unable to address weaknesses related to
the results framework, including the availability of baseline data before Board approval,
primarily due to time constraints

19.     Lessons reflected in the project design. Key lessons (in Nigeria and from elsewhere)
reflected in the project design included the need for: (a) a realistic assessment of institutional
capacity and level of readiness before project effectiveness; (b) strong leadership, political



                                                7
ownership and commitment to education reforms; (c) the credit amount per State to be
sufficient to have a catalytic effect on implementation of education sector plans; (d) a jointly
agreed results-based M&E system; and (e) availability of technical assistance, given weak
implementation capacity, especially in areas such as project implementation, procurement,
financial management and monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the design included
measures to address issues of delayed implementation in past projects, low disbursements, and
funds cancellation.

20.     Risks and their mitigation. The Project Appraisal Document identified important
country, sector and operational risks, with specific mitigation measures. Although the PAD
flagged two systemic risks associated with M&E and technical assistance as lessons, these were
not identified in the risk matrix. Eventually, these two risks did materialize during
implementation. The delayed planned establishment of EMIS had an adverse effect on project
monitoring, as this did not initially enable assessment of progress on key performance
indicators against baseline data. Similarly, delayed technical assistance from DfID parallel
financing affected critical project activities (e.g. capacity-building and M&E) which depended
on technical assistance right from project implementation start-up. These risks were partially
mitigated through IDA funding.

2.2 Implementation

21.     The project was implemented as designed, adopting a novel approach, and disbursing
on time (over a three-year period), in spite of initial weak capacity of implementing agencies.
Key factors that affected implementation were delays in project effectiveness (about a year) due
to elections, in timing of initial technical assistance for institutional capacity strengthening, and
in establishment of an M&E system with a credible Educational Management Information
System. Implementation experience shows that: (a) the design proved to be sound; (b) initially,
since the States started from a low-base with no experience with World Bank education
projects, there was a steep learning curve at the outset, especially given delayed technical
assistance; (c) Bank and Project Support Units worked closely in identifying and resolving
problems as a team, which was boosted by regular monthly video-conferencing of the Bank
project team with all three States’ representatives; (d) however, the time it took for
development of the Teacher Management Information System and M&E system became a
handicap to monitoring project progress against project indicators; and (e) in some cases, the
location of toilets posed difficulties in attracting girls to schools in that they were built adjacent
to those of boys, which is culturally unacceptable in certain project LGAs.

22.     With regard to CCT and ECE pilots, with hindsight, the design of these pilots had a
flaw in that their duration was too short to enable their full gestation and complete evaluation,
which would have contributed to greater project impact. Since both these pilots were
introduced much after the mid-term review, with the necessary initial preparatory activities to
enable them to be underway, their implementation period was in effect reduced substantially,
resulting in non-completion of desired multiple tranches by the closing date. Nevertheless, it
was envisaged from the outset that the CCT and ECE pilots would continue to form part of
broader interventions beyond this project.




                                                  8
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

23.     M&E Design. The project design for M&E was comprehensive, with a full set of
indicators in the PAD. Given the unavailability of reliable baseline data at the time of appraisal,
the project team indicated then that the baseline would be revised subsequently. This caused
difficulties of interpretation at the outset. Some key project indicators could have been fine-
tuned for precision. The QER panel emphasized the importance of finalizing indicators and
baseline data before Board Approval, but this did not materialize due to technical assistance
delays impacting on monitoring and evaluation activities, particularly the need for an updated
baseline

24.    At Project Entry. Although systems were in place at State level to generate project
development outcome information, M&E was considered weak at this point. Learning
assessments using Mathematics and Reading Comprehension test scores for learners and
teachers were conducted by the government with support from the World Bank and the DfID
CUBE project. On the other hand, the project depended on information from the EMIS and
Annual School Census for other key performance indicators. The analysis of these data sets
took more than a year to be finalized in Kwara and Kaduna, and about 18 months to finalize in
Kano, and neither LGA- nor school-specific data were readily available at the time, which
made it difficult to assess progress under project components initially. However, the project
undertook significant capacity-building of relevant project officers responsible for M&E, and
began to take steps to establish M&E systems to generate data for project intermediate results
and outputs.

25.     At Mid-Term/Project Implementation. M&E systems were still weak, but had
improved from project start-up. Data were available for Kwara and Kaduna, while Kano
worked hard to get the state EMIS data running and to analyze the annual school census of
previous years. Trained state M&E officers were taking responsibilities for data collection.
Following the MTR, the Bank supported the officers to design data summary tools with which
to aggregate data from LGEAs and schools. The M&E officers trained the LGEA desk officers
to use the tools to collect quarterly school reports. At this point, school report cards also
became available and reports were aggregated by the M&E officers. Data from the school
report cards formed the basis for the focus of technical support to schools requiring attention.
The M&E staff in the PSU designed quarterly reporting templates that were used for reporting
and reviewing key performance indicators as well as component outputs from mid-term
onwards. Generally, Bank staff supported the PSU with on-the-job training, mentoring and
follow-up, which led to significant improvement in the quality of monitoring information and
reporting. Eventually, when the analysis of the school census was finalized, reliable data
became available for baseline in the three states for key performance indicators for transition
and completion at primary and JSS levels, as well as for specific LGAs and schools. However,
the needed adjustments to these indicators were not reflected as formal revisions to the project
in the form of restructuring, due to the late stage of implementation. Both the early and closing
period of project implementation was challenging in the face of elections disruptions.

26.     At Project Closing. A year before the project closed, three important assessments were
identified as essential for documenting progress towards achieving the PDO, and relating the



                                                9
causal chain of results on the SESP project. These included the School Development Scheme
Assessment, the Learning Assessment and a Teacher Professional Development Assessment.
These assessments were commissioned in March 2011 and conducted by professional local and
international consultants. The reports were produced and validated by key stakeholders during
the last supervision mission in Kaduna. The information in these reports, together with
monitoring information from the EMIS and strategic information from the Annual School
Census, have formed the basis for the results reported.

27.     M&E utilization. Initially, the delay in developing the system of data collection and
analysis prevented any meaningful use, the more so to monitor key project performance
indicators. However, when more data became available after the MTR, project supervision was
more guided by the tracking of project performance against these indicators. In fact, in each of
these states educational statistics reports were produced after the MTR, in addition to Census
reports, which also provided a basis for the national publication of census reports for education
policy dialogue.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28.     Environment and Social. There were no major issues concerning the Bank’s
safeguards policy. Project activities were undertaken at existing sites and structures, and there
was no land acquisition or resettlement. ISRs consistently rated the project as satisfactory for
overall compliance with applicable operational policies. There were no significant deviations
or waivers from Bank safeguards and fiduciary policies and procedures during project
implementation.

29.     Financial Management. Acceptable financial management arrangements were
maintained during project implementation except the setting up of FMU for Kano State.
Discrepancies were corrected promptly. All annual financial statements were submitted on
time and received unqualified opinions, and there were no outstanding financial reports. ISRs
consistently rated the project as satisfactory for overall compliance with applicable operational
policies.

30.    Procurement. Although procurement risk was rated as “substantial “at entry,
procurement performance was satisfactory throughout implementation. There was effective
dialogue with the implementing institution to address procurement issues. The regular monthly
monitoring meetings contributed to resolution of issues promptly.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.    Institutional. All three States and participating LGAs and school have benefited
substantially in terms of capacity-building. Trained human resources will continue to be
available at all these levels, including school-based committees. The concerned state
Governments will continue improve upon their education sector plans and education strategies,
based on the lessons of implementation experience, which will include the funding of the
various systems built in the education sector. Some of them have gone further in terms of




                                               10
implementing key project activities through their own funding, as institutionalized under their
medium-term expenditure framework.

32.     More specifically, after project closing, the post-completion operation, including the
CCT was mainstreamed within the State Ministries of Education and the State Universal Basic
Education Board, with trained resources, equipment and logistics. The Kano State Government
has embarked on complementary activities such as school feeding, and free uniforms to sustain
efforts of CCT and ECE in order to increase primary education enrollment and completion for
girls. The establishment of Quality Assurance Bureaus, staffed with qualified personnel, will
sustain efforts towards improving education quality. In addition, operational costs and
maintenance will be sustained through budget lines of respective States. Regarding CCT, a
follow-up World-Bank supported project will incorporate the implementation experience of the
CCT pilot in a broader CCT multi-sectoral program. Furthermore, these States continue to
benefit from technical assistance from the Federal component of ongoing and pipeline World
Bank projects (such as the Lagos Eko Project, the Community and Social Development Project,
and Youth Employment and Social Support Project) as well as those supported by other
development partners, including DfID and UNICEF. Hence, the risk to ensuring sustainability
of project development outcomes will be minimized.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

33.     Relevance of Objectives. The project, as designed and implemented, addresses key
development priorities that remain highly relevant to Nigeria today. The Government’s
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) aims to overhaul the
education sector, and promote quality education for life skills acquisition, job creation and
poverty eradication. The project’s objective was strategically relevant and appropriate, and
fully consistent with this objective, and was aligned with the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy, in that it addressed the issues of education quality and access in poor LGAs in three
northern states, with particular emphasis on girls’ participation and retention. The focus on
requiring improvement of the quality of learning environment through greater community
involvement and ownership was appropriate. Equally important, was the focus on girls in the
north of Nigeria, such as Kaduna and Kano States, which account disproportionately for high
rates of non-participation in schools, and thereby hampering progress towards the Millennium
Development Goals. Thus, the relevance of objectives is rated high.

34.    Relevance of Design and Implementation. In light of the fragmented institutional
environment in the education sector, project design was appropriate, reflecting international
good practice and based on sound analytical studies and detailed implementation plans. All
four components were appropriately linked to the project objective, and purported to bring
about substantial educational gains, through policy reforms, school-level leadership,
management and accountability, improved learning environment, institutional capacity-
building, and monitoring and evaluation. The decision to cover only three States was
innovative and realistic in that it provided for: (a) greater focus (than would have been



                                              11
obtained under a national project), especially considering the limited capacity of states to meet
educational goals; and (b) a sizeable amount of funding for greater effectiveness. The design of
the implementation structure and institutional arrangements was sound, with a focus at state,
LGA and school levels. In addition, it was grounded on: (i) wide stakeholder consultation; (ii)
rigorous analysis of the education sector in Nigeria, and the participating states; (iii) detailed
analysis for selection of project LGAs; and (iv) public expenditures reviews for these states.
The Quality of Supervision Assessment viewed the overall design as realistic, sound, and
particularly relevant in light of the context of the education sector in Nigeria.

35.      In retrospect, some challenges that could have been addressed more fully pertained to
national coordination, the design for monitoring and evaluation, with clear steps of how this
activity would be done. Moreover, the untimely availability of technical assistance and delayed
implementation of activities supported by DfID, especially the EMIS also adversely impacted
initial implementation. In essence, the design was unable to mitigate fully the risk associated
with the DfID partnership. Also, though to a lesser degree, the design of the CCT pilot ought
to have taken into account the severe timing constraint posed by the original project closing
date.

36.    These challenges notwithstanding, the core of the project design has remained highly
relevant, and did not require any significant structural changes other than necessary
adjustments to address implementation challenges. In sum, the strengths outweigh the
shortcomings, and therefore, on balance the design relevance is rated Substantial.

37.   Based on a relevance rating of high for objectives and substantial for design and
implementation, the overall relevance is rated Substantial.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

38.    Overall, the project outcome and achievement of objective were Moderately
Satisfactory. The project achieved two notable results: (a) increased school autonomy and
accountability through direct funding based on approved School Development Plans, coupled
with renewed community participation; and (b) increased focus and capacity at sub-national
levels for education service delivery, through the adoption of innovative and flexible
approaches (e.g. the whole school approach), and key state-level policy reforms in educational
planning, education quality assurance, and textbook provision. Given their diverse contexts,
there were differences in performance among the States. Key achievements relate to the
remarkable success of decentralizing funding to schools and girls’ participation. The following
describes briefly the project achievements (see Annex 2, Outputs by Component).

39.     The project development objective was to: improve the quality of basic education in
targeted Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the participating States focusing particularly on
girls’ participation. The project development objective was to be measured by the following
outcome indicators (performance against these is described in detail below):

       Increased primary completion rates for boys and girls in targeted LGAs;



                                               12
         Increased junior secondary completion rates for boys and girls in targeted LGAs;
         Increased transition rates from primary to junior secondary for boys and girls in targeted
         LGAs; and
         Improved learning conditions in project schools based on 2007 baseline benchmarks.


(1) Increased primary completion rates for boys and girls in targeted LGAs

40.    The project targeted a five percent increase in the primary completion rates from

used). Project-LGA data show
substantial improvements for girls             Annual School Census data 2010 .
in both Kaduna (tripling the state
target) and Kano (an increase of 27 percent over the state target), over and above than the
corresponding state figures. Moreover, the data show that girl-boy parity improved for both
state and project LGAs over the baseline. However, project LGA results were higher than
those of the states (46.3 percent versus 43.5 percent against the state baseline of 41.8 percent).
When compared with available state data for 2010 on percentage of girls’ enrolment in JSS
schools in Kaduna, Kano and Kwara, project LGA data show higher girl-boy parity (45.2
percent versus 41.8 percent, 44.9 percent versus 35.1 percent, and 48.8 percent versus 46.7
percent, respectively) (Nigeria Digest of Education Statistics 2006-2010). This indicates that
more girls are attending and completing primary education in project LGAs, largely attributable
to the project, given its focus on supporting the state governments’ education sector plans,
particularly girls, and little overlap of other programs in project LGAs. Regarding whether the
targeted increase of five percent in the completion rate was realistic, the QSA panel re-
emphasized that a five percent improvement in completion as well as transition rates over the
project life was unrealistic, and recommended a downward revision. Given the elapsed time,
new expectations on the project being able to meet completion rates, and the heterogeneity of
project LGAs, this recommendation was not activated.

42.    In view of the above primary completion rates for Project LGAs (higher than state
averages in four out of six sub-targets, especially for girls), a minor shortcoming for Kwara

boys, and a higher girl-boy parity than the states, overall achievement for this indicator is rated
Satisfactory.


(2) Increased junior secondary completion rates for boys and girls in targeted LGAs

43.   The project targeted a five percent increase in the Junior Secondary School (JSS)
completion rates from baseline by the end of the project.

that girl-boy parity improved for
both state and project LGAs over the baseline. However, project LGA results were higher than
those of the states (38.7 percent versus 36.3 percent against the state baseline of 35.8 percent).
The data also show that Kano (Girls) experienced the biggest increase. This could be explained
by the fact that the Kano government increased its focus on girls’ education. Comparative
national data are unavailable. On attribution of results, it may well be that the Universal Basic
Education Commission’s complementary programs have contributed as well. Nevertheless, the
data comprehensively show greater improvement by project LGAs than the respective States.
In terms of realism of targets, the same explanation applies as under Indicator 1 above.

45.     On balance, given the positive achievement against all sub-targets for project LGAs,
and the states’ relatively high completion performance for girls, and improvements in girl-boy
parity the overall achievement against the targets is rated Satisfactory.


(3) Increased transition rates from primary to junior secondary for girls and boys in
targeted LGAs

46.   The project targeted a five percent increase in the Junior Secondary School (JSS)
completion rates from baseline by the end of the project in targeted LGAs.

Kano underachieved for both
boys and girls, though the               Annual Census data 2010 .
underachievement was more
pronounced for boys than for girls. It is worth noting that although primary completion rates
increased for both Kaduna and Kano, access to secondary schooling was a major bottleneck to
improving transition from primary to secondary education, which is a factor outside the control
of the project. In general, given that project LGAs were mostly rural, they faced greater access
difficulties to JSS than other LGAs. In addition, the government’s State Universal Basic
Education complementary program for additional classrooms at JSS did not materialize as
planned. This problem of access to JSS was more pronounced for Kano. A study supports the
finding of limited access to schools in Northern Nigeria, where it is found that in the Northern
regions between 40-70 percent of pupils attend schools their parents or guardians consider to be
overcrowded, compared with 18-28 percent in the Southern regions (Nigeria – DHS EdData
Survey 2010). As explained under Indicator 3 above, the targets applied to project LGAs were
probably unrealistic in the case of Kaduna and Kano.

48.    In the circumstances, and given that only two out of the six sub-targets have been met,
the overall achievement against the targets is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.


(4) Improved teaching and learning conditions in target schools based on 2007 baseline
benchmarks

49.     The assessment of achievement against this indicator poses some difficulties since the
PAD does not contain baseline data and an end-of-project target, but indicates that benchmarks
will be set before project effectiveness. Before delving into the analysis, it is important to note
that the project design called for a “whole school? approach, focused on demand-driven school
interventions for improving teaching and learning in target schools (for example, development
of school development plans, school-based in-service teacher training, decentralized
infrastructure development, and provision of teaching/learning materials. Thus, it was
unrealistic to use tests results as the only measurement of progress against this outcome
indicator, particularly given the focus on poor or remote LGAs, especially girls. More



                                                15
appropriate, would have been a combination of learning assessment together with an
assessment of intermediate outcome indicators relating to improvements in education quality
inputs associated with the “whole school? approach, such as improved physical learning
environment, especially targeting girls, improved access to teaching/learning materials,
teaching methods, teacher/student ratios, textbook:student ratios. As indicated under
“Achievement of Intermediate Outcome Indicators? below, all the targets were met or exceeded,
with minor shortcomings in a few areas.

50.    Another issue relates to the question of the Quality Enhancement Review Panel as to
whether it was realistic to expect project support in a 3-4 year timeframe to have a measurable
impact on improved learning outcomes during the project life, given that evidence from Bank-
funded projects in countries with a similar level of development to Nigeria points to the
contrary. Further, the Quality of Supervision Assessment recommended revisions to show a
concrete measurement of performance in improving teaching and learning conditions. After
the MTR, the task team had revised this indicator and targets by introducing testing for Grades
4 and 6 in Reading and Mathematics.

Nevertheless, a similar study on

significant improvement over baseline in reading comprehension levels (TPD study, June 2011
– see Annex 9). Considering that only two out of six sub-targets were met, the overall
achievement for Reading is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

low lower performance in Kwara
(TPD study, June 2011 – see Annex 9). Even taking into account project LGAs’ context, it
seems that the states are performing less well in numeracy, especially Kano and Kwara. On
balance, based on an achievement of five out of the six sub-targets, the overall achievement for
Mathematics is rated Satisfactory.

53.   To summarize, taking into account the explanations given above on assessment of
improvement in teaching/learning conditions, and based on an achievement rating of
moderately unsatisfactory for Reading and a rating of satisfactory for Mathematics, the
combined overall achievement for Reading and Mathematics for Grades 4 and 6 is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

54.     Achievement of Intermediate Outcome Indicators. In addition to the above outcome
indicators, project data show that all intermediate outcome indicator targets were achieved,
though with minor shortcomings in some (see Annex 2). Key achievements, in line with the
“whole school? approach include: (a) the ability of all SBMCs to develop school plans for
improving teaching/learning over time; (b) vastly improved pupil:book and teacher:book ratios
(to 1:1 against targets of 3:1 in most cases, except in Kano which met the target); (c) the
distribution of lower-cost textbooks; (d) the decline in shortfall of qualified teachers; (e)
improved rural/urban pupil:classroom ratios; and (f) the increase in schools with upgraded
learning facilities, including sanitation and potable water. As a result of better learning
conditions, enrolment (especially girls) and teacher attendance increased. For example, the
assessment for the School Development Scheme reveals that between 2008-2010 whilst boys’
enrolment rate remained constant (around 15 percent) in both project and non-project LGAs in
Kano, girls’ enrolment rate were higher in project than non-project LGAs (18.2 percent
compared with 14.7 percent). This is supported by community members who claim that
schools supported by grants were able to attract more girls to schools.

55.    The four project components were directly linked to the PDO, and contributed
accordingly. Under Component 1 – School Development Scheme, a remarkable achievement



                                                    17
was the institutionalization of decentralized funding to schools based on approved school
development plans, with key support from the local government administrators and Ministry of
Education support teams. Component 2 was instrumental in improving the learning
environment and education quality through decentralized in-service teacher training, provision
of teaching and learning materials, and selective infrastructure development. Under
Component 3, improved institutional capacity has enabled state education officials to better
plan, manage, implement and monitor educational activities, as evidenced by the production by
states of medium-term budgeting system, education sector plans, annual school census reports,
and quality assurance reports. Although implementation of activities under Component 4 was
slow initially, project management and monitoring and evaluation capacity in each of the three
States were strengthened substantially with improved coordination, as evidenced by signing of
Memoranda of Understanding by stakeholders to ensure better education service delivery, the
ability of the State Ministry of Education to coordinate educational activities across all
concerned agencies, improvements in accountability and reporting, and application of
knowledge gains from the project’s capacity-building activities.

56.     Conditional Cash Transfer Programs Pilot. The Cash Transfer Programs Pilot in
Kano State targeted some 12,000 girls (out of which 11,000 were eligible) to attract and retain
them in school. Key preliminary findings of an impact evaluation study suggest large
enrolment and attendance impacts of CCTs for girls in Northern Nigeria, with variations across
grades, geographical areas, and type of schools. Grade six beneficiaries show the largest gains,
equivalent to about 14 percent of control attendance rates (61 percent for control group versus
69 percent for CCT girls). Moreover, the amount of transfer seems to matter for attendance
(the unit cost per child needs to be sufficient to offset part or whole of the opportunity cost to
attract and retain girls in school). Also, supply at JSS level appears to be a limiting factor to
attract more girls, since the construction of additional classrooms in Kano state has not kept
pace with demand for spaces in JSS.

57.    Early Childhood Education Pilot. The ECD pilot undertaken in project LGAs in all
three States reached about 1,000 households. It enabled 30 personnel to obtain international
diplomas in Early Childhood Development. In addition, ECD personnel capacity improved
through interaction in international workshops and study visits.

58.     On the whole, the project development achievement is on balance rated Moderately
Satisfactory, given a substantial rating for both Outcome Indicators (1) and (2) on completion
rates, a modest rating for Indicator (3) on transition rates, a substantial rating for Indicator (4)
on learning assessment, together with the achievement of all key intermediate outcome
indicator targets, albeit with minor shortcomings.


3.3 Efficiency

59.    The costs involved in achieving project objectives were reasonable in comparison with
both the benefits and value for money. The project involved approximately US$65 million
equivalent in IDA funds, $1.7 million in DfID funds, complemented by local communities both
in kind and cash. Efficiency in terms of the SESP project’s IDA components has been



                                                18
examined in three ways: allocative efficiency, efficiency of procurement approach, and cost
efficiency analysis (unit cost comparison). In terms of allocative efficiency, the adoption of
school development plans under Component 1 as a vehicle for support to schools yielded
positive results with increased community participation and ownership, as well as competition
for school funding. Not only infrastructure costs were lower, but field observations have
shown that the quality of infrastructure improved. Similarly, the project secured greater
efficiencies through its procurement approach of transferring responsibility for procurement of
small-scale infrastructure to local actors under participatory and transparent community
contracting systems. With the devolution of greater decision-making at school level, supported
by institutional building at state and LGA levels, coupled with higher completion rates (i.e.
fewer drop-outs) at both primary and junior secondary levels, it can be reasonably assumed that
the project has contributed to greater internal efficiency in the education sector of the three
States. Other efficiencies resulting from a competitive process in areas such as textbook
contracting and infrastructure-building were also accomplished, as acknowledged by the
Quality of Supervision Assessment (April 2010). It is to be noted though that the increase in
project management costs reflects costs of the CCT and ECD pilots (about US$2 million).
Specific examples of how greater efficiency was achieved are described below.

60.     First, successful tendering process (ICB and NCB) resulted in substantial cost savings.
The textbook and infrastructure procurement demonstrated the benefits of a competitive
process with real cost effectiveness in both the savings generated (up to 40 percent versus
projected cost of school construction and textbooks) and the evident quality improvements.
The savings (about 40 percent) were used to procure additional textbooks and helped two states
achieve a 1:1 textbook ratio in core subjects for all targeted LGAs (the exception was Kano
which began and ended the project with the weakest procurement capacity, as noted by the
Bank procurement unit in Abuja).

61.      Second, there were cost savings in civil works activities in all the three states. For
example, Kano bids were US$7.9 million; down from an estimated US$9 million. Table 1
below shows a comparison of unit costs in Naira of infrastructure (in line with government
norms) for the government and for the project in the three States. The bulk of infrastructure
related to classroom construction (about 50 percent) and to toilet installations (30 percent).
Classroom unit costs show lower costs for Kaduna and Kano, resulting in savings of 6 percent
and 73 percent, respectively. For Kwara, if the unit cost is discounted to net out the head
teacher office cost, the resulting unit cost will also be lower. Toilet costs were lower for the
project in Kaduna and Kwara, but higher in Kano (the difference could be in material quality,
transportation costs or technical). In general, unit cost comparison for other categories of
construction shows savings by project as opposed to government costs. Most of the savings
were spent on additional bore holes and toilets. Overall, net savings in project accrued over
government costs for infrastructure development across the categories in the table, except in
two cases (Kaduna furniture and Kano toilets).

62.      Third, given the costs saved in not establishing a specialized institution for the
innovative approach to in-service teacher training, not to mention the attendant recurrent costs
implications, the outsourcing of in-service training is likely to have resulted in substantial
savings as well. Fourth, though this cannot be quantified, institutional capacity-building has
contributed substantially to improving systems efficiency. Additionally, savings in M&E
reflect the decision to outsource monitoring activities, using a decentralized approach, through
multi-tier monitoring by LGAs, schools, and independent monitors.

63.      Considering efficiency gains in textbook production and distribution, infrastructure,
in-service training, no project cost overruns, coupled with the fact that the project was
completed within its planned implementation period and total project cost, the overall
efficiency rating is Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

64.    The overall project outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory, based on a rating of
Substantial overall for relevance, PDO achievement, and efficiency.




                                                            20
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development.

65.     The project addressed the needs of a majority poor population, addressing cultural and
income barriers to schooling, giving special attention to low income, rural girls. In the new
climate of decentralized, popular participation in development, communities in the selected
LGEAs were empowered to take greater control over their schools, learning about problems
and working to resolve them. Data indicate that there was a huge rise in project completion
rates for girls for both primary and JSS. From a state-level data perspective, compared with
baseline data, increases in primary completion rates for girls were 136 percent in Kaduna, 41
percent in Kano, and 14 percent in Kwara. Similarly, increases in JSS completion rates from
girls were 388 percent in Kaduna, 210 percent in Kano, and 35 percent in Kwara. LGA-
specific data show much higher increases for girls, especially in Kaduna and Kano, two areas
with substantially low completion rates. On social aspects, given the focus of the project on
poor LGAs, the participation of the communities in school level management through school-
based management committees has shown tremendous success, especially in the innovative
approach of decentralizing funding to schools for education quality improvements. Moreover,
positive spillover effects occurred in that in many cases community participation in
participating LGAs was revived from involvement in school level management activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

66.     Major functions of the state education ministries benefited from capacity building.
They include (i) the foundations of an in-service training program for teachers and principals,
with tested training materials (although the performance of the out-sourced service provides has
not been assessed); (ii) the reform of the inspectorate, now operational in Kwara and being
legislated in Kaduna and Kano; and (iii) the development of a comprehensive EMIS, permitting
the institutionalization of sector plans, medium term strategies and annual performance reviews.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

67.      An unexpected positive outcome has been the revival of community participation and
ownership not only in school activities but also in other areas as well. Field observations
indicate a high level of ownership by communities, and a number of community mobilization
activities in schools such as parents’ assembly, and organization of school events, and school
environmental improvements (landscaping, tree planting, etc.), as well as social activities.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

68.    An independent assessment of The School Development Scheme was undertaken, based
on 20-30 percent sample of all SESP schools in all participating LGAs in the three states (24
percent in Kano, 30 percent in Kwara and Kaduna). Key results are summarized below. In all
the SESP schools visited, all the schools (100 percent) have established SBMCs, developed
school development plan, followed and used the approved guidelines, and opened an account at
an approved bank.



                                              21
69.     In all the schools visited, it was confirmed that training had been carried out for SBMC
on school development planning; Head Teachers and Principals on Leadership and Financial
Management Training, LGEA Desk officers and core team members on grant
review/endorsement. More than 50 percent of the schools used the grant for classroom
renovation, furniture for classroom and less than 10 percent for quality inputs. In particular,
more than 20 percent of the participating schools used the grant for additional girls’ toilets (in
particular, 20 percent in Kano and 29 percent in Kaduna). Perceived effectiveness of the
schools grant by beneficiaries could be attributed to a sense of community involvement and
ownership. The Parents/Teachers’ Association also embraced and appreciated the SBMC
approach to ensure openness, accountability at the school level. Assessment of physical
conditions, showed remarkable improvements from baseline. Students were found to be using
textbooks in classrooms. It was also confirmed that teachers were trained.

70.     Stakeholder’s workshops. Participants in these workshops comprised state and LGEA
representatives such as, village head, community members, religious leaders, teachers, farmers,
traders, PTA and SBMC members. Other participants included representatives from federal
and state organizations, education parastatals/agencies including UBEC, civil society and
NGOs. Stakeholders’ feedback was generally positive. They commended the leadership and
effective coordination/support within the Ministries of education. Almost all the relevant
stakeholders were trained, but they requested continuous training program to sustain their
capacity. Feedback received indicated that a Federal component should always be part of the
Bank’s project in the education sector especially to align state support to the national education
sector strategy and framework. Project activities should be mainstreamed in the government
budget at federal, state and LGAs level. The SDS is seen to improve openness, transparency
and accountability. This could provide a strong platform for demanding improvement in
learning outcomes at school level (see Annex 4).


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Overall Assessment. The risk is moderate.

71.      Risk to Objectives. As discussed in section 2.5, the project developed institutional
capacity, provided equipment and facilities, and established Educational Management
Information Systems and Quality Assurance Systems. These institutional mechanisms and
facilities should help the Governments of the three participating States to sustain development
outcomes. Most of the operational activities and systems have been mainstreamed within the
State Ministries of Education and the State Universal Basic Education Boards, which reflect a
major achievement impacting reduced risks to development outcomes. Hence, it is likely that
the concerned Governments will sustain project gains, especially with improved technical
capacity, and functional school-based management committees in all schools.

72.     Sustainability. Low budgets and poor budget execution were seen as a substantial risk,
with better planning and capacity building at the state and LGEA levels were seen as mitigating
factors. State, LGEA, and school level capacity for planning, implementation, and monitoring
has improved substantially. The risk to sustainability is moderate.




                                               22
73.     Changing government commitment to reform was also seen as a substantial risk in
the light of the imminent 2007 election. As it was, commitment to economic and social
reforms strengthened prior to the elections and stakeholders were strong supporters of the SESP
policies and investments. During the ICRR mission, commissioners of education and principal
secretaries in all three States did express their continued commitment and support to basic
education. The risk level remains moderate to substantial.

74.    Lack of a clear division of responsibilities and weak coordination were seen as
moderate risks. In fact, the state coordination units performed generally well, despite some
continuing lack of capacity in financial management and organization in Kano (CCTs). The
reform of the inspectorate in Kwara is a major step toward the quality assurance of education.

75.     It has harmonized the work of the various entities, with oversight over education and is
keeping the public informed. Legislation in the two other states will soon permit the same
progress. State commissioners and principal secretaries have shown leadership and have
worked to solve operational problems. The capacity of the SUBEBs may be overstretched in
term of span of control, timely technical advice and in terms of procurement. Institutional
audits of capacity, technical and financial management and governance should be implemented
to permit the generalization of reform on the ground. Given the increased pressures likely to be
created by scaling-up of SESP programs, there continue to be moderate risks, if institutional,
financial and technical audits are not conducted.

76.    Poor governance was estimated to be a modest risk. The new CCT scheme might have
been expected to suffer some “leakage?, as might have the school grants. The CCT impact
assessment found little evidence of leakage and stakeholders checked the accounts books which
were well kept by SMBCs visited by the ICRR mission. The state governor’s inquiry
confirmed these findings. The risk remains moderate, with the proviso that scaling-up might
change the situation, requiring strong safeguards.

Risk to Component Results.

77.    Lack of knowledge in procurement and financial management was rated a
substantial risk. In fact all three state implementation teams grew on the job, with Kwara
emerging as fully competent to oversee a scaling-up of operations. Kano, coming from a low
base, still faces challenges in financial management and operations and maintenance.
Mitigating factors included strong back-stopping by the Abuja office and on-site advice from
the ESSPIN teams located side-by-side with the project coordinators. Training was on tap to
meet common state upgrading needs. A moderate risk, providing continuity in PSU staffing,
with regular in-service training, is maintained.

78.    A lack of incentives for and ownership by the key implementing units was expected to
be a substantial risk. This was not the case for the PSUs. However, at the school level pay
and incentives remain an issue with regard to school principals, while teacher absenteeism is a
pervasive problem. The risk is moderate.




                                              23
79.     Overall coordination was also seen as a substantial risk factor. While capacity-
building and robust operational manuals built on a matrix of responsibility have had a
mitigating effect, there remain coordination difficulties between the PSUs and the SUBEBS
and between the federal level and the states. Federal projects appear poorly integrated with the
SESP and the coordinating committee designed to bring the state and federal levels together
was never created. The risk is moderate.

80.    Timeliness of technical assistance affecting implementation was seen as a modest risk.
General technical assistance has been quite effective in many key activities. Nevertheless,
while substantial efforts were made to mitigate this risk, a difficult challenge related to the
timely availability of technical assistance for EMIS. The risk is moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

81.     Bank’s performance was Satisfactory. The team that provided assistance in preparation
included members involved in Bank-supported projects in Nigeria, which ensured continuity.
The experienced team comprised members with an appropriate skill-mix in all missions. The
wide, intensive, consultative preparation process was appreciated by senior government
officials, which ensured strong borrower ownership, particularly at State level, where the
responsibility for implementation would lie. The task team was cognizant of the challenges in
adopting a novel approach focusing on decentralizing of funding directly to the school level,
entailing a steep learning curve for key stakeholders at that level and intensive capacity-
building and handholding. The role played by key stakeholders during preparation proved to
be of utmost benefit. Before pre-appraisal the team sought advice from a Quality Enhancement
Review panel, whose contribution was instrumental in improving upon project design.

82.     The Bank team ensured professional quality in preparation technical assistance.
Preparation was based on public education expenditure reviews, technical assistance and
feasibility studies. Together these enabled the team to adopt an intensive participatory
approach involving substantial national expertise in diverse technical areas. Moreover,
implementation lessons from past projects were incorporated in the project design. These
efforts resulted in a project design with adequate emphasis on key relevant issues, detailed
preparation, and implementation readiness factors. The Bank team also undertook economic
and financial analysis. In addition, Nigerian counterparts benefited from a workshop organized
by the Bank team on “Strategic Choices for Education Reform? in January 2007, which
focused on core capacity-building for education reform with specific reference to the Nigeria
sub-national environment. Nevertheless, the baseline data issues were not adequately
addressed to monitor the performance indicators especially in terms of integrating this into a
system-wide database.




                                              24
(b) Quality of Supervision

83.      The overall Bank’s performance was moderately satisfactory. Over 200 officials
from national, state, and LGA levels attended the successful project launch on May 27, 2008 in
Ilorin, which provided national advocacy on education. The Bank team carried out 10
supervision missions during four years (including the MTR in November 2009 and an ICR
mission in August 2011), with regular intervals of six months with systematic work with the
States. Three task team leaders were involved in the lending operation and supervision
missions with one of them based in Headquarters; thus needed supervision continuity was not
adequately achieved. Supervision teams, comprising a stable mix of appropriate skills, were
instrumental in identifying feasible solutions to address relevant implementation issues, with
some level of flexibility, especially during difficult periods of instability. In addition, the
States’ Ministry of Education benefited from strong ongoing, just-in-time support from staff in
the World Bank Abuja Office. It was on this basis that the quality of supervision was rated
satisfactory by a Quality of Supervision Assessment panel on April 16, 2010 (Please note that
section C3 of the project data sheet does not show this rating erroneously)

84.     The Bank team was proactive in supervision by ensuring enhancements through the use
of: (i) monthly video-conferencing throughout the project life with all three States focusing on
problem-solving of emerging implementation issues, for which the team has been commended
often; (ii) international advisers in specialized fields such as learning assessments, conditional
cash transfer programs early childhood education, and beneficiary assessments; (iii) study visits
abroad to obtain experience in, and exposure to, live programs similar to those in the project;
and (iv) dialogues and workshop training specific to the project, particularly in collaboration
with the World Bank Institute.

85.     A few areas, however, needed greater emphasis. First, in order to ascertain that key
educational and project data are readily available, it was crucial to require the setting-up of a
system of monitoring, data collection and evaluation right from the outset. Second, the risk on
timeliness of data due to delayed technical assistance identified in the PAD was difficult to
mitigate despite the task team’s efforts. Third, the commissioning of evaluation studies such as
cost and quality of infrastructure and performance of in-service providers ought to have been
planned well in advance to maximize project impact. Fourth, the limited timeframe for CCT
and ECD activities became an issue, which perhaps could have been accommodated through a
project extension to enable an additional 2-4 tranches of grants transfer towards greater impact
of these activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

86.     Based on the ratings for Quality at Entry (satisfactory) and at Supervision (moderately
satisfactory), the rating for overall Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory.




                                               25
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

87.     State Governments were deeply committed in the project at the time of preparation.
Government officials co-operated fully with the task team. Appropriate levels of review and
approval were in place. The State Government internalized the Education Sector Plans, and
used these in the programming of medium term expenditure budgets, and thus improved
sustainability of reforms. However, project coordination to ensure synergies and knowledge
sharing did not occur primarily because the National Consultative Steering Committee was not
established. Similarly, the relationship between the SMOEs and SUBEBs were not
strengthened as expected, resulting in institutional bottlenecks. In sum, the rating for
government performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

88.     The performance of three state implementation teams improved steadily from a low
base, in large part due to careful personnel selection and on-the-job training. PSU specialist
staff in the program areas – SDSs, the pilot programs, teacher training, as well as in planning,
programming and budgeting, performed well. While procurement performance was reasonable,
there was some weakness in financial management (for example in Kano, where available skills
at entry were scarce). Since capacity-building in the area of EMIS started late, data collection
at the outset was problematic, and there were no formal text books utilization study.
Furthermore, the late assessment of SDS and TPD also compromised their quality and feedback
could not be provided, while a preliminary assessment of ECE was not done. The rating is
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

89.     In light of a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for government performance, and a rating
of Moderately Satisfactory for the implementing agency performance, the overall performance
of the Borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

Project Preparation:

 (a) Government ownership and continued political commitment at sub-national levels are
     critical for the successful project implementation. Despite elections and bureaucratic
     changes, State Governments demonstrated stability and political commitment to stay the
     course with the project despite difficult implementation challenges. However, the setting-
     up of the National Consultative Steering Committee at the Federal level would have
     ensured greater synergies with ongoing national reforms and interventions.




                                              26
 (b) Using existing administrative agencies (as opposed to a separate Project
     Implementation Unit), ensures smooth project implementation and long-term
     sustainability, provided the choice of agencies is accompanied by commensurate
     capacity-building, and an effective coordination mechanism. Design assumptions that
     there would be cooperation among different agencies, motivated by a common interest in
     efficiency, were misplaced. This was demonstrated by the need for higher-level
     interventions to persuade agencies such as SUBEB to respond positively to, and to take
     advice and direction from, the State Ministry of Education.

 (c) Full upfront commitment of key local government education authorities is paramount
     for effective decentralized education management and implementation. The fact that
     these were not effectively involved during implementation start-up points to the need to
     ensure sufficient upfront commitment from such agencies during project preparation itself.

 (d) Establishing an effective monitoring and data collection system at project start is vital
     to the successful monitoring and evaluation of project achievements and outcomes. In
     retrospect, this project would have benefited greatly from ensuring the baseline data for
     targeted LGAs and related studies and surveys are available at implementation start-up.

Project Implementation:

 (a) Deployment from the outset of qualified staff for key positions is paramount for
     ensuring strong and consistent project implementation progress. The project benefited
     from early appointment of staff to the respective Project Support Units to ensure
     sufficient capacity throughout implementation, except the financial management position
     in Kano, which adversely impacted on Kano’s initial performance, compared to Kaduna
     and Kwara.

 (b) To maximize project impact, it is crucial to ensure accountability for timely quality
     inputs regardless of the source of financing (whether by the Bank, other international
     development partners or other agencies). Alignment and coordination of all project
     support from the outset is critical in ensuring effective implementation. The ill-timed
     technical assistance for educational management information system and monitoring and
     evaluation contributed to serious difficulties in developing a solid baseline and refining
     key project indicator targets by project start-up.

 (c) A well-designed and efficiently-implemented component for decentralized provision of
     education quality inputs with strong school-level leadership and accountability can
     contribute significantly to improving student learning outcomes. The implementation of
     the School Development Scheme focused on decentralizing provision of quality inputs to
     improve teaching/learning practices towards improved learning outcomes. Though
     overall learning levels remain relatively low, project LGAs in general have shown a
     marked improvement in reading comprehension and Mathematics over the baseline.




                                              27
 (d) Close collaboration with development partners such as DfID, UNICEF and UNESCO
     can build synergies leading to better results in basic education. For example, the project
     worked closely with DfID and UNICEF in developing support for CCT and ECCD,
     specifically through assessments, surveys and studies, impact evaluation, and
     dissemination.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

90.      The Borrower and Implementing Agency did not have any major issues with the content
of this report, and have indicated their agreement with the conclusions. However, the Borrower
has prepared its own evaluation report of the project (see Annex 6).


(b) Cofinanciers

Not Applicable.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

91.    DfID-ESSPIN inherited a commitment from CUBE to continue support to three
components of the World Bank-funded State Education Sector Project (SESP) in Kaduna, Kano
and Kwara. These DfID-funded components were concerned with EMIS, the reform of the
Inspectorate and Capacity Building for Planning and Management. Kaduna, Kano and Kwara
have all completed timely Annual School Censuses (ASC) for the past two years. EMIS units
have been established in the Ministries of Education of all three States, and they are now able
to manage the ASC cycle with minimum support. ASC data is now being used as a key tool for
planning in all states. Kwara has established a Quality Assurance Bureau, and undertakes an
annual program of quality assurance (QA) inspections of schools, albeit with problems of
budget release. While Kaduna has still to enact its QA law, it now runs an extensive school
program, yielding valuable information about school quality. Whereas initially Kano’s
commitment to QA development was weak, the state now supports a comprehensive
implementation program. All three states now have institutionalized procedures for planning
and budgeting through Medium Term Sector Strategies (MTSSs). All states develop the MTSS
with minimal external support and monitor and evaluate progress through Annual Education
Sector Performance Reviews.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


1.        A beneficiary assessment survey was undertaken through visits, follow-ups, interviews
during missions and by consultants as part of a. study to determine effectiveness of school
grants School Development Grant in Kaduna, Kano and Kwara (June 2011). Another study on
teacher professional development incorporated surveys of beneficiaries. Diverse beneficiaries
were considered, including students, parents, teachers, head teachers, government education
officials, as well as general community members and School-Based Management Committee
members. Technical details of the above studies are given in Annex 10. The key results from
the School Development Grant study are shown below.

Conclusions and Challenges

       All SESP schools in all three States: (i) established SBMCs; (ii) prepared School
       Development Plans according to approved guidelines;

       All schools were able to access funding, based on approved School Development Plans;

       Schools surveyed predominantly used infrastructure funding for classroom renovations,
       and facilities (water and sanitation);

       Schools surveyed predominantly used education quality improvement funding for
       blackboards, textbooks, exercise books, and school;

       Respondents indicate that the School Development Scheme was very successful
       because it helped to: (i) forge strong community involvement and ownership, with
       greater participation of PTAs; (ii) make school learning environment more conducive to
       learning; (iii) communities to give priority to solve school problems for education
       quality enhancements; (iv) improve staff capacity (e.g. SBMCs, head teachers/Teachers,
       and LGA Education Officers; (v) bring computer literacy to the doorstep of pupils in
       rural areas; (vii) give confidence to parents to send their children to schools; (viii)
       decongest classrooms; (ix) attract more girls (doubling enrolment) and hitherto
       disinterested boys to schools;

       Challenges relate to: (i) the difficulties of SBMCs to make collective decision-making
       effectively, given differences of opinion and their varied backgrounds and literacy
       levels; and (ii) the need for the approved guidelines to provide for greater flexibility to
       meet school individual needs; and (iii) the sustainability of SBMCs. Respondents felt
       that these could be tackled through proper sustained advocacy, monitoring and
       supervision, regular meetings, continued community involvement, and support from the
       Ministry officials and community-based NGOs.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      Participants in these workshops comprised state and LGEA representatives such as,
village head, community members, religious leaders, teachers, farmers, traders, PTA and
SBMC members. Other participants included representatives from federal and state
organizations, education parastatals/agencies including UBEC, civil society and NGOs.
Stakeholders’ feedback was generally positive. They commended the leadership and effective
coordination/support within the Ministries of education. They confirmed that all the relevant
stakeholders were trained, but they also requested continuous training program to sustain their
capacity. Feedback received indicated that a Federal component should always be part of the
Bank’s project in the education sector especially to align state support to the national education
sector strategy and framework. School Development Plans should be mainstreamed in the
government budget at federal, state and LGAs level.

2.     During the stakeholders meeting in June 2011, the following appreciation was
expressed by various stakeholders:

   (a) SBMCs indicated the following: “The books from the SDP funds make students turn
       out, they help student to be punctual, teachers to improve teaching? Two additional
       classrooms and one office, attending the school regularly, getting co-operation from
       parents. By building more toilets, repairing the school, providing other school materials,
       many respondents were convinced that the school grants have increased access to
       schooling for children in the community. Parents were more inclined to send their
       children to these better equipped schools. “Before, the entire school was dilapidated but
       now we have some desk provided by the SBMC.?

   (b) A farmer from Kaura Yandadi village, Kunchi LGA, Kano State. “There are sufficient
       toilets now for pupils unlike before when they had only one for all of them.?

   (c) A trader from Ungogo Gabas in Ungogo LGA, Kano State indicated thus: “the
       classrooms have become decongested and as such the teacher and pupils find the
       environment more conducive for learning and teaching, there are more pupils now than
       the period before the project.?

   (d) “The teachers can now mark assignments immediately in the class unlike before when
       there were no chairs and desks, and they had to take all marking home to do,? said a
       carpenter from Rimin Gata Village, Ungogo LGA, Kano.

   (e) A community member indicated that the SBMC and school grant has made a difference.
       “Thanks to this plan, the number of females students has almost doubled, and the male
       students who did not participate in school activities are now very interested.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

BASED ON REPORT FROM THE THREE STATES:

Context and Background:

In line with FGN strategy, the SESP aimed at accelerating progress towards the key education
MDGs, creating the basis for sustainable development, with emphasis on the areas with low
schooling levels of participation. The project has left an enduring legacy in the management of
education in the state. The accountability and transparency has brought to bear in all facets of
our operations. SESP has positively influenced the course of education service delivery in the
three States and this cannot be overemphasized. The State Government as major stakeholders
in collaboration with other stakeholders in various reviews strongly confirms satisfactory
implementation of SESP.

The Project: The World Bank financed the State Education Sector project led by three states
coordinators from the State Ministries of Education in the states of Kano, Kaduna and Kwara.
The development objective of the project was to improve the quality of basic education
(primary and junior secondary school) in targeted Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the
participating states (Kaduna, Kano and Kwara), focusing particularly on the education of girls.
The key outcome indicators agreed between the Government and the World Bank to measure
achievement of the development objectives are; Increased primary completion rates for boys
and girls in targeted LGAs; Increased junior secondary completion rates for boys and girls in
targeted LGAs; Increased transition rates from primary to junior secondary for girls and boys in
targeted LGAs; and Improved learning conditions in project schools based on 2007 baseline
benchmarks.

The Management support and M&E component supported implementation activities associated
with project management. They included coordination, procurement, financial records and
M&E.

Implementation Constraints: Initial take off of the project took time as government was not
ready for full state implementation of the project. When the project became effective, technical
training was incorporated in the project design and this was undertaken by the project team. It
was really difficult starting off as financial management needed to be strengthened and due to
lack of baseline data for some of the indicator, enhanced M&E capacity was required. At mid
term, action points were developed to address most of the challenges with regular monthly
meetings organized.

Implementation Achievements: SESP cannot be appropriately appreciated without reflecting on
the state of Education in the three states before the project. The scenario was one of poor level
of achievement in literacy and numeracy amongst pupils of our basic schools. Other challenges
that evidently confronted the sector included inequitable access, weak planning, management
and monitoring capacity and insufficient funding. There were also the problems of poor
learning environment, low learning outcomes, inadequacy of teaching and learning materials
including textbooks. On the part of school administration, the teaching workforce was



                                               37
characterized by low level of competence and professionalism-cum lack of opportunities to in-
service training which hindered the delivery of new basic education curriculum developed by
the Federal Government.

The signing into law in year 2004 by the Federal Government nine year (legislation on)
compulsory basic education came as a new challenge for the providers of education at various
levels including the states. In complying with and fulfilling the dream of the legislation, the
SESP took a step further by taking “improvement in the quality of Basic Education with
emphasis on girl-child access? as its PDO. The project SESP has not only come to reinforce
the development policy and programme in the states, rather the project has left an enduring
legacy that will keep it an integral part of the future of Education in the three States. Thus
when the project was envisioned and conceived in the early 2006, little did the States know
this project would by its completion transform into an epitome of change, the much desired
change that has roundly face – lifted the sector.

That SESP has positively influenced the course of education service delivery in Kwara, Kaduna
and Kano State is an undeniable reality of the experience and lesson learned from the project.
It has indeed become an enviable engagement between the States and the World Bank. Among
other things, the structure of SESP from the state perception and observation as one that has not
only enhanced service delivery through the procedure of check and balance but one that
activate performance from its transparency and accountability.

As for the benefits this project has bequeathed the three states, a cursory look at its structure
will suffice as an illustration. Thus the whole-school (holistic) development undertaken in the
SESP schools while standing as the traditional approach to project implementation that focuses
widely on learners, however the inclusion of the School Development Scheme, Teachers
Professional Development, Education Management Information System and Quality Assurance
Board have gone far to not only address the shortcomings inherent in the previous projects in
the states but its holistic nature go further to strengthen the performance of the project.

The project, SESP, throughout implementation and from available reports had been
satisfactorily implemented – this is attested to and confirmed by the feedback from
stakeholders. The States Government as major stakeholder in collaboration with other
stakeholders held series of reviews that strongly confirm satisfactory implementation of SESP
in term of: high population of pupil-, teachers, State Ministry of Education and its agencies and
community- beneficiaries, on-schedule completion of SESP, holistic structure of SESP
implementation , new challenges and accompanying solutions, new orientation resulting from
SESP and Bank’s implementation performance throughout the SESP tenure which ensured the
evident accomplishment of the PDO.

Lessons learned from the project are undeniable realities that will definitely impact on the next
phase of SESP or any other project. It has indeed become an enviable engagement between the
States and the World Bank. The three States assures the Bank of its readiness to sustain SESP
as activities and policies in this direction are already in place some of which include the States
School Improvement Programme (SSIP/SSIT) and the Grants already extended to schools in
the non-SESP and LGAs.



                                               38
Beneficiaries: The SESP is targeted at 1,974 schools in 21 LGA in the states of Kaduna, Kano
and Kwara respectively. The number of local government covered within the project are;
Kaduna- Chikun, Zaria, Kagarko, Birnin Gwari, Sanga, Soba (6) ; Kano- Garun Mallam,
Minjibir, Ungogo, Makoda, Kunchi, Rimingado, Kiru, Rogo, Wudil (9); Kwara Asa, Baruten,
Ilorin West, Isin, Offa, Patigi (6). Selection of schools for assistance was based on objective,
needs-based criteria.

Sustainability: The State Governments assure the Bank of sustaining the legacy of SESP by
further financing; it will further extend to more non-SESP LGAs and Schools. However, they
hope for the Bank’s extended engagement through financing of Education Reforms and to
further boost enrolment of the so many street children (almajirai), enhancing the transition rates
of the so many children leaving the primary schools, and having more girls coming into schools
and staying, especially with the vivid impact of SESP. Many policy reforms are being put in
place to reposition education in the States. We await the expansion of SESP beyond the pilot
just ended.

92.    DfID-ESSPIN inherited a commitment from CUBE to continue support to three
components of the World Bank-funded State Education Sector Project (SESP) in Kaduna, Kano
and Kwara. These DFID-funded components were concerned with EMIS, the reform of the
Inspectorate and Capacity Building for Planning and Management. Kaduna, Kano and Kwara
have all completed timely Annual School Censuses (ASC) for the past two years. EMIS units
have been established in the Ministries of Education of all three States, and they are now able
to manage the ASC cycle with minimum support. ASC data is now being used as a key tool for
planning in all states. Kwara has established a Quality Assurance Bureau, and undertakes an
annual program of quality assurance (QA) inspections of schools, albeit with problems of
budget release. While Kaduna has still to enact its QA law, it now runs an extensive school
program, yielding valuable information about school quality. Whereas initially Kano’s
commitment to QA development was weak, the state now supports a comprehensive
implementation program. All three states now have institutionalized procedures for planning
and budgeting through Medium Term Sector Strategies (MTSSs). All states develop the MTSS
with minimal external support and monitor and evaluate progress through Annual Education
Sector Performance Reviews.

Annual School Census in Nigeria: The Annual School Census (ASC) is an activity designed
to capture relevant data as needed for adequate planning and administration of education in
Nigeria. The main purpose of the census was to collect and collate data on schools in terms of
infrastructure, teacher status, enrolment, retention and completion rates, teacher to pupil ratio,
teacher to classroom ratio, pupil to classroom ratio that will inform stakeholders and form a
basis for improved activity-based planning and budgeting for education in the State. Over the
years, logistics have been a major challenge towards
the successful implementation of this annual event.

The data situation has increasingly improved with the development of the education data bank
over the past nine years. The National School Census is conducted by Federal Ministry of
Education and coordinated by NMIS. The states collect data from the schools for the education
database. The school census has been conducted every year in Nigeria since 2003, except in
2007/8 when funds were not sufficient to conduct the data collection. The 2007/8 was later
conducted in November 2008.



                                               40
Based on the inability of the 2008 Annual School Census to meet the education sector
expectations, the Federal Ministry of Education consented to the decentralization of the
exercise in order to capture more accurate data. The process was also decentralized in order for
states to take full responsibility for the activity including the printing of forms and the training
of relevant staff.

The 2009 Census was better planned as a result of state-level trainings received by enumerators
on information and data gathering and accurately transferring same on to the census forms.
DFID-ESSPIN project provided training for various cadres of Education Management
Information Systems (EMIS) staff from both the States Ministry of Education and States
Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB); production of census forms; and logistics support
for the actual exercises. The World Bank- supported State Education Sector Programme
contributed financially and materially by supporting some planned activities and printing the
various forms used for the exercise. Results obtained from this exercise fed into the states' 2010
Medium Term Sector Strategy (MTSS) and into the Annual Education Sector Review (AESR)
and provided a sound baseline for planning and budgeting. The results was validated and made
public by the end of February, 2010. Monitoring Learning Achievement

The Monitoring of Learning Achievement (MLA) is an assessment instrument that is based on
an approach that uses one-to-one interaction between the enumerator and the student. It
monitors whether learners are successfully reaching expected levels (minimum standards). The
World Bank-supported SESP was supported by DFID-CUBE to implement the Learning
Achievement tests at baseline. SEEP commissioned independent consultants in each of the
project states to implement the learning achievement test towards the end of the project. The
consultants used the same methodology that was employed at baseline, in order to maintain
comparability.

Annex 10 – Summary of Assessments on School Development Scheme, Teacher
Professional Development and Conditional Cash Transfer Program


1.      Introduction. Independent assessments were carried out between April-June 2011 in the
following programs: (1) School Development Scheme to examine the effectiveness of schools grants
through a beneficiary assessment survey in Kaduna, Kano and Kwara; (b) Teacher Professional
Development to assess these areas in Kaduna, Kano and Kwara: (i) school physical conditions, (ii)
quality of school leadership, (iii) teacher effectiveness, (iv) teaching strategy, and (v) learning outcomes
for primary Grades 4 and 6 in literacy and numeracy; and (c) Conditional Cash Transfer Program in
Kano (impact evaluation). Below is a brief description of these studies.


The School Development Assessment in Kaduna, Kano and Kwara

2.      Methodology. The assessment combined tools of traditional social research surveys and those
of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). A representative sample survey of about 20-30% of all SESP
schools in each of the three states was selected for assessment (24% in Kano and 30% in Kwara and
Kaduna). Assessment is based on 9 instruments: 5 questionnaires, 1 school checklist and 3 Focus
Group Discussion guides.

3.      Data collection methods and instruments

           1. Desk officer’s questionnaire (1 per LGA)
           2. Project Support Unit/LGA Education Secretary’s questionnaire (1 per LGA)
           3. Traditional/Religious leader’s questionnaire (1 per community)
           4. Head Teacher’s questionnaire (1 per school)
           5. Teacher’s questionnaire (1 per school)
           6. School checklist (1 per school)
           7. Student’s Focus Group Discussion Guide (1 FGD per school involving 5
              students)
           8. SBMC Focus Group Discussion Guide (1 FGD per school involving 5 SBMC
              members)
           9. Parents/Community Focus Group Discussion Guide (1 per school)

5.      Data Analysis. The total number of SESP schools for which data were available were 733 (out
of 849 schools). The main survey data analysis was undertaken in SPSS. Two types of data were
generated: quantitative data, generated through the data sheets and questionnaires; and qualitative data,
generated through interviews and questionnaires.


Main Findings

6.       A key finding is that schools in project LGAs have been able to boost enrolment for girls in all
three states as a result of school support through grants. For example, in Kano State which has the
lowest participation among the three States, girls’ enrolment in project schools increased at a higher
rate than that of non-project schools (18.2% versus 14.7% - see table 1 below):

                   Table 1: Growth in enrolment in Kano: 2008/2009-2009/2010

                Source: School Development Grant Assessment in Kano, Kaduna and Kwara States, June 2011.


7.       Other findings are: (a) all School-based Management Committees were established in the three
States; (b) all of them have developed School Development Plans according to approved guidelines; (c)
all SBMCs were trained in school level management and use of school grants; (d) Parent-Teacher
Associations have embraced the School Development Scheme; (e) the school population increased in
project LGAs; (f) there was strong community involvement and ownership; (g) physical learning
environment has improved remarkably in project LGAs; (h) better awareness was created at the school
and community level; (i) teaching/learning materials were made available in concerned schools.


The Teacher Professional Development and Learning Outcomes Assessment in Kaduna, Kano
and Kwara

8.      Methodology. The evaluation was conducted as an end-of-project evaluation of the SESP
project in Kaduna, kano and Kwara States. It involved a comparison of results with baseline results
conducted in the three States in 2007. Learning achievement tests in literacy and numeracy were
administered on Primary 4 and 6 students, respectively, and questionnaires administered on head
teachers, and teachers.

9.      Instruments. All instruments used for the baseline survey were adopted for this study. They
consisted of questionnaires/checklists, classroom observations, teachers’ interviews. Literacy and
numeracy tests were used, as well as two other instruments to measure teacher attitude towards the TPD

     number of textbooks in the school, etc.

     11.     Data Analysis. Data on schools, teaching and learning environment, head teacher practices,
     teachers and students, and simple tests of literacy and numeracy were examined. Simple charts using
     simple percentages and elementary statistics are used. Analysis was carried out through the Excel and
     SPSS software.
4.
5.
     Main Findings

     12.      Major findings include the following: (a) remarkable improvements over the baseline took
     place in terms of school physical conditions (classrooms, furniture, lavatory facilities, drinking water,
     security, etc.); (b) there was little or no difference in head teacher/teacher focus on learning and their
     involvement of the wider community in improving schools (though anecdotal evidence indicate a high
     degree of cordiality between the head teacher and community members); (c) teacher attitudes towards
     the TPD was generally low; (d) a slight improvement over baseline was observed in teacher introduction
     of lessons; (e) generally teachers in urban areas were more able than those in rural areas in terms of
     literacy and numeracy; and (f) assessment of literacy and numeracy for primary Grades 4 and 6
     generally indicates marked improvements over baseline, though learning levels remain relatively low
     (see details in Annex 9 of this report).


     The Conditional Cash Transfer Pilot for Girls’ Education Kano, Nigeria: Very
     Preliminary Findings on Female School Participation in Kano

     13.     This is an ongoing impact evaluation study. In Kano State, only 30% of girls attend
     secondary school and female school participation rates peak at age nine and decline
     precipitously after that.

     14.     Program Objectives & Design:              Overcoming demand-side constraints to girls’
     transition to secondary school.

     15.     Targeting:

             12,000 girls, from grades 5,6, JS 1 (either in- school or recently dropped out)
             300 randomly selected schools from 12 LGAs
             Rural – all girls; Urban – proxy means test
             Beneficiary identification through community meetings




                                                        46
16.     Early results suggest large enrolment and attendance impacts of CCTs for girls in
Northern Nigeria. There is suggestive evidence that due to supply constraints overall education
quality could be suffering. Amount of transfer seems to matter for attendance. However,
attendance elasticities are very small.

17.     Transition rate from Primary to Secondary School. Impacts are lower bounds due to
limited number of seats in Junior Secondary schools.

18.    First Round Attendance Impacts: Grade six beneficiaries show the largest gains,
equivalent to about 14 percent of control attendance rates (No change in junior secondary
attendance, but these data appear to be unreliable)

19.    Learning Environment: No impacts on boys’ attendance, no impacts on attendance in
lower grades. Teacher absenteeism is significantly higher in treatment schools.

20.   CCT impacts are smaller among poorest urban children and children going to
government schools (as opposed to Islamiyya schools).

21.     Preliminary evidence (from 2nd round of attendance checks) that beneficiaries are
reacting to program credibility signals. School participation of older girls seems more sensitive
to these signals. The challenge in this regard is how to safeguard CCT programs from political
hijacking.
