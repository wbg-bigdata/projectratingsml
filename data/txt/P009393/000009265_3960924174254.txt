FIRST VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(CREDIT 912-BD)
MPREACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First
Vocational Training Project in Bangladesh, for which IDA Credit 912-BD in
the amount of US$25 million was approved on May 28, 1979. The Credit was
closed on June 30, 1987, two years behind schedule. The balance of the
Credit proceeds, some US$6.41 million, was cancelled.
This report was prepared by a Unesco mission for the Government of
Bangladesh under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement concluded between
Unesco and the World Bank.   The PCR is based, inter alia, on (i) the
findings of the UNESCO project completion mission to Bangladesh during
October-November, 1988; (ii) discussions with people knowledgeable about
the project; and (iii) data from project files at Bank headquarters in
Washington.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on October 26, 1989 for comments by
December 22, 1989, but none was received.

FIRST VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 912-BD)
Introduction
This project was designed to assist the Government in streng-
thening vocational training for skilled workers.   It was prepared with
Unesco assistance, appraised In August-September 1978, and was approved the
following May. Project costs were estimated at US$32.38 million equiva-
lent, of which IDA financing of US$25.0 million equivalent was to cover 77
percent of the total. The project took seven years to complete, or about
twice as long as anticipated at appraisal, and was closed on June 30, 1989.
Total project costs were US$24.77 million, an underrun of 23.5 percent in
US dollars, but an overrun of 17.3 percent when expressed in local currency
terms. The underrun in US dollars was due mainly to the devaluation of the
local currency and lower than expected operating costs. Overruns within
the individual categories (civil works, equipment, furniture and technical
assistance) were mainly due to the change in the building program, addi-
tional equipment and cost increases in technical assistance honoraria. Of
the original proceeds of the Credit, US$16.6 million was disbursed and
US$8.4 million was cancelled, leaving the Credit to cover only 67 percent
of the total project cost.
Obiectives and Project Content
Objectives of the First Vocational Training Project were to: (a)
help increase the capability of the Government to plan, manage and evaluate
skill training; (b) accelerate the output from skill training institutions
to meet manpower shortages; and (c) improve the productivity of employed
workers.   A major goal of the project was to strengthen the National
Council for Skill Development and Training (NCSDT), a high level body res-
ponsible for formulating national training policies and plans and allo-
cating resources for training programs. As designed, the project provided:
(a) construction, furnishing and equipping of headquarters for the
Secretariat of the NCSDT, five Technical Training Centers (TTCs), and
additional equipment for two existing TTCs; (b) provision of funds on a
declining base to finance the salaries of additional staff for the
Secretariat of the NCSDT, staff salaries and training materials for five
new TTCs and for four existing TTCs; and (c) technical assistance and
professional services.
Implement1ton Experienca
The Credit Agreement was amended four times.    In 1984, it was
changed to allow the construction of two additional floors at the NCSDT
building and one additional floor at the administrative and academic block
of two TTCs. In 1985, the existing six-month modular training courses at



- vii -
the TTCs were replaced by self-contained courses of nine to twelve months
duration. Accordingly, the following year the Government revised the out-
put target from 10,300 p.a. to 7,880 p.a. In 1986, the Credit was amended
to allow for the transfer of US$750,000 from the *unallocated category to
"instructional equipment" and later to complete civil works, including
rehabilitation and renovation of TTC buildiags built by the Public Works
Department (PWD) between 1976 and 1980. In addition, there were five revi-
sions of the Agreement between the Government and International Labor
Organization (ILO). The first three concerned adjustment of the technical
assistance component, while the two others concerned the provision of addi-
tional training equipment and consumable materials.
The project was originally scheduled to be completed in four and a
half years but took seven and a half. The closing date was extended twice
to allow the installation of additional equipment and the completion of
buildings and the fellowship program.   The Project Implementation Unit,
which was inexperienced with IDA projects, did not carry out its functions
expeditiously, in part because of the lack of experience and high turnover
of Chief Technical Advisors (CTAs) and staff.
Despite these problems, the project was basically implemented as
designed, at least in terms of its physical aspects. Sites are appropriate
for project facilities.   Designs for project buildings, except for the
NCSDT building, are economical, although there were increases in areas
built in almost every case. The technical assistance for strengthening the
PIU, the Secretariat of the NCSDT and the project TTCs experienced problems
due to the high turnover of CTAs (five for the project duration), difficul-
ties in recruiting competent experts and considerable delays in providing
the experts with counterparts.
Results
The project was intended to increase the capability of the
Government in planning, managing and evaluating skill training, to accel-
erate the output from skill training institutions, and to improve the
productivity of employed workers. Although the buildings have been built
and some of the staff have been upgraded/trained as anticipated, outcomes
have been generally disappointing. The NCSDT and its executive arm, the
Secretariat, have never functioned as intended. The Council does not meet
regularly enough to perform its functions of formulating policy for and
managing the vocational training system, while the Secretariat is seriously
understaffed as well as handicapped without leadership of the NCSDT.
Although the rudiments of a monitoring and evaluation system and a National
Trade Standards and Tests system for TTCs have been established, neither
has been put into full operation.   Moreover, the training institutions
themselves do not appear to be operating as intended.   Output from the
project TTCs was low (less than 40 percent of the revised project targets),
while unemployment among TTC graduates in their chosen field is high.  This
situation with the institutions and their graduates appears all the more
paradoxical given the apparent high demand for skilled and semi-skilled
workers in Bangladesh. Objectives of increasing the productivity of 7,000
already employed workers through on-the-job training was not met because
the requisite financial support from various public sector corporations was
not forthcoming.

SstainabLIb
Without enactment of some of the recommendations cited below,
prospects for sust&Inability of this project are not promising on any
front--financial, institutional, or human. The major problems seem to be:
lack of support of intended beneficiaries (both students and employers);
inability of the vocational training system to retain qualified instructors
owing to more attractive conditions in the private sector; poor apparent
linkage between the training system and the needs of the market; and weak
support and guidance from the Govern'ent in the areas of policy formulation
and program implementation.
Recom_ ndations
In order to improve operating outcomes it is recommended that:
(a) based on the Cabinet Resolution (No. S-ll/TA-1/78), the Government
review the activities of the NCSDT and take appropriate measures for estab-
lishing its leadership in the Vocational Training System of Bangladesh; (b)
some additional efforts (in terms of finance, computer equipment, and staff
training) be directed toward putting the monitoring and evaluation system
in full operation; (c) widespread recognition and awareness of the benefits
of the National Trade Testing System be developed among the public and
employers, and the conditions for implementing the system be improved; and
(d) the NCSDT be flexible in establishing admission criteria and work more
closely with employers to identify trades to be taught, the standards of
performance they require and the duration of the training needed in order
to improve the internal efficiency and external productivity of TTCs.
While additional extensive investment in this subsector is not
merited as this time, the creation of a Special Skill Development Fund is
recommended in order to assist employers in upgrading productive workers
and to revive the moribund apprenticeship training program.
Findings and Lessons
The project attempted to establish a national trade training
system, and as such, covered all the major elements typically deemed neces-
sary for such a system. But potential difficulties, such as the declining
profits of public corporations (who were supposed to support the system),
the general disinterest of the public in attending TTC courses (and the
white collar aspirations of those who do attend), and the difficulty of
establishing functional arrangements for setting policy and managing the
system were underestimated.   Implementation experience with this project
has also emphasized following:
(a) identifying, at the appraisal stage, the nature of problems
(administrative, financial, legal, manpower, or other) which might
be a source of bottlenecks and a cause of delays in project
implementation;
(b) establishing a permanent structure for the management of project
implementation which will accumulate implementation and evaluation
experience for the benefit of the country.   This requires the



- ix-
capitalization of certain staff costs and provision of training in
technical and professional expertise;
(c) decentralizing operations and at the same time ensuring an effec-
tive communication system between the central and regional offices
so as to make site supervision more efficient. Adequate transpor-
tation and travel costs should be included in project budgets;
(d) including in budget estimates the cost of adequate site prepara-
tion (particularly earth filling and drainage system) so as to
ensure a better protection of the buildings against natural
disasters;
(e) paying attention to details of arrangements for project implemen-
tation. This was particularly crucial in the case of storage of
building materials and heavy equipment delivered on various sites
where construction work was not completed; and
(f) paying attention to the fulfillment of the operational program so
as to ensure the full use of the premises, and avoid underutilized
accommodation units which have suffered rapid physical
deterioration.

FIRST VYCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT (CREDIT 912-BDI
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
1.01     Bangladesh with a population estimated at around 100 million
(1985), and an annual per capita income estimated at $160 is one of the
poorest countries in the world. According to the recent survey,V about 45
percent of the population does not have enough income to afford a basic
diet considered to be the minimum necessary by international standards.
1.02     In the early 1980s, faced with an international recession, a
serious deterioration in its terms of trade, and a stagnation in external
aid receipts upon which the country is almost uniquely dependent,
Bangladesh adopted a program of economic stabilization which has largely
provided the policy framework followed since then. Demand management poli-
cies were used to reduce the fiscal deficit from 11.2 percent of GDP in
FY83 to 7.2 percent in FY86, which, together with an active exchange rate
management policy and control of imports, helped to reduce the external
current account deficit from 9.1 percent of GDP to 7 percent.  Economic
growth, averaging about 4 percent p.a. in real terms, was modest during
this period, due in part to the need for demand restraint and a continuing
series of natural disasters. Nevertheless, Bangladesh recorded a slight
improvement in poverty alleviation, which was reflected in increased real
wages for unskilled agricultural workers, greater availability of food and
employment through relief program such as Food for Work and Vulnerable
Group Development, and improvements in other poverty and nutrition
indicators.
1.03     Economic performance in FY87 largely continued the previous
trends. GDP grew at an overall rate of 4.1 percent; but value added in
agriculture rose by only 0.1 percent, reflecting a 22 percent decline in
raw jute production from the previous year. Manufacturing growth improved
to 6.4 percent due to increased processing of jute goods for export and
stronger domestic demand for textiles, as stricter enforcement of anti-
smuggling measures reduced inflows of foreign-made textiles.   Export
earnings increased by $255 million (or 31 percent in current prices) led by
the surge in non-traditional exports. This, together with sharply higher
remittances from abroad, led to a balance of payments surplus of $257
million, while gross reserves rose to a comfortable level of $752 million,
equivalent to 3.4 month's total imports. The budget deficit was kept below
the projected level of 8.2 percent of DGP, although both revenues and
expenditures fell short of targets by roughly equal amounts. The ratio of
government revenue to GDP fell slightly to 9 percent of GDP, while expen-
diture growth was restrained by an unexpected surplus in the food account.
Judged on an overall basis, FY87 represented a creditable performance from
the standpoint of financial stabilization, but was somewhat disappointing
from the standpoint of growth, which remained below the economy's
potential.

1.04     The floods in July-September 1988 affected severely the newly
planted aman rice crop. Preliminary estimates show that flood damage to
rural infrastructure has been extensive.   Repair and reconstruction is
programmed to be spread over two to three years, with the most urgent
measures initiated in the dry season started in November.
Education Sector
1.05     The formal education system in Bangladesh consists of five years
of primary education (grades 1-5), seven years of secondary education
(grades 6-12) and two to five years of higher education. Secondary educa-
tion is divided into three years of junior secondary (junior high school,
grades 6-8) and two years of secondary (high school, grades 9-10) followed
by two years of higher secondary or intermediate college education (grades
11-12).  There are two public examinations leading to the award of the
Secondary School Certificate (SSC) after grade 10 and the Higher Secondary
Certificate (HSC) after grade 12. The HSC is the minimum requirement for
entry to degree programs.   College degrees (pass degrees) are offered in
two-year college courses provided by the degree colleges. Although most
secondary schools and colleges are private non-profit institutions, the
magnitude of Government support and regulation is such that they should be
considered as part of the centralized governmental system of formal educa-
tion. University degrees (honors degrees) are offered in the seven univer-
sities and require, for the most part, three years of course work.
Technical education is offered in polytechnics (SSC pass students for a
three-year diploma) and the engineering colleges (HSC pass students for
four years leading to a BS).
1.06     Vocational (trade) training is being conducted mainly by the
Technical Training Centers (TTCs) run by the BMET, (Ministry of Labor and
Manpower),  and Vocational Training Institutes  (VTIs),  run by the
Directorate of Technical Education (Ministry of Education).  In 1982, the
Government decided to reorganize the Vocational Training System and the
VTIs were transferred from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of
Labor. However, in 1985, the VTIs were transferred back to the Ministry of
Education. At present, the trade courses offered in the TTCs and VTIs are
of two years duration, which is divided into two separate independent
parts. Each part consists of nine months institutional training and three
months industrial attachment.2Y There are also some short-term courses.
The level of intake is after eight or ten grades of general education,
depending on the trade. At present there are eleven TTCs with the total
students enrollment of about 3,200, and 55 VTIs with the total student
enrollment of about 4,200. In addition to that there are a number of trade
training centers run by other ministries and agencies as well as by NGOs
and private enterprises.
1.07     Beginning with the Second Five-Year Plan (1980-1985),  the
Government has made primary education a priority, seeking to increase
enrollment and improve quality. It has also focused on increasing opportu-
nities in vocational and technical education while limiting growth in non-
technical university education.
/ The industrial attachment programme has not been introduced yet to
VTIs.

Project Identification
1.08     The project was identified by a joint Unesco/World Bank mission in
March 1978 and prepared by the Government with the assistance of a Unesco
team in August 1978. It was then appraised by a Bank mission in May 1979.
The project was approved by the IDA Board of Directors on May 22, 1979.
The Development Credit Agreement was signed on May 31, 1979, and the Credit
became effective on November 25, 1979.
Proiect Objectives
1.09     The objectives of the project were to assist the Government to:
(a) help increase the capability of the government plan, manage and
evaluate skill training, (b) accelerate the output from skill training
institutions to meet acute manpower shortages, and (c) improve the
productivity of employed workers.
Proiect Cgntent
1.10     The vocational training project, the first of its kind to be
financed by IDA, consisted of:
(a) Construction, furnishing and equipping of:
(i) headquarters for the Secretariat of the National Council for
Skill Development and Training (NCSDT);
(ii) five technical training centers located at Bogra, Barisal,
Comilla, Mymensingh and Khulna;
(b) Additional equipment for two existing TTCs at Mirpur and Rajshahi;
(c) Provision of funds on a declining basis through CY 1984 to.
finance: (i) salaries of additional staff for the Secretariat of
the NCSDT; (ii) salaries and training materials for the five new
TTCs; (iii) salaries of additional staff and training materials
for the progressive introduction of short courses in the
afternoon, evening and morning shifts at four existing TTCs
(Mirpur, Bangladesh-German, Chittagong, and Rajshahi);
(d) Staff training of (i) 425 instructors for the TTCs and (ii) 1,500
training personnel for industry-based schemes; and
(e) technical assistance including 41 man-years of specialist services
and 49 man-years of fellowships.
Proiect Amendments
1.11     The Credit Agreement was amended four times:  (i) in 1984 to allow
the additional construction of two floors at the NCSDT building, and an
additional floor at the administrative and academic block of two TTCs;
(ii) in 1985, to replace the existing training courses at TTCs based upon
modules of employable skills of not more than nine to twelve months
duration. According to this amendment, in 1986, the Government revised the
output target from 10,300 p.a. to 7,880 p.a.; (iil) in 1986, to allow for



- 4 -
the transfer of US$750,000 from the unallocated category" to the
winstructional equipment"; and (iv) in 1986, to complete the civil work
including rehabilitation and renovation of TTC8 buildings built by the PND
between 1976 and 1980.
II.  PROJECT 1PLUDZXIQN
Overview
2.01     The Credit Agreement was signed on Nay 31, 1979, and the project
became effective on November 5, 1979 as planned. After a slow start in
implementation due to a problem of availability of sites and changes made
in the project content involving additional floors in the NCSDT building
and in 2 TTCs, the civil works were finally started nearly 18 months behind
schedule. These necessitated the extension of the closing date originally
planned for June 30, 1985 to June 30, 1986. To permit the installation of
additional equipment procured in early 1987 and the completion of the
fellowship program, it was extended for another year to June 30, 1987. The
Implementation of the project is shown in Annex II.01.   The technical
assistance program was providfd as expected by the ILO. There were alto-
gether five revisions of the Agreement with IW in the course of Project
Implementation.   The first three concerned adjustment of the technical
assistance component, while the two other revisions concerned additional
training equipment.
Project Administration and Nanaggmen
2.02     A Project Implementation Unit (rMU) was established in October
1979, chiefly comprising:   (i) a project director who was the Director
General of the BMET; (ii) a project manager (consultant); and (iii) a
project architect (consultant).   All totalled, the PIU consisted of 16
managerial and supporting staff (Annex II.02). The PIU was also assisted
by the Chief Technical Advisor provided by IW.
2.03     The project experienced major difficulties during implementation.
The project director resigned soon after the start of the project and was
replaced by the Director of Training Operations of the BMET. The acting
project director was not available full-time for the project. The PIU had
no project manager during the whole of 1986. Throughout the implementation
period there were five Chief Technical Advisors, and such turnover also
contributed to lack of coherence during implementation.
Professional Services and Building Desi"n
2.04     A firm of consulting architects-engineers-planners from Dacca was
selected and contracted by the Project Director with IDA approval.  Its
task was to carry out the design of the building and the furniture of the
NCSDT building, the design of the buildings and some furniture for the
TTCs, together with preparation of specifications and site supervision.
The performance of the consulting firm was satisfactory. Once the design
was approved by the Project Director and IDA, the drawings and specifica-
tions were delivered in time.  Site supervision during the construction



phase was reasonably well done with a resident engineer representing the
firm present at each site.
2.05     NCSDl Building.  The site finally was acquired in December 1982,
36 months behind the schedule. It is conveniently located and has a total
area of 22,000 square feet. The building area occupies 6,800 square feet.
The rest of the site outside *te building is used for garages and parking
spaces.
2.06     The program for the NCSDT building as originally planned at the
appraisal stage would cover a floor space area of about 20,000 square feet.
It was to provide mainly office space for the services of the NCSDT's
Secretariat. It was also to provide ground floor accommodation for utility
services.  In 1984 a government decision came into force which required
that the ground floor of all government buildings in Dacca area be reserved
for parking of vehicles. In 1985 the GOB requested IDA concurrence for the
addltion of 2 floors and a lift to the original building design, which
already included 4 floors, to accommodate the services of the VTIs
(paragraph 1.06) as well as the utility services of the BMET. The addition
represented a total usable area of about 6,665 square feet. IDA complied
with this request.  Thus the total number of floors built is therefore six
above the ground floor, providing a total usable area of 38,480 square
feet, which is 18,480 square feet more than what was envisaged by the
appraisal report. At present, the ground floor is left unused although
enclosed by walls; all the utility services originally planned here have
been distributed among the other floors.  Circulation accounts for more
than 35 percent of the usable area (not including parking and garages).
The distribution of the various areas corresponding to the program of the
BMET is shown in Annex 11.03.
2.07     The building is built on stilts as is the common practice in the
Dhaka area. It has a reinforced concrete structure, with concrete beams,
columns, and slabs, and a roof terrace. The external walls are of double
hollow cement blocks with cement rendering.  Terrazzo and cement tile
flooring, metal frame windows and a demontable partitioning system con-
sisting of standard glass panels (ll'x4') in wood frames, which allow
flexibility while providing natural lighting inside the building.
2.08     TTs.  The construction of the first phase of the TTCs started in
1976.   It was financed by the Goverment under the supervision of PND
regional offices.  PND head office was also responsible for the design.
The buildings were completed in 1980. According to the IDA project, the
five TTCs established by the Government were to be provided with additional
workshops, hostel accommodation for the trainees, a guest house and addi-
tional residential units for chief instructors, instructors and supporting
staff.  The additional site was acquired in September 1981 only, or 21
months behind schedule. The comparative Table of areas planned and built
of all accommodation units in each of the five TTCs is shown in Annex
11.04.
2.09     The buildings included in the project have a standard design
identical for each of the TTCs.  It consists of a reinforced concrete
structure, and slabs, brick ln-fill walls with cement finishes inside. The
brick facing on the outside gives a definite unity to the architecture of
the compound.

Source:  Compiled by the mission.
2.11     The net areas provided in the new workshops average 15 percent
above appraisal figures.  A sizeable difference appears in 2 cases.  The
chief instructor's office which is located above the store room near the
entrance on a sort of mezzanine overlooking the workshop, is accessible
only by way of a very steep steel ladder. It is used in none of the four
TTCs visited by the mission. Reasons given were difficult access and lack
of ventilation. Ths civil drafting room and the mechanical drafting room
which in all TTCs have both been accommodated in the PWD building by using
two adjacent classrooms by demolishing the partition between them. They
have a long corridor shape, are overcrowded by the furniture, and lack
efficient lighting which is necessary for this type of work. There ts no
outdoor activity at the auto/mechanics workshop. Auto bodies for repair
work are brought inside the workshop. Although the buildings and facili-
ties offered at the TTC's hostels are of good quality, the lay out of the
hostel is not economical, as each of its elements (dormitory wing, dining
hall, auditorium, etc.) is treated as an independent volume.
civil W-oks
2.12     According to provisions in the construction contracts for the five
TTCs and NCSDT building, the PIU provided the majority (60 percent) of
construction materials through local competitive bidding.   The non-
availability of sites at the target date permitted the PIU to organize the
delivery of building materials among the various sites on time.
2.13     The selection of the building contractors for the construction of
the NCSDT building and the five new TTCs folloied IDA procedures. The size
of the bidding did not attract foreign contractors. A pre-selection was
done by the PIU among local firms after IDA had accepted local competitive
bidding procedures. Tenders were called for by project items, i.e., the
NCSDT secretariat, and individually each of the five TTCs in Barisal,



- 7 -
Bogra, Comilla, Khulna and Mymensingh. The overall responsibility for the
construction rests with the general contractor.   Five contracts were
awarded: one contracting firm having won tenders for two TTCs.
2.14     Civil works experienced considerable delays at the start of the
project implementation due mainly to (a) lengthy procedures for land acqui-
sition at the NCSDT site as well as at TTCs sites, and (b) the nonavail-
ability of funds for custom clearance for the release of imported building
materials, an operation under the responsibility of the GOB alone. Other
reasons that required an extension of the time period of completion were
additional construction program such as one floor addition of academic
buildings in Barisal and Mymensingh TTCs, overhead water tank (TTC Khulna),
deep tube-well (TTC Barisal), renovation of workshops (all TTCs) and
addition of two more floors at NCSDT.
2.15     The renovation program of all PWD-built buildings at the TTCs,
which included:   roof leakages, drainage, electrification,  plumbing,
plastering and painting was also delayed by the unavailability of nwD
maintenance teams. To avoid the interference of two building contractors
on the same site, the PIU extended the contract of the general contractor
in each TTC site to carry out this renovation program. Such delays caused
some damage to the equipment which could not be installed when delivered in
the site.
2.16     Among the conditions of effectiveness,  the Development Credit
Agreement specified that: "the Borrower shall have entered into agreements
with tecimical agencies or bodies for the provision of technical assistance
experts and fellowships for the project .... ' Such an agreement was signed
in August 1979 with the ILO.   It covered ILO provision of services for
equipment procurement as well as technical assistance. ILO experts parti-
cipated actively in the preparation of equipment lists and specifications
in close collaboration with the PIU and, at some stage, with the Principals
of the TTCs. Equipro, a branch of ILO at the Geneva headquarters, was made
responsible for the purchase of equipment, an operation which was carried
out in two phases as follows:
(i) A first package of heavy equipment representating about 80 percent
of the total, was procured and delivered by December 1982.
(ii) In January 1986, following ILO suggestion and with IDA approval,
the fifth revision of the Agreement between the GOB and the ILO
substantially increased the allocation made available for
equipment, mainly for additional training material. handtools and
consumables. These were ordered by EQUIPRO during the spring of
1986, dispatched in containers in March 1987 and arrived in June
1987.   This was, among others, a reason for GOB requesting the
extension of the closing date to 31 December 1987. Two additional
TTCs (Bangladesh-German and Chittagong) benefitted from this
additional equipment.
2.17     The efficient fulfillment of Equipro's contract in the procurement
of equipment during the first years of the Project Implementation, was



- 8 -
counterweighed by the serious delays in civil works which considerably
hampered the installation of heavy equipment delivered in 1982.
2.18     Crates and containers were stored (some uncovered) first at
Chittagong, the Port of entry for Bangladesh, waiting for custom clearance
and payment by the GOD of custom duties and taxes, and second, after their
arrival on TTCs sites where construction work was not completed.   Many
parts had to be repaired or renovated from damage by two rainy seasons
before being installed. Bank supervision missions brought the attention of
the PIU to this problem, on several occasions, and discussed measures to be
taken for adequate storage of equipment in covered premises.  All parts
were procured through normal international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA regulations.   ILO experts assisted the PIU in
finalizing the bids. The rest of the procedure was monitored by EQUIPRO
from their Geneva headquarters.
2.19    Tenders were advertised internationally and organized into
packages by trade. The PIU manager was responsible for local control, in
particular, port clearance and delivery to the sites which were contracted
to local transport firms through local competitive bidding. Although ILO
experts had already left the country by the time the installation phase
could proceed, this work was satisfactorily carried out by National Skilled
Development Instructor teams (NSDI) hired by IID from local industries.
2.20    The mission was shown the equipment in all TTCs visited (7 out of
9) and witnessed demonstrations. All the equipment is now installed and
operational.
Furniture
2.21    Most of the furniture for the NCSDT Secretariat was office
furniture including: armchairs, visitors chairs, tables and office desks
designed by the architectural consulting firm also responsible for the
design of the buildings. Cupboards and filing cabinets, secretarial desks,
etc., were procured through local competitive biddings.
2.22    TTCs furniture consisted mainly of office furniture for the
administrative offices and ;he instructors offices, drafting tables and
benches for the drafting rooms and the workshops, furniture for the hostel
(chairs, tables, cupboards and beds) which were also designed by the
architects. In general the designs are satisfactory and the manufacturing
is adequate with a few exception: tubular frame chairs and stools for TTC
trainees have been found to be fragile.
2.23    All this furniture was procured through local competitive bidding
procedures organized in packages such as:  wood furniture, steel frame
furniture, combined steel framed, wood seats. Apart from delays during the
organization of tenders, particularly the prequalification of manufacturing
firms, all furniture was delivered on time.
Technical Assistance
2.24     The project orig'nally included:   (a) 8 man-years of special
services and 6 man-months fellowships for the establishment of the
Secretariat of the National Council for Skill Development and Training;



(b) 15 man-years of specialist services and 14 mn-years of fellowships for
staff training and commissioning the TTCs; () 8 man-years of specialist
services and 28 man-years of fellowships for the organization of in-plant
training; (d) 2 man-years of specialist services and 1 man-year of
fellowships for procurement, evaluation, analysis of training costs, etc.;
and (e) 8 man-years of local consultant services for project manageesnt and
civil works implementation.
2.25     As envisaged at the time of appraisal the tochnical assistance was
provided by IL under the agreement with the Government signed in August
1979. There were three more revisions of this agreement concerning the
adjustment of technical assistance components. A summary o_. the technieal
assistance program is given in Annex 11.05.
2.26     S2ecialit Services.   The project originally included 396 man-
montha of expatriate specialists services which after revision in 1986 was
reduced to 322.75 man-months. in fact, the specialist services took 329.25
man-months, or 6.5 man-months more than it was envisaged by the revised
project proforma.
2.27     The project experienced serious difficulties with regards to the
key post of the Chief Technical Advisor (CTA). During the protact imple-
mentation there were five CTA's who did not renew their contract or
resigned before the end of their term. The replacement of the first one
took eight months, and therefore, the post remained vacant from April 1982
to March 1983.   This situation also was hampered by ILO difficulties in
recruiting competent experts.   However, those finally recruited, once at
their post, ptrformed reasonably well.
2.28     On the other hand, the Government experienced considerable delays
in providing experts with sufficient number of full-time counterparts.
There was a Government ban on the recruitment of civil servants during a
martial law period which was lifted only in 1986. The problem was com-
pounded, since many of the assigned counterparts were either mismatched to
the work of the particular sector or were of a different calibre.
2.29     Local Consultants Services.  The project originally allocated 96
man-months which after the revision in 1986 was increased to 120 man-
months. In fact, the local consultant services took only 108 man-months.
The remaining 12 man-months which were to be used by the consultant manager
have never been used. Instead, the BMET Director of Training Standards and
Planning undertook this job on a part-time bases during the first and the
second extension of the project.   However,  the performance of local
consultants (both project manager and architect) has been satisfactory.
2.30     Fallowships.   The project originally included 588 man-months
fellowships which after revision in 1980 was nearly tripled to 1,558. In
fact, the fellowships took 941 man-months or 617 less than it was
allocated. About 95 percent of fellowships were of a regional nature. The
fellowship program was controlled entirely by the Government. ILO involve-
ment was purely administrative (i.e., making arrangements for fellowships
to be activated) and the experts took little part in approval of programs,
recommending candidatures, pre-fellowships orientation, etc.



- 10 -
2.31     The overall implementation of fellowships program was slower than
planned for various reasons: complex and lengthy government procedures for
nominating candidates, proper matching of desirable and actual qualifica-
tion, somewhat unwieldy mechanics of placement, considerable problems in
the placing of fellows in the in-plant sector, etc.
[nstrucetional and Consumable Materials
2.32     The curriculum prepared in cooperation with the BTEB is now
followed in all TTCs. However, trainees still lack necessary instructional
materials such as books, manuals, and worksheets in Bengali. Such materi-
als were to be developed by the technical assistance experts, but due to
inadequate management this was never accomplished.
2.33     TTCs have adequate provision of consumable materials for workshop
practice. However, only $1.76 million of the $5.28 millions allocated for
the consumable materials has been spent due to the long delays with the
construction of TTCs and the overestimation of materials required for in-
plant training activities.
-_', COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
Proiects Costs and Financin;
3.01     At appraisal the estimated project cost including taxes and duties
was $32.38 million (Taka:  485.76 million) and the IDA financing of $25
million was expected to cover approximately 77 percent of the total project
cost. The final project cost is $24.77 million3/ (Taka: 569.72 million
including the cost of regional offices which were entirely financed by the
Government). This figure is approximately 24 percent less than was esti-
mated in dollars terms and 17 percent more than was estimated in local
currency. Total disbursement amounted to $16.59 million, or 66 percent of
the credit, covering 67 percent of the final cost of the project--as com-
pared to the 77 percent in the appraisal estimates. The credit account was
closed on December 31, 1987 and the sum of $8.41 million was cancelled.
The Annex III.01 gives a comparison of estimated and actual costs by proj-
ect component.
3.02     The differences shown in the Annex:  17 percent overrun in taka;
and 24 percent underrun in US$, are due mainly to the devaluation of the
taka during project implementation (1979: 1US$ - taka 15,00; 1987: 1US$ -
taka 33,00) which resulced in the escalation of labor costs as well as
local materials. On the other hand, as far as local currency is concerned,
the underexpenditure clearly shown in the case of operating costs (salaries
and consumable training materials, category 3 and 4) are due to delays in
civil works which impeded an early start of the operational phase of the
project. On the contrary over-expenditure in the categories of buildings,
equipment, and expert services was due to the change made in the building
program, additional equipment and to cost increases in TA experts honoraria
(Annex 111.02: estimated and actual project costs by category).
i/ Based on 1US$ - Taka 23.00. Average figure between 1979 and 1987 rate
of exchange.



-11 -
3.03    During project implementation no staff training subsidies were
spent because of a Government ban on recruitment until 1986 which prevented
the NCSDT Secretariat from recruiting for the posts sanctioned but not
filled. Training needs were partly absorbed by the fellowship component.
unit CostsL
3.04    Unit costs per square foot of construction (exc%ading site devel-
opment but including contingencies) were estimated at US$15 per square
foot. This is an average figure for the construction of the TTCs (includ-
ing academic and communal as well as boarding and housing accommodation)
used in the analytical cost estimates in the appraisal report. A compari-
son of appraisal and actual unit costs shows an average increase of 118
percent in taka terms and 40 percent in dollar terms. It is presented in
Annex 111.03 and summarized in Table 2.

Disbur,sements
3.05    The delays which occurred during the early phase of the project
and held up civil works is reflected in the rate of disbursements as
presented in Annex 111.04: planned and actual schedule of disbursements,
which soon lagged behind appraisal estimates. The constant devaluation of
the taka during project implementation, explains further the reason for a
total disbursement figure of $16.59 million lower than the amount available
in the Credit ($25.00 million).
3.06    The revolving fund was established before December 1979 to comply
with the conditions of the DCA, but once the money had been spent (mainly
for the purchase of local materials) it was never replenished despite the
numerous complaints made by successive IDA supervision missions. The PIU
and the Project Director never succeeded in their pleas to the Ministry of



- 12-
Finance. It should be added that this situation had no effect ln the pro-
gress of project implementation as all payments to contractors, consul-
tants, etc., were made according to schedule.
IV.  PJ          QICOa
A.       The first main objective of the project was to help Iacrease the
capability of the Government to plan, manago, and evaluate skill traiiln8
through assistance to the NCSDT and its Secretariat, and the UNeT.
Activities of the NCSDT and its Secretariat
4.01     A National Council for Skill Development and Training was estab-
lished in 1979 by a Resolution of the Cabinet. It comprises ministers and
permanent secretaries of the Ministries of Manpower, Education, IndustrLes,
Finance and Planning, together with representatives of the employers
Association and the Trade Unions. The Council is responsible for preparing
draft legislation or administrative regulations/resolutions pertaining to
training, formulation of national training policies, approval of training
plans and recommending allocations of financial resources to implement the
plans and execution of training programs.   It is also responsible for
evaluating existing curricula and performance, approving new curricula,
national skill standards and tests, and curtailing ineffective programs.
Council membars channel decisions to the line ministries concerned with
implementation.   Annex IV.01 shows the organizational structure of the
National Council for Skill Development and Training and the relationship
with other ministries involved in training.
4.02     In order to increase the efficiency of the NCSDT the project pro-
posed that it should be assisted by a Secretariat located within the
Ministry of Labor and Manpower.   The Secretariat would incorporate the
Ministry's Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training, and would have its
functions divided among three directorates. The Directorate of Training
operations would be responsible through its regional divisions for tech-
nical training centers, in-plant and apprentice training and staff develop-
ment. The Directorate of Planning would carry out labor market analysis,
training needs assessment, planning and evaluation of training and the
collection of statistics. The Directorate of Standards would be respons-
ible for curriculum development, setting skill standard, trade testing and
the production of teaching material. Annex IV.02 shows the proposed and
actual organizational structure of the Secretariat.
4.03     The mission found that in spite of several attempts to organize
the the NCSDT's activities on regular bases, the effectiveness of the
Council in policy formulation and management of training remained unsatis-
factory.  For example, according to its own decision, the Council is to
meet at least once a year, however, since its creation in 1979 the full
Council met four times only (i.e., once in 1980, once in 1983, and twice in
1984). Although for the last four years a number of issues have accumu-
lated for discussion and policy decision, no meetings have taken place. At
present the Council's Secretariat (BRET) is practically left alone to
coordinate and manage vocational training activities through informal
arrangements with other agencies (MOE, BTEB, etc.).



- 13 -
4.04     There are a number of reasons which affect the activities of the
Council. Among them is the relatively low status of the Council which is
not a statutory body established through an Act of the Parliament (like
BTEB) but a body established through a resolution of the Government only.
As a result, the authority of the Council is not fully recognized by other
ministries and organizations, and it is not easy to call regular meetings
of the Council because of the high status of its members. Furthermore the
Council has been asked to deal with technical rather than policy matters
for which the members are not always qualified.  A number of advisory
committees set up by the Council in 1980 (Finance and Administration
Committee, Planning and Development Committee, Executive Committee) except
the Planning and Development Committee, have never started their work. At
the same time the BMET, which is the Council Secretariat, has been unable
to regularly prepare the position papers on policy issues because of the
insufficiency of the Secretariat itself.
4.05     It was estimated by the Appraisal Mission that about 100 profes-
sional level staff recruited from among the existing chief instructors and
engineering technicians from industrial enterprises would be required for
the establishment of the Secretariat to make it functional (Annex IV.02).
In fact, during project implementation the number of professional posts
were reduced by the Government from 100 to 40, and at present (November
1988) out of these sanctioned posts, 33 only have been filled. Among those
still vacant or never sanctioned, are:   Additional Director General,
Regional (zonal) Directors, manpower specialists, training planners, and
operations programers. Because the responsibilities for Trade Testing have
been transferred from the BMET to BTEB, the proposed two separate
directorates of the NCSDT Secretariat (Directorate of Training Standards
and Directorate of Planning) have been incorporated into one Directorate of
Training Standards and Planning, and a number of professional posts (job
analysts, curriculum specialists, testing and certification officers) have
been abolished.   The quality of professional staff below the level of
director is low.   Out of 13 existing deputy directors and assistant
directors, only five have passed through intensive upgrading courses at
BNDC and BUET, and three of them have already left their job.
4.06     In conclusion it should be mentioned that the NCSDT and its
Secretariat are not functioning in the manner envisaged at appraisal and
are instead becoming another obstacle in the already cumbersome decision
making process. Based on paragraph 5 of the Cabinet Resolution (No. S-
II/TA-1/78) which suggests that "The Government may, from time to time,
review the activities of the Council" the mission believes that it is high
time for the Government to implement this suggestion.
Establishing a Monitoring and Evaluation System
4.07     Section 3.11 of the DCA obligated the Government to establish a
monitoring and evaluation system by June 1, 1982. It was visualized that
such a system would evaluate annually the overall effectiveness and impact
of the training programs carried out under the project. There has been
considerable delay against appraisal targets in establishing such a system.
Three successive CTAs have made starts to develop an evaluation system but
these have never led to any concrete results. In 1984 a new CTA drafted a
plan to operate a continuous inspection system which would ensure that



- 14 -
every TTC receives at least one inspection per year. Finally a monitoring
form has been developed, a number of BMET staff has been trained as
monitors. The first phase of monitoring TTCs was carried out during March/
April 1986 and it was completed with the help of the computer of BUET. In
1987 a new monitoring form for Phase II was developed and the monitoring
was conducted in April 1987. The evaluation results were discussed with
the TTCs principals and BMET-zonal officers at the two-day workshops held
in October 1987.
4.08     At present the development of the evaluation system is practically
completed.   It is being set up and tested for computer operation at the
BUET.   The computer program is designed to keep track of the training
program expendlture, costs of consumable materials, equipment, number of
trainees by program, staff by program, examination, and trade testing
results, etc.  Once operational, it will provide detailed information on
the impact of the vocational training and on the supply of trained workers
for the industrLal and service sector of the country. This system is one
of the original components of the project. However, to put the established
monitoring and evaluation system in full operation some additional efforts
in terms of finance, computer, equipment, and staff training will be
requLred.
Establishing National Trade Standards and Tests System
4.09     In Bangladesh there are many private and state industrial
enterprises which have not codified the recruitment rules and pay scales
for their workers. The most common criteria that are applied to appoint
workers are work experience, training on-the-job and age. Practically none
of the enterprises have a uniform definition of unskilled, semi-skilled and
skilled workers for the proper application of recruitment rules and the pay
structure.
4.10     In order to establish a uniform definition of skills the- project
suggested a National Trade Standards and Tests System. It consists of two
essential parts. The first one includes the preparation of Trade Standards
and Tests for three-grade levels, namely:   Grade III (corresponding to
semi-skilled worker), Grade II (skilled worker), and Grade I (highly-
skilled worker). And the second part is to conduct the trade tests among
the TTC's and VTI's trainees as well as among tradesmen with or without
formal training who desire to obtain a trade certificate.
4.11     It was envisaged by the Appraisal Mission that the responsibility
for setting skill standards and conductory trade tests would rest upon the
Directorate of Standards of the BMET (paragraph 4.02). However, as per the
decision of the NCSDT in 1985, these responsibilities have been divided
between two agencies, namely 3NET (setting skill standard only) and BTEB
(setting and conducting trade testing). As a result the number of profes-
sional posts at the BMET's Directorate of Standards were considerably
reduced, and it was merged with the Directorate of Plannlng (paragraph
4.05).
4.12     The original objective of the project was to develop 30 trade
standards and tests according to 30 trades which were to be introduced at
the six-month modular courses of TTCs and VTIs. However, in 1984, because
of the six-month courses which had been replaced by two one-year courses



- 15 -
(paragraph 4.18), the number of trades at TTCs and VTIs as well as the
number of trade standards and tests to be developed, were reduced from 30
to 14. The status of preparation of standards and tests is given in Annex
IV.03. As seen from the Annex, out of 14 trade tests which were developed
for Grades III and II, and approved by the BTEB's Trade Advisory Committee,
four trade tests (radio/TV, refrigeration and air-conditioning, general
mechanics, and turner) are still at the validating stage.  However, the
further development of Trade Standards by the BMET and Trade Tests by the
BTEB would suffer from the lack of qualified personnel as the number of
vital professional posts at BMET (job analysts, manpower specialists,
testing and certificate officers, etc., has been abolished (paragraph
4.05), and they have never been reestablished at the BTEB. Not a single
Trade Standards and Tests for the Grade I has been developed.
4.13     Apart from the setting of Trade Standards and Tests there is a
problem of conducting trade tests. The experience of other countries which
have established national skill standards and tests system shows that the
test is always conducted on a tripartite basis (the parties being the
government, the workers and the employers), and the certificates issued on
the basis of the testing is universally acceptable in the country.   In
Bangladesh although a number of skill standards and tests has been
developed, the tripartite testing arrangements have never been introduced.
For this reason the final examinations, which are supposed to correspond to
the trade tests conducted by the BTEB for both TTCs and VTIs trainees,
cannot be considered as suitable trade testing.
4.14     From the mission's point of view the project has provided the
first steps only for the establishing Trade Standards and Tests System for
TTCs and VTIs trainees. However, some greater efforts should be undertaken
for strengthening the system itself and enhancing public and employer
awareness of the benefits of a National Trade Testing System.
B.       The second objective of the project was to accelerate the output
from skill training institutions to meet manpower shortages through
construction, equipment and furniture for five TTCs (Bogra, Barisal,
Comilla, Rhulna, and Nymensingh), equipment for two TTCs (Rajshahi and
Nirpur), instructor training, and support for staff and training materials
for four TTCs (Nirpur, Bangladesh-German, Chittagong, and Rajsbahi).
Technical Trainina Centers (new and existing)
4.15     Now TT8.   The Commilla TTC and Khulna TTC started their
operations on a limited scale in earlier 1980s, and at present they can
provide 308 and 452 places for skilled manpower training in seven and
twelve trades, respectively. The Mymensingh TTC, Barisal TTC and Bogra TTC
were opened in 1985 with the capacity of 272 places in six trades each.
The total capacity of new TTCs established by the project is about 1,600
places.
4.16     Existing TTCs.   Four existing TTCs (Mirpur, Bangladesh-German,
Chittagong and Rajshahi) were established between 1963 and 1969.   At
present, they can provide skill training from ten to twelve trades with a
total capacity of around 2,500 sitting places. Details of the capacity for



- 16 -
each TTC are in Annex IV.04 and the trades provided in Annex TV.05.4/
Trainlng Programs. Course Structure and Currlculum
4.17     Introduction of Six-month Nodular CQourses.   At the time of
appraisal it was agreed that the existing and new TTC8 would operate an a
two-shift system with some TTCs operating on an evening shift for employed
workers.   It was also agreed that starting in January 1980 with the
afternoon shift, courses of six-month duration would be introduced in the
existing TTCs, and by January 1982, all existing two-year courses would
have been phased out and replaced by six-month modular courses of
employable skills (720 hours).  Following this agreement, by 1984, six
batches of trainees completed six-month basic courses of Grade III level,
and the course content and syllabus for the six-month advanced module to
attain Grade II level of skill were also prepared and were ready for the
introduction in TTCs.  In addition, all the existing vocational training
institutes (VTIs) earlier belonging to the Ministry of Education were
transferred to the Ministry of Labor and the six-month modular courses were
introduced there in July, 1983. However, beginning in January 1984, there
was great resistance from the trainees to the six-month modular courses
introduced in both VTIs and TTCs. According to the Government's expert
sub-committee established in 1984:   "the reasons behind were lack of
properly trained instructional staff and insufficient supply of training
materials to attain the required skill level."I/  All training activities
both in VTIs and TTCs remained suspended for one complete year in 1984, and
as a result, all the VTIs were retransferred back to the Ministry of
Education, and the six-month modular courses were abolished and replaced by
two one-year self-content courses.
4.18     Introduction of Two One-Year Self-Content Courses.  Following a
recommendation of a committee especially established for this purpose,6/
the trade courses offered in the TITCs have been of two years duration since
1985. The two-year period is divided into two separate independent parts,
i.e.,  1st year and 2nd year.   Each part consists of nine months
institutional training and three months industrial attachment. Attachment
with industry is considered as integral part of the training program, in
order to expose the trainees to the industrial environment and also to
improve their practical skill level. The trainees on completion of each
part are to be employable as semi-skilled and skilled workers and at the
same time attain the skill standard Grade III on completion of 1st year and
skill standard Grade II on completion of 2nd year, respectively.   The
trainees on completion of 1st year may leave the training center for
employment or, if they so desire, may take admission into the 2nd year. It
should be mentioned that the 1st year course (Grade III) is identical with
the six-month basic modular courses and 2nd year courses (Grade II) is
identical with the six-month advanced modular courses introduced earlier,
in respect to their content (paragraph 4.17). The only difference is the
g/ In addition to that there are two more TTCs (Rangamati and Fariburg)
which are outside the IDA project.

duration that has been increased from six to nine months, and in addition
to that a 3-month on-the-job practice has been added. These courses both
for the 1st and 2nd year trainees, are being run during the morning shlft
only, and they are known as regular courses because they are being financed
from the regular budget of the Ministry of Labor and Manpower.
4.19     The second type of course is presently financed by the Ministry of
Youth.  This program of special courses is identical to that of regular
course program, and is being run durLig the afternoon shift.
4.20     The BTEh  is responsible for conducting the National Skill Standard
Test at the Grade III and II levels (for both regular and special courses
graduates) and for issuing trade certificates. In addition to that, the
TTCs also periodically organize on a limited basis skill upgrading programs
for industrial workers and self-supporting trade training programs for
those who are employed and cannot avail the regular day courses.  The
duration of these programs is from two to slx months, and they are usually
run during the afternoon or evening.
4.21    TZacling TLme.  During the nine months of institutional training
for both regular and special courses approximately 80 percent of teaching
time is allocated for the workshop practice (in 1979 it was about 20
percent).   In addition, at the end of academic year a three-month
industrial attachment program for the trainees has been introduced. The
summary of this program for the TTCs under the project is given in Annex
Iv.06.
4.22     Duration.   Although the replacement in 1985 of the six-month
modular courses by one year self-contained courses was a deviation from
what was proposed at the time of appraisal, the mission believes that
neither the six-month modular courses nor the one-year self-contained
courses should be sacrificed. The experience of other countries is that in
certain trades (plumbing, masonry, carpentry, etc.) the course duration is
normally less than six months, but in some of the other trades (turner/
bitter, automechanics, etc.) the course duration may be up to nine months.
In identification of course duration for a particular trade the NCSDT
should be more flexible, i.e., the major emphasis must be put on the trade
standards which are acceptable and endorsed by employers. Once these are
approved, the duration of the course should be determined.
Admission and Examination Policy. Enrollment and Qutput
4.23     Admission and Examination Polity.  Information about admission to
the TTCs is usually delivered to the public by the daily newspaper every
year. The Bangladesh Technical Education Board arranges to have standard
objective admLssion tests conducted all over the country on a stipulated
date and time. Candidates undergo admission tests in language (Bangla and
English), general mathematics, general knowledge and aptitude test followed
by short viva-voce (interview).   There are two sets of test papers
according to entry qualification of the trade, one for SSC and another for
grade 8.  The qualification for admission to civil drafting, mechanical
drafting, refrigeration/air conditioning and radio/TV trades is SSC, for
remaining trades it is successful completion of grade 8.  The admission
charges per TTC trainees is Tk 225.



- 18 -
4.24     As mentioned earlier, the Bangladesh Technical Education Board
conducts the National Skill Standard Test for Grades III and II (Part I and
Part II), and final examination according to Training Regulations of
Technical and Vocational Courses.   In each part of the course, a total
1,000 marks are possible, out of which 80 percent are for practical and 20
percent for theoretical.   However, distribution of percenta3e of marks
between theory and practice may slightly vary in respect of civil and
mechanical drafting, air conditioning and refrigeration and radio/TV.
4.25     The trainees must have 80 percent attendance in both theory and
practical classes, failing which they are not allowed to sit for the final
examination. The principal has discretion to waive attendance requirements
in very special cases such as illness, etc. Minimum qualifying pass marks
for practical and related subjects are 60 percent and 40 percent,
respectively.
4.26     Enrollment.  The mission found that although by 1985 all five new
TTCs and four existing TTCs have been put in full operation, the enrollment
in almost all TTCs under the project is well below the originally agreed
level. As it can be seen from Annex IV.07, in 1988, in the first shift
(regular courses), the utilization of the new TTCs was 58.5 percent, and
that of existing TTCs 62.0 percent only.   As far as the second shift
(special courses) is concerned, the situation is even worse. In 1988 out
of a total 1,576 places available at the new TTCs, 122 (7.7 percent only)
were occupied by trainees, and out of total 2,521 places available at the
existing TTCs 552 (21.8 percent) were occupied by trainees. At some TTCs
(Barisal, Comilla), the enrollment in regular courses is less than 50
percent of the capacity. In Chittagong TTC, only 25.8 percent places were
occupied. The Comilla TTC does not use the second shift training at all.
4.27     There are a number of reasons for this shortfall.  One of the main
reasons is proper identification of the target group of trainees to be
admitted to TTCs. It is generally recognized that any vocational training
institute cannot run at full capacity for want of trainees with proper
attitude and willingness to become productive workers. The mission found
that many TTC trainees (some 20 percent of whom have 8 or 10 years of
general education and come from mainly urban middle-income groups with
'white collar mentality") consider these TTCs an avenue for further
education rather than as preparation for becoming productive workers. At
the same time it is difficult to bring to TTCs the youth from urban low-
income groups and rural areas because most of them cannot meet the minimum
admission requirements--eight years of general education--and/or to
maintain themselves in the town for one or two years during the training.
As a matter of fact, this disadvantaged group very seldom apply for
admission to TTCs and those who do so have less aptitude in handling modern
implements, and this works against them during admission tests.
4.28     At the TTCs there are a number of trades (carpentry, masonry,
plumbing, blacksmithy, forging, etc.) for which demand exists in Bangladesh
but the training facilities are not being used because the trainees from
the middle-income groups consider them as *unpopular trades.' The solution
may lie in relaxing of the admission criteria for these trades from 8 years
of schooling, shortening the duration of course for certain trades, and
granting concessions in admission criteria to the youths or even adults
from low income groups who seek admission. The existing age limit of 20



- 19 -
years old for admission to TTCs also acts against the disadvantaged groups
of youths from the poor families who, if they go to school at all, are
comparatively older when they finish school.
4.29     Ouaput.  One of the objectives of the project was to increase the
output from the projected TTCs from 3,400 (in 1979) to 10,300 p.a. through
introduction of a six-month course and introducing several shifts at the
TTCs. Because the duration of the course was extended from six months to
one year (parapraph 4.18) the target of the output was reduced from 10,300
to 7,380 p.a.17  The mission found that, despite the fact that the last
projected TTC was not put into operation until 1985, the implementation of
even the revised target is still well below from what was expected at
appraisal. Table 3 below shows the planned and the actual output from nine
project TTCs in 1986 and 1987.

Source: Compiled by the mission.
As seen from Table 3 above, in 1986 the total output from the project TTCs
was 2,725 or 36.9 percent of the target, and in 1987 it was even less -
2,525 (34.2 percent of the target). The main reasons for this shortfall
are:   (i) a low student enrollment, especially in the second shift of
special courses (Annex IV.08); (ii) lack of qualified instructors for some
of the trades provided by TTCs; and (iii) a high rate of dropout; and a
high rate of failure on the final examination.
Teaching Staff
4.30     The Appraisal Mission estimated that about 425 trade instructors
and some 60 senior technical staff would be required for the TTCs under the
project. At present (October 1988) out of 468 sanctioned posts of instruc-
tors, senior instructors and chief instructors, only 311 (66.4 percent)
were filled.   However, as seen from Annex IV.09, the average teacher/
student ratio is around 1:10 due to low student enrollment, and at some
TTCs it is even less (Nirpur TTC - 1:9; Comilla and Chittagong TTCs - 1:6).
There are some trades (carpentry, masonry) where the number of instructors
is about the same as number of trainees. At the same time, the expansion
of other trades (radio and TV, refrigeration and air-conditioning) is
suffering from the lack of qualified instructors.

4.31    The appraisal mission suggested that the new instructors for
project TTCs would be recruited from among skilled workers and foremen in
industrial occupations, mainly from within state corporations. Technical
assistance experts would then execute skills upgrading program for each
appointed instructor.   In addition, short refresher courses would be
organized for 170 instructors who were working that time at the TTCs. It
was assumed that the retention of instructors should not be a major
problem, because of the recent 30 percent salary increase and provision of
staff housing.
4.32     The mission found that, contrary to the expectation of the
appraisal mission, most of the new instructors were not recruited from the
industrial sector, but mainly from the TTC and polytechnic graduates, and
were lacking in maturity, adequate practical training, and relevant work
experience.   With the assistance of the ILO experts and after their
departure, 185 newly recruited instructors undertook a six-month pre-
service skill upgrading course, and 185, some short refreshing and
upgrading courses (for details see Annex IV. 10).  However, a number of
instructors who undertook this training have already left their jobs
because of the more attractive conditions in the private sector and a
strong foreign demand for skilled, experienced workers.
Qua1itx
4.33     Internal Efficiency.  The internal efficiency of the project TTCs
varies from one center to another. On the whole, for the last two years,
the dropout ratio of the regular course trainees was around 28 percent (in
1986), and about 10 percent (in 1987) during the first month of training.
The situation is even worse at the special course where the dropout rate is
varying from 36 to 48 percent. The main reason for the dropout is not the
weak academic background of entering trainees, but is due to obvious disap-
pointment in the quality of training they are receiving and their future
prospects of becoming productive workers (paragraph 4.27).
4.34     The pass rate of trainees also varies from one TTC to another, and
from year of training. As seen from Annex IV.05 it is relatively better
(around 80 percent) after the second year of training as compared with that
of the first year (around 60 percent). As far as particular TTCs are con-
cerned, the pass rate of trainees is relatively better at Comilla TTC
(between 80 percent and 90 percent); Bangladesh-German and Barisal TTCs
(around 80 percent), and it is very low at Chittagong and Rajahahi TTCs
(between 30 percent and 70 percent). In the view of the mission the main
reasons for low pass rates are the low quality of instructors (paragraph
4.32) and lack of management and financial authority of the TTCs's adminis-
tration. Due to inadequate delegation of authority to the principals of
TTCs, the recruitment of instructors and purchase of instructional materi-
als are very slow, and some posts remain vacant for years and training
suffers from shortage of instructional materials. The members of the TTCs
management committees nominated from local industries, local manpower
officers, etc., are inactive because of lack of incentives.
4.35     In addition to the ordinary workshop practice and industrial
attachment program, and in order to create a sense of confidence in the
trainees and to help improve their skills, consideration should be given to



- 21 -
training which would produce products and service which can be sold. How-
ever, it would require from the TTCs management comittees more attention
to the design, cost analysis, economic utilization of raw materials,
quality control, planning and marketing.
4.36     Extenal  rdt ctivity.  In keeping with the Credit Agreement, a
monitoring and evaluation system was established at the BNET to follow and
assess the activities of trainees enrolled in TTCs, both during their
training and after graduation (paragraphs 4.07-4.08).   In addition, two
feasibility studies on assessment of tralning needs for TTCs and 'Ma,'/
and recruitment rule and pay structure of state corporations!' have been
undertaken during the project.
4.37     Based on these studies and information received from the BMET the
mission found that, whiile apparently demand for skilled and semi-skilled
workers in Bangladesh is substantial, in practice, unemployment among the
trainees qualifying from the project TTCs is also high. In addition to the
reasons mentioned before (admission policy, social status and enrollment,
etc.) the mission came to the conclusion that in many cases training in the
TTCs is not being conducted in accordance with the needs of the labor
market.
4.38     According to the first feasibility study which was based on a
survey of 557 establishments with around 330,000 employees in all districts
of the country, the employment rate of TTCS graduates10/ varies from one
trade to another, and from district to district, but in general it has been
inadequate. Taking only the districts where the project TTCs are located,
and the trades conducted by these TTCs, the situation is as follows:
4.39     Dacca District.  The employment rate in both civil and mechanical
drafting has been substantial (around 42 to 47 percent). As far as other
trades are concerned, the rate is very low (between 10 and 13 percent), and
the most depressing rate is in carpentry and masonry. It seems, that the
need for project training is not recognized in these trades.
4.40     Nymensingh District.  The participation of the TTC's graduates is
noticeable only in electrical, turner, general mechanics and welding.
Rates range from 3 and 8 percent.
4.41     Chittagong District.  The participation of TTC's graduates is in
machinist and drafting (civil only) between 10 and 16 percent.
4.42     Comilla District.   The participation rate is very poor indeed.
The TTC's graduates found employment in only two trades, i.e., only 3
graduates out of 99 employed in electrical trades and 1 out of 86 employed
in general mechanics.

* .43    Ihulna District.  The TTC graduates procured jobs in only 4 out of
the 10 trades taught by the TTCs, i.e., electrical, turner, general
mechanics and carpentry. The percentage procuring jobs is under 3 percent.
4.44     Barisal District.  The only substantial participation rate is in
automotive trade (20 graduates out of 38 employed workers).   It is
relatively fair in general mechanics (12 percent), and very poor in
electrical (1 percent).
4.45     Rajabhbi District.  TTC graduates could find employment in 6mall
number (1 out of 5) in automotive, electrical (13 out of 297), turner (8
out of 110), machinist (8 our 40), general mechanics (5 out of 211),
welding (2 out of 69), and civil drafting (1 out of 3) trades.
4.46     Bogra District.   TTC graduates could find Jobs in 3 out of 6
trades, i.e., except carpentry, masonry and plumbing. At the same time,
the most striking feature is 100 percent of participation rate of TTC
graduates in automotive (16 out of 16).
4.47     The second study on recruitment rule and pay structure of state
corporation based on 25 establishments selected for the survey, suggested
that only 26 percent of the employed workers in the thirty identified
trades are institutionally trained.  At the same time a substantial number
of the trainees qualifying from the TTCs remain unemployed.l/
4.48     As was mentioned before, one of the reasons for low external
productivity is that training in the TTCs is not being conducted in
accordance with the labor market's needs. The trades now offered by TTCs
is certainly too limited in number (13), if one particularly takes into
consideration the growing requirements of the country's development needs.
Reliable information indicates that with the aid of existing TTCs
facilities a number of other trade courses could be introduced without
major financial investment.  This is important if one remembers that the
facilities available at the TTCs have been underutilized.
4.49     Another reason for low external productivity is the existing
recruitment rules of state corporations and private enterprises. The study
undertaken on this subject suggests that trade certificates received by the
TTCs graduates are important only in limited cases, and relatively
unimportant in most of the establishments. A good number of establishments
do not have codified guidelines for recruitment, pay-scale and promotion
for those who graduated from TTCs and/or from other technical institutions.

employed workersl2/ through Introduction of In-plant training courses and

XU-Plant Training
4.50     The original objective of the project was to upgrade 7,000
production workers. The aim was that 1,500 first line supervisors would
receive short courses in industrial techniques, industrial relations,
safety and pr:duction methods, as well as technical subjects necessary to
prepare them for on-the-job upgrading of production workers.   For this
purpose the appraisal mission identified six state corporations, i.e.,
Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC),   Bangladesh Sugar and Food
Industrial Corporation (BSFIC), Bangladesh Mineral Exploration Corporation
(BMEC), Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corpore-ion (BSEC), Bangladesh
Chemical Industrial Corporation (BCIC), Bangladesh Inland Water Transport
Corporation (BWTC).   This program was also coordinated with the ILO
sponsored National Management Development program (NNDP) to train the
training managers and training officers, and to establish a training
infrastructure within the state corporations.
4.51     SunervisoXy Upgrading Courses.  With the assistance from the IID
expert and from 54 training officers graduated from the ILO sponsored NND
program, the upgrading courses for the first line supervisors have been
undertaken at four out of six state corporations, i.e., at BSFIC, BCIC,
BSEC, and BJMC.   Two corporations  (BMEC and BWTC) expressed their
unwillingness to start such training.
4.52     During project implementation two types of programs have been
conducted, i.e., (i) a four-week modular supervisory training program which
included training within industry, modules on safety, job analysies, etc.,
and (ii) a two-week production and maintenance productivity program,
followed by two-week practical assignments.   In order to manage these
programs, a number of Productivity, Maintenance and Training Units (PMTU)
has been established at corporation headquarters and at plant level in the
nationalized industrial sector. The initial objective to train the first
line supervisors at four corporations has been achieved in quantitative
terms. During the project 2,120 supervisors were upgraded, including 697
supervisors at 26 enterprises of BSFIC, 1,018 at five enterprises of BCIC,
299 at three enterprises of BSEC, and 106 supervisors at four enterprises
of BJMC (details are given in Annex IV.ll).
4.53     Product&in Workers ftgradLng Courses. As it was mentioned before,
the original objective of the project was on-the-job upgrading of 7,000
production workers by supervisors trained during the course of the project.
The mission found that this objective has not been achieved and its
implementation has not started yet. The main reason is a lack of finance
for conducting upgrading courses. According to the industrial policy,13/
the public sector corporations should spend not less than 1 percent of
their annual gross profit on research and development (including skill
development).   In fact, the profits as a percentage of sales of public
industrial corporations has consistently declined from 4.9 percent in FY83
to 1.8 percent in FY84, to minus 4.2 percent in FY85 and to minus 9.8
percent in FY86.14/ As a result during the project life no funds have been

allocated for the upgrading courses of production workers. The creation of
a special skill development fund by the donor agencies might facilitate
solving the problem.
AuvhalentZbb r  ainLug
4.54     Under this component of the project the apprentice training scheme
for recognized skilled occupations was supposed to be revised and closely
coordinated with TTC courses to ensure continuous personal and skill
development of trainees.   In quantitative terms, the objective of the
project was to train 1,500 apprentices.L5/
4.55     During the implementation of the project with assistance from IIO
experts, a number of relevant papers have been prepared including guidance
for apprenticeship training officers, a manual for apprenticeship training,
apprenticeship training standards for five trades and apprenticeship
training courses for four trades.   In addition, some amendments to the
existing Apprenticeship Ordinance and a wide range of recommendations for
the consideration of the Government have also been proposed.
4.56     The mission found that the quantitative objectives of the project
were achieved: 1,660 apprentices were trained. However, on the whole the
apprenticeship training in Bangladesh is moribund, and the number of
apprentices registered at BMET have precipitously decreased from 686 in
1985 to 49 in 1986, and to 16 in 1987 (details are given in Annex IV.12).
It seems that the value, extent and place of apprenticeship training within
the informal system of vocational training are not fully appreciated by the
NCSDT and its understaffed secretariat, and the mechanism for ensuring a
close working relations of TTCs with employers has not been fully
developed.
4.57     One of the main reasons is that the existing (since 1962)
apprenticeship .ordinance is difficult to enforce, while a new ordinance
drafted by BMET in 1984 it has still not been approved by the Government.
Among other things this draft ordinance proposes to extend apprenticeship
training from establishments employing 50 workers or more to those employ-
ing 10 workers or more. The Ministry of Finance is holding the financial
obligation of the Government, since the new ordinance proposes to pay
stipends to apprentices and employers in addition to other training costs.
The creation of a special skill development fund by donor agencies might
facilitate a solution to problem.

5.01    The project generation took about one and a half year which can be

percent, on supervision missions.

5.02     In view of the fact that it was the first project of this nature
to be implemnted by the BMET through an inexperienced PIU, the monitoring
carried out by IDA during the first phase of the implementation to assist
the PIU was reasonably efficient in developing local capacity in this
respect. The appraisal mission overestimated the Government's ability to
recruit new instructors for TTCs from among skilled workers and foremen Af
state corporations. Perhaps closer attention should have been paid at
appraisal to the appropriateness of some components which were not given
priority by the Government, such as: salaries to additional staff of the
NCSDT Secretariat and of the TTCs as well as for the in-plant training
program.
5.03     The project was supervised by 17 missions.  The intervals between
missions were 1.5 to 12.5 months, with an average of six months.  The
average stay in the field was 14 days, however, nearly all missions were
carried out concurrently with appraisal and supervision of other projects,
and accordingly in some cases only a limited supervision of the Credit was
undertaken (see Basic Data). An economist participated in eleven missions,
technical educators in ten, architects in seven, and a facilities
specialist in one.
5.04     In order to assist in the preparation of an ex-post evaluation
report on the project, it would have been helpful to have provided
guidelines to the PIU and BMET at a very early stage so that the work
toward such evaluation as well as the preparation of quarterly reports by
the PrU might have been planned and launched early. Because of the absence
of the guidelines the Government did not prepare an evaluation report on
the project, thus failing to comply with Section 3.04(c) of the Credit
Agreement.
5.05     IDA shoved flexibility in agreeing to two amendments to the Credit
Agreement and good judgement regarding the course duration at the project
TTCs.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01     The three objectives pursued by the project were as follows:  (a)
to help increasing the capability of the Government to plan, manage and
evaluate skill training; (b) to accelerate output from skill training
institutions to meet acute manpower shortages; and (c) to improve the
productivity of employed workers.
6.02     The project was successful in the implementation of physical
facilities and in meeting the quantitative target in the training of first
line supervisors and apprentices. Although the closing date of the project
has been delayed for two years, the final cost has not been an overrun in
dollar terms; indeed it is approximately 24 percent less than was estimated
at appraisal.   The project has established a monitoring and evaluation
system and a National Trade Standards and Tests system for TTCs and VTIs.

6.03    With regard to other project items, achievements are mixed.  No
doubt, the project has represented a major brekthrough In the system of
vocational tratining in Bangladesh.  At the same time, contrary to the
expectations expressed in the appralsal report, the activities of the
National Council for Skill Development and Training (NCSDT) in policy
formulation and management of vocational training are still inadequate and
NCSDT has become another obstacle in the already cumbersowe decision making
process. Although the Monitoring and Evaluation system as well as Trade
Standards Tests system have been established to put them in full operation,
additional efforts in terms of finanee, computer, equipment, staff train-
ing, widespread recognition among the public and employers, etc., are
required.
6.04     Because of the low student enrollment,  lack of qualified
instructors for some trades, and high dropout, the actual output from the
project TTCs is less than 40 percent of the target set up by the revised
project document.
6.05    The mission found that the appraisal mission had overestimated the
Government's ability to provide new instructional staff to TTCs from among
skilled workers and foremen of state industrial corporations.  In fact,
most of the new instructors were recruited from the polytechnic and TTC
graduates and lack maturity, adequate practical training, and relevant work
experience.
6.06    Although the new TTC's curricula has been modified considerably in
the direction proposed by Appraisal Mission, the replacement of the six-
month modular courses envisaged at appraisal by two one-year self-content
courses has raised afresh the trainees expectation to become "white collar*
employees rather than productive workers.
6.07    While apparently demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers in
Bangladesh is substantial, in practice unemployment among the trainees
qualifying from the project TTCs is also high. In many cases training in
the TTCs is not being conducted in accordance with the needs of the labor
market.
6.08    The target of the project for on-the-job upgrading 7,000
productive workers has not been achieved due to the lack of finance from
public sector corporations.  Although, the quantitative objective of the
project to train 1,500 apprentices has been achieved, on the whole the
apprenticeship training in Bangladesh is moribund, and the number of
apprentices registered at BMET has been decreasing sharply in recent years.
