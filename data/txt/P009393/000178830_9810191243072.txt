1. MANPOWER IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Manpower Shortages and Development
1.01      Although Bangladesh is a labor surplus country, it suffers from a
shortage of skilled manpower which constrains its economic development.
Bangladesh's record on project implementation, production performance and
productivity, though improving, remains inadequate. While natural calamities,
world-wide inflation, inadequate domestic resources and the low level of
export earnings have been the main impediments, an important contributing
factor has been the shortage of managerial and skilled manpower.
1.02      Since independence, project implementation in the industrial sector
has been hampered by the shortage of skilled manpower. For example, the
Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemical Company project and the Chittagong Dry
Dock have been slowed considerably because of the lack of technicians and
skilled workers. Completion of development projects has been similarly
delayed in the transport, communications, irrigation and construction sectors.
1.03      Skilled manpower shortages have also adversely affected  production.
Industries such as the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation, Bangladesh Steel
and Engineering Corporation and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation
have failed to achieve their annual production targets, and the production of
intermediate goods (fertilizer, cement) fell far short of planned targets.
1.04      The shortage of skilled manpower has also affected productivity.
Enterprises have been forced to hire unskilled labor, but have few programs to
upgrade unskilled employees on the job. This has had an adverse effect on
the skill profile of the work force. The Bangladesh Chemical Industries
Corporation estimates that only 20% of its 18,000 production workers are
skilled, while the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (55,000 workers) and
the Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation (25,000 workers) would
classify less than 20% of their workers as skilled. The Bangladesh Mineral
Exploration Corporation estimates that only about 10% of its workers are
skilled/semi-skilled.
1.05      The high percentage of unskilled labor in the industrial work
force inhibits efforts to improve productivity. For example, untrained
workers manning unfamiliar machinery increase the incidence of machine
breakdown and accidents. Also, as more unskilled workers are hired, the
amount of informal in-plant training by skilled workers increases and thereby
reduces productivity. Some state corporations recognize the need for in-plant
training and have recently started srmall programs.
1.06      The shortage of skilled manpower can be attributed to three major
factors: (a) the small output of sk:illed personnel from existing training
institutions; (b) the absence of in-plant and upgrading programs for workers;
and (c) the rapid depletion of the skilled manpower stock due to emigration
to the Middle East. Emigration has become a critical factor: for example,
during 1977 the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation lost 300 skilled



workers to Iran; the Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation
and the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation estimate that they have
lost about 300-400 skilled/semiskilled workers to Middle East employment.
Although Bangladesh is a newcomer among labor-exporting countries, the
departure of manpower has accelerated during the 1976-78 period. In 1977,
15,750 workers secured employment abroad, a 250% increase over the 1976
figure. By June 1978, over 30,000 workers had accepted foreign employment
(see Table 1.1). In addition, Bangladesh has agreed to provide Iran with
23,800 workers (including 15,000 skilled industrial workers and 5,000 cons-
truction workers) between 1978 and 1980 under the agreement on Technical
Cooperation. Recent events in Iran may, however, delay the implementation of
this agreement.
Development Strategy and Manpower Demand
1.07      The demand for skilled manpower is likely to increase in the future
to meet the requirements of Bangladesh's efforts towards rural development,
electric power production and distribution, and increasing industrial produc-
tion. Future demand for skilled/semiskilled workers is evident from the
subsector development strategies.
(a) Industry. In an effort to increase the output of steel,
fertilizer and cement, the Government plans to modernize the
Chittagong Steel Mill, and the Fenchuganj Fertilizer Factory and
to complete the Ashuganj Fertilizer Factory. These undertakings
will require machine tool operators, machine fitters, draftsmen,
general mechanics, welders, sheet metal workers, foundry workers
and electricians. The jute and cotton mills are to be rationalized
to make the industries viable. This will involve retraining of
workers. Future plans also include a modern plywood factory and a
furniture factory. These projects would require general mechanics,
joiners and fitters, as well as specialized personnel such as
weavers, spinners and knitters.
(b) Construction. Major construction efforts are planned for both the
public and private sector. In housing, the construction of about
4,500 housing units for government employees, 2,000 low-cost
housing units, multistoried office complexes and new subdivisional
headquarters is planned. Construction under IDA supported Educa-
tion, Population I and II, Agriculture Extension and Ashuganj
Projects will require additional skilled workers. An increased
supply of masons, plumbers, carpenters and electricians (house-
wiring) will be necessary for the Dacca-Chittagong Water Supply and
Sewerage Project which involves pipelaying and masonry works.
Similar workers will be needed for road works, bridges, etc.
(c) Transport and Communications. In the transport sector, the main
priority is given to completion of unfinished projects, the reduction
of transport bottlenecks in arterial roads, ports and water
transport, and the modernization and rehabilitation of railways and
bridges. In the communications sector, priorities include the
completion of unfinished projects, as well as the expansion of
distribution facilities. However, the highest priority is given to

improving operational efficiency and maintenance in the transport
and communications agencies. At present, sufficient auto and
diesel mechanics, welders and sheet metal workers are not available
to properly maintain the systems. In the power sector, top priority
is given to the completion of the East-West interconnector and
distribution for rural development. Electricians, welders and
construction workers would be needed for this project.
(d) Irrigation. Current plans call for the sinking of over 200,000
tubewells. A cadre of pump maintenance and repair mechanics
is needed to service the tubewells to exceed achievements under
the First Plan when only 59% of total irrigation targets (including
private schemes) were met.
(e) Small, Cottage and Rural Industry. The Government plans to under-
take a program of cottage and rural industry development which
would require additional skilled and semiskilled workers such
as mechanics, blacksmiths, tinsmiths, carpenters and joiners.
1.08      The foregoing overview indicates that the Government's development
plans and strategies in several key sectors will require a significant input
of skilled and semiskilled labor. The demand for skilled workers is difficult
to estimate, since no accurate or comprehensive assessment of Bangladesh's
manpower needs has yet been undertaken. The following attempt to provide
order-of-magnitude estimates for annual skilled and semiskilled manpower
requirements should then be seen in light of the virtual absence of comprehen-
sive employment data and a lack of reliable information on the occupational
structure at lower skill levels.
1.09      Table 1.2 shows the employment structure by sector in 1974.  The
sectoral composition of employed persons is believed to have changed little
since then: in 1978, agricultural employees comprised 81% of the labor force
while industrial sector employment grew from 5% in 1974 to around 6% in
1978./i
1.10      Table 1.2 shows a projection of Bangladesh's annual domestic
requirements of skilled and semiskilled manpower by sector. Annual expansion
rates used were: 2% for agriculture; 3% for manufacturing, construction and
utilities; and 4% and above for transport and other services./2  For replace-
ment of persons leaving the labor force, an annual figure of 3% was used for
manufacturing, construction, transport and utilities, but this does not take
into account the exodus of manpower to the Middle East and Gulf states. For
the lower levels of the occupational structure, adjusted data were used from
Pakistan.

1.11      Bangladesh's annual domestic requirement for skilled workers in
1983/84 is estimated at about 30,400 of which one half is nonagricultural.
The total annual requirement for skilled and semiskilled workers, including
the agricultural sector, is estimated at around 195,000. The annual require-
ment in the manufacturing, construction, utilities and transport sectors
is estimated at 40,000 skilled and semiskilled workers per year. This compares
with an annual output of 2,000 skilled/semiskilled workers from formal and
nonformal training programs (Table 2.1).
1.12      Foreign demand for Bangladeshi labor is mainly linked to growth in
the oil-based economies of the Middle East. The order-of-magnitude estimates
in Table 1.3 are therefore conservative, based on the assumptions that the
rapid increase in manpower exports over the last two years (about 2,000
persons per month), will not be sustained in the immediate future. It also
assumes that by the mid-1980s the demand for skilled labor will be higher
than for unskilled labor.
1.13      Several trends reinforce these two assumptions.  First, many of
the Middle East states are beginning to train and produce their own skilled
and technical manpower. Further, these states are establishing immigration
quotas for employment on large construction projects. Many Middle Eastern
countries are also using Korean, Philippine and Thai contractors, who tend to
bring skilled and unskilled labor with them. Recruiters are increasingly
turning to other countries for skilled workers. Labor contracts are now
mostly for one year instead of two years. Finally, even though Bangladeshi
demand for jobs overseas still far exceeds supply, foreign employment may
become less attractive as workers return home with reports of language diffi-
culties, harsh climatic conditions, and in some cases, poor treatment.
Second, while the rate of emigration of labor has increased in the last two
years, the proportion of skilled/semiskilled labor to unskilled labor is low,
with unskilled labor now accounting for 45% of exported manpower (Table 1.1).
This could be because (a) investments in the oil-exporting countries require
a relatively higher proportion of unskilled labor; (b) Bangladesh is unable
to supply more skilled workers; or (c) Bangladeshi skilled workers cannot
compete with workers from other countries.
1.14      By the mid-1980s, labor demand in the oil-exporting countries is
likely to shift towards skilled and highly skilled manpower as investment
programs in infrastructure (which require a relatively higher unskilled labor
component) become saturated and give way to "diversification programs" in
services and manufacturing. Of the estimated 50,000 skilled and semiskilled
workers needed by Bangladesh in 1983/84 (Table 1.3), about 10,000 would be
needed for the foreign labor market. This figure is affected by several
demand factors. The Iranian Agreement is now expected to continue into the
mid-1980s because of the program's slow start; should Iranian development
priorities change (i.e. less modern sector industrial and infrastructure
development), then the demand for Bangladeshi skilled labor would decrease
accordingly.  Also, it is assumed that by 1983/84, skilled/semiskilled
workers will constitute about 55% of total manpower exports (33% at present)
to reflect changing investment priorities in the oil-exporting countries.
Thus while total manpower exports would drop from the present 25,000 per year
to around 18,000 in the mid-1980s, there will continue to be pressure on the
skilled manpower stocks of Bangladesh because of the occupational structure
of exported labor.

about 3,000 skilled industrial workers per year and about 1,500 construc-

/c  Represents stock of workers.
1.15      Despite domestic shortages of skilled manpower, the Government has
so far not attempted to limit the export of manpower mainly because of the
practical difficulties of keeping people in the country against their will
and the benefits of this activity. The most important benefit is remittances
which constitute the second largest source of foreign exchange earnings for
Bangladesh. In 1977, remittances from Bangladeshi workers in the Middle East
and Western Europe reached US$83.4 million, and the value of goods shipped
under the Wage Earners Scheme totalled US$60.0 million. Total cash remitt-
ances for 1978 is to be around US$107 million. While the short-term benefits
of this export of manpower are obvious and relatively easy to quantify in
financial terms, the short and longer term costs to the economy of reducing
further the country's already severely limited stock of skilled and semi-
skilled manpower are more difficult to estimate. The Government and IDA are
currently undertaking a regional study of labor migration with a view to
quantifying its costs and benefits and providing a basis for specific manpower
export and development policies.
1.16      The shortage of skilled laLbor is expected to continue to impede
Bangladesh's development plans.  It will continue to make the implementation
of development projects and the achievement of production targets difficult,
while limiting productivity gains achieved by increasing other inputs to the
production process. The shortage of skilled labor will also make it difficult
for Bangladesh to capitalize fully on the benefits (remittances) of exporting
manpower to the Middle East. On the domestic side, the estimated annual
demand of about 40,000 skilled worke!rs may be reduced by the return of workers
from the Middle East. Similarly, in the foreign market, a change in the devel-
opment priorities and employment opportunities of some Middle Eastern states
may lessen the demand for Bangladeshi skilled labor. Nonetheless, Bangladesh's
overall development, and its industrial development in particular, will neces-
sitate a much greater supply of skilled manpower than the present output
capacity of its training institutionLs. Bangladesh, therefore, needs to create
the infrastructure of institutions and programs that would meet short- and
medium-term skilled manpower requirements.

2. VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN BANGLADESH
Scope and Management of Vocational Training
2.01      The responsibility for vocational training in Bangladesh rests
mainly with the Ministries of Manpower, Education and Industries. The
Ministry of Manpower conducts two-year training courses in 14 trades at five
Technical Training Centers (TTCs) for secondary school dropouts and other
unemployed workers normally with a minimum of eight years schooling.  It
is also responsible for the Apprenticeship Training Scheme. Within the
Ministry, the Directorate of Training is charged with implementing and
supervising these programs. The Ministry of Education offers two-year courses
in 10 trades at 23 Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs) and at 13 Poly-
technics only in the afternoon shift. However, each VTI only conducts 2
trade courses. A grade eight graduation education is the entrance require-
ment. The Ministry of Industries operates training programs at the
Bangladesh Industrial Technical Assistance Center, the Textile Institute, and
short courses within state corporations. Table 2.1 shows that in 1976, the
total output from the vocational training system was just over 2,000. Of
these, 600 were trained in the TTCs, 800 in Ministry of Education institu-
tions and 700 through the Mnistry of Industries' training schemes.
Financing of Vocational Training
2.02      By international comparison, Bangladesh spends only a small share
of its resources on education and training. For FY78/79, budgeted recurrent
expenditure on education and training amounts to about Tk 1,390.0 million, or
13.2% of the country's current budget expenditures and 1.1% of estimated GDP.
The latter figure is well below the relative education expenditures of other
low-income countries (see Comparative Education Indicators, Annex 1).
Development expenditures are expected to total Tk 720 million in 1978/79 and
would account for about 5.2 % of the Annual Development Program (ADP). About
95% of education expenditure is allocated to the Ministry of Education; the
Ministries of Health, Transport, Labor and Industries account for most of the
remainder. Expenditure on vocational training has always accounted for less
than 2% of educational expenditures (Table 2.2), but has been increasing at an
average of about 88% p.a. over the three-year period 1976/77-1978/79, which
indicates that the Government has recognized and accepted the i mportance of
skill training. However, the 1978/79 allocation of Tk 29.39 million remains
inadequate for the task of producing the requisite numbers of skilled/semi-
skilled workers to meet both domestic and foreign manpower demands.

Issues in Vocational Training
2.03      The main issues in vocational training are its relevance to the
needs of the economy, quality of output, inadequacy of output from existing
institutions and poor coordination.
Relevance to the Needs of the Economy
(i) No strategy to promote in-plant upgrading of workers. The main
emphasis in vocational training in Bangladesh has been placed on
pre-employment training at established training centers, with
little attention given to the value of in-plant upgrading as a
means of increasing the skills, productivity and earnings poten-
tial of workers.
(ii) Lack of Manpower Assessment and Strategy. Training plans have
been made without prior assessment of the labor market, the man-
power needs of state enterprises or the activities of other
ministries which require skilled manpower. This has resulted in
an imbalance between the supply of and demand for the numbers and
types of workers trained. An example of this was the acute shortage
of skilled welders required for the construction of the Ashunganj
Fertilizer Plant. Future training programs should therefore be
based on an assessment of employment opportunities and should
pursue a common objective.



- 11 -
Quality of Output
Low Skill Level of Trainees from Training Centers. This is mainly
because:
(i) no trade testing procedure has been established based on
training standards developed with the participation of
industrial enterprises. Moreover, there is no central institu-
tion to establish training standards or to design, produce,
and periodically update teaching material based on job analysis;
(ii)  existing teaching materials are in short supply and are not
organized in training units that can be arranged flexibly into
different training programs as needed;
(iii) expenditure per trainee year (about US$20 in the TTCs) on
consumable materials is low (a more reasonable amount would
be close to US$200). Therefore sufficient materials cannot
be purchased for trainees to acquire skills, to consolidate
them, and to reach established standards of quality, precision
and speed. Furthermore, the lack of consumable materials
restricts the time that can be allocated for workshop practice.
Although the curriculum shows a reasonable distribution of
time between theory and practice (25% and 75%), in fact
practice does not exceed 10% of the time;
(iv) although the staffing ratio of ten trainees per instructor is
low, instructors ha,ve been recruited with a polytechnic
background but without adequate industrial experience as a
skilled worker. They cannot therefore develop in trainees
skill levels that aLre acceptable to industry. It has been
difficult to attract skilled and experienced instructors to
the system, largely because of the relatively low salaries
vis-a-vis skilled worker salaries in public enterprises, and
also because of the poor work environment and career opportuni-
ties; this situation has now changed somewhat due to the
recent 30% increase in instructor's salaries.
(v) supervision of training is almost nonexistent. The Directorate
of Training of the Ministry of Manpower has only one Director
and an assistant while five supervisory posts remain vacant
because of budgetary constraints. The Directorate is weak in
planning, course development and the supervsion of TTCs, and
there is no supervision of in-plant training. The Directorate
of Technical Education of the Ministry of Education is better



- 12 -
staffed to carry out technical supervision of the VTIs because
of its involvement in engineering and technical education;
however, budgetary constraints again limit the frequency of
inspections.
Inadequacy of Output From Existing Institutions
(i) Single shift operation contributes to inadequate output from
existing training institutions. Furthermore, in 1976 only 45%
of the places available in VTIs and 64% of the places in
polytechnics were used. In TTCs facilities were overutilized
by 14% (Table 2.1). However, by introducing second and third
shifts, output in both VTIs and TTCs, could be substantially
increased.
(ii) All courses last two years, which is too long for training un-
employed adults not committed to a specific occupation: a
maximum of six months's training in basic skills and technology
is usually adequate for job entry. Moreover, as employers
consistently recruit at the lowest wage level, a graduate from
a short course with lower wage expectancy would be more employable
than a graduate with a two-year certificate who has expectations
of civil service salary levels.
Poor Coordination
There is limited coordination and no common strategy between three
ministries mainly responsible for training. This has led to a
duplication of programs.
2.04      The lack of recurrent funds is a major factor contributing to
these weaknesses in vocational training and is both a reflection of the
overall shortage of domestic resources and the relatively minor importance
the government attached to vocational training so far. The authorities have
not allocated sufficient funds to provide trainees with minimum training
materials, to maintain buildings and equipment and to recruit suitably
qualified teaching staff. Thus, the major problems of organization, planning,
relevance, quality and efficiency still plague the vocational training
system.
Strategy for Expansion and Improvement
2.05      Recognizing the need to develop a coordinated vocational training
system, the Ministry of Manpower has formulated proposals to establish
closer relationships with industry and other ministries. The first of
these, a National Advisory Committee was proposed in 1976, but was never
implemented because it was felt that an Advisory Committee would be ineffec-
tive. The second, an Interministerial Council, was convened in 1977 to
decide on the programming and budgeting of training for various ministries.
A program was approved but could not be implemented because of the lack of



- 13 -
resources. The Government has now upgraded and expanded this body to form
the nucleus of a permanent National Council for Skill Development and Training
with a Secretariat located in the Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training.
It is responsible for planning, financing, skill standards, and the execution
of training as described in para. 3.03.
2.06      Specific plans of the Government for the 1978-85 period to promote
vocational training included the following:
(a)  under the Ministry of Manpower, three existing TTCs at Mirpur,
Chittagong and Rajshahi would be improved and expanded; three other
TTCs under construction at Khulna, Rangamati and Bogra would be
completed; and four new TTCs would be built at Comilla, Mymensingh,
Faridpur and Barisal. This expansion program sought to increase the
annual output capacity of TTCs from about 1,400 to about 3,400
under the regular two-year TTC program. The Ministry also planned
to introduce an accelerated (one-year) modular training program as
a second shift at all TTCs so that by 1983, the TTCs would have an
annual output capacity of a further 6,600 trained workers, giving a
total output capacity of 10,000 trained workers per year;
(b)  the Islamic Center for Technical and Vocational Training and Research
would be established in Dacca financed by the Islamic Conference.
This would be an international center under the Ministry of
Manpower and Bangladesh's share of output is estimated at 300 per
year;
(c)  the Ministry of Manpower would establish a National Skills Development
Institute to be responsible for the nationwide extension of a skills
standard and certification system to improve the skill profile of
the labor force; and
(d)  under the Mlinistry of Education, the number of VTIs would increase
from 23 to 35 by 1981, with a total output of 1,200 per year. A
Vocational Teacher Training Institute would also be established at
Bogra.
2.07      In line with the above objectives, the Government requested financial
assistance from IDA for:
(a)  the implementation of the TTC expansion program [para. 2.06(a)];
(b)  strengthening the Bangla-German TTC as an instructor training
center;
(c)  establishment of the National Skills Development Institute
[para. 2.06(c)]; and
(d)  strengthening the Directorate of Training to improve its planning
and administrative capabilities.
The total capital cost of this proposal exceeds Tk 648.0 million (US$43.2
million).

2.08      While the overall objectives of the Government's request were
desirable, implementation appeared unrealistic in light of previous voca-
tional training financing, the availabilitv of recurrent funds and management
capacity. The Government's proposal would have increased recurrent expendi-
ture from Tk 29.0 million in 1978/79 to Tk 87.0 million in 1983/84. As a result
of discussions between the Government and the Association, the proposals were
modified and recurrent costs reduced to a more attainable level.
External Financing in Vocational Training
2.09      Since 1972, the Government has received extensive technical assis-
tance from multilateral and bilateral sources: the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) is assisting the Ministry of Education to develop
VTIs and the Vocational Teacher Training Institute at Bogra [para 2.06 (d)]:
the Federal Republic of Germany is providing capital, equipment and expert
assistance aimed at the expansion, improvement and staff upgrading at the
Bangla-German TTC; ILO/NORAD have assisted in the extension and improvement
of the Marine Diesel Center at Narayanganj; and UNDP is helping the textile
industries. A recently approved ITNDP project (July 1978) aims at (a) upgrading
the skill levels of selected managerial and supervisorv staff at the Bangladesh
Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC) and skilled workers in selected mills, (b)
establishing central training and advisory services for BTMC mills, and (c)
improving machine productivity by establishing suitable preventive maintenance
systems and repair services.
2.10      JTDP/ILO assistance has also been extensive (US$8.0 million between
1973-78). It has organized training programs for inland water transport deck
personnel, low-lift pump operators and mechanics, the improvement and develop-
ment of employment services, manpower survey, and management development and
training assistance to Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation Truck and Bus
Division. In addition, since 1973 UNDP/IL0 has been financing services
(USS2.2 million) of international experts, spares and equipment to:
(a)  assist in the organization, implementation and staff training for
the activities of the headquarters of the Bureau of Manpower,
Employment and Training (BMET): and provide support activities for
all existing and future training centers as well as broad, industry-
based training schemes;
(b)  upgrade two training centers (Mirpur, Rajshahi);
(c)  assist in the initial planning for design, construction, operation
and routine inspection of new TTCs (Bogra, Comilla, Faridpur,
Mymensingh, Khulna, Barisal and Rangamati): and
(d)  assist in making three of the new TTCs (Rangamati, Khulna and
Bogra) operational.
This project has fallen short of its objectives, mainly because the inadequate
operational budget allocated by the Government did not permit sufficient
counterpart staff to be appointed to the various sections of the BMET. A
project revision to adjust project objectives to the revised Government
training strategy is now underway.

Bank Group's Role in Education and Training
2.11      Previous Bank Group lending in the education sector includes:
(a) Credit 407-BD (1973) which aimed to improve and expand institutions pro-
viding education and training in technical and agricultural subjects. The
total cost of the project was US$36.3 million and the Credit amount, US$21.0
million; and (b) Credit 621-BD (1976) which aimed to expand and improve
agricultural and rural training.  The total cost of the project was US$16.5
million and the Credit amount, US$12.0 million.
2.12      IDA funds in the Education sector in Bangladesh have been concentrated
(72%) in agriculture and the major share has gone to the Bangladesh Agricultural
University (BAU). BAU has become the main source of trained agricultural
manpower in the country, but its teaching and research programs have tended to
be overspecialized in relation to the present state of agricultural development
in Bangladesh which requires technicians with more generalized training.
Recently a number of new programs have been introduced to improve the practical
skills of students and increase their involvement in research and extension.
Progress in the recruitment of experts (under Credit 621-BD) to assist BAU to
define its role in training, research and extension has been slow; however, a
list of candidates proposed by BAU for these appointments is now under consider-
ation by the National Committee on Rural Training (NCRT). In addition, Credit
621-BD is expanding the training capacity for middle-level agricultural
manpower through assistance to seven Agricultural Training Institutes and the
Bogra Academy, but training shortages are projected even with this higher
capacity. Credit 621-BD also established a National Committee on Rural
Training (NCRT) to assist in avoiding gaps or duplications in rural training
programs. The NCRT has functioned only marginally so far, largely because of
staff shortages and a lack of expertise. However, action has been taken to
recruit staff for the NCRT Secretariat and the appointment of Technical
Assistance experts. In technical education five new polytechnics for training
technicians have been established with IDA assistance (under Cr. 407-BD) and
equipment has been provided to eight others. All five polytechnics have
started in new facilities which became operational on a limited basis in
December 1978. Efforts are under way to revise curricula to give a practical
orientation to technical education and to improve the quality of teaching
staff. The eight IDA-assisted polytechnics are also being used on a second
shift basis for vocational training.
2.13      Almost all of the IDA funds committed for education and training
thus far have been devoted to the upper levels of the system, with little
allocated for basic or nonformal purposes. The proposed third project in
vocational training would complement earlier projects by focusing on the
training needs of the industrial sector and to a lesser extent, the agricul-
tural sector. However, in line with current manpower shortages it represents
a shift in the emphasis of Bank Group education lending from the upper levels
to the intermediate levels.
3. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The proposed project would pursue three objectives, as follows:
(a) to help increase the capability of the Government to plan, manage and
evaluate skill training, (b) to accelerate the output from skill training



- 16 -
institutions to meet acute manpower shortages, and (c) to improve the produc-
tivity of employed workers. The first objective, building management capacity,
would be sought through assistance to the National Council For Skill Development
and Training in its initital stages in the formulation of policies to promote
the planning, coordination and implementation of training across ministries as
well as promoting trade testing and certification. The second objective,
acceleration of training output from 1,400 p.a. to 10,300 p.a., would be
pursued through the expansion of training capacity and by reducing the length
of training programs from two years to six months. The third objective,
improvement of worker productivity, would be sought through the introduction
of upgrading courses for employed workers in structured enterprises.
3.02      The project would consist of:
(a) construction, furnishing and equipping of:
(i) headquarters for the Secretariat of the National Council
for Skill Development and Training (NCSDT);
(ii) five technical training centers located at Bogra, Barisal,
Comilla, Mymensingh and Khulna;
(b) additional equipment for two existing TTCs at Mirpur and Rajshahi;
(c) provision of funds on a declining basis through CY1984 to finance
(i) salaries of additional staff for the Secretariat of the NCSDT;
(ii) salaries and training materials for the five new TTCs;
(iii) salaries of additional staff and training materials for the
progressive introduction of short courses in the afternoon, evening
and morning shifts at four existing TTCs (Mirpur, Bangla-German,
Chittagong and Rajshahi);
(d) staff training of (i) 425 instructor staff for the TTCs; and
(ii) 1,500 training personnel for industry-based schemes; and
(e) technical assistance including about 41 man-year of specialist
services and 49 man-years of fellowships.
Project Components
3.03      Secretariat of the National Council for Skill Development and Training
(NCSDT). (Proposed Outlay: US$0.5 million for physical facilities, excluding
cost of land and contingencies). A National Council For Skill Development and
Training was established by a Resolution of the Cabinet and comprises Ministers
or Permanent Secretaries of the Ministries of Manpower, Education, Industries,
Finance and Planning, together with representatives of the Employers Association
and the Trade Unions. The Council is responsible for preparing draft legisla-
tion or administrative regulations/resolutions pertaining to training, formula-
tion of national training policies, approval of training plans and recommending
allocations of financial resources to implement the plans and execution of
training programs. It is also responsible for evaluating existing curricula
and performance, approving new curricula, national skill standards and tests,
and curtailing ineffective programs. Council members channel decisions to the
line ministries concerned for implementation.



- 17 -
3.04      The NCSDT would be assisted by a Secretariat located within the
the Ministry of Manpower Development and Social Welfare and headed by a
Director General. The existing training department would be incorporated
into the new Secretariat which would have its functions divided aming three
divisions.  The Directorate of Training Operations would be responsible
through its regional divisions for technical training centers, in-plant and
apprentice training and staff development. The Directorate of Planning would
carry out labor market analysis, tra.ining needs assessment, planning and
evaluation of training and the collection of statistics. The Directorate of
Standards would be responsible for curriculum development, setting skill
standard, trade testing and the production of teaching material. Charts 1
and 2 show the organizational structure of the National Council for Skill
Development and Training and its Secretariat and the relationship with other
ministries involved in training. Government approval of the Project Proforma
setting out the staffing pattern and the budgeting provision for the Secretariat
would be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed credit.
3.05      Some 276 staff including about 100 professional level staff would
be required for the establishment of the Secretariat. Professional staff
would be recruited from among existing chief instructors and engineering
technicians from industrial enterprises (Table 3.1 shows the recruitment plan
for the professional staff of the Secretariat). All professional staff would
receive training through: (a) the fellowship program financed by the project,
(b) participation in courses organized by the technical assistance experts
financed under the project, and (c) working as counterparts to the experts.
To accelerate the establishment of the Secretariat which, as a technical
institution, is fundamental to the organization of vocational training in
Bangladesh, staff salaries would be financed on a declining basis out of the
credit for five years starting January 1980. IDA financing would amount to
about 80% of the total cost of salaries and consumable materials. Office
space is necessary, for the Secretariat of the National Council to function
effectively because present facilities in the Bureau of Manpower, Employment
and Training are inadequate. The proposed project would finance the
construction of a headquarters building in Dacca to house the Secretariat of
the NCSDT.
3.06      Technical Training Centers (Proposed Outlay:  US$10.3 million
for physical facilities, excluding contingencies). The proposed project
would finance the construction, furnishing and equipping of five new TTCs
located at Bogra, Comilla, Barisal, Mymensingh and Khulna. It would also
finance equipment for two TTCs at Mirpur and Rajshahi. The TTCs would
operate on a two-shift system, with some TTCs operating an evening shift
because of increased demand from nearby industrial centers.
3.07      The location of the centers and the composition of their proposed
training programs were based on the results of a detailed training needs
assessment conducted by the Government between August-December 1978 with
assistance from the ILO. Courses would include drafting, general mechanics
welding, sheet metal, auto mechanics and diesel, housewiring, armature
winding, radio repair, sanitary and pipe fitting, building construction,
outboard engine mechanics and pump maintenance. Starting in January 1980

with the afternoon shift, courses of six months duration (720 hours) would be
introduced in the existing TTCs (Mirpur, Bangla-German, Chittagong and
Rajshahi). In January 1981 evening upgrading courses for employed workers
would commence and by January 1982 all existing two-year courses would have
been phased out and replaced by short courses. All training would be based
on occupational analysis and flexibility would be insured through the use of
short self-contained training modules. The minimum general requirements for
admission would be 14 years and the ability to read and write equivalent to
eight years of education. Placement of graduates from the TTCs would be the
responsibility of the employment service of the Ministry of Manpower Develop-
ment and Social Welfare. During negotiations the Government gave assurances
that it would replace the existing two year courses at all TTCs with training
courses of modules of employable ski:Lls not exceeding six months duration by
January 1982.
3.08      The TTCs would require about 425 new trade instructors and some
60 senior technical staff. Trade instructors would be recruited from among
skilled workers and foremen in industrial occupations, mainly from within
state corporations. They should have a minimum of six years of primary
education and five years of industrial experience in their speciality
(Table 3.2 shows an instructor recruitment and training program). The
selection procedure would include literacy, numeracy and skills tests
designed to highlight skill deficiencies. Technical assistance experts would
then execute skills upgrading program for each appointed instructor-trainee
lasting a maximum of 720 hours. Training would be carried out in one of the
TTCs (at Bangla-German, Chittagong or Mirpur) which are receiving technical
assistance for instructor training, mainly from the ILO.  In addition, short
refresher courses would be organized for the 170 instructors presently in the
vocational system. The retention of instructors should not be a major
problem, because of the recent 30% salary increase which made instructors'
salaries competitive with those of skilled workers in state corporations,
provision of staff housing, shorter working hours and the prestige attached
to a staff appointment. The proposed project would include further technical
and financial assistance to strengthen present instructor training, which
would intially be the responsibility of the technical assistance experts. By
January 1983, however, this responsibility would be taken over by the Chief
Instructors in the Mirpur, Chittagong and Bangla-German TTCs, so that a
permanent infrastructure would be created capable of providing qualified
instructors to meet future demands. The Government provided assurances
during negotiations that it would design or redesign trade tests to ensure
that qualified instructors are available for all technical training centers
and it would appoint instructors on the basis of the results of such tests,
giving preference to persons with relevant industrial experience.

of training centers. These courses would also be financed by the project.
3.10      Housing accommodation for all TTC staff members has been included
in the project in accordance with government policy and the need to provide
additional incentives to attract instructor staff./l Because of transporta-
tion problems and the need to extend the catchment area of the TTCs, boarding
accommodation has been included for all project institutions except at the
existing institutions (Mirpur, Chittagong, Bangla-German, and Rajshahi),
where the Government is already providing boarding facilities. Boarding
accommodation would take care of about 80% of the trainees in the new
project insititutions. Furthermore, to facilitate the start up of centers
and ensure the introduction of short courses, salaries and consumable training

material would be financed by the credit for five years (1980-84) at four
existing TTCs where second shift programs are introduced and for two years at
the five new TTCs (assuming completion of facilities by the end of 1982).
completion of facilities by the encl of 1982). Percentages of financing
would decline from 100% - 48% (see Table 4.4). On average, IDA financing
would amount to about 80% of total costs for salaries and consumable materials.
Government approval of the Project Proforma establishing the staffing pattern
and budgetary provision for the TTCs, including the foreign exchange needs for
consumable training mateials which are not covered by IDA funds, would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
3.11      In-Plant Training (Experts, fellowships, stipends, consumable
materials, and staff training included as part of technical assistance -
Proposed Outlay: US$2.1 million, excluding contingencies). An in-plant
training program is needed to upgrade unskilled workers and to replace
skilled workers who are leaving st.ate corporations for employment abroad.
Employment of a disproportionate number of unskilled workers by public and
private enterprises results in low productivity (paras. 1.02-1.05) and a high
wastage and accident rate. An in-plant training scheme would be developed
with technical assistance financed under the project to provide a comprehensive
range of services to state corporations: the diagnosis of training needs,
the preparation and organization of training programs and materials, budgeting,
implementing and measuring the effectiveness of training within the corporations.
Training programs would focus on improving manufacturing efficiency, quality
of product and maintenance techniques. Technical assistance (para. 3.13)
would develop a cadre of personnel in the corporations which, over time,
could create effective training programs to promote productivity as well as
meeting the internal training needs of the corporations. Group training or
individual, company-based schemes would be organized and training implemented
in the following public sector corporations:
Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation
Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation
Bangladesh Mineral Exploration Corporation
Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation
Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation
Under this component of the project the apprentice training scheme for recog-
nized skilled occupations would be revised and closely coordinated with TTC
courses to ensure continuous personal and skill development of trainees.
3.12      The ILO-sponsored National Management Development Program (para.
2.10) is now training about 150 training managers and training officers to
establish a training infrastructure within the state corporations; course
topics range from determination of training needs and the preparation of
training plans to the evaluation of training programs. This program would be
coordinated with an IDA-financed component under which about 1,500 first line
supervisors would receive short courses in instructional techniques, indus-
trial relations, safety and production methods, as well as technical subjects
necessary to prepare them for routine, on-the-job upgrading of production
workers. A technical assistance expert financed by the project would orvanize
the courses. In addition, the fellowship program would allow selected training
managers and training officers to gain experience abroad on the organization
and management of training within enterprises in the same sectors as their own.

3.13      Technical Assistance (Proposed Outlav:  UJSS3.0 million, excluding
contingencies). The technical assistance to be provided under the proposed
project would complement and extend assistance provided by UNDP/ILO and the
Federal Republic of Germany (paras. 2.09-2.10). It would comprise:
(a) 8 man-years of specialist services and 6 man-years of fellowships
for the establishment of the Secretariat of the National Council
for Skill Development and Training;
(b) 15 man-years of specialist services and 14 man-years of fellowships
for staff training and commissioning the TTCs;
(c) 8 man-years of specialist services and 28 man-years of fellowships
for the organization of in-plant training;
(d) 2 man-years of specialist services and 1 man-year of fellowships
for procurement, evaluation, analysis of training costs, etc.; and
(e) 8 man-years of local consultant services for project management
and civil works implementation.
3.14      During negotiations the Government agreed to a staffing plan that
included a timetable for appointment of counterpart staff. Assurances were
also be obtained from the Government during negotiations that (i) qualified
counterpart staff for the Secretariat of the National Council for Skill
Development and Training, the Technical Training Centers and the State
Corporations training program would be appointed prior to the arrival of
technical assistance experts; (ii) the terms of reference and criteria for
selection of all specialists would be mutually agreed between the Association
and the Borrower; and (iii) the fellowship program would be carried out in
accordance with a training program acceptable to the Association and the
Borrower. A condition of effectiveness for the proposed Credit would be the
signing of a contract with an agency or firm acceptable to the Association
for the provision of technical assistance set out in Table 3.3.
Evaluation
3.15      A system would be developed with the assistance of a consultant
for evaluating the external and internal effectiveness of the training
activities financed under the proposed project. External evaluation would
focus on the effect of training both on the enterprise and on the
trainee. Statistics would be gathered annually from reDresentative
enterprises in each industrial sector covering: (i) expenditure on training
(ii) workers wages: (a) without training and (b) with training; (iii)
annual output per worker: and (iv) capital investment. For the individual
trainee a career follow-up scheme would be devised to record his progress.
3.16      Internal evaluation would be concerned with the training costs of
different training modes and deliverv systems. It would aim at identifving
the lowest cost system. During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that it would establish and have operative by June 1, 1982, a
monitoring and evaluation system satisfactory to the Association, which would
evaluate annually the overall effectiveness and impact of the Training
programs carried out under the Project. The Government also gave assurances
that it would make available to the Association for review and comments,
annual evaluation reports of the system for the duration of the project.

4.03      Base cost estimates refer to September 1978 prices.  The planning
of facilities has been based on, functional and economic considerations, but
has taken into account specific technical limitations, and climatic and social
factors that affect planning and design. Unit costs are derived from recent
building contracts for similar facilities in Bangladesh. Although local
materials and building techniques would be used to the maximum extent possible,
some basic building materials such as mild steel and cement might have to be
imported, and procured separately.  The average unit cost is estimated at
about US$11 per sq ft excluding site development and contingencies, compared
with US$12 sq ft in Nepal, US$9 in India and US$17 in Indonesia for similar
facilities. Comparisons of capital costs per place are not applicable to the
project as a whole, since the proposed project would include extensions to
existing facilities and part of the equipment would be financed by UNDP/IL0.
However, capital costs per place for a new TTC would average about US$5,000
(excluding contingencies) which is reasonable.
4.04      Utilization factors would average 83% of available time for workshops.
Usage would be economical because of the double shift operation (five hours
each). Courses would be based on 24-week sessions (6-day week). There would
be two sessions per year. The cost of equipment was determined from preliminary
lists related to the teaching program. About 12% of the total project costs
(excluding contingencies) would be allocated for staff housing, which is con-
sidered a necessary incentive in promoting recruitment of qualified teaching
staff (para. 3.12). About 11% of total project costs (excluding contingencies)
would be allocated for hostel facilities, which would accommodate about 80%
of the trainees at the five new project TTCs. Hostels are traditionally
provided at such institutions in Bangladesh and would be necessary at the
project TTCs because of poor transport infrastructure. They should also
encourage enrollment of students from rural areas.
4.05      Physical contingencies (Annex 3) of 10% has been added to the
base line cost of all categories of expenditures to cover unforeseen factors
and to allow flexibility in design. A total price contingency of US$6.6 mil-
lion has been included to cover expected price escalation at the following
annual percentage rates:

Based on detailed analysis of expenditures in similar projects in Bangladesh,
the foreign exchange component has been estimated as follows:  (a) site
development, 20%; (b) buildings 30%; (c) furniture, 35%; (d) equipment, 93%;
(e) professional services, 20%; (f) fellowships, 99%; (g) expert services,
80%; (h) staff training, 25%; and (j) consumable materials, 93%. These
percentages have been derived by (a) determining the costs of civil works
attributable to materials, labor overhead and profit, (b) analyzing the
c.i.f. Chittagong costs of imported building materials equipment and furniture,
inland transportation and insurances, and delivery and installation of equip-
ment and furniture. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$17.2
million, or about 55% of the total project cost net of customs duties and
taxes. Customs duties and taxes inmposed on imported building materials
would be borne by the borrower.
4.06      Customs Duties and Taxes.  All building materials specifically
imported for the proposed project would be subject to customs duties and
taxes. The duties and taxes imposed on c.i.f. values would be as follows:
(a) cement, 25%; (b) steel, 75%; (c) construction equipment, 100%, (d) wood
200%; and (e) electrical fittings, hardware fixtures, 225%. The total
amount of local taxes is estimated at about US$1.65 million. Instructional
equipment and consumable training materials are normally exempt from taxes.
During negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would take
such steps as may be necessary, including the provision of adequate funds
to ensure efficient customs clearance of building materials imported for use
under the project.
Project Financing
4.07      The proposed IDA credit of US$25.0 million equivalent would finance
79% of the total project cost net of taxes and duties. The remaining 21%

would be met by the Government. Project financing would cover on a declining
basis, an average of 80% of the recurrent expenditures for additional consum-
able materials and staff salaries through 1984 for the Secretariat of the
NCSDT, and the TTCs.
Recurrent Cost Implications
4.08      By 1983/84, projected annual recurrent costs would amount to about
Tk 52.0 million (US$3.5 million) for vocational training conducted under the
Ministries of Manpower and Industries: Tk 48.0 million (US$3.2 million) for
the Ministry of Manpower and Tk 3.0 million (US$0.3 million) for the Ministry
of Industries. Annual recurrent costs (salaries and consumable training
materials only) of about Tk 34.55 million (US$2.3 million) would be generated
by the nine project TTCs (5 new and 4 existing), the Secretariat of the NCSDT
and the regional divisions of the reorganized Directorate of Training Operations.
Other recurrent costs would be incurred by institutions not financed under
the project (Ministry of Manpower's TTCs, Rangamati, and Faridpur and
Minstry of Industries' Marine Diesel Training Center and the Bangladesh
Industrial Technical Assistance Center plus the maintenance and supply costs
for the entire system.
4.09      The threefold increase in annual recurrent costs for these two
ministries, from Tk 16.04 million in 1978/79 (Table 2.2) to Tk 52.0 million
in 1983/84, is significant and raises the question whether Bangladesh can
afford to expand relatively expensive vocational training. In 1978/79,
recurrent costs of vocational training in the Ministries of Manpower and
Industries represented about 1% of total educational and training expenditures.
In 1983/84, Tk 52.0 million would represent about 3% of total education and
training expenditures if such expenditures remained at the 1978/79 level, or
a little more than 1% if total education and training expenditures increase
at 5% p.a. to 1983/84. These levels are feasible, given the new priority
attached to vocational training by the Government.
4.10      The threefold increase in annual recurrent cost under the project
would be less than that implied by the Government's more expensive plan
(paras. 2.06-2.08). The proposed project would represent a significant
reduction in the government plan (25% reduction in capital costs from
Tk 648.0 million to about Tk 486.0 million and a 40% reduction in projected
annual recurrent costs from Tk 87.0 mLllion to Tk 52.0 million) but would
increase potential benefits. The proposed project would give greater emphasis
than the government plan to in-plant training, planning, coordination,
national skill standards and increasing the efficiency and output of TTCs.
Under the Government's original plan, by 1982 output from TTCs would have
been about 10,000 with a cost per trainee hour of Tk 5.8. Under the proposed
project, by 1982 the additional output from TTCs alone (excluding the output
from in-plant programs) would be about 7,500 students with a cost per trainee
hour of Tk 5.6. The cost per trainee hour is now about Tk 1.1: the increase
would be due to an increase in the per student allocation of training materials
(Tk 0.2 to Tk 3.1), instructor salary increases of 30%, and allowances for
depreciation and maintenance. Table 4.5 shows that over 60% of costs are
estimated to be in materials and supplies, indicating that salaries would
remain relatively low, while the supply of consumable training materials
would increase substantially. The cost per trainee hour TK 5.6 (US$0.37)
would still be low compared to other countries (e.g. Korea, US$0.50).

Project Implementation
4.11      Administration.  The project would be implemented by the Secretariat
of the NCSDT with the Director General of the Secretariat directing all
aspects of project execution. To assist and advise the Director General
(Project Director) in carrying out the various functions of project implemen-
tation a unit would be established Ln the Directorate of Training Operations
with the following staff on a full-time basis: a project manager (on contract
basis), a coordinator/vocational training officer; a project architect (on
contract basis); a procurement officer; a project accountant and adequate
supporting staff.  Directors of the TTCs would be responsible to the Project
Director for management of operations at the regional level and would assist
in the supervision of civil works. Advice on technical matters would be
provided by technical assistance experts financed under the project, supple-
menting UNDP technical assistance whenever necessary. Approval of a Project
Proforma by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC)
showing provisions for adequate supporting staff and facilities for the
Project Unit would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
4.12      Duties and Responsibilities of the PIU.  The project unit staff
would work as a team and in accordance with their respective terms of
reference. The PIU would prepare Project Proformae for all components
requiring approval by the Planning 'Commission and ECNEC. The duties and
responsibilities of the PIU will cover all phyiscal execution and educational
development aspects of the project. Collectively, the PIIJ would inter alia:
(a) coordinate and integrate project activities with the relevant authorities;
(b) select, brief and enter into agreement with consultants and specialists;
(c) prepare Quarterly Progress Reports; (d) assist and supervise in the
preparation of architectural designs, masterlists of equipment and furniture
and bidding documents and submit them to the Association for review; (e)
review reports, plans, specifications and other material related to the
project; (f) call and e-valuate bids and award contracts for civil works,
equipment, furniture and training materials with assistance from relevant
consultants; (g) supervise construction of buildings and delivery and
installation of equipment and furniture; (h) organize and administer technical
assistance and fellowship programs; (i) plan, program and monitor project
progress and prepare implementation schedules; (j) maintain project accounts;
and (k) make payments against project expenditures, operate the revolving
fund and prepare withdrawal applications.
4.13      Since this would be the first IDA project handled by the Ministry
of Manpower, it would initially require intensive supervision from Bank staff
and the resident mission. Arrangements would also be made during the initial
implementation period to provide training to project unit staff, particularly
on documentation and procurement, and planning and scheduling of critical
activities.
4.14      Professional Services.  Designs for most TTCs included in the
project were prepared about 10-12 years ago by the Public Works Department
(PWD), which was assigned the design and supervision of civil works. Only
part of this project was executed. The existing PWD designs are no longer



- 32 -
appropriate for the project and would require major changes to meet project
needs. Because the PWD's experience in planning and designing facilities of
this type is limited, it is recommended that the services of an experienced
architectural firm be retained. Bangladesh has sufficient qualified architec-
tural consulting firms capable of offering services on an effective and
economic basis. As a condition of effectiveness of the credit, the Government
has been asked to enter into an agreement with a consulting architectural firm
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment are
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Association which would provide design
and supervision services for the entire project.
4.15      IDA Review and Approval.  During negotiations the Government provided
assurances that it would send preliminary designs and cost estimates of the
buildings for the Secretariat of the NCSDT, and each TTC, master lists of
furniture and equipment and a schedule of consumable materials to the
Association for review and would take into account the comments of the
Association before proceeding with construction on any building. Review of
bid evaluation documents would be required prior to the award of civil works
contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent and for any equipment, furniture,
building material and consumable training material contracts exceeding
US$50,000 equivalent.
4.16      Construction.  Construction of the civil works component would
be undertaken by private contractors. Only prequalified contractors would
be allowed to bid for civil works contracts under this project. Construc-
tion would be phased as follows: Phase I, advance procurement of building
materials - Phase II, Building, Phase III, Site Development and External
Works.
4.17      Sites.  Except for the site of the Secretariat of the NCSDT in
Dacca, the other five sites have been acquired and surveyed. During nego-
tiations the Government provided assurances that it would acquire a suitable
site for the Secretariat of the NCSDT by December 31, 1979.
4.18      Procurement.  Because of their relatively small size (mostly below
US$500,000), contracts for civil works and furniture would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally following procedures satisfac-
tory to the Association. Building materials, such as bricks and sand, would
also be procured through local competitive bidding.  Foreign contractors would         
be allowed to participate in local bidding if they express an interest to do so.
4.19      Contracts for equipment, building materials (excepting bricks and-
sand) and consumable training materials exceeding US$50,000 equivalent would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines. Local manufacturers would receive a margin
of preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the c.i.f. price of competing
imports or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower. Contracts that
cannot be grouped into packages for bulk procurement of at least US$50,000,
not exceeding in the aggregate US$1.5 million (equivalent to about 15% of the
estimated total cost of equipment, building materials and consumable training
materials), would be procured in accordance with local competitive bidding



- 33 -
iteras, not exceeding US$15,000 equivalent for each contract and aggregating a
maximum of US$0.5 mlllion (equivalent to about 5% of the estimated total cost
of equipment, building materials and consumable training materials) could be
purchased on the basis of a minimum of three price quotations. Prior approval
of the Association would be required for the award of any civil works contract
exceeding US$200,000 equivalent and for any equipment, furniture, building,
materials and consumable training materials, contracts exceeding US$50,000.
4.20       Revolving Fund.  As a condition of credit effectiveness, the
Government would establish and maintain a revolving fund of Tk 750,000 in a
commercial bank to be used exclusive:Ly to make prompt payments in Takas for
expenses of Liemrs on the project excluding (a) salaries of additional staff;
(b) travel expenses and per diem for local staff; and (c) import duties and
taxes for all imported items. The revolving fund would be replenished at
least once per month to maintain a minimum deposit of Tk 750,000. The project
director would be authorized to make withdrawals from the revolving fund to
make such payments.
4.21       Operation and Maintenance.  For proper operation of the facilities
and equipment, and uninterrupted training at the TTCs, provisions have been
made in the Project Proformae to ensure engagement of properly trained personnel
and maintenance staff at each institution, and inclusion of adequate mainte-
riance budget. Funds have been included in the project for (a) spare parts for
instructional equipment, and (b) initial supplies of consumable training
materials.
4.22       Project Acc,)mit s.  Project expenditures would be recorded in accord-
ance with sound accounting practices. Accounts and financial statements for
each fiscal year would be audited by competent auditors acceptable to the
Association.  Certified copies of the accounts and financial statements for
each fiscal year together with the audit shall be furnished to the Association
as soon as available - but not later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year.
4.23       Implementation Period.  The proposed project would be implemented
over about five years, but completion of the physical facilities (including
procurement and installation of equipment and furniture) should be achieved
in about three years from credit eff'ectiveness (by about December 31, 1982).
To assist in effective and tiraely project execution, a detailed implementation
schedule has been prepared in consul]tation with the Manpower Bureau. This
schedule would also serve as a monitoring tool during implementation and
would be updated quarterly by the project unit staff.
Disbursements
4.24       The proposed credit of US$25 million would finarnce 79% of the
total project costs, excluding custoDms duties and taxes. The proceeds of the
proposed IDA credit would finance:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported building materials,
equipment and furniture;



- 34 -
(b) 100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured building
materials, equipment and furniture;
(c) 100% of the expenditures on expert services, staff training and
overseas fellowships;
(d) 60% of the cost of imported building materials, equipment and
furniture procured locally;
(e) 60% of local expenditures on civil works including building
materials procured locally, related professional fees for civil
works;
(f) 80% (average) of expenditures on consumable training materials
on a declining basis as follows:
100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported materials
100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured materials,
procured through ICB
90% of expenditures on locally previewed materials for operations
during 1980-82
80% of expenditures incurred for operations during 1983
52% of expenditures incurred for operations during 1984; and
(g) 80% (average) of expenditures on staff salaries on a declining basis
as follows:
100% of expenditures incurred for operations during CY 1980-82
80% of expenditures inccured for operations during CY 1983
48% of expenditures incurred for operations during CY 1984
Withdrawal applications would be supported by full documentation, except for
expenditures on salaries which would be reimbursed against statements of
expenditures signed by the project director. Documentation for these
statements would be retained by the project unit and be available for
review by IDA during project supervision missions. To the extent practicable,
withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$50,000 or more
prior to submission to the Association for reimbursement out of the proceeds
of the proposed credit. Undisbursed funds could be used with the approval of
the Association for other project-related components. The percentage of (d),
(e) and (f) above would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursement over
the estimated project implementation period. The estimated disbursement
schedule is shown in Table 4.6 below. Disbursement is expected to be
completed by March 31, 1985.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
5.01      The proposed project would form an integral part of the Govern-
ment's strategy to expand vocational training and produce the skilled manpower
needed for industrial development and for the replacement of skilled workers
emigrating to the Middle East. The project TTCs would help to accelerate
the output of skilled and semiskilled workers, which would benefit the
Government in the implementation of its modern sector development projects.
This would in turn increase the low production of the industrial and manufac-
turing sectors by achieving a higher ratio of skilled workers to unskilled
workers, thereby reducing the need for extensive on-the-job training. The
industrial sector would also benefit from the programs for in-plant training
and upgrading of unskilled workers. In addition, an increase in skilled
workers would enable the country to capitalize (through foreign exchange
remittances) on Middle East employment opportunities without disrupting domes-
tic production, project implementation and productivity.
5.02      The proposed project represents a less expensive scheme than
the Government's original investment program for vocational training (para.
2.06). By 1980, with the introduction of shorter courses in the double
shifts, the output of existing TTCs would increase by an additional 2,500
workers. In 1983 when project-financed facilities would be fully operational
the total direct annual output from the Ministry of Manpower's expanded system
of technical training centers would be about 10,350 skilled and semiskilled
workers (see Table 5.1) in 18 different occupations in the construction,
electrical and mechanical fields, compared with a present output of about
2,000. About 7,800 would be new entrants to the labor force and 2,000 would
be workers already employed and apprentices upgraded through evening courses.
The indirect output from in-plant training would be about 8,500, comprising
some 1,500 apprentices and 7,000 production workers. By 1983, project training
would account for 85% of total output from the national vocational training
system and would meet about 40% of the total estimated skilled and semiskilled
manpower requirements of the nonagricultural sectors. The balance would be
provided mainly through Ministry of Education Vocational Training Institutes
(about 1,800 p.a.) and informal learning on-the-job.
5.03      A major benefit of the project would be the better quality of
training given graduates entering the job market. The project would
establish training standards developed with the participation of industrial
enterprises hence making training more relevant. The quality of training
would be further enhanced by funds provided under the project for consumable
training materials to foster practical rather than theoretical instruction;
and incremental staff salaries to ensure that sufficient instructors of the
requisite quality are trained and employed. The project would institute
a shorter, six-month modular-type course, a system which is both cost
effective and practical in Bangladesh. The proposed coordination of institu-
tional training (TTC) with in-plant schemes would reinforce this practical
orientation.

5.04      The project would also have significant institutional benefits.
The creation of a National Council for Skill Development and Training with
its Secretariat would help to ensure national coordination, avoid duplication
of programs, thereby enabling a more efficient use of resources. It would
also assist Bangladesh's planning capability, foster standardization of
qualifications throughout the system and promote the evaluation of vocational
training. The project would benefit vocational education in general by
strengthening training institutions, mainly by assisting the Directorate of
Training Operations to strengthen its headquarters and regional staffs in the
supervision and administration of TTCs.
Risks
5.05      Although an implementation schedule has been discussed and accepted
by the Borrower, experience has shown that implementation usually takes
longer than planned when ministries and agencies are involved in their first
Bank project. Therefore, procedures such as intensive supervision, training
of project staff, and revolving fund, have been suggested to assist the Bureau of
Manpower, Employment and Training in implementing the project, since major
delays might reduce some project benefits substantially, e.g. failure to meet
short-term manpower needs or to increase remittances from foreign workers.
5.06      Some concern centers on the creation of the Secretariat of the
National Council for Skill Development and Training particularly as it
relates to its proposed size and feasibility.  However efforts have been made
to clearly define the organizational roles of the three Directorates which
make up the Secretariat. Further, the provision of a sizeable amount of
Technical Assistance would assist in overcoming most of the initial problems
of operating the Secretariat. Efforts have also been made to recruit the
staff for the Secretariat over a 3 year period (Table 3.1) so as to alleviate
the problem of unsettling the existing bureaucratic set up of the BMET.
Finally by providing salary support for staff of the Secretariat for 5 years,
there is a reasonable assurance that the institution would be adequately
staffed in its formative stages and would be able to perform its planning
coordination and evaluation functions.
5.07      Problems are also possible in the recruitment and retention of
qualified instructors, and staff of the Secretariat of the NCSDT. For
instructors, recent salary increases of over 30% plus the provision of housing
for instructors at all TTCs should attract suitably qualified personnel from
industry, but alternative employment opportunities still exist in the "fiddle
East. The appointment of suitably qualified staff would therefore be closely
supervised and remedial action (e.g. increasing the output from instructor
training programs) recommended should shortages develop.
5.08      In an effort to improve the quality of training, the project would
finance expenditure for consumable training materials for five years. The
Government would be required to include in the Project Proformae that budgetary
provisions, including foreign exchange, would be made to cover its share of
these costs during the project life. The risk remains that the Government



- 39 -
might not provide sufficient foreign exchange funds for training materials
after the project is completed, particularly if the shortage of resources
remains critical.  However, despite these risks, it is believed that the
benefits realized through increased domestic industrial production and
workers' remittances from abroad would be sufficient to motivate the Govern-
ment to allocate adequate funds to thie project facilities to enable them to
operate effectively.
6.  AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      During negotiations, the Association and the Government agreed on:
(a)  the organizational structure for the Secretariat of the NCSDT
(para. 3.04);
(b)  a plan for specialist services and fellowships including a timetable
for the appointment of counterpart staff (para. 3.14); and
(c)  procedures for an annual audit of project expenditures (para. 4.22).
6.02      During negotiations the government provided assurances on: (a)  the
replacement of two-year courses at ELll TTCs (para. 3.07); (b) the appointment
of vocational instructors (para. 3.08); (c) the appointment of counterpart
staff (para. 3.14); (d) the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation
system (para. 3.16); (e) customs clearance of imported building material
(para. 4.06); (f) IDA review and approval of preliminary designs (para. 4.15);
and (g) the acquisition of a site for the Secretariat of the NCSDT (para. 4.17).
6.03      In addition to the usual conditions the following are conditions of
effectiveness:
(a)  Government approval of the Project Proforma for all project
components (para. 3.04, 3.10, and 4.11);
(b)  the signing of a contract with an agency or firm acceptable to the
Association for the provision of technical assistance (para.
3.14);
(c)  the appointment of a consulting architectural firm whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the
Association (para. 4.14); and
(d)  the establishment of a revolving Taka fund (para. 4.20).
6.04      With the above assurances and conditions, the project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$25.0 million to the People's Republic
of Bangladesh for a term of 50 years including a 10 year grace period.
