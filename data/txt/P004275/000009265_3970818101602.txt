SECOND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                   Malaysia
Amount:                     US$73.3 million equivalent
Terms:                      Repayable in 15 years, including three years of
grace, at the standard variable rate.
Project Description:        The project which would assist the Government to
complete the long-term investment program in
technician and skilled worker training started
under the first Industrial Training Project (Loan
2145-MA), is designed to (a) increase the supply of
technicians and skilled workers; (b) further
improve the quality of training and strengthen
management of training; and (c) improve manpower
development planning. It would provide for:
(i) construction and equipping of three poly-
technics, at Kota Bharu, Kuching and Port Dickson,
with a total enrollment of 4,500 and a planned
annual output of about 2,200 technicians; intro-
duction of new training courses to meet industrial
needs, training for polytechnic staff, and
strengthening of management; (ii) construction and
equipping of two industrial training institutes, at
Alor Setar and Kota Bharu, with a total training
capacity of about 1,000 places and a planned annual
output of about 1,300 skilled workers; introduction
of new training programs to meet industrial needs,
training for industrial training institute staff,
and strengthening of management; and (iii) improve-
ment in the manpower development planning capacity
of selected governmental agencies.
The project, from 1990 onwards, would increase the
annual supply of technicians and skilled workers by
about 2,200 and 1,300 respectively; upgrade train-
ing and introduce new programs; strengthen manage-
ment of training; improve the regional distribution
of training opportunities and increase effective-
ness of manpower planning and labor market infor-
mation as an input to national planning. There is
a risk of delay due to limited capacity of the
Ministry of Labor to implement its project compo-
nent; however, under the project the Ministry's
staff would be strengthened and technical
assistance would be provided to minimize that risk.

SECOND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING PROJECT
I. The Industrial Manpower and Training Sector
Introduction and Overview
1.01      To meet the demand for skilled workers and technicians in Malaysia,
the Government, in 1982, initiated a major program of expansion and upgrading
of training with assist V ce from the Bank under the first Industrial Training
Project (Loan 2145-MA).-   The project would complete that development
program. The overall objective over the period 1983-90 is to expand
polytechnic facilities for the training of technicians, from two polytechnics
to seven, and to expand the industrial training institutes (ITIs) for skilled
worker training, from five ITIs to ten.
The Demand for and Supply of Industrial Manpower
1.02      Estimates of demand for industrial manpower are based on the
projections for industrial dtyelopment and employment in the Mid-Term Review
of the Fourth Malaysia Plan1    The original plan envisaged annual growth in
industrial output of 10% and employment of 3.2% over the period 1981-85
(compared with an actual growth in employment of 3.92 p.a. over the period
1970-80). The manufacturing sector was expected to grow by 11.0% p.a. and to
create 267,000 new jobs, with employment growing at 5.9% p.a. The global
economic recession over the period 1981-83, which also had its concomitant
impact on the Malaysian economy, contributed to the slow down in the growth of
both output and employment during the early part of the Plan period. Overall,
employment grew by 2.9% p.a. over the three years 1981 to 1983 compared with
the 1981-85 target of 3.2%; but there were marked differences in the
performance between sectors.  In manufacturing, employment grew by only 2.2%
and resulted in about 50,000 new jobs. Employment in construction grew by
8.9% p.a. - more than double the expected rate - and created nearly 80,000
jobs. Within the tertiary sector, the government services sector was the
largest generator of jobs with employment growing at 6.5% resulting in 144,000
jobs; but most of the expansion took place in 1981 under a deliberate exercise
to fill vacant posts, and by 1983 the effect of the partial freeze in new
posts was to slow the annual rate of increase to 3.4% (Appendix 2, Table 1).
1.03      The Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Malaysia Plan recognizes that the
original targets for output and employment will not be met. In revised
projections the growth in manufacturing is, however, expected to pick up, with
1/  Malaysia:  Staff Appraisal Report - Industrial Training Project (Report
No. 3740a-MA), April 1982.
2/   Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Malaysia Plan 1981-85, March 1984.



employment growing by 4.6Z p.a. over the two years 1984-85. Construction,
transport and government services are expected to grow more slowly than in
1981-83 - but still to show growth over 1981-85 greater than that originally
envisaged under the Plan. The total growth in employment for all sectors is
expected to be about 760,000, equivalent to an annual growth of 3.OZ.
1.04      Projections of employment for 1985-90 are currentLy being prepared
by the Government for incorporation in the Fifth Malaysia Plan. Assuming that
the rates of growth by subsector for 1986-90 are the same as the revised
estimates for 1981-85, employment is projected to increase by about 1.7
million over the decade, compared with the estimate of 1.9 million made in
1982 (Appendix 2, Table 2).
1.05      There is a lack of reliable survey data on the distribution and
qualifications of technicians and skilled workers in industry on which to base
estimates of future needs.  The same approach has therefore been adopted as in
the preparation of estimates in 1982, i.e., to take cross country comparisons
of occupational structure by industrial sector. Using actual growth in
employment for 1981-83 and estimated growth in 1984-90 and maintaining the
same coefficients for occupational structure with an average annual attrition
rate of 2Z, the annual incremental needs for technicians and skilled workers
over the decade to 1990 are estimated to be of the order of 5,500 and 35,000,
respectively (Appendix 2, Table 3). The estimated annual need for technicians
is thus slightly lower than the 6,000 estimated in 1982 but that for skilled
workers remains unchanged.
1.06      The Supply of Industrial Manpower.  The sources of industrial skill
and technician training are (a) polytechnics, which provide technician
training; (b) ITIs and other skill training institutes and centers, which
prepare school leavers for industrial employment and upgrade the skills of
employed workers; (c) vocational secondary schools, which provide introductory
skills training and produce semi-skilled new job seekers; and (d) in-plant
training in industry. The polytechnics and vocational secondary schools are
the responsibility of the Technical and Vocational Education Division (TAVED)
of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the ITIs are under the Training Service
Division of the Manpower Department of the Ministry of Labor (MOL).
1.07      Technician training is mainly provided in two polytechnics, Ungku
Omar (Ipoh) Polytechnic established in 1969 and Kuantan Polytechnic, which
opened in temporary accommodation in 1977 and occupied its new building in
late 1983. Two new polytechnics, which are being constructed under the first
Industrial Training Project at Batu Pahat and Alor Setar, have opened with
small enrollments in temporary accommodation. The total polytechnic
enrollment in 1984 was about 4,400 mainly in certificate courses of 2-1/4 year
duration arranged on a sandwich pattern including 5 months of industrial
placement. About 60% of entrants are sponsored by employers, and about 80% of
sponsored students are sponsored by government departments. There were over
25,000 qualified applicants in 1984 for the 2,000 places. The annual output
of the polytechnics in 1983/84 was about 1,300. In addition, about 300
technicians graduated from the Tunku Abdul Rahman College and about 700 were
estimated to have graduated from private institutions. The full development
of the existing institutions including the establishment of the two new



-3-
polytechnics at Batu Pahat and Alor Setar will provide an annual output by
1990 of about 3,500 tec.hnicans (Appendix 2, Table 4). Thus, based on the
revised projections indicated in para. 1.05, there would be an annual
shortfall of about 2,000 technicians in 1990.
1.08      The annual output of new skilled and semi-skilled workers from
public training institutions in 1983184 was estimated to be about 12,000. Of
these, about 7,000 were semi-skilled secondary vocational school graduates.
Only 1,500 completed training at the ITIs: the others were trained in centers
operated by Majlis Amanah Rakayat (MARA) or by the Ministry of Youth, Culture
and Sports (MYCS). Only about 100 existing workers were reported to have
completed skills upgrading.  The annual output from existing sources,
including the three new ITIs at Ipoh, Kuantan and Malacca which are being
built under the first Industrial Training Project, is expected to increase to
about 17,000 by 1990 (Appendix 2, Table 4). Thus, based on the revised
projections indicated in para. 1.05, there would be an annual shortfall of
about 18,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers in 1990.
1.09      The Government has completed the initial phase of a study of
manufacturing industry, financed under the first project, to examine training
needs, cost-sharing and incentives and gther mechanisms for improving the
participation of industry in training.3   The findings indicate that the
present training in industry is generally unstructured and inadequate to
provide the levels of practical knowledge and skills required to facilitate
high product quality, improve productivity and ensure efficient use of plant
and equipment. The study also confirms the need for the expansion and
development of higher levels of pre-employment training and skills upgrading
for existing workers. As a next phase of the study of manufacturing industry,
further feasibility and other studies have been planned, also to be funded
under the first project, covering (a) legislation to require employers to
provide and finance training, (b) establishment of Training Councils- under a
National Board to coordinate the planming, funding an! moniL .ing of trainina-,
and (c) introduction of pilot schemes for training supervisors and advanced
skills training and upgrading courses for electrical fitters and mechanics.
Expenditure on Industrial Training
1.10      While, in terms of its total allocation of budgetary resources for
education, Malaysia compares favorably with most countries in the Region, the
share of its public recurrent expenditure on technical and vocational
education and training has been low. It was estimated in 1984 to be only 2Z
of total spending on education and training, compared with 1980 allocations of
7% and 6Z in Korea and Thailand, respectively. Only a small proportion of the
cost of technician training is recovered by the polytechnic fees of M$400 p.a.
which have not increased for about 10 years. No fee is charged by the ITIs.
The Government will consider an increase in polytechnic fees and the
3/   Findings of W.D. Scott Ltd., on the study of Industrial Training Schemes
reported at a meeting at MOL on October 24, 1984 and to be incorporated
into the consultant's report.

introduction of fees for ITI training as part of the studies referred to in
the previous paragraph.
1.11      Returns on Investment in Training.  The social rates of return to
investment in polytechnics and ITIs were estimated at appraisal of the first
project in 1982 to be of the order of 16% and 12% respectively, confirming the
shortage of qualified technical manpower. Since costs, salaries and
employment prospects have not changed significantly since 1982, it is assumed
that these favorable rates of return have been maintained.
Shortcomings of the Present Industrial Manpower Training System
1.12      The main shortcomings of Malaysia's industrial training system
are: (a) its inability to meet the demand for skilled and technician level
manpower, particularly in the specializations required by growth industries;
(b) less than optimum distribution of training facilities which does not fully
reflect regional distribution and characteristics of industry; (c) weaknesses
in the management systems for training; and (d) inadequate coordination in
manpower development planning.
1.13      Deficiencies in the Supply of Industrial Manpower.  The present
training facilities, together with those being constructed under the first
,roject will not supply sufficient skilled manpower to meet the estimated
needs. The annual shortfall in technicians and skilled workers is estimated
as about 2,000 and 18,000 respectively by 1990, but to average about 3,000 and
22,000 per year, respectiveLy, over the period 1980-90. These estimates
exclude the need for upgrading the skills and technical knowledge of existing
workers which is likely to be as great a task as that of providing newly
trained manpower. Recent inquiries in industry, as part of the technical
assistance program under the first project, are reported to provide further
evidence of shortage of appropriately trained manpower. Deficiencies in level
of output are compounded by the lack of training in technologies and skills
needed for the planned development of new process and manufacturing
industries, particularly in the chemical, ceramics, plastics, electrical,
electronics and fabricated metal products subsectors.
1.14      Regional Distribution of Training Facilities.  Training facilities
are not satisfactorily distributed across the country. For example, training
is not available in some of the regions in which the Government Plans to
develop industry in order to provide employment opportunities, such as the
North East of Peninsular Malaysia and in East Malaysia. Also, there is no
facility for technician training in the Selangor/Kuala Lumpur area, in which
there is already a heavy concentration of industry. The location of training
in industrial regions is necessary to facilitate close relationships with
industry and the development of training relevant to industrial need.
1.15      Management of Training.  Both the polytechnic and ITI systems are
small and so far have not required elaborate arrangements for central
coordination and management. The implementation of the current development
plan to expand the polytechnics from two to seven and the ITIs from five to
ten, and their subsequent operation will require effective organization and
management. The programs of management development have started with tech-



-5-
nical assistance and staff training under the first project, with the aim of
establishing effective internal management structures for the polytechnics and
ITIs and strengthening the management capacity of both the TAVED of HOE and
the Training Service Division of MOL. Within TAVED a new Development Unit is
being formed, the Intake Unit is being strengthened to deal with the central
administration of polytechnic admissions, and the Polytechnic Unit is assuming
a stronger policy-making role. Within MOL the reorganization and strength-
ening of the Training Service Division of the Manpower Department under the
first project has not been fully implemented because of the Government's
policy of restricting the growth of public services staff; the proposed
project would address this question (para. 2.08).
1.16      Manpower Development Planning.  The agencies concerned with manpower
planning have limited capacity and lack coordination in their work. The
Government, in 1982/83, reviewed its arrangements for manpower planning and
defined more clearlv the responsibilities of the agencies concerned. It is
taking steps to strengthen them and to improve coordination.
1.17      The main planning agencies are:  (i) the Research and Planning
Division (RPD) of the HOL (responsible for studies of private sector
empLoyment and labor market); (ii) the Manpower Planning Section (MPS) of the
Public Service Department (PSD) (responsible for manpower planning in the
public sect.,r); and (iii) the Educational Planning and Research Division
(EPRD) of the MOE (responsible for planning in the formal education system).
These agencies are in need of strengthening through improvement in the
qualiiications and experience of staff (including postgraduate training),
strengthening of their data handling, and improvements in the design and
impLementation of their planning systems. The project would address these
problems.
Government Strategy and the Bank's Role
1.18      The Government's objectives are to expand and raise the quality of
skill and technician training to meet industrial manpower needs and to achieve
a balanced distribution of training opportunities in relation to regional dis-
tribution of population and industry. Under the revised Fourth Malaysia Plan
the Government has allocated 32X of the total development expenditure on
education and training to the development of technical and vocational
education. The Government is also taking steps to strengthen the agencies
responsible for planning and management of manpower development and training
and is exploring the possibilities for industry to contribute more effectively
to the provision of training.
1.19      The Bank, through several projects, has been active in the
development of skilled worker and technician training in Malaysia. The
establishment of a second polytechnic was financed under the Third Education
Project (Loan 974-MA) of April 1974. The capacity for skills training was
increased by the establishment of three new ITIs at Labuan, Kuala Trengganu and
Johor Bharu, raising the total to fivc-, under the Fourth Education Project (Loan
1329-MA) of November 1976.



-6-
1.20      A major program of expansion and upgrading of training was initiated
with the first Industrial Training Project (Loan 2145-MA) signed in October 1982
and scheduled for completion by June 1987. The project provides for the design,
construction and equipping of two new polytechnics (at Alor Setar and Batu
Pahat' having a combined annual output of about 1,400 technicians, and three new
ITIs (at Ipoh, Kuantan and Malacca) having a combined annual output of about
1,800 skilled workers, together with the design, site acquisition and site
preparation for an additional three polytechnics and two ITIs. The project also
included provision for a sizeable technical assistance program to help with the
detaiLed planning of new training programs, and the upgrading of training and
management systems. Fellowships were provided for skills and technical
upgrading of staff and for management training.
1.21      in spite of a slowdown in public sector development in 1982-84, good
progress aas been made with the implementation of the first project. Sites have
been p-_pared for all five institutions which are to be built under this
proje-.. Construction of the two polytechnics has begun and will start shortly
for the three ITIs. All constructi3n is expected to be completed by December
1986 which would be only three to six months behind appraisal estimates. The
start of technical assistance and trainirg programs was delayed but the programs
are under way and are expected to be completed in accordance with appraisal
estimates. New management systems are being set up, effective links with
private industry established and training. programs revised in accordar.ce with
industrial needs. Staff training has also started. The Government, with the
assistance of consultants, has also started the program of studies of training
in industry which are designed to lead to the adoption of policies to improve
industrial participation in training (para. 1.09). Implementation of the ITI
component has been somewhat slower than planned, mainly because the staff of the
Development Unit of MOL has not been increased as expected and the existing
staff has been occupied with the completion of the ITI cosponent of the Fourth
Education Project.
1.22      The design and preparation for the additional three polytechnics and
two ITIs to be constructed and equipped in a second phase has proceeded without
delay. All sites for these institutions have been acquired: site preparation
is almost complete for two of the polytechnics, about six months ahead of
appraisal estimates.  Site work for the third polytechnic and the two ITIs will
be combined with construction.
1.23      Four Bank education projects have been completed:  one has been
audited, the second was exempt from audit and the completion reports on the
other two are in draft. Overall, the projects have been successfully
implemented, but with delays. Problems with site acquisition and construction,
which were the main causes of delay in the first four projects, h.-ve been
eliminated in subsequent projects by ensuring :hat projects siLes are acquired
at an early stage in project processing, and by the employment of private
architects in place of Public Works Department staff. Educational objectives
have been achieved. A follow-up study of graduates from the Kuantan
Polyt. -nic, established under the Third Education Project showed that they are
readily absorbed into employment - this is attributed in part to the shortage of
technicians and partly to the beneficial effect of the period of training in
industry included in the courses. Staff training has played an important part



- 7 -
in earlier projects: experience with recruitment and training for Kuantan
Polytechnic has been favourable and the turnover rate of polytechnic teachers is
reasonable at about 5Z p.a.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.24      The project would complete the long-term development program initiated
under the first IndustriaL Training Project. It would complete the
institutional development for which initial investment in the planning, detailed
design and site acquisition and preparation was provided in the first project.
The objectives of the development of technician and skilled worker training
remain valid since shortages in the supply of technical manpower constitute a
major bottleneck to economic and social development and are expected to persist
at least until the end of the decade.
II. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Scope
2.01      The project wouLd assist the Government to continue with the
investment program in technician and skilled worker training started with the
support of the first project. The project would (a) increase the supply of
technicians and skilled workers, with attention to the regional distribution of
training facilities in relation to the distribution of population and industry;
(b) improve the quality and strengthen the management of training; and (c)
strengtien manpower development planning.
2.02      The project would provide civil works and related professional
services, equipment and materials, furniture, and technical assistance to:
(a) extend and upgrade technician training through the construction and
eiiDping of three polytechnics, at Kota Bharu, Kuching and Port
Dickson, to provide an annual output of 2,200 technicians; introduce
new training programs; improve management of training and upgrade
teaching and management staff;
(b) extend and upgrade skilled worker training through the construction
and equipping of two ITIs, at Alor Setar and Kota Bharu, to provide an
annual output of about 1,300 skilled workers; introduce new training
programs; improve management of training and upgrade training and
management staff; and
(c) strengthen selected key agencies responsible for manpower development
planning, including the provision of 63 man-years of fellowship
training and relevant equipment and facilities.

Project Components
Technician Training (US$74.2 million excluding contingencies)
2.03      Physical Development.  For the three polytechnics at Kota Bharu,
Kuching and Port Dickson, pLanning, design and site preparation is being
completed under the first project. Each polytechnic would have the capacity for
a total enrollment of 1,500 equivalent full-time students, including 1,200 in
certificate courses of 2-1/4 years duration and the equivalent of 300 in part-
time specialist and diploma courses. The total enrollment in these new
poLytechnics would increase to 4,500 by 1989 and by 1991 the new polytechnics
would contribute an estimated annual output of 2,200 technicians to the overall
annual output of about 6,400.
2.04      Course and Staff Development.  The three polytechnics would be located
in regions of existing and planned industrial development and courses would be
related to regional industrial needs including new subjects and specializations,
e.g., agricultural engineering, plant engineering, highway engineering, water
engineering, timber technology, printing, and textiles (Appendix 3, Table 1).
At full development the three new polytechnics would require an additional 450
teaching staff (Appendix 3, Table 2). Teachers' salaries, although comparable
with salaries of engineers in other government departments, are not sufficiently
attractive to draw a significant numi-er of experienced engineers from private
industry to polytechnic teaching. esnce, it would be necessary for the MOE to
recruit potential teachers from the graduates of secondacy schools, sponsor them
in basic courses and provide further upgrading and experience. Senior staff
would be drawn from the existing polytechnics. This is a satisfactory
approach. At negotiations the Government agreed with the Bank a schedule for
appointment of polytechnic staff. The project would support the expansion and
upgrading of polytechnic staff by including 65 man-years of fellowships for
overseas training for about 50 existing staff in selected specialist fields of
postgraduate training and industrial experience, about 530 man-years pre-service
degree training for about 130 new staff and about 290 man-years of fellowships
for preservice diploma and first degree training in Malaysia for about 70 new
staff. To assist in the development and initial impLementation of training in
new technologies, and in the related in-service training of staff the project
would provide specialist assistance on short assl3nments - 72 man-months foreign
and 72 man-months local (Appendix 3, Table 3).
2.05      Management.  As the polytechnic system grows, the management
structures of the polytechnics and the arrangements for polytechnic management
within the TAVED are evolving with the help of the technical assistance and
training program under the first project. The proposed project would continue
the program of strengthening management of the polytechnic system by the
provision of 12 man-years of fellowships for management training overseas and 6
man-years for local training for senior staff of the polytechnics and the TAVED
(Appendix 3, Table 3).
Skilled Worker Training (US$19.6 million equivaLent, excluding contingencies)
2.06      Physical Development.  For the two additional ITIs at Alor Setar and
Kota Bharu, designs and site preparation are being completed under the first



- 9 -
project. The project would provide civil works, i.e., workshops, classrooms,
administration and communal buildings and staff and trainee housing, equipment,
furniture and professional services.
2.07      Course DeveLopment.  Each of the new ITIs would have a training
capacity of about 500 places and provide an output of about 650 skilled workers
(Appendix 4, Table 1). The project would support the continued development of
new and upgraded training methods and materials and the development of training
courses in new specialist skills and technologies related to industrial needs in
the regions in which the ITIs would be located. To assist in the detailed
planning and initial implementation of training modules required in new skills
and technologies and to provide the related in-service staff training, the
project would provide about 216 man-months of technical assistance from overseas
training specialists (Appendix 4, Table 2).
2.08      Staff and Management Development.  The project would provide technical
assistance and staff training for the management and staff development necessary
to establish effective training programs including the promotion of, and support
for, increased training by industry. The Training Service Division of MOL would
be reorganized into two units - a Technical Unit and an Operational Unit - and
would delegate to the ITIs some responsibilities for planning and development,
including the deveLopment and upgrading of in-plant industrial training. The
proposed structure of the Training Service Division is shown in Appendix 4,
Chart 1. To implement successfully the proposed Second Industrial Training
Project in paralleL with the first project, adequate additional senior staff
would be required. The staffing of the Training Service Division would
therefore be increased from the present 8 to 18 by 1987; staffing for each ITI
would include at least 5 additional posts for development including in-plant
training development. The two new ITIs would require about 90 new instructors,
and as for the polytechnics (para. 2.04) these will have to be recruited and
trained (Appendix 4, Table 1). Details of the main responsibilities and
schedules of appointment of the new and reorganized posts of the Training
Services Division and the training, planning and development posts in the ITIS
were agreed with the Government. To support staff development, the project
would provide 103 man-years of overseas fellowships for specialist skills and
management training for senior instructors and other MOL staff and 200 man-years
of local training in basic skills (Appendix 4, Table 2). The project would
provide 60 man-months of consultant services from overseas specialists to assist
in management and the setting up of effective industrial liaison and planning
and development systems in the ITIs.
Manpower Development Planning (US$2.5 million excluding contingencies)
2.09      The project would improve the capacity of relevant agencies to carry
out manpower development planning through the financing of staff training,
advisory services and supporting equipment and materials for: (a) the EPRD of
the MOE; (b) the RPD of MOL, and (c) the MPS of the Establishment Division of
the Public Service Department (Appendix 5).
2.10      EPRD (MOE):  The project would finance 18 man-months of specialist
consultant services to provide advice and in-service training for the
Educational Planning and Research Division, in order to establish the operating



- 10 -
and data management systems for the proposed MOE computer system. In addition,
56 man-years of fellowships would be provided for overseas training of EPRD
staff. The project would also finance the purchase of books, periodicals and
reproduction equipment for the EPRD library/documentation center (Appendix 5,
Table 2).
2.11      RPD (MOL):  To improve the capacity of the Research and Planning
Division of MOL to provide policy advice on the labor market, particuLarly
within the private sector, the project would finance 24 man-months of specialist
consultant services and 51 mcn-months of fellowships for training overseas,
together with supporting microcomputers and software (Appendix 5, Table 3).
2.12      MPS (PSD):  In order to strengthen the capacity of the Manpower
Planning Section to plan for the overall requirements, supply and deployment of
manpower in the public services sector the project would finance 18 man-months
of consultant services and 68 man-months of fellowships for training and
internship assignments overseas for MPS staff, together with supporting
microcomputers and related equipment and software (Appendix 5, Table 4).
Project Implementation
2.13      The project would be managed as follows:  (a) the technician training
component by the existing Development and Supplies Division of MOE in
coordination with the TAVED; (b) the skilled worker training component by the
Development Unit of the MOL Manpower Department; and (c) the planning component
by the three divisions or sections directly involved. The Development and
Supplies Division of MOE and the Development Unit of MOL are responsible for the
management and implementation of the first project. Coordination of project
management between the two ministries without a separate coordinating entity has
not posed any difficulty for the Bank. With regard to the proposed planning
component, EPRD would be assisted by the Development and Supplies Division of
MOE and RPD by the Development Unit of MOL in respect of the procurement of
equipment, materials, consultants and training and of the maintenance of
accounts for the project activities.
2.14      In the case of technician training, the division of responsibilities
for implementation between the Development and Supplies Division and TAVED would
be the same as that established and working effectively for the first project.
The staffing of the two divisions is adequate.
2.15      The delay in increasing the technical staff of the Development Unit of
the MOL under the first project has been a major factor in delay in
implementation of the MOL component of the first project. There are only four
of the planned seven staff in post; the three vacant posts should be filled to
strengthen staffing for equipment procurement, administration of technical
assistance and training programs and liaison with other agencies and the Bank.
The strengthened staffing together with the provision of technical assistance to
support the Unit, particularly for procurement of goods and services, would be
essential to ensure prompt and effective implementation of the ITI component of
the project. The Government has agreed to appoint the three additional staff to
the Development Unit: the appointments would be a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan (para. 3.02).

Status of Project Preparation
2.16      The project is poised for implementation and would be implemented over
a five-year period from mid-1985 to mid-1990 (Appendix 6). All project sites
have been acquired. Site works and infrastructure, financed under the first
project, have been compLeted for the Kuching Polytechnic site and are expected
to be compLeted for Kota Bharu Polytechnic by May 1985. Tendering for their
construction began in January 1985 and construction is planned to start in mid-
1985; contractors have already been prequalified. The site works for Port
Dickson Polytechnic will be combined with construction in a single contract to
be tendered in early 1986. Detailed design of the two ITIs at Alor Setar and
Kota Bharu has been completed. Tenders for construction and site works will be
invited in May 1985 and construction is planned to start in mid-1985. Master
equipment lists have been agreed for the main subjects.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
2.17      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$121.0 million
equivalent. The estimated cost by project component is summarized in Table 1,
and by category of expenditure in Table 2. (Detailed costs are given in
Appendix 7, Table 1 and project expenditure by year and purpose in Appendix 7,

2.18      Base costs refer to April 1985 prices.  Estimated construction costs
are based on recent tender prices for the two polytechnics being estabLished
under the first project, which incLude similar designs for classroom and
laboratory buildings, workshops and student and staff housing, tender prices
for Kuching Polytechnic, and on quantity surveyors' estimates of costs for the
ITIs. Estimated equipment costs are based on master-lists and the recent cost
of polytechnic and ITI equipment. Furniture costs are estimated at about 15%
of construction costs. Based on MOE's past experience, the estimated cost of
equipment and furntiure for the Kuching Polytechnic in Sarawak will be
significantly higher than in Peninsular Malaysia due to transportation and
higher labor costs. Technical assistance and training fellowship costs are
estimated on the basis of recently negotiated contracts under the first
project. Customs duties and taxes on building materials are estimated to
amount to about 1.7% of total project costs. Equipment and teaching materials
imported under the project would be exempt from duties and taxes.
2.19      The unit areas and costs for the project institutions are in line
with recent Bank median values for comparable facilities (Appendix 7,
Table 3).
2.20      The foreign exchange component of US$76.4 million, representing
about 63% of the total estimated cost, has been calculated on the basis of the
following estimated foreign exchange percentages (with taxes and duties
excluded): civil works - 35%; professional services - 20%; equipment and
library and reference materials - 901; furniture - 25Z; foreign consultants
and overseas training fellowships - 100%; and local consultants and fellow-
ships - 20%. Physical contingencies of 10% have been allowed for construc-
tion, furniture, equipment and materials and professional services and 5X for
technical assistance. Price contingencies which are equivalent to about 15%
of base costs plus physical contingencies were calculated in accordance with
the implementation schedule and the following expected average annual
increases: local and foreign - 5.0% for 1985, 7.5Z for 1986, and 8.0% for
1987 to 1990.
2.21      The Canadian Government, acting through the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), intends to make a grant of about Canadian $4
million (US$3.1 million) to finance part of the technical assistance and staff
training for the skilled worker training component. The memorandum of
understanding is expected to be signed in early July 1985 and the grant will
be effective as soon as soon as the Bank loan becomes effective. The plan of
operation for the technical assistance has been agreed between the Bank, CIDA
and the Government. The proposed Bank loan of US$73.3 million would equal the
balance of the foreign exchange component and would finance 61% of the total
project costs excluding duties and taxes. The proposed financing plan is
shown in Table 3.

Recurrent Costs
2.22      The recurrent expenditure on education and training represents 22.7%
of total federal recurrent budget and 5.6% of GNP. The estimated incremental
annual recurrent cost of the proposed project when all institutions are
operating at full capacity is about US$4.5 million (at 1984 prices) for the
technician training component and US$1 million (at 1984 prices) for the
skilled worker training component. These costs would represent about 0.25Z of
the MOE operating budget and 2.3% of MOL's in 1990 assuming these budgets grow
at about 5% p.a.
Procurement
2.23      Civil works contracts of more than US$2.5 million would be awarded
on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Civil works contracts
for less than US$2.5 million would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally in accordance with government procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank. Equipment and furniture would be grouped to the
extent possible into attractive bid packages to facilitate bulk procurement.
Packages estimated to cost US$200,000 or more (estimated value US$30 million)
would be awarded on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. In
the comparison of bids for equipment and furniture, local manufacturers would
be extended a margin of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing
imports or the actual customs duties, whichever is lower. Equipment and
furniture packages estimated to cost less than US$200,000 (estimated value
US$16.3 million) and which, because of content are not expected to interest
foreign suppliers, would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally in accordance with government procurement practices which
are acceptable to the Bank. Miscellaneous items in packages not exceeding
US$25,000 in value and aggregating to not more than US$3 million equivalent
would be purchased on the basis of quotations from a minimum of three
suppliers or through Treasury contracts for bulk purchase. Books, computer
software and other instructional materials would be procured through direct
purchase after negotiation for the lowest price. Table 4 provides a breakdown



- 16 -
of project expenditure by procurement category. Prior Bank review of bidding
documents and proposed contract awards would be required for all contracts for
civil works, equipment and furniture awarded on the basis of ICB, estimated to
cost a total of about US$80 million including contingencies 66X of the value).

2.24      Technical Assistance.  Under the first Industrial Training Project
major technical assistance and staff training contracts were signed with con-
sultants in accordance with Bank guidelines. Similarly, a series of contracts
should be arranged for the technical assistance and overseas training under
this project. Terms of reference, timetables for consultant services and
overseas and local training and criteria and procedures for selection of staff
for the award of fellowships have been agreed.
Disbursements
2.25      The proposed loan of US$73.3 million would be disbursed over a
period of six years. Disbursements would be made on the basis of (a) 35Z of
the cost of civil works and professional services; (b) 100% of the c.i.f. cost
of imported equipment, furniture and materials, 100% of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured equipment, furniture and materials, 60Z of the cost of
imported equipment, furniture and materials procured locally; and (c) 100% of
the cost of consultant services and fellowships. To the extent practicable,
withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$100,000 or more
prior to submission to the Bank for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the
loan. In view of the satisfactory budgetary procedures and financing for
earlier education and training projects it was agreed to accept the



- 17 -
earlier education and training projects it was agreed to accept the
Government's preference not to establish a special account and matching
operating account before it has weighed the advantages and disadvantages in
more detail. Disbursements for miscellaneous equipment and furniture items,
books, computer software and other instructional materials and local
fellowships would be based on statements of expenditure. Supporting documents
would be retained by the project implementing units and made available for
review by visiting Bank missions. All other disbursements would be made
against full documentation.
2.26      The disbursement schedule (Appendix 7, Table 5) has been based on
the implementation schedule and the experience with disbursement in education
projects in the Region. The profile for the project shows a higher rate of
disbursement than the historical average because of the advanced state of
project preparation. To allow sufficient time for submission of final
withdrawal applications following the scheduled completion date of June 30,
1990, the Closing Date would be June 30, 1991.
Reporting and Audit
2.27      Project accourts would be maintained by the MOE Development and
Supplies Division, by the MOL Development Unit and, in respect of the MPS
planning subcomponent, by the Administrative Division of the PSD. The
accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices
satisfactory to the Bank. The units concerned would submit to the Bank within
six months of the end of the Government's fiscal year, statements reflecting
the financial performance and position of the project together with
independent auditors' reports including separate audit of accounts relating to
disbursement against statements of expenditure. Six months after the Closing
Date, the MOE Development and Supplies Division would submit to the Bank a
project completion report covering all project components.
Benefits and Risks
2.28      The main benefits would be (a) an increase and improved geographic
distribution in the training capacity and supply of suitably qualified
technicians and skilled workers for industry; (b) improved management capacity
of the poLytechnics and ITIs; and (c) improved capacity for planning of human
resource development. By 1991 the output from the three polytechnics would be
about 2,200 technicians annually, representing about 33% of the total annual
supply. The two ITIs would contribute about 1,300 to the total annual output
of the ITI system of about 7,200 skilled workers, i.e., about 20% of that
output. These increases would contribute substantially to alleviating one of
the major constraints to the country's industrial development. The project
would also improve the regional distribution and increase the opportunities
for further education and training for secondary school leavers. The
assistance to agencies responsible for manpower planning in the public and
private sectors would result in the availability of improved labor-market and
employment informatien as a basis for policy decisions relating to the
utilization and supply of manpower.



- 18 -
2.29      The main risk to the timely achievement of the anticipated benefits
is MOL's capacity to ymplerent the ITI component on schedule.  This has caused
delay in the implementation of past projects. The requirement for
strengthening the staff of the MOL Development Unit and the technical
assistance are designed to minimize that risk (para. 2.15).
Critical Implementation Dates
2.30      The following are the expected dates for critical activities in

III. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDAIION
3.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on:
(a) schedules for appointment of staff for the polytechnics
(para. 2.04);
(b) the posts for the Training Service Division of MOL and the training,
planning and development positions in the ITIs, including the
schedules for appointment of staff (para. 2.08); and
(c) schedules for the engagement of consultant services and
implementation of the staff training programs and criteria and
procedures for selection of staff for the award of fellowships
(para. 2.24).
3.02      The appointment of staff to fill the three vacant technical
positions in the MOL Development Unit would be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para. 2.15).
3.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would consti-
tute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$73.3 million equivalent to the
Government of Malaysia at the standard variable rate for a term of 15 years
including a grace period of three years.

SECOND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING PROJECT
Manpower Planning and Planning of Education and Training
Introduction
1.        Mhe proposed project would improve the capacity of relevant agencies
responsible for manpower planning in the private and public sectors and for
the planning of education. The assistance would be narrowly-based and would
focus on the improvement of systems and operations, mainly through the
provision of consultant services and staff training, the latter by fellowships
for training overseas, and by in-service on-the-job training. Three key
agencies would be assisted:
(a) the Education Planning and Research Division (EPRD) of MOE;
(b) the Research and Planning Division (RPD) of MOL, and
(c) the Manpower Planning Section (MPS) of the Public Service Department
(PsD).
Education Planning and Research Division (EPRD)
2.        The EPRD serves as the technical support and secretariat of the
Education Planning Committee of MOE and provides the data .7nd analysis for the
formulation of policy and implementation strategy. The Division-comprises
five units - Planning, Research and Coordination, Evaluation, Data, and
Policy. There is a total staff establishment of 119 of which 90 posts are
currently filled (Table 1).
3.        The Education Data Unit is responsible for the management infor-
mation system for MOE.  It is already provided with microcoIputers and,
following a recent Ministry-financed study, expects to install a main-frame
computer system for general MOE service by January 1986. The proposed project
would provide consultant services to establish the operating systems and to
supervise the initial development of software - including the in-service
training of staff.
4.        The project would also finance 56 man-years of fellowships for
overseas training to improve the qualifications and experience of EPRD
staff. The library/documentations center would also be strengthened by the
supply of books, periodicals and reproduction equipment. The technical
assistance program is shown in Table 2.
Research and Planning Division (RPD) of the MOL
5.        The RPD of the MOL is responsible for manpower development planning
for the private sector. Major activities include an Annual Survey of Employ-
ment and Earnings in selected industries, a triennial Occupational Wage Survey



- 33 -                           Appendix 5
Page 2
in select industries in the manufacturing sector and surveys of labor market
mechanisms - the first pilot being undertaken in 1982. The RPD is organized
in two sections: one for research and planning and the other for statistical
anaLysis. The technical staff of eight is not expected to be increased
significantly during the next few years due to the restriction on new
appointments for the public service.
6.        The project would improve the capacity of the RPD to undertake
research and planning and to supervise and commission studies, by providing
specialist consulting services, staff training and supporting microcomputer
facilities and related software. The technical assistance program is shown in
Table 3.
Manpower Planning Section (MPS) of PSD
7.        The PSD is the central personnel agency of Government, responsible
for formulation and implementaticn of all personnel policies for public sector
empLoyees. It has a key role in implementing the present policies for
curtailing g-owth and increasing productivity in the public sector.
8.        The proposed project wouLd focus in the strengthening of the MPS of
the PSD's Establishment Division. The MPS has formulated guidelines for the
organization of the manpower planning process for all public sector agen-
cies. The process includes: analysis of functions and objectives, past and
present stock, workload and establishment norms, supply and labor market
information; forecasting of demand and supply; formulation of agency manpower
plans; and implementation and evaluation.
9.        The project would assist MPS by:
(a) training key MPS and other public sector agency staff in courses
(48 man-months) and internships (20 man-months) overseas;
(b) providing consulting advisory services for: (i) in-country
training of manpower planners, in association with the Institut
Tadbican Awam Negara, Malaysia (12 man-months), and (ii) specialist
short advisory assignments by key staff from associated overseas
institutions (6 man-months); and
(c) supply of microcomputer equipment and related software.
The technical assistance program is shown in Table 4.
10.       The Head of the MPS would be responsible for implementing this sub-
component including the procurement of the technical assistance. The Adminis-
trative Division wouLd be responsible for procurement of the hardware and of
maintenance of project accounts.
