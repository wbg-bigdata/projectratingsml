NEKORiNDU EAND RECOENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIORAL BANC FOR -zcoiSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO TEE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
FOR A RURAL PRIMARY EDUCATION MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed US$4.4 million equivalent
development loan to Honduras is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be for a period of 20 years, with 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable rate, and would help finance a rural primary education management
improvement project.
2.      Back2round.  Honduras made considerable progress during the past
decade in extending edueational services at all levels. Most available
indicators show a performance about equal to the average for Central
American countries, and the public sector budget for education is
reasonably distributed in its support of primary (50 percent), secondary
(23 percent), and higher education (17 percent), with approximately 10
percent going to other programs. There is a need, however, to improve the
quality and cost-effectiveness of education. Accordingly, recent
initiatives have been undertaken to strengthen management at the central
level, including creation of a Cabinet for Social Development, focussing on
policies for sectoral development, activation of the Ministry of Public
Education's (SEP) Executive Council with responsibility for formulation of
policy and program proposals for consideration by relevant entities,
including the Social Cabinet, and creation of a technical unit in SEP (the
External Assistance Coordinating Unit (UCCE) to provide support for the
Executive Council on a broad range of topics and to coordinate all external
financial assistance. In addition, the Government has recently updated its
policy framework, covering all areas under the purview of SEP, with
emphasis on primary and secondary levels: (a) initial concentration on
grades one through three; (b) extension of coverage in poorly served,
mainly rural and urban marginal areas; and (c) introduction of systematic
planning. Improvements to be introduced at the primary level would be
extended to the secondary level. Regarding higher education, the policy
objectives of the National Autonomous University (UNAH) include: improving
institutional management and expenditure control, expanding revenues from
non-fiscal sources, introducing selective admissions policies based on
student achievement, improving the quality of the faculty, curricula, and
research programs, and tailoring professional training progrems to national
needs.
3.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project would be part of a
phased approach to support the Government's efforts to improve the quality
and effectiveness of education. It would seek to alleviate key constraints
to SEP's capacity to effectively plan and carry out needed investments and
administer the educational system. On this basis, the project would seek
to strengthen the structure and management capacity of SEP and to
decentralize the management of rural primary education.



-2-
4.       Protect DeacriRtIon.  The proposed project would enhance the
management capacity and performance of SEP through technical assistance
aimed att (a) strengthening the capacity of SEP's Executive Council and
UCCE in the areas of inter-ministerial coordination, sectoral policy
formulation, planning of education development, budget management, and
internal administration; (b) developing recomnendations for Improving SEP's
organization; and (c) preparing an evaluation of current decentralization
policies. The project would assist SEP in developing and testing an
effective management and development planning system for rural primary
education, designed to economize on recurrent expenditurest improve cost-
effectiveness, and establish the basis for raising atudent achievement.
This would entails (a) carrying out a micro-planning exercise for the rural
primary schools in the project area (six departments in the northern
region), including a diagnostic survey of needs, proj ections of growth, and
reorganization of the schools into a cohesive network for administrative
and supervisory services; (b) preparing, as part of the micro-planning
exercise, action plans for construction or repair of physical facilities,
teacher training, management and supervision, and a student testing system;
(c) testing the results of the micro-planning effort by implementing the
action plans for two school districts under a pilot subproject; and (d)
preparing a comprehensive operational plan for all schools in the project
area by consolidating all micro-plans and action plans, taking into account
the results of the pilot subproject. A diagnostic survey would also be
carried out to assess the needs of first cycle (grades 7-9) secondary
schools located in the project area. The project, to be carried out over
3-112 years, provides funds for technical assistance and training; civil
works; equipment, supplies, furniture, vehicles, and spare parts; and
incremental operating costs (salaries and travel expense). The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$6.9 million equivalent, with foreign
exchange component of US$1.4 million (202). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are showr in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Honduras are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6609-HO, dated
April 6, 1987, is being distributed separately.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The focus of the proposed project
on improving educational management by establishing systems to increase
cost-effectiveness of expenditures is consistent with the Bank's strategy
to assist the Government in controlling the growth of public expenditures
while making better use of available resources. The targetting of project
benefits to rural primary education would contribute to poverty
alleviation. The project would build on the experience acquired under two
earlier operations in support of education in Honduras. Although these
operations achieved their principal objectives, completion was delayed as a
result of inadequate management capacity and, in the case of the second
project, overly ambitious objectives. Nevertheless, the latest operation
successfully tested technical concepts to be used in the proposed project
and demonstrated the viability of well-planned efforts to decentralize
activities. The other major donors in the sector (USAID and IDB) have
provided substantial financial assistance in the past and have proposed to
continue such support: USAID is working on provision of textbooks and
learning materials for primary education, while IDB would support



- 3 -
vocational, secondary, and adult education.  These donor. have welcomed the
proposed project, which would be complementary to their efforts.
6.       Areed Actions.  The Government has agreed to take the following
actions: (1) establishment of a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and a
Regional Unit (responsible for micro-planning) in SEP, appointment of their
respective directors, and employment of a qualified agency to assist SEP in
selecting and contracting consultants to be employed under the project, as
conditions of effectiveness; (2) satisfactory completion of the micro-plans
and action plans for the two pilot districts, selected according to
criteria agreed with the Bank, as a condition of disbursement for the pilot
subproject; (3) staffing of the PCU and the Regional Unit according to a
timetable acceptable to the Bank; (4) presentation of the results of a
study on SEP's administrative organization, together with a plan for
implementation of the study's recomaendations, by December 31, 1989; and
(5) preparation of a comprehensive operational plan for primary education
in the project area, together with a timetable for its implementation, by
October 31, 1990. The Government's current statement of policies for
primary education is considered satisfactory, and the Bank will continue
its dialogue with the Government on policy issues affecting the sector.
7.       Justification.  The proposed project would help the Government:
(a) strengthen its management of the educational system, thus enhancing the
quality and efficiency of its operations and enabling it to avoid
distortions in its programs and deal more effectively with broader sectoral
issues; and (b) establish a primary education management and development
planning system to improve quality and efficiency in primary education,
reduce repetition and dropout rates, and enable more rapid extension of
educational opportunities to disadvantaged rural and urban marginal
families with available resources.
8.       Risks.  The main risks relate to possible implementation delays.
The technical assistance inputs to the project are designed to strengthen
SEP's managerial capacity, thus offsetting such risks. In addition, the
Bank would carry out close supervision of the project.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
