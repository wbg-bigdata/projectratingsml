1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.   Context at Appraisal

The second programmatic DPL series was presented at a critical juncture for Indonesia, as it was
facing the ramifications and contagion effects of the global financial turmoil in late 2008. However,
Indonesia entered into the crisis in a relatively strong position. Real GDP growth had accelerated to a
ten-year high in the previous year, despite unstable global financial markets and a slowing world
economy. The budget deficit had been maintained at relatively low levels, 1.3 percent of GDP in
2007, and the debt-to-GDP ratio had also declined significantly from 55 percent in 2004 to 34.9
percent in 2007. These improvements in Indonesia’s public finances reflected strong fiscal discipline,
and a significant reduction in fuel subsidies that relieved a substantial budgetary burden from soaring
oil prices. Indonesia coped with the global financial turmoil relatively well, given its record of
prudent fiscal management, as well as its size, robust economic demand and diverse exports.

Nevertheless, because of its relatively open capital account, the significant foreign presence in its
stock and bond markets, and the legacy of the 1998 crisis (which left Indonesian investors sensitive to
exchange rate movements and prone to capital flight), Indonesia was more exposed to externally
mobile capital than other countries in East Asia. Recognizing this vulnerability, the Government took
a number of precautionary and proactive measures. These included clarifying the roles,
responsibilities and procedures for different agencies in the event of failure within the financial
system, raising the deposit insurance limit and submitting to Parliament a revised budget that
corresponded to the global downturn. In addition, to alleviate financing constraints in the event that
global liquidity conditions would not ease, the Government requested contingent financing from the
World Bank and other development partners in the form of an additional DPL with a Deferred
Drawdown Option (DPL-DDO). Altogether, these measures, coming on top of Indonesia’s record of
prudent fiscal management, previous macroeconomic performance, and ongoing commitment to the
longer-term institutional reform agenda, provided the requisite stability that warranted continued
support for Indonesia’s structural and institutional reform efforts through the second DPL series.

The second programmatic Indonesia DPL series was anchored to the FY09-12 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) that was approved by the Board in September 2008. The CPS proposed that the DPL
continued to be at the center of the WBG support in strengthening Indonesia’s central government
institutions and systems, a key cross-sectoral engagement theme under the CPS. The second DPL
series was originally envisaged to consist of three annual single-tranche loans (DPLs 5-7), which in
substantive terms is a continuation of the first DPL series (DPLs 1-4), though focusing more on the
medium-term institutional and policy reforms in the areas of investment climate, public finance
management and poverty alleviation and service delivery. However, with the newly elected
Government’s strategies and priorities in place, it was realized that there was a renewed opportunity
to better realign the DPL program with those strategies and priorities. Hence, following agreement
with the Government, and endorsement by the World Bank regional management, the second DPL
series was closed one year earlier than envisaged and DPL 7 is being represented as the beginning of a
new series. This ICR therefore covers only DPLs 5-6.

1.2.   Original Program Development Objectives

The overall goal of the DPL program is to help the Government of Indonesia achieve its medium term
growth and poverty reduction objectives. The program is a continuation of the first DPL program
surrounding three core policy areas:

(i)     Improve the investment climate. Under this policy area, the objective was to focus on reforms
        to help make Indonesia a more attractive place to invest overall, through reducing the
        uncertainties for investors by strengthening investment service institutions and improving
        investment regulations; reducing the time needed for, and the cost of, importing and
        exporting; reducing compliance costs, enhancing taxpayer services and improving the

                                                                                                     1
         efficiency and equity of the tax administration; reducing the vulnerability of the financial
         system; and improving MSMEs’ access to credit.

(ii)     Strengthen public financial management. The DPL program sought to contribute to a more
         efficient, transparent and accountable management of public resources. It is expected to do so
         through improving budget and cash management within the central Government; improving
         the results orientation in the budget process; streamlining budget execution and management
         of budget authority; improving government accounting and audit functions; improving public
         procurement; and enhancing bureaucratic effectiveness.

(iii)    Enhance poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts. The objective under this policy area
         is to improve efficiency and equity in the use of public resources by better targeting of the
         poor and through improvements in sub-national spending. This is expected to be achieved by
         strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of public expenditures and programs; enhancing
         the pro-poor impact of social protection and human development programs by improving
         their targeting; and raising the quality of public service delivery, specifically education.

1.3.    Revised PDO

Overall, the PDO and reform policy areas remained consistent throughout the series.

1.4.    Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

1. Investment Climate. Business surveys suggested that an improved perception of macroeconomic
   stability and economic reform may have contributed to some recovery in investment. Investment
   growth accelerated in 2007 by 9.2 percent, from just 2.5 percent in the previous year, accounting
   for one-third of total economic growth. As a share of GDP, investment was back up to 25 percent,
   a major improvement from less than 20 percent during the early post-East Asian crisis years of
   2000-03, although still not a full recovery to pre-crisis levels of nearly 30 percent of GDP.
   However, much remained to be done, as the overall investment climate was still characterized by
   high transaction costs for business overall, which was attributed to cumbersome business
   licensing and approval systems, and tax and customs complications. The DPL series continued to
   support reform actions aimed towards addressing these gaps in order to promote a more
   conducive investment climate.

2. Public Finance Management. Following the adoption of a new regulatory framework in 2003-
   04, the Government embarked on the implementation of ambitious public financial management
   (PFM) reforms as legislated. These efforts were part of a broader agenda to improve governance
   and enhance service delivery. Pursuant to the new legal framework, progress has been achieved in
   the way public finances are managed and in increasing transparency and independent oversight. In
   particular, the role of parliament, the Ministry of Finance and its spending agencies have been
   reformed and the budget formulation process has been substantially streamlined as articulated in
   new PFM laws. The DPL series continued to support these efforts by improving the way in which
   public finances are managed, increasing transparency and reliability of accounting and reporting,
   and creating an enabling framework for more effective public institutions.

3. Poverty Alleviation and Service Delivery. Improving the delivery of public service and
   enhancing the pro-poor impact of public expenditures continued to be critical for Indonesia.
   While Indonesia has made significant progress in poverty alleviation and service delivery, there
   are still causes for concern with the pace of poverty reduction and the extent of vulnerability.
   Many households were clustered just above the national poverty line, making them highly
   vulnerable to expenditure shocks, with the potential to drive them into poverty. Lagging human
   development indicators such as low continuation rates from primary to secondary school also
   need to be tackled by improving the quality of education services. The DPL series supported the


                                                                                                     2

       well as enhancing the quality of professional development and training for teachers.

1.5.     Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

N/A.

1.6.     Other significant changes

Building on the pillars that were the focus of the first DPL series 1 to 4, the second DPL series was
originally anticipated as the second programmatic series of DPLs anchored to the FY09-12 CPS,
consisting of three annual single-tranche DPLs 5 to 7. Yet because the legislative and presidential
elections were scheduled for 2009, and the 2010-14 national plan would not be finalized until late
2009, the team had anticipated that DPL 7 would be negotiated with the newly elected Government in
late 2010. Hence, a much more indicative set of triggers for DPL 7 was developed. Indeed, this was
indicated in the Government’s Letter of Development Policy for DPL 6, which stated that although
major reform areas of the DPL program were expected to continue, it would be the new Government
that would work with the development partners to bring future DPLs into alignment with the new
RPJMN 2010-2014, new annual government action plans (RKP) and other reform programs.

At the time DPL 7 was prepared, the newly-elected Government had already embarked on a robust
and comprehensive reform agenda. Shortly after taking office, the new Government had issued the
100-day action plan, Inpres No.1/2010, and the RPJMN 2010-2014 containing specific outputs, target
dates and responsible authorities. As such, there was a renewed opportunity to better align the DPL
program with the new Government’s development strategies and priorities. Therefore, the second
DPL series was terminated earlier than originally anticipated, with the DPL 7 now representing the
beginning of a new, third DPL series (DPLs 7 to 9), although still anchored under the FY09-12 CPS.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.     Program Performance

The second DPL series continued to be delivered annually and on a timely basis. DPL 6 in particular
was delivered in September 2009, two months earlier than the previous DPLs’ usual delivery. This
early processing was requested by the Government at the time, who wanted to secure financing prior
to the imminent transition in Government, given that the presidential election was scheduled in July
2009 and the new government was expected to take office in October 2009.

The strong dialogue between the Government and the Bank helped in ensuring that the reforms are
“owned?, rather than “agreed-to?, by the Government. With that, the pace and scope of reforms were
largely driven by the judgment of key reformers within the Government on whether or not those
reforms were bureaucratically or politically feasible. The policy actions as proposed by the
Government at times may have seemed more incremental and focused on implementation.
Nevertheless, such incremental steps were actually necessary to lay the path for more substantive
reforms in the longer run. In that sense, the DPL program was helpful in ensuring that the necessary
steps were taken, and that government ownership was maintained.

In order to ensure a more focused and programmatic approach, with advice from the World Bank’s
OPCS unit, it was decided at the beginning of the DPL series to reclassify the policy actions into two
categories: prior actions and benchmark actions that signify progress towards longer-term reforms.
Therefore, out of the 19 indicative DPL 5 triggers identified at the time DPL 4 was prepared, 12 were
developed as actual DPL 5 prior actions, whereas the remainder were maintained as benchmark
actions. The following is a list of prior actions for DPLs 5 and 6.



                                                                                                     3

2.2.   Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Some key factors have contributed to the timely and satisfactory performance of the DPL program
overall. Some of these factors had already been identified in the ICR for the first DPL series, such as:

Strong and continued government partnership. The second DPL series continued to benefit from
the strong partnership that the team had built and sustained with the Government throughout the
series. Overall, the DPL program has been driven largely by the Government’s own reform agenda.
The DPL was able to help in a number of ways. It focused assistance from the World Bank and other
development partners in implementing key reforms and it also elevated some issues to the attention of
policy makers when consensus and coordination across ministries was needed.

Decentralization of task team management. Strong field presence of the task teams, both of the
managing team and technical teams, has also contributed positively to the implementation of the DPL
program. Continued presence in the field enabled the teams to work closely with the various
government counterparts on a day-to-day basis, and strengthened the breadth and depth of policy
discussions.

Coordination with development partners. Similar to the previous series, the second DPL series was
prepared in close collaboration with the Government of Japan/JICA and the Asian Development
Bank, who provided parallel financing of US$200 million and US$400 million, respectively. At times,
the European Commission and AusAid were also involved as observers during policy dialogue.


                                                                                                                  5
Overall, the collaboration allowed not only additional leveraging of resources, but also consistency in
the development partners’ signal on the priority of reforms and reduced transaction costs for the
Government. The analytic and advisory activities of the partners also complemented the Bank’s own
knowledge base and fed into the DPL policy actions.

In addition, the following factors were identified during the second DPL series, which also affected
the implementation of the DPL program:

The global financial crisis. The DPL 5 was presented to the Board when Indonesia was coping with
the ramifications and contagion effects of the global financial turmoil. Although Indonesia came into
the crisis in a relatively strong position, GDP growth still declined from 6 percent in 2008 to 4.5
percent in 2009, and foreign direct investments almost halved from US$9.3 billion to US$4.9 billion
during the same period. Nevertheless, the Government had urgently taken a number of precautionary
and proactive measures, including those aimed at minimizing the vulnerability of the financial system
and reducing budget financing pressures by requesting the contingent World Bank DPL-DDO.
Altogether, these proved to be positive measures that helped further the DPL program reform agenda.
The DPL-DDO in particular was instrumental in advancing and/or expediting policy actions that were
envisioned as part of the ongoing DPL series, particularly those that helped maintain critical public
expenditures and reassure investor confidence.

The political transition period. The 2009 legislative and presidential elections had expedited the
earlier processing of DPL 6, compared with the usual DPL delivery schedule. Moreover, the new
Government’s robust and well-articulated reform agenda, as defined in its 100-day action plan, Inpres
No.1/2010 and the RPJMN 2010-2014, led the team to close the second DPL series one year earlier
than envisioned and start a new series (DPLs 7 to 9), better aligned with the priorities of the new
government. Because of this early termination, in some cases the originally envisaged outcomes were
not yet achieved at the end of the DPL series. Nevertheless, the unfinished reform agenda will
continue to be pursued under the subsequent DPL series, and with a new vigor, given the new
Government in place and the potentially strong alignment with its reform priorities.

Evolving Government and Bank priorities. While the Government and Bank partnership has been
strong overall, in some cases, the priorities of both parties shift and/or evolve. This sometimes led to
diminishing DPL policy actions. For instance, under the poverty alleviation and service delivery
pillar, the priorities shifted from raising the quality of public education towards improving the
targeting of the poor under social protection and human development programs.

Political sensitivities of certain reform agenda. The second DPL series initially supported
bureaucracy reforms under DPL 5, through the initiation of reforms in the Supreme Court and State
Audit Agency, and continued implementation of reforms within the MoF. However, at DPL 6, no
further follow-up actions were identified, not only because it was not clear as to when and how GoI
intended to expand the reforms, but also because it seemed unfeasible to expect major revisions in the
associated legal framework during an election year. Therefore, it was decided that bureaucracy
reforms were better supported through other Bank instruments, such as AAA.

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

As in the previous series, the second DPL series continued to be monitored based on continuous
dialogue with government counterparts. The task teams’ field presence enabled the DPL program
to be monitored continuously. Task teams communicated closely with government counterparts in
developing policy actions and assessing progress and bottlenecks, benefiting also from the synergies
offered by other Bank activities, e.g. investment projects, technical assistance and AAA. More
organized policy dialogue sessions were also held, in order to bring about more coordinated
discussions, which was particularly useful in resolving cross-cutting, multi-sector policy issues. A
monitoring and results framework was developed for DPL 5, which included a series of quantitative
indicators with baseline data and was further developed for DPL 6.

                                                                                                      6
The Government also strengthened its monitoring and evaluation efforts through the
establishment of a new Presidential Delivery Unit (UKP4). Upon taking office, the new
Government established the UKP4 unit to monitor and evaluate the implementation of ministerial
programs, in the context of the 100-day action plan, Inpres No.1/2010 and the RPJMN 2010-2014. To
date, the new unit has demonstrated both energy and success in performing its task, particularly in
monitoring the government’s performance towards delivering their policy output targets as listed in
Inpres No.1/2010 by the end of 2010, thereby helping to sustain the new Government’s reform
momentum.

2.4.   Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operations (if any)

DPL 7 will begin a new, third series of annual single-tranche loans (DPLs 7 to 9), although still
anchored under the FY09-FY12 Country Partnership Strategy. The new DPL series is expected to
continue and deepen reforms along the same objectives and pillars of the two preceding DPL series,
namely investment climate, public finance management, and poverty alleviation and service delivery.
Indeed, these pillars are prominently featured in the new Government’s priorities, as outlined in the
100-day action plan, Inpres No.1/2010 and the RPJMN 2010-2014. While the triggers identified in
previous operations for DPL 7 were the basis for discussion with GoI, the DPL prior actions are
reflective of the new emerging priorities (consolidation and improvements of anti-poverty programs,
results orientation in the budget, improving logistics within Indonesia).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The second DPL series had relied largely on the task team’s dialogue and engagements with the
Government in all three DPL policy areas (investment climate, PFM, and poverty alleviation and
service delivery). As such, the Government’s own reform agenda fed significantly into the objectives,
design and implementation of the second DPL series. This is reflected in the fact that all three policy
areas feature prominently in the development plans prepared by the new government (the 100-day
action plan, Inpres No.1/2010 and the RPJMN 2010-2014).

This series supported key GoI reforms to cope with the ramifications of the financial crisis, through
the strengthening of the Financial Sector Stability Forum or enhancing GoI’s ability to use fiscal
policy as a demand management by improving budget execution. At the same time, it also helped
keep the focus on the medium term development agenda at the time of the crisis, through the
development of a revised budget program structure that was more results oriented or laying the
foundation for improved targeting of government anti-poverty programs.

The DPL series may at times include prior and benchmark actions that seem incremental in nature,
rather than critical policy decisions. However, these actions often represent the outcome of
deliberations and represent the policy consensus that is necessary to move forward in the reforms
being supported by the DPL. Many actions were necessary to allow the DPL series to lay the
groundwork for longer-term reforms and to sustain government ownership.

The second DPL series is also featured prominently in the FY09-12 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Indonesia that went to the Board in September 2008. The CPS proposed that the DPL series
continue to be at the center of the WBG support in strengthening Indonesia’s central government
institutions and systems, a key cross-sectoral engagement theme under the CPS. Within the DPL
framework, the investment climate pillar is aligned with the CPS objective of enhancing the
environment for private sector development to foster accelerated growth and poverty reduction, and
strengthen competitiveness and inclusiveness. The public finance management pillar supports another

                                                                                                     7
key CPS objective of strengthening central government institutions and systems through increasing
accountability and transparency in government financial management and enhancing public finance
management and governance to increase the development impact of priority budget expenditures.
Finally, improving the institutional capacity to better target poverty alleviation and service delivery is
critical in order to achieve the CPS objective of more efficient service delivery to reduce poverty
levels and improve equity.

The CPS recognized that the DPL program has helped the Government’s efforts to reduce inefficient
public expenditures, strengthen tax administration and debt management, enhance the competitiveness
of the financial sector and implement governance and fiduciary reforms. Underpinned by a large
AAA program co-financed by development partners, the DPL program has also supported key
reforms to improve the business climate and service delivery. The CPS envisioned that the next
generation of DPLs would build on strong relationships with the reform-minded economic ministries
and continue to support the central Government in strengthening effectiveness of its systems. This
includes efforts to reduce inefficient public expenditures, strengthen tax administration, enhance the
overall business climate and strengthen poverty alleviation and service delivery.

Overall, the second DPL series’ objectives, design and implementation are highly relevant and
consistent with the Government’s reform priorities and with the ongoing Bank partnership strategy for
Indonesia.

3.2.   Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Achievement of Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

The second DPL series has helped the Government in progressing towards achieving its
medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives. Despite the fact that the series was
terminated one year earlier than envisaged, significant accomplishments were made in the three policy
pillars. In investment climate, the DPL helped reduce uncertainties for investors to invest in Indonesia
by continuing to push for reforms through the revision of the investment negative list, implementation
of one-stop shops (PTSP) and rollout of the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW). It has also
strengthened the tax administration through key regulatory reforms aimed at reducing compliance
costs, enhancing taxpayer services and improving the efficiency and equity of the tax administration.
In public finance management, the governance and transparency of public spending was significantly
improved, through various improvements to the budget formulation and execution systems. These
include the establishment of a comprehensive Treasury Single Account regime and an automated
SPAN system; the initial operation of the newly established LKPP as a national public procurement
agency; and the issuance of various regulations and trainings for improved government accounting
practices. In poverty alleviation and service delivery, the necessary groundwork for longer-term
reforms has been laid by institutionalizing a government system for program evaluation within
Bappenas and initiating the process of establishing a uniform database that will be used by various
implementing agencies to develop poverty program beneficiaries list.

Investment Climate

Rating: Satisfactory

By mid-2010, investment flows into Indonesia were already on their path to recovery after the
severe slump in 2009. FDI inflows totaled US$9.3 billion in 2008 according to Bank Indonesia
statistics, but halved in 2009 as the global financial crisis and economic downturn limited investment
flows globally. However, by mid-2010, FDI inflows increased substantially to US$4.87 billion or
about half of the peak investments in 2008, indicating their path to recovery. Evidently, firms are
scaling up investments with the global economic recovery and improved long-term financing

                                                                                                        8
conditions. This, together with the Government’s renewed focus on improving the investment climate
in general, has helped boost investment flows to Indonesia.

While the second DPL series helped Indonesia in improving investment climate, much remains
to be done. The second DPL series had supported key policy actions that are aimed to reduce barriers
to investments, through improving the investment regulations such as the one-stop shops (PTSP) and
negative investment list, reducing the time and costs for importing and exporting through the piloting
of the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW), strengthening the tax administration regulation and
systems, establishing the Financial Sector Stability Forum to reduce the vulnerability of the financial
system and improving MSME financing schemes. However, much remains to be done to further
improve the investment regulatory framework, streamline licensing and approvals, expand the INSW
implementation, modernize the core tax administration system and address the high logistics costs
within the country overall. Reforms in these areas will continue to be supported under the next DPL
series.

The Doing Business Survey 2010 indicated an improvement in Indonesia’s overall investment
climate. As of 2009, Indonesia ranked 122 out of 183 countries, up from 129 out of 181 countries in
2008.1 In particular, double-digit jumps were made in the categories of: (i) registering property,
wherein the time to register property was slashed from 39 to 22 days, thanks to the time limits
introduced for standard procedures at the land registry; (ii) protecting investors, with the strength of
investor protection index improved from 5.7 to 6, as disclosure requirements for related-party
transactions were expanded; and (iii) starting a business, wherein Indonesia’s ranking improved from
171 (near the bottom ranking globally) to 161, with the number of procedures, time and cost of
starting a new business significantly reduced.2 This overall positive development was attributed to the
eased incorporation and post-incorporation processes for new business registration by introducing
online services, eliminating certain licenses, making the registry more efficient and cutting company
deed legalization fees, publication fees, registration fees and business license fees.

Following the passage of the Investment Law in March 2007, the second DPL series has
consistently supported the issuance of follow-on regulations that aim to clarify investments
restrictions in Indonesia, specifically the investment negative list (DNI). Initially, the DNI was
revised in July 2007, making it more detailed and comprehensive than previous negative lists, and
hence more transparent. However, the revised 2007 DNI introduced new restrictions in key sectors
such as telecommunications, health, shipping, ports, logistics, pharmaceuticals and insurance. It also
failed to clarify issues relating to how incumbent investors in these sectors would be treated — the so-
called grandfathering clause. In response to concerns raised by the industry, the Government
committed in 2008 to further simplify the list and address specific shortcomings that had led to
uncertainty regarding Indonesia’s investment law. Such effort was prolonged under the second DPL
series, and just recently bore fruit. Following a series of discussion with stakeholders, including the
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) and international business chambers, a new
Presidential Regulation No. 36/2010 on the DNI was issued on 25 May 2010.3 As a single document
containing all restrictions on investment, the regulation has improved legal clarity and opened up
some sectors to foreign investment. However, overall, changes in foreign equity limits are relatively
minor and the benefits of the newly issued DNI will be limited to the legal clarity provided.

Regulatory reforms have also been undertaken that laid the basis to implement longer-term
reform efforts that help simplify and streamline investment procedures. As another follow-on
regulation to the 2007 Investment Law, the Government also issued an implementing regulation
(PerPres No. 27/2009) that authorizes the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) to

establish one-stop shops (PTSP), along with an electronic information and licensing service. In the
longer run, the PTSP mechanism will enable a more simplified and online processing of domestic or
foreign company’s licensing and approvals, at the sector and provincial/district level. The
implementing regulation also allows ministries and central government agencies to turn over or
delegate their authority to issue business licenses to BKPM, thereby allowing a more streamlined
central government approval or licensing procedures for domestic or foreign investments.

The time required to set up a business continued to decline, signaling that the DPL-supported
investment regulatory reforms are on the right track. The Doing Business Survey showed that as
of 2009, it took about 60 days to incorporate and register a new business, before it could legally
operate. This is a significant reduction from 2007, when the indicator was at 105 days. Among the
more cumbersome and lengthy procedures involved are: (i) registering with the Company Register
(Ministry of Trade) and obtaining a registeration certificate (TDP) (15 days); (ii) application to the
Ministry of Law and Human Rights for approval of the deed of company establishment (14 days); and
(iii) registering with the Ministry of Manpower (14 days).

Various regulatory reforms have also been introduced to strengthen the tax administration
following the passage of the Tax Administration Law in 2007. Implementing regulations were
issued by the Directorate General of Taxes to support the Tax Administration Law’s effort of striking
a better balance between the rights and obligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax officials. These
new regulations clarified and provided certainty in the administrative procedures for the taxpayers to
comply with the law, as well as for the tax officials to provide services to the taxpayers. The DG
Taxes has also required the tax offices to report on a quarterly basis the average time to process
taxpayer registration, VAT refunds, tax objections, exemptions of witholding tax on imports, and
property tax reliefs. Furthermore, DG Tax decrees were issued to allow for the roll-out of e-
registration and e-filing for taxpayers: (i) to allow recognition of digital signatures for individual
taxpayer registration and for filing personal income tax returns; and (ii) to implement new, simplified
standard format for financial information.

The groundwork for Indonesia’s National Single Window (INSW) has been put in place, which
will help reduce the time and cost for importing and exporting activities. After two years of pilot
implementation, the INSW has helped increase the reliability and transparency of the decision-making
processes at customs. The INSW facilitated the initial electronic submission of licensing applications.
Customs and other government agencies have also enhanced their supervision and monitoring
capabilities over trade transactions. In addition, INSW has facilitated the development of a
comprehensive database of trade regulations (Lartas). A fully operational INSW should benefit the
private sector through more efficient customs release and clearance of goods, as it allows single
submission, single processing and single approval of import/export documents, which involve 36
different government agencies. Currently, about half of these government agencies have been taking
part in the INSW with customs as the temporary operator until a more permanent structure is to be put
in place in 2012.

The DPL program has contributed to reducing the vulnerabilities of the financial system.
Establishment of the Financial System Stability Forum (FSSF) has formed the basis for the financial
sector safety net, which called for an integrated system to supervise the financial sector and a
framework for closely monitoring financial sector stability. Through a joint decree between the MoF,
BI and LPS (the deposit insurance agency), the FSSF was established in June 2007 to serve as a venue
for coordination, cooperation and information exchange among the authorities responsible for
safeguarding financial system stability in Indonesia. Teams were also established under the FSSF to
develop a financial system crisis management protocol, scenarios for crisis simulation exercises and
early warning indicators for various sub-sectors. Indeed, the FSSF played a crucial role during the
financial system turmoil, particularly in addressing systemic risks and taking swift actions towards
resolving insolvent banks through joint policies and decisions. At the end of the DPL series, the
financial sector was in good health overall, with non-performing loans falling from 3.2 percent in


                                                                                                    10
2008 to 3.0 percent in mid-2010 and capital adequacy ratio increasing from 16.76 percent to 18.06
percent during the same period.

The DPL has contributed to improved MSME access to finance. With suppport from the DPL, the
Government has rationalized MSME financing schemes across line ministries and state-owned
enterprises. Regulatory reforms were also introduced that allow for the legal establishment of national
and provincial credit guarantee and re-guarantee institutions, and clarify the legal status of these
institutions, their ownership structures, reporting mechanisms and investment options. These positive
developments contributed to the growth in proportion of MSME loans to banking sector loans, from
50.4 percent in mid-2008 to 52.7 percent in mid-2010, even at a time of financial turmoil which tends
to have more adverse effects on MSMEs.

Public Finance Management

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Since the adoption of a new regulatory framework in 2003/44, the Government has shown strong
commitment towards building a modernized, state-of-the-art public financial management
system, and to this end has embarked on a broad-based and ambitious PFM reform agenda. The
Government has been undertaking remarkable efforts to improve business processes and systems
throughout the entire budget cycle, from budget formulation and execution, accounting and auditing
of expenditures to civil service reform. It has also addressed a multitude of risks related to capacity
constraints, poor infrastructure, and weak governance across the wide PFM institutional and
stakeholder landscape. In the medium to long term, it is expected that these system improvements will
lead to more targeted and flexible allocation of public funds to development priority needs and more
efficient, transparent and accountable disbursements. This achievement is fundamental to improving
public service delivery and enhancing development outcomes.

The breadth and depth of PFM reform achievements over the short reform period have been
remarkable. The most notable ones include the introduction of performance based budgeting;
procurement of an integrated financial management information system (IFMIS); the staged
implementation of a Treasury Single Account (TSA); the establishment of cash forecasting capacity in
the Treasury; the development of accounting standards to provide for a “cash towards accrual?
accounting framework; the on-going inventory of government assets; the establishment of a new
public procurement agency; and improvements of internal controls and internal and external audit
systems.

The second DPL series supported the establishment of a comprehensive Treasury Single
Account (TSA), thereby consolidating and improving cash management of public finances.
Under DPL 5, the Treasury in cooperation with BI has implemented the daily sweep of government
revenue deposits from collecting branches of the 15 largest commercial banks and post offices into the
TSA. This is a significant improvement from the previous practice established since 1989 of
sweeping the revenue accounts twice a week. Under DPL 6, the daily sweeps were expanded to all
commercial bank branches. Ultimately, the overall consolidation minimized idle government cash
balances and encouraged better operational cash planning by government institutions, thereby
substantially improving central government budget and cash management.

Substantial progress has been made towards the implementation of an Integrated Financial
Management System, the SPAN project. Once fully implemented, SPAN is expected to overcome
the existing system fragmentation and weaknesses in the multitude of financial data processing
applications used by government institutions, by providing an integrated, more robust and secure
system that is aligned according to business functions. Under SPAN, government budget execution is

expected to be streamlined through improved management of budget authority, thereby smoothening
budget implementation and execution. Since 2008, progress in procuring the SPAN turnkey solution
has been substantially accelerated, with evaluation of bids completed in February 2009 and contract
signed in mid-2009. A new Treasury Transformation Directorate, which will focus on SPAN
implementation, has been established and ministerial decrees establishing a project governance
system for SPAN have been issued. DG Treasury has also completed the procurement of major
consultancy related to the Business Process Improvements, which feeds into the SPAN project.

To improve the results orientation of the budget process, the Government has developed a
revised program structure for the RPJMN 2010-14, with measurable results and targets. The
revised program structure marked the launch of performance-based budgeting (PBB) and medium-
term expenditure framework (MTEF) implementation by all line ministries and ministry-level
agencies, with the RPJMN 2010-2014 and Renstra-KL to form the basis for the FY2011 budget
preparation process. The newly revised structure was indeed incorporated in the RPJMN 2010-14,
with corresponding key performance indicators, and will be used as the basis for development of
budget ceilings starting in FY2011. Implementation of the revised program structure will continue to
be supported under the third DPL series.

The DPL series has strengthened the regulatory framework that allowed for improved
government accounting practices. Under DPL 5, two MoF regulations were issued: (i)
PMK171/2007 on accounting systems for line ministries emphasizing the responsibility of ministers
for recording the budget allotment in their ministries, requiring the reporting of receivables, payables
and investments in line ministries’ financial statements and introducing new accounting sub-systems
into the treasury accounting system; (ii) PMK91/2007 on the standard chart of accounts, harmonizing
the budgeting and accounting codes. In addition, over 3,185 accounting staff at line ministries were
trained on the changes implied by the new regulations. Altogether, these actions laid the basis for
enhancing the accountability of line ministries and improving the quality of line ministries’ financial
statements.

The legal framework establishing Lembaga Pengembangan Kebijakan Pengadaan Pemerintah
(LKPP) or the National Public Procurement Office was enacted in 2008. DPL 5 supported the
establishment of the new institution, which reports directly to the President and is responsible for
sustainable, integrated, focused and coordinated planning and development of strategies/
policies/regulations associated with the procurement of goods/works/services using public funds.
Efforts to ensure that LKPP is fully operational continued, as supported also by the Indonesia:
Strengthening Public Procurement Program, as well as AusAID-funded technical assistance.
Throughout the DPL series, the Government also continued to improve the regulatory framework for
public procurement by advancing the revision of the Keppres No.80/2003 on procurement, which
mandated the use of national standard bidding documents to be used by all public agencies.

The DPL has helped the Government in advancing bureaucracy reforms within various
government agencies. Under DPL 5, such reforms were: (i) initiated in the Supreme Court and BPK
under the aegis of the National Committee for Bureaucracy Reform chaired by MenPAN, and
monitored by KPK; (ii) continued to be implemented within the MoF with the introduction of new job
descriptions and a new grading scheme, the allocation of all positions to one of 27 grades, and salary
increases based on an extra allowance determined by the new job descriptions and grades; (iii)
expedited through the initial development of a new human resources information systems in MoF.

Poverty Alleviation and Service Delivery

Rating: Satisfactory

The poverty alleviation and service delivery pillar has been reprioritized, as the Government
began to shift its focus from enhancing service delivery to making public expenditures more
pro-poor. This shift was largely driven by the growing recognition that critical reforms needed to be

                                                                                                     12
pursued to enhance the delivery and effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs, and maximize the
impacts of increased funding to such programs. For instance, in 2006, it was reported that the cash
transfer program (BLT) had inclusion and exclusion errors of 8 and 22 percent, whereas the Rice for
the Poor Program (Raskin) subsidy received by non-poor was 2.5 times that received by the poor. As
a result, throughout the DPL series, the Government continued to push ahead for reforms aimed
towards enhancing the targeting of the poor under social protection programs, specifically through
the initial establishment of a uniform database and poverty targeting, and continued use of poverty
targeting in the adjustment of size of block grants under the PNPM program.

Under the DPL series, the Government has institutionalized a system for program evaluation
within Bappenas. The evaluation system focused largely on sector evaluation, regional evaluation,
and systems and reporting of development performance. In this regard, a workplan has been
developed and workshops held with regional governments, line ministries and other units, in order to
reflect international best practices in establishing and mainstreaming a M&E function within the
government bureaucracy.

The process of establishing a uniform database and improving the targeting of the poor was
launched. Such process was launched by BPS through: (i) updating the household registry data that
were used for the earlier implementation of the cash transfer program (BLT) in 2005; (ii) adopting a
better PMT system to identify poor households; and (iii) piloting experiments in 24 villages in four
kabupaten (Muara Enim, Pontianak, Gowa and Tangerang) in May 2008, to inform the optimal design
of mechanisms to identify and target poor households.

The DPL 5 supported the Government’s introduction of incentives for teacher certification and
relocation to remote areas. Ministerial Decree No. 18/2007 was issued by the Ministry of National
Education, which required all teachers to deliver 24 teaching hours per week in order to receive the
professional allowance for certified teachers. In addition, teachers receiving the special area
allowance are required to fulfill the 24-teaching-hour requirement. Subsequently, the World Bank
support to the Ministry of National Education towards raising the quality of public education was
continued through other programmatic initiatives, such as BOS-KITA.

The National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM Mandiri) was scaled up in terms of
geographical coverage and size of average block grant. By the end of 2009, the Government’s
flagship anti-poverty program reached all 6,400 sub-districts (kecamatan), of which around 4,500 are
located in rural areas. Central government funding for the entire PNPM was increased to Rp 10.3
trillion. The Government also introduced poverty targeting to determine the size of community block
grants so that the increased funds are allocated more effectively.

3.3.   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the DPL program has advanced highly relevant reform progress in the three pillars. Building
on a more stable macroeconomic base, the DPL focused on continuing the longer-term institutional
reforms initiated during the previous series. Most outcome indicators indicate that the DPL reforms
are progressing in the right direction, with reduced percentage of people living below the national
poverty line, reduced start-up time and number of procedures to start a business, a healthier banking
system and increase in MSME credit. However, in some cases, the results were not as expected for a
variety of reasons. For instance, the global crisis had caused slower GDP growth overall and reduced
foreign investments. It should also be noted that the DPL series was terminated one year earlier than
anticipated, as the DPL 7 was realigned with the new government priorities. While reforms in the
investment climate area have been successful as evidenced by improvements in several investment
climate surveys, reforms initiated are not complete yet and how successful they ultimately are will be
determined by ongoing implementation efforts.

3.4.   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

During the DPL series, the poverty headcount fell from 15.4 percent in 2008 to 13.3 percent in mid-
2010. However, many people remain poor and vulnerable, wherein about 32.5 million Indonesians are
still living below the poverty line and about half of all households remain clustered around the
national poverty line (Rp 200,262 per month). The gap between the poor and non-poor was also quite
significant, with the Gini coefficient, a measure of consumption inequality, at about 37 percent during
the same period. Regional disparities also persisted with eastern Indonesia lagging behind other parts
of the country, notably Java. Critical gender issues also remained, with the still high maternal
mortality (228 per 100,000 in 2009), and under-representation and lower wages in professional fields.

The DPL series helped address poverty and gender issues directly through: (i) institutionalizing an
M&E system for public expenditures and programs, to help strengthen accountability in policy
formulation and budget allocation processes; (ii) enhancing the pro-poor impact of social protection
and human development programs by improving the targeting of such programs; and (iii) completing
efforts to raise the quality of public provided education, which were initiated under the previous series
as public expenditures were reallocated from untargeted fuel subsidies; and (iv) improving the
investment climate and strengthening public financial management systems, which in the longer run
contribute to sustainable economic growth and reduction of poverty, including of women; and (v)
emphasizing the promotion of women’s participation under PNPM, with various initiatives to improve
gender equity and increase women’s participation, such as creating separate sub-project windows for
women, holding separate special meetings to discuss proposals originated by women and tracking of
gender data throughout project implementation


(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
       capacity and institutional development)

Significant reforms have been undertaken to strengthen various institutions across the three DPL
pillars. These include improving analytical capacity, enhancing efficiency through better technology
and more reliable and transparent reporting. These efforts are also complemented by other Bank
instruments, including investment projects, technical assistance and AAA.

In the investment climate area, the DPL series supported the following institutional strengthening or
establishment of: (i) up to 36 government agencies that were involved in the implementation of the
INSW, in granting permits or licenses for export or import; (ii) tax offices reporting on a quarterly
basis the average processing time for major taxpayer services; (iii) the Financial Sector Stability
Forum to help reduce the vulnerability of the banking sector; and (iv) the legal basis for provincial
credit guarantee companies and re-guarantee companies, through the issuance of Government
Regulation No.2/2008.

In public finance management, the DPL continued to strengthen Treasury’s capacity to implement the
Treasury Single Account system and modernized all provincial treasury offices (KPPN); enhanced the
accountability of line ministries by putting in place a more results-oriented program structure for the
RPJMN 2010-14 and budget submission templates for RKA-KL; supported the operationalization of
the newly-established LKPP through recruitment of staff and sufficient budget allocation; and
initiated bureaucracy reforms in the Supreme Court and BPK, and continued to implement those
within the MoF

In poverty alleviation and service delivery, the DPL institutionalized a government system for
program evaluation within Bappenas, supported BPS’s efforts towards establishing a unified database
and promoted the use of poverty targeting in the adjustment of PNPM block grants.


                                                                                                      14
(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

The continued policy dialogue under the DPL strengthened the knowledge base and allowed the
Government to move proactively in taking precautionary measures at the time of crisis. For instance,
teams were established to develop a financial system crisis management protocol, scenarios for crisis
simulation exercises, and early warning indicators for various sub-sectors. At the time of crisis, these
allowed the Government to quickly assess the vulnerability of the financial system, and enabled it to
swiftly request for the DDO-DPL, which was delivered to the Board only three months after the DPL
5 delivery. In turn, the DDO-DPL helped in restoring public confidence and advancing other policy
reforms, particularly under public finance management area. Without the DPL series, such quick
processing of the DDO-DPL would not have been possible.

NA.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

With strong commitment and ownership, the Government has demonstrated a track record in
undertaking successful reforms throughout the first and second DPL series. While many of the
reforms are unlikely to reverse, there is a slight risk that the extensive reforms initiated under the DPL
series so far may not be advanced further following the recent change in government counterparts, at
both the higher policy-making and the operational levels. Nevertheless, this risk is minimal, given that
most DPL reforms are driven by priorities that were developed and articulated formally through
consensus within the Government, rather than by individual government officials. Another risk is
Indonesia’s external vulnerabilities, wherein significant and rapid shifts in global financial market
sentiments may result in sudden, large and somewhat disruptive capital outflows, thereby reversing
the development impacts of the DPL-supported reforms. However, this risk has been lowered with the
significant improvements in the Indonesian macroeconomic framework in recent years, thereby
improving resilience to external shocks. Recent experience (in the last quarter of 2008 and more
recently in May 2010) has shown that Indonesia, while still vulnerable to large capital outflows, is
able to cope relatively well with turbulences in international financial markets, reversing previous
sentiments that Indonesia’s financial tend to overreact to turbulences in international markets.

Investment Climate (Moderate). The global financial crisis has revived protectionist sentiments in
many countries, including Indonesia. It remains to be seen whether these also translate into
protectionist policies. This could weaken the investment climate reforms that have been introduced,
particularly those aimed towards facilitating foreign investment and trade. External vulnerabilities
could also affect Indonesia’s attractiveness to investors, thereby undermining the results of investment
climate reforms that have already been introduced. Nevertheless, the reforms introduced to date are
promising in terms of providing greater clarity and reducing uncertainties surrounding investment in
Indonesia.

Public Finance Management (Low). The reforms achieved under the public finance management
area have been extensive and involved significant system and institutional investments and are
thereby unlikely to be reversed. The performance-based budgeting, the integrated financial
management information system and Treasury Single Account, for instance, have been established
and will be continued throughout the next DPL series.

Poverty Alleviation and Service Delivery (Low). With the reprioritization of the poverty and service
delivery pillar, there is an increased vigor within the Government towards enhancing the delivery and
effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs, and maximizing the impacts of increased funding to


                                                                                                       15
such programs. The recent establishment of a new poverty alleviation team under the Vice-
President’s office, which is a trigger for DPL 7, is also a promising sign.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The DPL series was well designed in response to Indonesia’s needs, as it evolved from a
macroeconomic stabilization towards longer-term development. While particular attention was paid to
the financial crisis in the preparation of this series, the focus continued to be on medium term
structural reforms, therefore ensuring that responses to the crisis did not jeopardize but rather
contribute to advancing the medium term reform agenda. The Bank worked closely with the
Government in mapping out the reform policy actions to be undertaken over the subsequent three
years. The existence of other Bank instruments, such as investment projects, TA and AAA — some of
which funded through trust funds — also allowed broad and intensive Bank engagement with the
Government, along with other development partners, thereby facilitating a strong knowledge base
when designing the DPL series at entry.

Close collaboration was also maintained with the Government of Japan/JICA and Asian Development
Bank. Both participated actively in the policy discussions during the preparation stage throughout the
DPL series. This allowed a more harmonized approach towards policy-based lending, more synergies
from other investment and technical assistance activities, and reduced transaction costs for the
government.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Given the DPL nature, all of the prior actions were fulfilled upfront in order for the loan to be
disbursed. Hence, the supervision of DPL mainly took place during the policy dialogue for the DPL
preparation. Such policy dialogue was conducted through the day-to-day communication between the
government counterparts and Bank technical teams, as well as a series of roundtable discussions
involving various government and Bank stakeholders. This facilitated substantive and continued
policy dialogue throughout the DPL series, during which key issues and obstacles to reforms were
addressed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performed well and supported the DPL in supporting reforms that were fully implemented
and produced desirable outcomes. The DPL series was delivered timely and, in the case of DPL 6,
even earlier than the usual delivery schedule. Strong dialogue was maintained with the Government
throughout the series, which ensured full ownership of the program, with active participation of the
Government of Japan/JICA and ADB. In addition, other Bank investment projects, TA and AAA also
provided synergies in terms of providing solid knowledge base in the design and implementation of
the DPL series.

5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

                                                                                                   16
Rating: Satisfactory

The DPL series’ supported reforms involved various government ministries/agencies. The investment
climate area involved BKPM, which was responsible for the DNI and PTSP; MoF DG Customs for
the INSW; and MoF DG Taxes for tax reforms. In public finance management, the following agencies
were involved: (i) MoF DG Budget and BAPPENAS for budget formulation; (ii) MoF DG Treasury
for budget execution systems; and (iii) LKPP for procurement issues. The poverty alleviation and
service delivery area involved Bappenas, BPS, the Coordinating Ministry for People’s Welfare and
the Ministry of National Education.

While the performance across different agencies varied, the overall commitment and ownership to
reforms is strong. Seeing the DPL as a useful tool, reform-oriented government officials have also
used the DPL series to strategically advance their reform agenda. Hence, the overall rating for
Borrower performance is Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

As the implementing agency, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) was
responsible for overall coordination and oversight of the DPL program. The CMEA, as in the previous
DPL series, performed very well in ensuring consistent and effective cross-ministerial coordination,
and was a key player in the success of the program. The CMEA also ensured that the a comprehensive
reform agenda is developed by the different agencies, and that any follow-up actions are taken by the
responsible agency in a timely manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall rating of the Borrower is Satisfactory. The Government was fully committed and
extended strong ownership over the program, providing the necessary resources and personnel to
facilitate the program. This was a key factor for the success of the program. Strong coordination
amongst the multiple Government ministries/agencies was also maintained throughout the DPL series,
which enabled the undertaking of critical and complex reforms.

6. Lessons Learned

Some important lessons have been learned over the course of the DPL program. These lessons largely
stem from the nature and evolution of the relationship between the Bank and the Government, and
also from the characteristics of the DPL program as a means of offering policy support, together with
the changing policy environment on the ground. Some of the lessons may be particular to the
Indonesian case because of the broad scope and depth of the Bank’s engagement with the
Government, and the range of resources that the World Bank program in Indonesia has available.

Key lessons learned from the previous series and reaffirmed during this DPL series:

   Strong Government ownership and committed counterparts are vital for the DPL program
    to help accelerate key reforms. Given their complexities and significant effects over the way the
    Government works, policy reforms should be driven by the Government and not development
    partners. Furthermore, the pace and scope of reforms should also be driven by the judgment and
    tactical sense of the key government counterparts on whether or not those reforms are
    bureaucratically or politically feasible. The DPL program has been successful in ensuring
    Government ownership and committed government counterparts through strong dialogue and

                                                                                                  17
    broad engagement. In areas where policy consensus is still evolving, the pace and scope of
    implementation may seem more modest than desired, but their very inclusion in the DPL-
    supported agenda maintains a focus on the policy issue, prompts on-going deliberation of policy
    options, strengthens the resolve of reform champions, and may eventually lead to reform
    breakthroughs. Indeed, the DPL is useful not only as a financing instrument, but more as a tool for
    accelerating the Government’s own critical reforms overall.

   Constant collaboration and dialogue between the Government and the Bank continued to be
    fundamental for the success of the DPL program. The Bank’s strong field presence continued
    to facilitate constant collaboration and dialogue with the Government, not only on the DPL but
    also on other engagements that provide synergies with the DPL. Such collaboration and dialogue
    also benefited from the involvement of key reform champions, both within the Government and
    the Bank, who were able to complete actions in the timeframe agreed upon and ensure the
    successful delivery of the DPL program.

   Mapping out a reform program provides meaningful direction and substantive results down
    the road, but a degree of flexibility is still needed, especially to ensure sustained government
    ownership. Compared with the first, the second DPL series was more systematic in adopting a
    multi-year strategic frame for the program, and laying out a basic mapping of the reform program
    that more specifically describes the end goals. While the initial mapping out of a detailed strategy
    and a multi-year agenda under each of the various DPL reform aims allowed a more strategic
    consideration of what the most critical next reform steps might be, ensuring sustained
    Government commitment to furthering the various reform objectives was even more critical.
    Indeed, institutional and policy reforms are usually complicated and involve unpredictable
    undertakings. Such reforms often need to go through a trial and error process, where there may be
    the occasional dead-ends that require backtracking and finding an alternate route. Hence a degree
    of flexibility should be maintained, so that when the right opportunity presents itself, reforms that
    had otherwise been apparently slow can be supported and advanced more rapidly.

In addition, some new lessons were learned under this second DPL series, which are beneficial for
future DPL operations:

   Continuous DPL dialogue strengthened the Government’s knowledge base, which in turn
    allowed more proactive and swift measures to be taken at a time of crisis. The continued
    policy dialogue under the DPL has strengthened the knowledge base and allowed the Government
    to move proactively and take precautionary measures at the time of crisis. Establishment of the
    FSSF, for instance, has formed the basis for the financial sector safety net and allowed the
    Government to swiftly address systemic risks in the financial system. The Government was also
    able to proceed quickly in requesting for the DDO-DPL, which eventually helped in restoring
    public confidence and advancing other policy reforms, particularly those under public financial
    management and investment climate. Had the DPL been non-existent, the swift resolution of the
    financial systemic risks and quick delivery of the DDO-DPL at the time of crisis would not have
    been possible.

   The reclassification of policy actions — into prior and benchmark actions — allowed a more
    prioritized and programmatic approach. While DPL 5 is very much a continuation of the first
    DPL series’ medium-term institutional efforts, the indicative DPL 5 triggers identified at the
    preparation of DPL 4 were reassessed, then reclassified into prior and benchmark actions that
    signify progress towards longer-term reforms. Indeed, some benchmark actions that may appear
    incremental at face value are actually steps that need to be taken before more substantive reforms
    can take place. Hence, the reclassification of actions allowed more priority and focus over the
    more critical, key prior actions, while still acknowledging the Government’s pace and scope of
    reform process. This not only helped in ensuring a sustained Government ownership, but also in
    mapping out a more comprehensive, multi-year strategic frame for the program.


                                                                                                      18
    DPLs are only one instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted
     engagement, and the choice of instrument should be contingent on the issue, the political
     context and the institutional circumstances. This is particularly applicable in the Indonesian
     case because of the size and scope of the World Bank program in Indonesia. The Bank program
     in Indonesia is one of the largest of any country in terms of number of staff and overall resources.
     Large teams are working closely on a daily basis with government counterparts at often very
     senior levels on a wide range of issues from public financial management and trade and
     investment, finance, public expenditures and poverty. In this context, the DPL is not the only
     instrument for supporting reform, but rather complementary to other instruments such as
     investment projects, TA and AAA.

Comments provided by JICA

The World Bank thanks JICA for providing their views on the results achieved in this DPL series as
well as areas where improvements can be made (see Annex 5 for JICA comments on this ICR). The
World Bank team would like to provide the following comments to some of the issues raised by JICA:

Reflect the voices of the private sector and the poor. This is already being done, although not
necessarily through surveys conducted explicitly to evaluate the DPL program. The design of the
program is based on analysis that identified key constraints both for private sector development as
well as poverty reduction, and many of the reforms being supported aim at addressing those
constraints. The results framework being proposed also uses information collected through surveys to
assess results achieved through the implementation of these reforms.

Improve results framework to include targets/ goals. This has been addressed in the preparation of
the next series, with both baselines and targets identified for results by reform aim.

                              JICA Comments on ICR for DPL 5-6
                                                                                            2010.9.14

Overall, JICA considers the second DPL series achieved its objectives and we are proud to be part of
the DPL dialogue. Following are the some consideration for further improvement of DPL in future.

i)     Opinion of private sectors and the poor. In order to achieve further substantial
       improvement in investment climate and public service delivery to the poor, it is important to
       reflect the voices from private sectors (in case of Investment Climate) and the poor (in case of
       Poverty Alleviation).
ii)    Comprehensiveness. Policy actions should be mutually exclusive and collectively
       exhaustive, in order to realize substantial policy reform. In the field of investment climate
       improvement, JICA considers that it’s worth considering addressing issues related to
       intellectual property right, labor and SMEs in future. In addition to issues on trade and tax,
       those issues are also very important to for realizing investment climate improvement in
       Indonesia.
iii)   Involvement of stakeholders. In order to make actions under each policy aim more effective,
       involvement of all stakeholders is very important. In this respect, it might be worth
       considering the involvement of non-governmental institutions. For instance, the procedure of
       investment permission has been streamlined through efforts by the BKPM as we addressed in
       DPL 5-6. However, in order to realize substantial decrease in time for investment permission,
       the procedure by notary, which the BKPM is not responsible for, need to be also streamlined,
       and the DPL has not addressed this issue so far.
iv)    Cooperation for capacity development among donors. In order to realize the substantial
       reforms, the capacity development needs to be realized. In this respect, capacity building of
       local/implemental level officials is very important. The lack of such capacity building might
       undermine benefit to be potentially acquired by customers of government services through
       achievement of policy action(s). We could further promote our cooperation among donors
       with regard to capacity development for local/implemental level.
v)     Linkage between each action and output/outcome indicators. It is ideal if we could
       indicate achievement of each action leads to improvement of relevant indicator(s). In
       addition, it might be better for us to examine if we could set policy actions which contain
       numerous targets/goals.
vi)    Number of Policy Actions. Compared with DPL 1-4, the policy actions tend to be getting
       small-scaled in general, and at the same time that the number of policy actions tends to
       increase. If we could set policy actions to be large scale and the number of the actions to be
       limited, like at the first stage of DPL series, this will help reduce administrative cost of DPL
       and also promote substantial policies and institutional reforms through policy dialogue.
