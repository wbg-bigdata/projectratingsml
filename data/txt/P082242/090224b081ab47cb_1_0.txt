                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects findings from implementation support missions conducted in Nov-Dec 2012 and March 2013.

                         The Project is in its final stage, with the closing date of the original credit and the additional financing set for June 30, 2013. To date it has disbursed roughly 95% of the original Credit
                         (CR-4097) amount (XDR 12,657,169, or US$19,062,836 equivalent as of March 25, 2013). Under the Additional Financing Credit (CR- 4964), which became effective in January

                         2012, approximately 25% of the total credit (XDR 571,542, or US$860,795 equivalent as of March 25, 2013) has been disbursed.

                         Component 1: The component is progressing satisfactorily. As of March 14, 2013, US$950,000 of the original credit (CR-4097) had been disbursed (95% of the total for this
                         component) and US$860,000 of the AF (CR-4964) had been disbursed (86% of the total for this component). The Secretary of Social Development (SDS) has developed a plan for

                         the implementation of the country's Social Protection Policy, which was developed with civil society. The Secretary of the Presidency (SDP) is supporting studies on key social
                         protection topics (such as the use of subsidies, targeting, etc.) to build knowledge and capacity in government to make informed decisions about social protection policy and
                         programs. Both Secretaries are working to prepare transition strategies to prepare for the new government in 2014, including positioning the Social Protection Policy as well as tools
                         for social protection programs and policies (Unique Beneficiary Registry (Registro Unico de Beneficiarios, or RUB), etc.) at the national and local level. The RUB has registered nearly
                         1.4 million beneficiaries. The System for the Evaluation of Social Policies (SUEPPS) has been fully designed, but will not be able to be developed or implemented in full, due to the
                         limited funds (US$31,000) currently budgeted for this activity, so the SDS will focus on developing the first module (monitoring) using Project funds. The SDP and SDS are organizing
                         a regional forum on social protection to be held in early June 2013, addressing the institutionality of social protection.

                         Component 2: The component has disbursed approximately 90% of its total allocated amount and has continued to make progress in terms of both implementation and analysis. The
                         revised final report on the impact evaluation will be available in April 2013. An event to present results of this component, including the impact evaluation, a cost-benefit analysis of
                         the community-based nutrition program Atención Integral a la Niñez Comunitaria (AIN-C), experience introducing a pilot on early childhood stimulation, etc. will be held in May 2013.
                         A strategy to continue AIN-C activities after Project funding ends is being finalized and communicated to government. Currently, the Ministry of Health has absorbed a small
                         proportion of the personnel working with AIN-C at the regional level, with its own funds.

                         The Rapid Social Response Grant has made important progress, but recently, due to problems with budget incorporation in the national budget system, has had to halt activities until
                         budget becomes available (expected in early April 2013). Once the budget incorporation is processed by the government, the funds will be available for disbursement. The cell phone
                         technology component is functioning in six departments. Micronutrient supplements and machines to assess anemia at the community level are expected to be delivered by the end
                         of June 2013, with training beginning in April 2013.

                         Component 3: Under Cr. 4097, US$6,850,000 has been disbursed (about 92%) and under Credit 4964 funds have been not yet been disbursed because the implementation
                         arrangements changed. A restructuring was processed in March 2013 for the additional financing and it was agreed that the National Institute for Professional Training (INFOP) would
                         be the agency responsible for providing training for the First Employment Program (instead of the NGO CADERH, which provided services under the first three rounds of training).

                         Project restructuring: As mentioned above, the AF (CR-4964) was restructured in March 2013 to: (i) modify the training scheme of the First Employment Program (FEP) under
                         Component 3 and its implementing arrangements; (ii) revise one intermediate outcome indicator target to reflect those changes; and (iii) change one disbursement category to
                         facilitate disbursement for activities to strengthen institutional capacity for social protection under Component 1. The original Project (CR-4097) will be restructured by April 2013 to
                         reflect reallocation across expenditure categories.
