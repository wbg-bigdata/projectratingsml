                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to improve Honduras' social safety net for children and youth by: (i) strengthening the Government's capacity to administer social
                         assistance programs; (ii) improving nutritional and health status of young children by expanding the AIN-C program; and (iii) increasing employability of at-risk youth by
                         piloting a First Employment Program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects findings from a supervision mission conducted in April 2012, and subsequent videoconferences held with government implementing agencies between May  July
                         2012.

                         The Project is moving towards attainment of its development objectives. To date it has disbursed roughly 89% of the original Credit (CR-4097) amount (US$17,912,267). Under the

                         Additional Financing Credit (CR- 4964), which became effective in January 2012, US$300,000 has been disbursed (roughly 9% of the total amount).

                         Component 1: The component is progressing satisfactorily. The approved POA and PAC show that as of April 2012, all but US$60,000 of the remaining US$329,900 under the
                         component had been disbursed or committed. The government agency INE has completed the survey work to identify additional beneficiaries for the country's conditional cash

                         transfer (CCT) program; the Social Protection Policy has been formally approved by the Social Cabinet, and a Social Protection Technical Committee has been formed and charged
                         with elaborating an implementation strategy for it. The conceptual design of the System for the Evaluation of Social Policies has been completed; the Unique Beneficiary Registry
                         (RUB) design has been finalized and data collection has begun. Data from the RUB would be used as the basis for the selection of beneficiaries under Component 3; and the
                         consultancy to analyze subsidies is in the process of being contracted. The Secretary of the Presidency proposed, and the Bank agreed, to change the activities to be financed under
                         Component 1 of the Additional Financing Credit. Instead of funding the urban targeting methodology, they proposed undertaking studies on citizen participation in the CCT program;
                         the quality of services in education and health which are conditions of the CCT; and the articulation of the country's Social Protection Strategy into the National Agreement. Given that
                         the Government had already developed an urban targeting methodology by the time the Credit became effective, and the value these studies can impart to the design and
                         implementation of the country's CCT program, the Bank agreed to this change.

                         Component 2: The component has disbursed approximately 78% of its total allocated amount; however, the AIN-C results are mixed: the impact evaluation is back on track, with the
                         firm agreeing to re-analyze the data from the first measurement and second measurement is in process, while the third is yet to begin. The country has completed its Early Childhood
                         Development Policy, and has presented it to the Office of the First Lady. Collaboration between the central and regional levels has improved. The Rapid Social Response Grant
                         Agreement was countersigned by Government in June 2012 and the procurement plans for the acquisition of micronutrients and hemocues have been reviewed by procurement staff
                         and a proposal for moving them quickly has been reached between the Bank and government. The Early Childhood Development pilot has completed guidelines for facilitators and
                         monitors, and is compiling a report on the experience as well as a study on institutionalizing the program. Contracts for AIN-C staff have been signed and are valid through December
                         2012. However, there are continued weaknesses in the capacity of AIN-C staff to implement the program. Field trips reveal the need for improved supervision practices (including
                         improving the supervision checklist), and capacity to carry out financial management remains low (although there has been a recent improvement in procurement staff). Technical
                         staff also lacks pro-activity in resolving problems, including a recently revealed situation where children identified by the AIN-C team as malnourished are failing to receive
                         supplemental support, due to a lack of government resources. In terms of sustainability, while the team has hired a consultant to conduct a study to institutionalize the AIN-C program
                         within the Ministry of Health. As of June 30, three of four AIN-C service providers have ended their contracted services and the Project is in a transition phase for the provision of
                         services through trained regional personnel which are currently financed with counterpart funds. A minimum operating structure has been set in place to comply with basic
                         requirements for the provision of services.

                         Component 3: Under Credit 4097, all funds have been disbursed. Under Credit 4964, The Ministry of Labor has requested to change the implementation arrangements to using
                         INFOP (National Institute for Professional Training) to provide training instead of the NGO CADERH, in order to cut training costs and take on a larger role in supervision of training
                         programs. At the same time, it will strengthen the Ministry of Labor institutional capacity to assume its role in supporting the development of the labor market. Subscription of contract
                         with INFOP to carry out the fourth session of youth training is in process.
