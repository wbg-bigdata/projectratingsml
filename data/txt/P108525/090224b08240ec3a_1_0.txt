                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in establishing and institutionalizing an efficient and effective framework for formulating and implementing
                         sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity of public institutions responsible for the development and implementation of such policies to
                         formulate and carry out the policies. [Objective as reflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not different from the PAD but wordings are different.
                         The most important project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic policy development and decision making through establishing
                         strong inter-ministerial coordination and interface; b) support process of economic policy development and implementation through enabling public institutions (and
                         particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) to formulate sound and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of
                         employment practices and wages in the civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other main objectives are from the PAD but are
                         not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although broadly in line in substance ]

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project assessment remains moderately satisfactory. The project activities have been implemented as planned. The government has now established clear institutional
                         arrangements for coordinating and developing macroeconomic projections/scenarios. The Ministry of Economy has strengthened its capacity to develop and implement economic
                         policy measures and proposals, conduct regulatory impact analysis, and monitor and evaluate implementation of the anti-corruption program. The State Personnel Service has been
                         carrying out pay and grading reform measures in the civil service.

                         Component 1
                         At a technical level, the economic policy coordination mechanism has been satisfactory. The technical expert group, which includes representatives from the Ministry of Economy, the
                         Ministry of Finance, the PM’s office, the Central Bank, the Statistics Committee, and the Social Fund, supports the Coordination Council on Macroeconomic and Investment Policies
                         (CCMIP). The work of the technical group has satisfactorily ensured good coordination between the key government bodies at the technical level. As a result, the key government
                         bodies are able to produce agreed macroeconomic projections and scenarios more effectively and faster than it was before the start of the projection.

                         At a decision making level, the CCMIP appears to play a limited role in economic policy coordination largely because the government uses other established arrangements for it. The
                         meetings of the CCMIP were not regular. In 2013, the CCMIP only met three times, to consider the mid-term macroeconomic forecasts, the mid-term budget framework and the
                         partnership strategies of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. However, the government maintains adequate coordination through regular government meetings and
                         other meetings chaired by the Prime-Minister or Deputy Prime-Minister responsible for economic issues.

                         The Government institutionalized a mechanism for producing macroeconomic projections and scenarios. With its resolution No557 dated October 9, 2013, the Government approved
                         the financial programming model (a macroeconomic consistency framework) and a manual for using it. The financial programming model has now become the main tool for key
                         government bodies to produce agreed macroeconomic projections and scenarios.

                         Component 2
                         The current structure of the Ministry of Economy (MoE) enables it to adequately address the tasks assigned to the Ministry. The current structure was adopted in August 2013
                         reflecting new functions added to the Ministry and recommendations from functional review analysis conducted by a CBEM project consultant and USAID consultants. The Ministry
                         now has assigned staff to work on policy development, macroeconomic analysis and projections and anti-corruption policy. The ministry has also strengthened its strategic planning
                         function.

                         Analytical capacity of the policy development group has increased. The policy development group, with support from the CBEM consultants, developed analytical documents on
                         economic policy, governance, strategic planning and monitoring and evaluation system.

                         The MoE continues to strengthen its role in implementing and coordinating the government's anti-corruption action plan. The MoE has developed and approved:

                         i) a methodology on anti-corruption monitoring and evaluation system;
                         ii) a manual on monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the government's anti-corruption action plan (Order of the Minister of Economy, number 80, date d April 16, 2013);
                         and
                         iii) a methodology to help individual ministries and government agencies develop and implement their own anti-corruption programs (Order of the Minister of Economy, number 89,
                         dated May 6, 2013).

                         The MoE has made good progress in developing tools to produce and maintain a macroeconomic framework. With the support from the CBEM consultants, the MoE is now able to
                         maintain:
                         i)          the RMSM-X model;
                         ii)         a simplified financial programing model; and
                         iii) an inflation model.

                         In addition, CBEM consultants have developed a methodology for economic forecasting at the regional level.

                         The MoE’s capacity for tax policy development and public investment management remains weak. CBEM consultants have developed a tax and non-tax revenues forecasting model,

                         conceptual proposals on strengthening revenue policy, and recommendations on improving public investment management. However, the MoE's capacity remains weak. This is
                         partly due to lack of efforts to reach strong results in these areas. The MoE's senior management needs to put more efforts to strengthen the ministry's capacity before the closure of
                         the project.

                         The MoE has enhanced its capacity in regulatory impact analysis (RIA). A CBEM consultant, in cooperation with the MoE staff, prepared a new RIA methodology, which is expected
                         to be approved by a government resolution. In addition, the CBEM consultant prepared a manual to assess the quality of RIA.

                         Component 3
                         Outcomes under this component have been achieved. The Wage Reform Strategy for civil and municipal servants covering 2013-2020 and an action plan for its implementation have
                         been approved by the Government (Resolution number 383 dated June 28, 2013). The Government has also adopted standards for job descriptions and qualifying requirements in
                         the civil service, and regulation for assessing performance of civil servants. In addition, the President approved a new civil and municipal services registry (Order number 145 dated
                         June 26, 2013). These documents incorporate proposals and comments from ministries and government agencies collected during presentations and round tables conducted by the
                         state personnel service in May and June 2013.

                         macroeconomic framework has increased.

                         The Ministry of Economy has enhanced its capacity to:
                         i)      develop macroeconomic projections/scenarios;
                         ii)     prepare analytical documents related to economic policy, governance, strategic planning and monitoring and evaluation system; and
                         iii)    monitor and evaluate the implementation of strategic programs and plans.

                         The State Personnel Service (SPS) has developed a program for improving the wage system for civil and municipal servants during 2013-2020, and an action plan to implement the
                         program. The action plan is being implemented.
