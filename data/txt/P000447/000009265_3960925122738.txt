PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Rdport (PCR) for the Fourth Highway
Project in the Central African Republic for which Credit 1258-CA in the amount
of US$18.0 million was approved on June 8, 1982. The credit was closed and SDR
15,009.11 (approximately US$20,000) was canceled effective April 7, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Occidental and Central Africa Department, Africa Regional Office. It is based
on information in Association fi s, including supervision reports, interviews
with IDA staff, a project complerion mission to the CAR in July 1988.
This PCR has been read by the Operations Evaluation Department. The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments on November 6, 1990. No comments
were received.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT, CReDIT 1258-CA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A. Introduction
1.        The Third Highway Project was successful in improving the road link
between Bangui and Cameroon, but difficulties were encountered in executing the
limited maintenance program. However, CAR's Road Fund was restructured and made
financially autonomous.   The audit report stated that restructuring the Road
Fund, 'together with the substantial technical assistance included in the Fourth
Highway Project, should make it possible to develop and improve the institutions
in the road sector and enable the Government to begin to finance and execute road
maintenance on its own account."
2.        The project was designed to complement the activities already initiated
by FAC, FED, FRG and Japan (para. 1.03). The project was prepared in separate
packages in order to facilitate implementation, supervision and procurement so
that each donor could follow its own procurement regulations. In order to take
into consideration the lack of experience in the MTP, which had lost most of its
previously trained staff during the long period of the Bokassa reign, all of the
physical operations were to be carried out by contract under the control of
expatriate consultants.   An important component of technical assistance was
provided to assist MTP in implementing road maintenance works by force account.
B. Obiectives
3.        The project was designed to meet the immediate need in CAR for
rehabilitation of its economy. The priority road network was a key element in
the rehabilitation plan; but because of the severe financial and economic
difficulties in the country, rehabilitation works could not be accomplished
without foreign financing. The project included institutional development and
training components to hopefully ensure that the rehabilitated priority road
network could be maintained by CAR personnel and local funds.
C. Implementation Experience
4.        The project got off to a slow start, but it was substantially completed
within the appraisal schedule (para. 8.01).
5.        The physical components were completed satisfactorily, but apart from
the training of contractors and the transport studies, little progress was
achieved on institution building (para. 8.02).
6.        The Road Fund proved to be a most useful device for assuring funding
for the project. Given the circumstances, it was reasonably well managed and
contributed greatly to the success of the physical parts of the project
(para. 8.06).



- vi -
7.        The project was well prepared and supervised by IDA up to 1986 when
the momentum built up during the earlier years appears to have slackened because
of differences with the Government over the content of the follow-up project
(para. 8.08).
8.        The start up of the pro-ect was slowed by a -hange in country
leadership and by the unfamiliarity of new Government officiaAs with the project.
However, p-ogress later improved and the project was substantially completed
within the appraisal schedule.
D. Results
9.        The overall reevaluated rate of return for the rehabilitation works
is 112 as compared to the appraisal estimate of 29Z (para. 4.05).
10.       The consultants performed their technical tasks well but might have
made more of an effort in institution building, despite the problems of a poorly
motivated civil service.   Thus, little in the way of long-term progress in
institution building was achieved (para. 8.05).
11.       The Government, due to frequent changes in administration and in
staffing its MTP, lost an opportunity to benefit from the technical assistance
offered under the project (para. 8.07).
12.       The road rehabilitation, office building and transport study components
were satisfactorily executed. However, little in the way of long-term benefits
were achieved under the training and the technical assistance components, other
than the training of petty contractors and the transport studies.
E. Sustainability
13.       Given the problems facing CAR at the time the project was appraised
and the lack of trained personnel in all sectors, the project was probably too
ambitious in its expectations.  It will require decades of effort to rebuild
institutions in CAR and the project must be considered as the first of several
steps in that direction.
F. Findings and Lessons
14.       The Fourth Highway Project should be considered as a first step in
strengthening CAR's transport institutions. Lessons learned include: (a) where
weak executing institutions exist, consideration should be given by lending

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT, CREDIT 1258-CA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      According to the staff appraisal report for the Fourth Highway Project
the ability of the Central African Republic (CAR), a land-locked country, tu
trade competitively was hampered bv the large size of the country, the long
distances to the sea, and high transport costs. By 1982, these costs were still
high despite the efforts made unc,)r three previous IDA road projects and by
bilateral assistance to upgrade the road system. improve its maintenance and
strengthen the road administration.
1.02      According to the audit reports,  performance under the first two
projects was poor.   The Gavernment was unable to meet the necessary road
maintenance costs, equipment was used on non-project works, and the results of
the training were unsatisfactory. Performance of public institutions began to
deteriorate for political reasons.
1.03      The Third Highway Project was successful in improving the road link
betweer Bangui and Cameroon, but difficulties were encountered in executing the
limited maintenance program. However, CAR's Road Fund was restructured and made
financially autonomous.   The audit report stated that restructuring the Road
Fund, "together with the substantial technical assistance included in the Fourth
Highway Project, should make it possible to develop and improve the institutions
in the road sector and enable the Government to begin to finance and execute road
maintenance on its own account."
1.04      In the late 1970s, the Bank Group decided not to process any further
projects in CAR during the last years of the Bokassa regime because of its
adverse 9ffect on the country's economy. Soon after its fall in 1979, the Bank
allocated a credit of US$15 M for a highway project.   In order to speed up
project preparation, the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) offered to
provide technical assistance services to identify a possible scope of euch a
project, and IDA financed a feasibility study under PPF No. 137-CA.
1.05      At about the same time, FAC, the European Development Fund (FED) and
the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), had granted a total of US$6.9 M equivalent
for an emergency road rehabilitation program, and the Government of Japan had
supplied equipment for two ruad maintenance brigades.  The newly restructured
R.oad Fund was devoted exclusively to road maintenance financing. Its financial
autonomy was ensured by an earmarked levy on motor fuels amounting to 20 CFAF
per liter at the start of the project.   Management of the Road Fund was
strengthened by an advisor officially appointed to this function.
1.06      The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Regional  Planning  (MTP)  was
responsible for the execution of the project, except for the planning and studies
components which were the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation.
1.07      This report is based on information in IDA files including supervision
reports, interviews with IDA staff, and a project completion mission to the CAR
in July 1988.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The project was designed to complement the activities already initiated
by FAC, FED, FRG and Japan (para. 1.03). The project was prepared in separate
packages in order to facilitate implementation, supervision ard procurement so
that each donor could follow its own procurement regulations. In order to take
into consideration thie lack of experience in the MTP, which had lost most of
its previously trained staff during the long period of the Bokassa reign, all
of the physical operations were to be carried out by contract under the cor,trol
of expatriate consultants. An important component of technical assistance was
provided to assist MTP in implementing road maintenance works by force account.
2.02      Two  donor  conferences  were  held  during  the  period  of  project
preparation, and, finally, five donors participated in the financing of the
project for a total amount of US$26 H equivalent. These included the African
Development Fund (ADF), Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale (BDEAC), FAC, the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED), and the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Pund. IDA participation amounted to US$18 M
and the CAR local funding amounted to US$4.1 M equivalent. Each donor financed
a  separate  package  including  engineering  and  supervision  so  that  IDA's 8
involvement was limited to overall project coordination, and the supervision of
the IDA-financed components.
2.03      The project was appraised in May 1981, negotiated in May 1982, and
approved by the Board on June 8, 1982.  The IDA Credit Agreement provided a
cross-effectiveness condition with the KF and the ADF. Due to some constraints
on these funds, and, also, a lack of experience on the part of the Government
in processing their respective negotiations and Credit Agreements, the
cross-effectiveness clause was waived when it appeared evident that financing
from both sources appeared to be only a matter of time. The IDA Credit became
effective on January 24, 1983.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
2.04      The project was designed to meet the immediate need in CAR for
rehabilitaticn of  ts economy.  ,he priority road network was a key element in
the rehabilitation plan; but because of the severe financial and economic
difficulties in the country, rehabilitation works could not be accomplished
without foreign financing. The project included institutional development and
training components to hopefully ensure that the rehabilitated priority road
network could be maintained by CAR personnel and local funds.
2.05      The three-year project (1983-85) was a time slice of the Government's
extended program (1982-88) of rehabilitation and maintenance of the priority
network.   The project objective was to rehabilitate about one third of the
country's priority network to all-weather conditions, so as to remove the
physical hindrances and prepare the way for extended road maintenance in the
future. Other donors undertook rehabilitation of the rest of the roads in the
network.   By 1988, MTP's own staff, with financing from the Road Fund, was
expected to be capable of properly maintaining the rehabilitated roads.



-3-
2.06      The project consisted of:
(a) Rehabilitatior and Reconstruction of Roads
(i)     works by contract for rehabilitating 1,217 km of gravel roads
in the priority network and complementary works to be
executed by force account;
(ii)     repairs and resealing by contract of the Bangui-M'Baiki road
(102 km); and
(iii)     reconstruction by contract of the Bangui-Ymbi road (6.5 km);
(b) Consultant Services
to supervise the rehabilitation and reconstruction works in (a) above;
(c) Complementary Equipment Procurement and Renovation of buildinRs
(i)     procuring equipment to complement MTP's ro&d maintenance
brigades, and repairing and overhauling existing equipment;
and
(ii)     constructing and renovating buildings and other facilities
to support road maintenance and training facilities;
(d)  Technical Assistance
(i)     for executing road maintenance activities,  repairing and
overhauling equipment during the project life and aiding
institutional development;
(ii)     for  promoting  development  of  petty  road  maintenance
contractors in rural areas; and
(iii)     for promoting transport planning and conducting a study of
the trucking industry operations; and
(e)  Training
for filling both the immediate project needs and developing personnel
for handling key decision-making roles in MTP over the long term.
2.07      MTP, with the assistance of resident FAC experts, was to coordinate
the project with other ongoing and planned rehabilitation works under FAC, FED,
and FRG programs.   DGTP was to maintain  (routinely and periodically)  the
rehabilitated roads, with the works being financed through the Road Fund.
2.08      The project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1987.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Consultants prepared the tender documents for all road rehabilitation
works to be let by contract.  For the IDA-financed works, tender documents were
ready at the time of Board presentation and tender procedures were initiated
shortly thereafter. For the components financed by other donors, long delays
occurred.  The Government called for five tenders, one per dono;.  In most cases,
including the IDA component, the proposed contract awards were all proposed to
one firm. As most of these proposals were objected to by the donors, iincluding
IDA, the Government had to review its bid evaluations and selection criteria
which resulted in additional delays.
3.02      MTP was in charge of the technical design of the building construction
and renovation component. Due to MTP's poor technical and management capacity,
the last contract was awarded to a local firm, only in December 1986, three years
after the project started. The contract for the construction of the MTP office
building in Bangui had to be cancelled because of the poor performance of the
contractor. The offices ana workshop buildings were not completed until the end
of the project.
3.03      In 1983, shortly after a new Minister was appointed, structural and
geometrical design standards of the works already underway were unilaterally
raised. This decision led to a rapid draw down of the credit because it involved
higher than planned quantities of works. IDA decided not to disburse for the
supplementary works, and they had to be paid by the Road Fund. Upon further
review, IDA agreed that the original standards for the rehabilitation of the
gravel roads could be upgraded in view of the actual traffic, which was above
the appraisal expectations, and, in light of the uncommitted balance in the
credit account,  accepted some structural upgrading.   Also,  in view of the
substantial increase in the US dollar exchange rate, other donors agreed, within
the limits, either to upgrade their standards or, in the case of paved roads,
to extend the length of the roads to be rehabilitated or reconstructed.
3.04      The technical assistance program for developing small road maintenance
contractors was satisfactory, and an extension of this program is still underway.
According to the final supervision mission, the petty contractors trained during
the project are working well with labor intensive methods, but need to be
supplemented with seasonal mechanical grading and reshaping.   The mission
recommended that in order to increase the productivity of the petty contractors,
the best of them should be trained to do mechanical grading and reshaping. It
was also recommended that the training scheme should be extended to include
medium size contractors. Since small and medium size contractors are financially
vulnerable, they need strong support to help them contend with CAR's cumbersome
administrative procedures and the lack of assistance from the weak banking
sector.   These weaknesses have been overcome by the continuation of foreign
technical assistance which manages the group of petty contractors.
3.05      The consultants presented a study on transport planning and the
trucking industry operations which recommended that the state-owned transport
company should be privatized; this was eventually done under a later IDA project.
3.06      The training component was implemented with the assistance of about
90 mm of experts. In retrospect, the scope of this component was ambitious; it
was not possible to inculcate managerial attitudes through courses and training



-5-
in staff with a low educational level. Also, the chief of the Training C)-. r
was not sufficiently motivated to continue the work after departure of the
trainers. The program of fellowships and scholarships abroad financed by FAC
under its bilateral program, suffered the same problem.
3.07      The implementation schedule and costs of the road rehabilitation works
are shown in Table 1. Project costs as estimated at appraisal and completion
are shown in Table 2. The sources of financing at appraisal and completion are
shown in Table 3.
3.08      Fuel taxes were the main source of revenue for the Road Fund through
which road maintenance was financed. The annual 'evenue targets of the Road Fund
were regularly adjusted by law in accordance with. the Credit Agreement. At the
end of the project, the earmarked RF levy reached 50 CFAF per liter of fuel.
Unfortunately, most of the revenue was used on the rehabilitation of roads not
included in the priority network, instead of being devoted to the maintenance
of the priority network. At the end of the project, the total length of the
network to be maintained was about 6,000 km instead of about 3,000 km as
estimated at appraisal.
3.09      D.Lsbursements started off slowly but gradually caught up with the
appraisal estimate. The strong US dollar to the CFA franc enabled the inclusion
of more works than anticipated at appraisal.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
4.01      The economic analysis of the rehabilitation works carried out at
appraisal considered vehicle operating cost savings (80X to 90Z of total
benefits) and value added by increased cotton production for Kaga Bondoro-Sido
and Bossangoa-Bedaoyo. No data are available for Bossangoa-Bedaoyo, and it is
not included in the reevaluation.
4.02      This reevaluation is more conservative than the appraisal as it only
considers vehicle operating cost savings. With respect to cotton, the appraisal
report assumed a value added of US18¢/kg of lint in end-1980 prices. 1/ However,
no production costs were given for the area so it is not possible to assess
subsequent value-added per year based on the c.i.f. prices.   The table which
follows shows that the c.i.f. prices for lint have dropped appreciably since 1980
suggesting a somewhat lower growth, if any, for such value-added.
1/   Based on the c.i.f. price Pointe Noire-Europe.

1982                159.7
1983                185.4
1984                178.5
1985                131.8
1986                105.6
1987                104.8
1988                139.9
4.03       Traffic growth rates overall through 1986 exceeded those estimated at
appraisal (Table 3). However, the decline in cotton production (from 12,600 tons
in 1984 to 6,300 tons in 1988), the marketing problems for coffee, and the
decline in the production of logs (from 87,900 m3 in 1984 to 40,900 m3 in 1988),
plus the consequent demand for fewer consumer goods, led to a sharp fall in
traffic growth rates from 1986 to 1988.  While none of these commodities is
expected to reach its peak production of 1984/1985 by 1992, the estimates for
their growth are all positive. For the reevaluation, traffic growth is assumed
to be positive (roughly from 2.2? to 9.62) for all the project roads.
4.04      During the preparation of a follow-on project, vehicle operating costs
(Table 4) were found by the preparing consultant firm to be substantially higher
than those used for the appraisal. This may be explained by rising real costs
in part and, in part, by more detailed analyses. Nonetheless, the differences
are significant, as the following table comparing the VOCs for unpaved roads
shows.
Unpaved Roads -- Vehicle Operating Costs
(CFAF/km)
------ 1981 ------    ------- 1988 --------
Appraisal Estimate       Reevaluation
Good  Fair  Poor     Good   Fair   Poor
Pickup/Small Truck         -6    85   116      82.7  140.6  173.7
Medium Truck (7 ton)       90   102   145    181.8  236.1  409.0
Heavy Truck (12 ton)      200   224   330    308.8  442.4  860.4
4.05      The above suggests that the vehicle operating costs savings may have
been understated at appraisal as the 1986 estimates, e.g., for a medium truck,
going from a poor condition road to a good condition road gives a 247 CFAF
savings, while at appraisal, the savings are only 55 CFAF.   The reevaluation
considers the new costs, but applies a ratio similar to that implied in the
appraisal report to be more consistent with that analysis.   Based on these
assumptions, the overall rate of return for the rehabilitation works is 11l
compared to the appraisal's 29.5Z (Table 5). Costs exceeded those at aplraisal
(including physical and price contingencies) by about 25? and with the low



- 7 -
traffic growth rates, the llZ is a reasonable rate of return under these
circumstances.
V. CONSULTANTS' PERFORMANCE
5.01      The consulting firm which was in charge of the project preparation and
the feasibility studies was selected to implement the project. With regard to
the road and building works by contract, their performance was satisfactory.
MTP and MTCA received all necessary assistance in their relations with the donors
and the contractors, but they were not involved in direct project management
tasks. The consultant's team did not try to integrate itself into the MTP in
order to achieve some institutional building objectives. As a consequence, no
civil servants were trained in matters of project management, perhaps because
of their low educational level (para. 3.06).
5.02      As regards technical assistance, none of the consultants left behind
a more or less well trained CAP. national.   In many cases, extensions of the
consultant's contract were needed to fill the void created by their departure.
Finally, the contract for technical assistance which initially amounted to
381 mm, had to be amended to reach 568 mm in 1987. Some of the courses prepared
by the consultants were poorly designed. It can be concluded that the transfer
of knowledge was not achieved, and that this was in part due to the lack of
technical staff with vocational training abilities.
5.03      One exception to the above was the outstanding performance of the
advisor for the development of petty contractors (para. 3.04). He worked closely
with small contractors on the job and provided a range of assistance. He also
made a serious effort to develop local counterpart capacity to run the program
after his departure.
5.04      While the objective of institution building was not specifically
mentioned in the consultants' terms of reference, it can certainly be inferred
from the description of their tasks. Their terms of reference called for the
improvement of the organizational structure and efficiency of MTP, on-the-job
training and the provision of advice and assistance. However, as stated above,
consultant staff, while technically qualified, are often not trained to transfer
knowledge to less-educated national staff, who, in the end, become discouraged
and disinterested. Also, frequent changes in Government staff made it difficult
to maintain continuity. In addit4on, the motivation of local staff was low; they
were poorly paid and often had    take a second job to make a living.
VI. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
6.01      At the time of project preparation, the whole CAR Administration was
being reorganized, and most of the civil serve 's were inexperienced and poorly
motivated. France supplied many advisors to .elp keep essential accivities of
the country moving. The project preparation was imp *mented in close coordina-
tion with these advisors and representatives of FED and FRG which participated
in the effort to improve the CAR economy.  During that period, new military
leadership took over the still very young civil regime, and credit negotiations



had to be pursued with new officials, none of whom was familiar with the content
of the project or IDA's procedures.
6.02      During project implementation, the MTP was headed by four successive
Ministers, the MTP administration was managed by four succedsive General
Secretaries, and three General Directors of Public Works. At lower levels, a
similar turnover considerably hampered achieving institutional building
objectives. As time went on, the civil servants began to try to free themselves
from the influence of their expatriate advisors, but they were unable to execute
the project or their own in a professional manner.  During this period, the
Borrower's performance in matters of project management seriously deteriorated.
6.03      The Government frequently tried to use the Road Fund to finance
projects not related to the Fund's statutory objectives.   Following IDA's
objection, the Government reimbursed the Road Fund the amounts involved. Other
misuses of the Road Fund in regard to maintenance equipment operations and fuel
allocations were also regularly pointed out by IDA.  For 1988, these misuses
were estimated to amount to roughly 102 of the total revenue of the Fund.
However, overall, it can be said that Road Fund budgets were put to good use even
if not always in full accordance with the spirit af the Credit Agreement. The
Government has contracted an external auditing firm approved by the Bank to carry
out an audit of the Fund for the fiscal year 1987/88.
6.04      The final supervision mission pointed out that the revenue of the Road
Fund was insufficient to permit the development of a satisfactory road
maintenance program. It recommended that the revenue of the Road Fund should
be increased from CFAF 1.7 billion to CFAF 3.0 billion per year.
VII. THE ROLE OF THE ASSOCIATION
7.01      Project concept and evaluation, made in coordination with the other
donors participating in road rehabilitation and maintenance programs, was
satisfactory. The economic analysis was made on an early HDM model (version 1)
and based on a normal estimate of the traffic growth.   Thanks to the large
increase in the CFAF value of the credit during execution of the project, some
upward revision in the design standards could be made within the limits of credit
funds  (para. 3.07).   Other donors either upgraded their technical design
rehabilitation standards or extended the length of road to be rehabilitated/re-
constructed. However, the economic analysis shows that the return on the roads
as built was only 11X; thus, any higher standards would have been difficult to
justify.
7.02      IDA supervision staff emphasized to the MTP the need to comply with
the Credit Agreement. The Road Fund, one of the few public organizations with
substantial financial resources, was, of course, the center of political
attention. IDA coordinated closely with the donors' resident missions in CAR
in order to maintain consistent policies in the development of the transport
sector.
7.03      During the preparation of the follow-on project,  the Government
expressed its interest for a new international transit road to Cameroon called
"route du quatrieme parall6le," which would traverse the tropical rain forest
that partially stretches over Southern Central Africa. The Association concluded



that such an expensive and ecologically potentially damaging project was not
economically  justified.    After  consultation with  FAC,  FED  and  FRG,  the
Association strongly opposed it. In order to review the economic justification,
the Association requested a comparative technical-economic study of different
alignments  of the road.   This  study concluded,  however,  that a low but
satisfactory rate of return existed for a road (but not for a railway, which was
a potential alternative dating from the French colonization). IDA continued to
strongly oppose the project despite the conclusions of the study, and despite
the fact that FAC and the Kuwait Fund had decided to finance part of it. The
position held by the Association was unacceptable to the Government, and, as a
consequence, the preparation of a follow-on transport sector project was delayed
for more than one year. When the Central African Republic and France signed an
agreement in May 1987 to construct part of the road (Yamando-Bambro), the
Association lifted its objections on the condition that an Ecological Impact
Study be carried out that would provide the necessary recommendations on how
potential damage to the tropical rain forest could be mitigated. This study is
now being carried out following long delays in the consultant selection process
and, in fact, after the above road portion has almost been completed. Moreover,
the Government has taken measures to prevent farmers from moving into the forest
along the road and establishing settlements, so that burning has thus far been
limited.
7.04      At the end of the project, in order to fill the void left by the
departure of the consultants in charge of project implementation, the Government
requested IDA to develop an interim project in which individual advisors would
replace the consultants.   IDA would finance their logistical facilities and
several selected experts for the key positions such as the Mission Chief
responsible for overall project implementation. However, this led to an increase
in the estimated project costs to unacceptable levels.  Finally, IDA and the
Government agreed to fiil the gap between the two projects by continuing two
experts (a mechanical engineer and the manager of the petty contractors) under
the Second Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1587-CA). In 1988, an entirely
revised training and technical assistance program was prepared which included
the establishment of an inter-ministerial transport sector planning cell. This
program was devised to prepare the staff of the Minister of Public Works, and
of Transport, for the execution of the Transport Sector Project scheduled for
FY90, and to resume some of the training activities started under the project.
The program is financed by the Economic Management Project (Credit 1971-CA) which
was approved in December 1988.
7.05      IDA seems to have underestimated the amount of technical assistance
needed and the degree of training required by local personnel.  However, the
project was frequently supervised by IDA with five missions in each of 1984 and
1985. After 1985, missions were reduced to twice a year which may have been
insufficient in the light of the execution problems in CAR.  Unfortunately,
continuity in lending for transport was not maintained with the result that the
sector suffered from a lack of external funding.  The next vroject will be a
transport sector operation which was appraised in October 1989.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The start up of the project was  slowed by a change  in country
leadership and by the unfamiliarity of new Government officials with the project.



_ 10 -
However, progress later improved and the project was substantially completed
within the appraisal schedule.
8.02      The road rehabilitation, office building and transport study components
were satisfactorily executed. However, little in the way of long-term benefits
were achieved under the training and the technical assistance components, other
than the training of petty contractors and the transport studies.
8.03      Given the problems facing CAR at the time the project was appraised
and the lack of trained personnel in all sectors, the project was probably too
ambitious in its expectations.   It will require decades of effort to rebuild
institutions in CAR and the project must be considered as the first of several
steps in that direction.
8.04      The overall reevaluated rate of return for the rehabilitation works
is 112 as compared to the appraisal rate of 292. This is considered reasonable
in view of higher construction costs and lower traffic growth rates over those
estimated at appraisal.
8.05      The poor results in institution building may be to some extent blamed
on the consultants. However, it would appear that the little interest shown by
MTP staff in benefitting from the opportunity offered them was the major
contributor to the outcome. The fact that under the project now being prepared,
institution building has to be started almost from scratch, indicates the loss
in time and money of the failure to achieve progress in this vital area.
8.06      The Road Fund proved to be a most useful device for assuring funding
for the project. Given the circumstances, it was reasonably well managed and
contributed greatly to the success of the physical parts of the project.
8.07      The Government,  due to frequent changes in administration and in
staffing its MTP, lost an opportunity to benefit from the technical assistance
offered under the project.
8.08      The project was well prepared by the Association and thoroughly
supervised until 1986 when mission frequency was cut to less than half the number
in 1985-86. The momentum built up during the earlier years appears to have been
adversely affected by the difference of view between the Borrower and IDA as to
the content of the follow-up project. A transport sector project for FY90 will
be appraised in October 1989.
8.09      The Fourth Highway Project should be considered as a first step in
strengthening CAR's transport institutions. Lessons learned include: (a) where
weak executing institutions exist, consideration should be given by lending
agencies to maintaining roads by contract rather than by departmental forces;
and (b) consultants should be directed and supervised more closely than they
were under the project to ensure that they are carrying out their mandate for
institution building.
