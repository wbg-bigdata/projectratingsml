and coverage, within the limits of fiscal constraints. Improved incentives
and technical support for community involvement are also needed. The
Government plans to address these needs through a six-year development program
(1992-97) for public primary education. The proposed project supports this
program, which is satisfactory. It would center on improving teacher
performance and support. strengthening the institutional capacity of the
SEEBAC and expanding community involvement at the school level. A
complementary project, to be financed with assistance of the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), would focus on providing textbooks and other
educational materials and facilities rehabilitation for primary schools. This
project is expected to be approved by the IDB Board of Directors in June,
1991. A recent USAID-assisted project is supporting primary education
development in private, urban schools.
9.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The proposed project forms an
integral part of the Bank's strategy for country assistance, wvbch includes
support for developing a coherent macro-economic strategy and selected
investments in key sectors. The Bank seeks to support incrsased expenditure
and efficiency in the social sectors within a viable fiscal and economic
framework, while ensuring an appropriate balance between public and private
sector participation and between recurrent and capital expenditures. Bank
strategy also emphasizes poverty alleviation, through cost-effective measures
necessary to reverse the deterioration in sociaL services.
10.       The Bank Group previously financed one credit and one loan in
education. Credit 235-DR, approved in 1971, was designed to assist in
educational planning, curriculum development and construction of secondary
schools and a teachers' college. It was completed in 1978 after two, one-year
extensions. lot. 1142-DR, approved in 1975 and focussing on vocational and
community learning centers, was fully disbursed by 1984 with a four-year delay
due largely to a lack of local counterpart funding, a chronic issue across
sectors in the early 19809. In both cases, project completion and audit
reports emphasized the need to support institutional development and ensure
project suot^inability. The project thus incorporates measures to build
institutional capacit) for subsector planning and management, to foster
continuity in benefits zhrough provision and efficient use of requisite
resources and community support, and to limit requirements for local
counterpart financing during implementation in view of current financing
constraints.
11.       Proiect Oblectives.  The project aims to strenothen primary
education and institutional support to sustain improvements. In particular,
it would raise student retention, promot:       4 achievement levels; increase
the participation rate of poor rural and urban children; and ensure effective
planning and monitoring of resources available for primary education.
12.       Prolect Description.  The project would be implemented during 1991-
97. It encompasses components for educational development, centering on
teacher training and supervision, school maintenance and school nutrition, and
for management development.
13.       The educational development component (US$9.6 million) would
provide: in-service training for about 10,000 practicing primary school
teachers, or half the tot.al, to improve subject matter knowledge and classroom
teaching skills; training and 300 small motorcycles for regional supervisors,
district officers, and directors of larger schools in the rural areas to
enable them to provide improved and regular technical support and supervision



for teachers; and routine maintenance for about 4,000 urban and rural
classrooms representing a first phase of a system for routine maintenance for
school facilities, including water supply and sanitation, and incorporating
community inputs of labor and Government financing of materials; and,
equipment and studies to evaluate, improve and expand the ongoing school
n.utrition program (including feeding, iron supplementation and deparatization)
to reach 180,000 needy school children in rural border areas, and, with local
NGO support, in peri-urban areas.
14.       The management development component (US$7.4 million) would provide
technical assistance, equipment, training and materials to SEEBAC to:
strengthen management information for planning and monitoring (central and
local) for primary education based on school-level data; introduce a student
assessment system to measure and monitor achievement in core subjects (i.e.,
language, mathematics, science and social science); improve the SEEBAC's
capacity to support expanded community involvement in primary education by
providing training and information for parents' associations and promoting the
establishment of 1,000 additional associations to contribute to school
maintenance, school nutrition and textbook distribution. A share of book
rental fees collected from students for use of school materials (about US$50
per school) would be returned to associations for purchase of *:omplementary
materials. Selected studies related to future development and financing of
education, including an assessment of requirements for medium- to longer-term
improvements in pre-service teacher preparation and incentives, would also be
carried out; and fInancing for project management would be provided.
15.       The project would be managed by the SEEBAC with support of
technical and administrative advisors (local consultants) to be appointed to a
project coordinating unit (PCU), headed by a Project Coordinator, already
appointed. In addition, technical assistance would be provided to the PCU by
a management consulting firm. The total project cost is estimated at US$17.0
million equivalent. The Bank would finance US$15.0 million and the Government
US$2.0 million equivalent. Foreign cost would represent about 41 percent of
the total. The Bank would provide retroactive financing in an amount of
US$1.0 million for selected expenditures made after November 1, 1990.
Breakdowns of the costs and financing are shown in Schedule A. Arrangements
for procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. The timetable of
key events for project processing is summarized in Schedule C and the status
of Bank Group Operations in the Dominican Republic in Schedule D. A map is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9377-DO, dated May 23, 1991, is also
attached.
16.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to:
(a) take all necessary measures to achieve key monitoring targets to gradually
reduce student repetition to 14 percent by 1994 and 10 percent by 1997; reduce
student dropout to 6 percent by 1994 and 4 percent by 1997; increase the
primary school enrollment rate to 92 percent by 1994 and 95 percent by 1997;
and maintain adequate remuneration to attract and retain sufficient qualified
teachers for public primary schools (beginning with a planned increase of 20
percent or more in teachers' salaries in 1991); (b) undertake an annual review
of project execution and furnish to the Bank, each year by December 1,
beginning in 1992, a report of results of implementation for the previous year
and proposed activities and budgetary allocations for the following year; and
include in the annual reports for 1994 and 1997 ^n evaluation of project
implementation and progress towards meeting the key monitoring targets,
carried out under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and furnished for
Bank review by June 30 1993 and June 30, 1996, respectively; (c) complete an



MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEYELOPHENT
TO THE E)ECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMEWT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Dominican Republic for US$15.0 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The loan would be repayable over a period of 20 years, including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would
help finance a primary education development project designed to improve
educational effectiveness within a strategy to raise productivity and reduce
poverty
2.        Background.  After a period of vigorous economic growth, amounting
to about 6.5 percent of GDP p.a. from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s,
economic conditions in the Dominican Republic declined sharply. Between 1982
and 1986, GNP per capita fell from US$1,330 to US$130, the rate of open
unemployment climbed from 18 percent to 25 percent, and the external debt rose
from 30 percent to 59 percent of GDP. Based on a massive rise in public
investment intended to reinstate growth, GDP grew by 8 percent in 1987, but
the excessive expansion of domestic demand led to the loss of international
reserves and to persistent inflation, which reached a rate of 101 percent in
1990. Real GDP growth decreased to 2.4 percent in 1988 and to a negative 5.1
percent in 1990.
3.        To halt the rapidly deteriorating economic situation, the
Government recently implemented a stabilization program. Inflation was
reduced to an annual equivalent rate of less than 10 percent in the first
quarter of 1991. A differential between the official and the parallel market
exchange rates was eliminated, the official exchange rate was devalued and
international reserves have begun to reaccumulate. All arrears to the Bank
and to the International Monetary Fund were cleared during February and April,
1991, respectively; and new overdues have been kept below 60 days. As part of
the stabilization program, all regulations pertaining to deposit and lending
interest rates in the banking system were lifted, steps were taken to reduce
portfolio requirements, and a free interbank market was created; and key
domestic prices, e.g., for gasoline, electricity, flour and sugar, were
substantially increased. All current government expenditures were frozen and
capital expenditures limited to the completion of on-going work.
Stabilization efforts have continued over the first half of 1991. Further
details on recent developments will be presented in the forthcoming Country
Brief. Medium- to long-term prospects for development will depend upon the
capacity of the Government to maintain its stabilization efforts while
pursuing other policy reforms necessary to sustain growth. Further, arrears
to other creditors remain very large. Sustained stability and growth will
require a coherent Government debt strategy.
4.        The difficult economic situation prevailing in the late 1980s had a
direct, negative impact on the provision of basic social services and the
living standards of the poor. The incidence of povzorty, reflected in a
25 percent decline in the real minimum wage between 1980 and 1989, rose during
the decades by 1986 one-fourth of Dominican families were classified as
indigent. By the late 19809, malnutrition affected two-fifths of all children
under the age of five. Sanitary conditions also declined while the incidence
of water-borne diseases and related infections soared. Education likewise
experienced increasing difficulties over the 19809.



5.        Estimated  enrollment rates of 90 percent, 45 and 10 percent,
respectively, at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels, are comparatively
high. Overall, however, educational efficiency and quality are poor,
especially at the lower levels of the system. Some 1.3 million children
(evenly distributed by sex) attend primary schools, with 80 percent in public
and 20 percent in pri--ate (mainly non-profit) institutions. The annual drop-
out rate is 7 percent, and the repetition rate is 17 percent. The average
student completes only four grades of the six-year cycle but spends 6.7 years
in the system. The Dominican Republic does not yet possess a regular system
for measuring student achievement, but recent studies show that achievement in
selected subjects, in particular mathematics, is poor, even when compared with
countries of lower per capita income. Moreover, 10 percent of children,
mainly from poor families living along the border with Haiti and in urban
slums, are not enrolled. For 75,000 of these children, a rural school feeding
program supported by CARE and the Government, with food provided through 1994
by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), shows
potential to reverse the poor enrollment and attendance records caused by
poverty. In some cases sufficient schools and classrooms are lacking for
these children.
6.        The problems in primary education can be attributed largely to
inadequate and poorly managed resources. Public expenditure on education,
already one of the lowest in the region, fell from 1.7 to 1.3 percent of GNP
between 1980 and 1988. Private expenditure on education (2.8 percent of
personal income) and a relatively high share of public education spending
allocated for primary education (nearly 50 percent) are insufficient. The
limited resources and low efficiency have led to a severe shortage of learning
materials, teacher upgrading, school supervision, and facilities upkeep. Low
base salaries for teachers (comparable to the minimum wage) contribute to poor
motivation and low average quality of teaching. The existing Teachers'
Statute provides for annual salary increments and performance reviews but has
not been enforced regularly.
7.        Institutional constraints also detract from educational
effectiveness. The Secretariat of State for Education, SEEBAC, responsible
for primary and secondary education, id highly centralized and weak.
Communication among and within the several administrative levels of the SEEBAC
is limited: management information, and as a consequence, planning and
monitoring, remain deficient and contribute to misallocation of resources.
Partly off-setting this is a tradition of community support for primary
education. School ass',ciations, established at 4,000 of 5,000 primary
schools, contribute to school maintenance, collect iominal fees for use of
school materials and participate in the ongoing school feeding program.
However, the associations generally lack financial resources and have not
developed to full potential.
8.        The overall inferior quality and poor efficiency of primary
education fomented extensive public debate during '489/90, led by the private
business sector.  The United Nations' Development Pro,ram (UNDP), which serves
informally as coordinator for groups interested in education (government,
private and donor), contributed substantially to the process. The importance
of a better-educated labor force for sustained economic growth, and the
particular need to serve the least well-off segments of the population, were
highlighted. Selected investments for educational materials, teacher and
supervisor training, facilities upgrading and school nutrition, were
identified as critical needs. The Government is also aware that improved
planning and monitoring are necessary to achieve better quality, efficiency

assessment of the school nutrition program by December 31, 1994 and propose
satisfactory arrangements for continuing provicion of food after USAID phases
out support, by June 30, 1994; (d) introduce the improved information system
for SEEBAC by June 30, 1993; (a) introduce the student assessment system by
the 1991/92 school year and nationwide by the 1996/97 school year; (f) furnish
to the Bank the results of project-related studies by June 30, 1993;
(g) provide a specified annual contribution In pesos to project financing
during 1992-96 (equivalent to US$0.2 million in 1992, US$0.3 million in 1993,
US$0.4 million in 1994, US$0.5 million in 1995 and US$0.6 million In 1996) and
budget an increment in pesos in a minimum amount equivalent to US$2.0 million
as required to cover all recurrent costs attributable to the project in 1997;
and (h) maintain throughout project implementation the PCU with adequate
qualified personnel, including the Project Coordinator and five other key
personnel, and the project account in pesos in an amount equivalent to
US$100,000. Conditions of loan effectiveness would be appointment of five key
consultants to the PCU, establishment and initial funding of the project
account, and signing of a contract with independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank.
17.       Proiect Benefits.  Investment in primary education, both for
improved quality and expanded coverage, has a high economic return and is
recognized as a prerequisite for improvements in labor productivity. The
project aims to achieve these objectives and to reduce povertys it directly
targets the enrollment of an estimated additional 80,000 children from low
income households; most of these children would benefit from the school
breakfast program, which would help to improve achievement as well as
retention. The introduction of improved planning and monitoring, and the
educational assessment system for primary education, would also help to
improve participation and achievement of children. Reaching the project's
management objectives, together with the implementation experience to be
gained by SEEBAC's central and regional directorates, would contribute to
long-term gains in the effectiveness of resource management and would help to
sustain benefits beyond completion. Enhanced community involvement in primary
education would also help to sustain improved educational quality and
efficiency.
18.       Project Risks. Project management relies on SEEBAC capacity which
may prove insufficient for successful and timely implementation.  To reduce
this risk and ensure a balance between efficient project management and
related capacity-building in the SEEBAC, the project includes appointment of
technical and administrative consultants and UNDP support to assist with
project management. In view of fiscal constraints, a lack of national
counterpart funds, in particular for initiating project implementation, could
also cause delays.  To minimize these risks, UNDP funding has been provided to
complete detailed project design, and specific annual government contributions
to financing, limited to about 12 percent of total project cost, have been
confirmed.
19.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan of US$15.0
million would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the propcsed loan.
