                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project is to assist, as part of a global polio eradication effort, the Government of Nigeria to achieve its goal of interrupting the
                         transmission of wild polio virus, and to sustain these efforts throughout the implementation of the Project, through effective OPV coverage of the target population.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The PDO aims to assist GON to achieve its goal of interrupting WPV and sustaining the efforts through effective oral Polio Virus (OPV) coverage. Against the baseline value of
                         20-30% of children reached with OPV, the target value of 80% has been reached and has been sustained for the last 4 years. This was independently verified through a performance
                         audit by the Bank in 2011. Over the project lifetime the number of polio cases increased in the first few years of the project followed by a downward trend – and a small increase this
                         last year. Despite this small increase, polio cases in Nigeria are now concentrated in high risk LGAs in high risk states and are seen in young children who have received zero doses
                         or are under-immunized indicating that the pool of population not reached with vaccine is shrinking. The recently prepared Emergency Plan for Polio Eradication specifically targets

                         these children and, if implemented as planned provides opportunities for achieving eradication in the near future. In addition high political commitment to the polio eradication goal,
                         substantial government commitment of its own resources, supplemental interventions and the improved/well-maintained surveillance system indicate that the building blocks for
                         sustainability are in place. Overall progress on objectives and implementation of the project rating is therefore satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government of Nigeria requested for a US$95M additional financing on January 5, 2012. However considering the age of the project a decision was taken to develop a 2 year
                         track 1 project. Hence this project (P080295) will close on April 30th, 2012. The new project will take the lessons learned into consideration and will remain simple in that it will
                         provide for Oral Polio Vaccine to be procured and supplied by UNICEF. The project will also continue to include a buy-down arrangement similar to that of the current project and will

                         maintain the performance based element of linking the buy-down to a trigger being met. At the same time, the Bank team will initiate a dialogue with the Government of Nigeria on the
                         preparation of a longer term, more comprehensive project which will support polio eradication and subsequent surveillance but also provide more comprehensive support to
                         strengthening health care systems for routine immunization and general mother and child care services.
