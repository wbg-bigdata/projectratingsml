                         The development objective of the Project is to assist, as part of a global polio eradication effort, the Government of Nigeria to achieve its goal of interrupting the
                         transmission of wild polio virus, and to sustain these efforts throughout the implementation of the Project, through effective OPV coverage of the target
                         population.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         While overall performance of the program has been satisfactory and political commitment to polio eradication remains high - Nigeria saw an increase in the number of new cases. As
