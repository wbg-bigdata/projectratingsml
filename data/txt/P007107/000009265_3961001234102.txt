MEMORANDUM zJND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
0? THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADTR
FOR A FIRST SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Ecuador for US$89 million equivalent.
The proposed loan, which would finance basic education and training
activities, would be repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The Government of Ecuador (GOE)
would be the borrower and the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) and the
Vocational Training Service (SECAP) would be the executing agencies.
2. Backaround. In Ecuador poverty remains widespread and income
distribution is highly skewed. Resources from the oil boom of the 19708
enabled the Government to improve performance in the social sectors; however,
the resource constraints induced by the precipitous decline in oil prices in
the 1980. led to much lower per-student and per-patient expenditures in the
social sectors. Part of the reduction in unit costs of social programs can be
attributed to increased productivity but there is a general concern that the
quality of some critical social services, which affect the poor the most, has
been eroded. Moreover, development of public sector institutional capacity
remains limited, as does progress toward better public investment programming
mechanisms and more timely program implementation.
3. The Government, to address the growing social sector malaise, now has
given priority to expanding substantially social sector programs, in
particular to increasing their coverage throughout the country. However,
public social sector expenditures within a decreasing Central Government
budget fell to 4.5% of GNP in 1988 and 4.2% in years 1989 and 1990. This
reflects the rigidities in Ecuador's traditional budgeting process that
severely limit the level of public expenditures directed to the social sector.
4. Within the social sector, primary education coverage is reasonably high,
especially in urban areas, but quality has deteriorated. Since the children
of the poor bear the brunt of this lower quality, the issue becomes one of
social equity. Furthermore, most new entrants to the urban labor force have
been absorbed in low-skill, low productivity jobs, the poorest among them
having almost no formal education. The first activity the present Government
undertook to implement its strategy in the social sector was a major national
literacy campaign targeted to the uneducated adult poor.
5. The Government has identified basic education and training as priority
sectoral issues, as noted in the recent Bank social sector report (8935-EC),
and supports several programs in these areas. Among them are a Basic
Education Quality Improvement Program, part of which is being implemented
under an 1DB loan covering rural areas, and the Proarama de Capacitaci6n
Popular, which focuses training activities on the poor and is attempting to
improve the way SECAP utilizes capacities developed under an earlier Bank loan



(2171-EC). A key aspect of the Government's efforts to improve the quality of
the nine-year basic education cycle is to deliver inputs for quality
improvement through decentralized school networks. Under the ongoing IDB
program, selected schools are upgraded to serve as centers of excellence and
1--ome the focal points for quality improvement activities in local networks
o_ from 10 to 20 schools serving surrounding rural areas. The Government now
seeks Bank assistance for a complementary project that would extend the
qualitative reform to cover poor children in low-income urban neighborhoods.
6.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project forms an integral
part of the Bank's overall strategy for country assistance, including:
redefining the role of the state to focus m4ore on areas of clear public
responsibility such as social welfare, and replacing the existing
protectionist trade regime and inefficient labor market policies with
incentives to stimulate economic diversification and greater outward
orientation of the country. Bank social sector strategy is aimed at
alleviating poverty, improving efficiency and equity of social expenditures,
strengthening public sector management and decision-making, and targeting of
priority social programs. The Government's strategy, as expressed in on-going
dialogue with the Bank, emphasizes basic education, in particular the
improvement of educational quality. The strategy emphasizes in-service
training for teachers and principals, preschool education, and special
education. Supporting elements include improving textbooks and educational
materials, and developing an achievement testing system for assessment of
education sector performance. In tandem with this initiative, the Government
also gives priority to improving skills of less educated workers through
training as well as increasing opportunities of poor adults through programs
that maintain or enhance literacy or basic education, complemented by training
to improve their productivity.
7. Proiect Obiectives. The project aims to improve the quality and
effective delivery of basic education and training services targeted on the
poor and strengthen decision-making and management of public institutions that
deliver basic education and training programs. These two objectives would be
achieved through: (a) raising learning achievement of primary age children;
(b) raising basic skills of poorly educated adults; (c) strengthening capacity
of decentralized service providers; and (d) improving resource allocation and
program design processes in the education/training sectors.
8. Proiect DescriDtion. The proposed project would have two main
components. The Urban Basic Education component (76 percent of total project
cost) would finance: (a) provision of 697,000 textbooks and 65,000 teachers
guides, in-service teacher training for 12,700 teachers, limited pre-school
and special education programs for 113,000 needy children and enhancement of
existing physical facilities in 935 schools; (b) establishment of
decentralized system for school management through 55 school networks, which
will deliver these services to 935 schools serving 345,000 students in the
urban poor areas of the country; (c) development of a nation-wide, sample
based educational assessment system for evaluating student achievement and
educational quality through which students of grades 2,6 and 9 would be
tested; and (d) policy and institutional strengthening of NEC by (i)
establishing an education statistics and management information system to



- 3 -
guide resource allocation, providinl training to S90 staff at decentralized
levels and to 45 staff at the central NEC in its use and application, (ii)
improving the budget system and providing training to 255 staff at both
central and decentralized levels, and (iii) conducting selected studies in the
areas of quality and cost-effectiveness of baoic education, impact evaluation
of selected programs and for national consultations on the roles and quality
of secondary and higher education. The Adult Education and Training component
(24 percent of total project costs) would finances (a) basic education and
training (functional literacy) programs directed to 180,000 poor adults (about
30,000 per year): (b) technological and informational support, and training
for small enterprises in three manufacturing subsectors with good export
development potentiall and (c) strengthening of SECAP's utilization of
installed capacity, and increasing SECAP'S institutional and technical
capacity by (i) strengthening the existing management information system,
including use of labor market information and tracer/evaluation studies of
SECAP graduates and (Li) providing training to 2,160 staff.
9. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$113.7 million
equivalent (excluding taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of
US$33.1 million (27.9%). The proposed loan of US$89 million would finance 7S%
of %otal project costs while the remaining US$29.7 million would be provided
by Gt  and the direct beneficiaries.  Eligible expenditures from July 13, 1991
to the date of loan signing are proposed for retroactive financing from the
loan, up to a maximum equivalent to US$4.8 million. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Ecuador are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9843-EC, is also attached.
10. The borrower would be GOB. The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed
over a seven year period. The project would be implemented through the
existing organizational structures of NEC (for the Basic Education component)
and of SECAP (for the Training component) each with support of a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCUs would submit to the Bank semi-annual
reports with data on phy3ical and financial progress. An annual project
implementation review would be carried out between the Bank and GOB to assess
project progress, resource management and sector performance, on the basis of
which the forthcoming year's annual operational plan would be established.
11.  Actions Agreed. The Government has legally established the school
networks and an Editorial Council for the purpose of coordinating activities
related to textbook production; and has provided evidence that project teams
(precursors of the PCUs) are operational at MEC and SECAP, with coordinators
appointed for both institutions. The Government has provided assurances that:
(a) resolutions would be promulgated by July 1992 regulating relationships
between the Provincial Education Directorates and the school networks; (b)
criteria acceptable to the Bank will be applied for site selections of
networks a d hub schools to be built during project phases two and three; (c)
all studies and consultations performed as part of the Institutional
Strengthening activities would be performed in accordance with the schedules
agreed; (d) it will annually conduct with the Bank a joint review of the



- 4 -
MEC/SECAP budgets for the following year, specifically identifying the ehares
allocated to basic education and the amounts needed to meet estimated project
costs; (e) a partial cost-recovery system for all of SECAP's training courses
will be instituted including feee charged for SECAP technical assistance; (f)
adequate budget funds for bas.c operational expenditures would be allocated at
the local level; (g) a comprehensive mid-project review would be undertaken in
1995; and (h) a public primary school student testin.g program will be
implemented on a pilot basis in 1992 and on a national basis by 1996. The
following are conditions of Loan Effectiveness: (a) submission of signed
operational agreements, acceptable to the Bank, between the Ministry of
Education and SECAP; (b) submissioi by SECAP of t plan of action for
establishing agreements with private chambers; (c) submission of signed
contracts by MEC and SECAP between them and their respective
procurement/technical assistance agents; and (u) establishment of PCUs with
key staff in place.
12. Benefita. The proposed project would increase human capital
accumulation 'mong the poor, improving the country's human capital stock and
contributing to a more equal distribution of economic opportunities due to
enhanced educational attainment and productivity ef project beneficiaries.
Improved sector policies resulting from the project would includes (a) a new
approach to basic education, (b) introduction of an education assessment
system, (c) development of a cost-effective special education program, and (d)
a revised role for SECAP. In addition, the project would improve the
efficiency of public resource use by strengthening the MEC's planning and
budgeting process and its implementation capacity, and by offering sector-
level support necessary for the over-all budget reform measures being pursued
at the macroeconomic level. Similar benefits would be effected in SECAP. In
addition, the project would use more fully SECAP's underutilized institutional
physical capacity.
13.  Risks.  The main risk for the project derives from poor implementation
capacity on the part of Government agencies. This problem may be aggravated
by the presidential election and change of administrations in 1992. Project
design incorporates the following features to overcome the kinds of obstacles
to successful implementation that have been endemic in most projects in the
country: development of a decentralized management network for basic
education, use of SECAP's existing decentralized facilities and the network
of MEC literacy staff (already used successfully by MEC in its national
literacy campaign), use of existing sector staff -- selected on a merit basis,
provided with necessary training and offered career development
opportunities -- in project tasks, use of SECAP's experience in managing Bank
projects, contracting with specialized agencies to manage procurement and
technical assistance, assuring incorporation of counterpart funding of
recurrent expenditures in the national budget and including annual subsector
and project budget reviews during supervision missions, introducing cost-
recovery schemes and managing their proceeds in a decentralized manner, and
establishing direct ties between schools and their communities and between
SECAP and private industries. The potential delay with the upcoming change in
Government !s reduced by the substance of the project components that,
focussing &s they do on alleviating poverty, are expected to enjoy continued
support in spLte of change in administrations. Intensive supervision will



nonetheless be maintained during the transition to ensuro clear understanding
of and comm'tment to the project.
14.  Recovnmendaticn.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement or the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
