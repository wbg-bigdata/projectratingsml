low-income urban areas, and furnishing, maintenance and operation of
each such school as a Hub School, as well as maintenance of the
facilities of the School Networks.
2.    Provision of in-service training, covering topics such as
improved use of class time and improved use of textbooks, to all
teachers who work in the School Networks, together with provision of
training to the instructors who will present such in-service
training so that they may do so in the most effective manner.
3.    Operation of pre-school classes in each School Network.
4.    Screening of all students served by the School Networks to
detect the presence of learning disabilities, and provision of
special education services, headquartered at each Hub School, to

nation-wide testing program to assess academic achievement (but not
to decide promotion) of second, sixth and ninth grade public Primary
School students on a periodic basis.
7.    Decentralization of selected MEC administrative activities so
that such activities are assumed by the School Networks and by the
Provincial Directorates in each of the provinces where a School
Page  16
Network is located, together with provision of training to approxi-
mately 635 staff members (110 from School Networks, 480 from
Provincial Directorates and 45 from MEC headquarters) with respect
to administration under the new decentralized structure.
8.    Provision of training and technical assistance to approxi-
mately 255 staff members (110 from School Networks, 105 from
Provincial Directorates and 40 from MINFIN, CONADE and MEC

                   students are at greatest risk of repeating
                   grades or dropping out of school and how
                   educational inputs can affect that risk; and
          (iii)    compare the academic achievement of public
                   Primary School students who have participated in
                   pre-school programs with the achievement of
                   those who have not participated in such
                   programs;
      (b)   a study on the demographics of indigenous children of
Primary School age and on the social, cultural, linguistic and other
problems they could face as Primary School students; (c) studies on
the effectiveness of the pre-school and special education activities
carried out under Parts A.3 and A.4 of the Project and on Primary

Page  22
3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as
the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                   Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                   deposits into the Special Account at such
                   intervals as the Bank shall specify.
           (ii)    Prior to or at the time of each such request,
                   the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
                   documents and other evidence required pursuant
                   to para- graph 4 of this Schedule for the
                   payment or payments in respect of which
                   replenishment is requested. On the basis of each
                   such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                   Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and
                   deposit into the Special Account such amount as
                   the Borrower shall have requested and as shall
                   have been shown by said documents and other
                   evidence to have been paid out of the Special
                   Account for eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Page  23
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
