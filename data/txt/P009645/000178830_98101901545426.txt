APPRAISAL OF A
FIFTH INDUSTRIAL I1PORTS PROJECT
IINDIA
SUMMARY
(i)       The four previous IDA credits to India for industrial imports pro-
vided a substantial proportion of the foreign exchange required by industry
in India for imports of raw materials, components and spare parts from 1964/651
to 1967/68. The range of industries covered was broadened in several stages
and now comprises most industries manufacturing capital goods and agricultural
chemicals in India.
(ii)      Assisted significantly by the availability of foreign exchange, which
they could use in any member country of the Bank or in Switzerland, most indus-
tries increased their production in each year since 1964/65.   However, in
1967/68 the growth rate generally was short of expectations and some sectors
actually reduced their output. Major reasons for these shortfalls are the
cutback in Government purchases and the slower rate of private investment.
(iii)     The industries are capable of producing a wide range of products,
using only a fraction of the foreign exchange that would be required if the
end product were to be imported. Many continue to have idle production
capacity, though the rate of underutilization varies from industry to industry
and from firm to firm.  As all industries operate in a sheltered market, prof.
itability is adequate, although production costs are higher than in most dev-
eloped countries. Since the summer of 1966 the continuous availability of
foreign exchange for production imports, together with relaxation of other
controls, has given the more efficient firms an advantage over their competi-
tors; with competition, efficiency is expected to increase further.
(iv)      In 1968/69 the demand for most products is expected to grow,
though major production increases Till be achieved only in a few sectors.
(v)       The proposed fifth credit for industrial imports in an amount
equivalent to US$125 million would provide foreign exchange for imports of
the same types of goods as under the previous credits. An amount of US$2
million would be set aside for balancing equipment. The Government of India
has agreed that during the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 1969,
it will continue to make available to firms in the industries covered suffi-
cient foreign exchange to meet their production import requirements.
(vi)      The credit would be made available to India on the usual IDA terms;
the Government in turn would make the foreign exchange equivalent of the credit
available, through the Reserve Bank of India, to specified manufacturing firms
for purchase with rupee funds. The credit would not involve any financing of
the beneficiary firms.
(vii)     The proposed credit is sound and economically justified; it will make
possible a substantial increase in the quantities of capital goods and agri-
cultural chemicals available to the Indian market.
1/ Reference is made to the Indian fiscal year - April 1 to March 31.



APPRAISAL OF A
FIFTH INDUSTRIAL INPORTS PROJECT
INDIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Association has made four credits to India for industrial
imports.  The first (Credit No. 52-IN) in June 1964 ras in an amount of
$90 million, the second (Credit No. 78-IN) in August 1965 for $100 million,
the third (Credit No. 92-IN) in August 1966 for $150 million, and the
fourth (Credit No. 97-IN) in December 1966 for $65 million.  The principal
objective of all four credits was to increase the supply of selected capital
goods (and more recently agricultural che.2d.cals) by providing part of the
foreign exchange required by Indian enterprises to import raw materials and
components for their production, spare parts for their machinery and some
miscellaneous items of capital equipment required to balance their production.
2.        The proposed fifth credit for industrial imports in an amount of
$125 million would serve the same broad purpose, namely help maintain and
expand production by manufacturers of various types of capital equipment
and agricultural chemicals.

II. PREVIOUS INDUSTRIAL IMPORTS CREDITS
A. Coverage and Benefits
3.        The proceeds of the first industrial imports credit of 1964 were
made available to manufacturers of commercial vehicles, automotive components,
machine tools and cutting tools, electrical equipment and construction equip-
ment, primarily for the import of raw materials, components and spare parts.
When the second credit was made in 1965, the cable and wire industry was added
to the sectors covered.  The two credits had the expected effe t of increasing
production in these industries. The targets set for 1964/651/ and 1965/66 were
generally achieved, except in the commercial vehicle sector. Capacity utili-
zation, which had been low, went up, though not as much as had been hoped,
because during the same period many firms were still corileting earlier expan-
sion projects; capacity was increasing at almost the same rate as production.
4.        The third and fourth credits were made in August and December of 1966
While the construction equipment industry was excluded from further assistance
at the request of the Government of India (its import requirements being
covered from the proceeds of a loan from the U.S.), other sectors were added;
presently manufacturers of the following types of capital equipment, industrial
raw materials and agricultural chemicals are eligible:
Commercial vehicles for the civilian market (including trucks with a
capacity between 3 and 12 tons light-weight in-the-city transporters,
jeeps, three and four wheelers5;
Agricultural tractors with a range from 26.5 to 50 HP;
Automotive components such as tires and tubes, storage batteries, auto-
electricals, fuel equipment, wheels, brakes, radiators, pistons, valves,
gaskets, shock absorbers, brake linings, instruments, etc.;
Machine tools such as cutting, grinding, miLling, planing and shaping
machines, lathes and presses, and accessories;
Cutting and small tools such as drills, taps, reamers, cutters, etc.;
Electrical equipment such as motors, transformers, control and switchgear,
generators, power capacitors, rectifiers, relays, stampings and lami-
nations;
Cables and wires for electrical usage;
Industrial machinery such as textile, sugar, cement mill and mining
machinery;
1/ Reference is made to the Indian fiscal year - April 1 to March 31.

Ball and roller bearings;
Fertilizers and pesticides;
Basic non-ferrous metals (aluminum, copper, lead, zinc and antimony);
Abrasive grains;
Powder metallurgy, i.e., sintered parts and oilite bearings;
Industrial fasteners, high tensile and alloy steel bolts, nuts, etc.;
Petrol engines for agricultural sprayers;
Synthetic robber
Castings and forgings;
Mathematical and scientific instruments.
5.        The first two credits had only modest objectives.  In its efforts to
conserve scarce foreign exchange, the Government of India at that time was
operating a complex foreign exchange allocation and import licensing system
which allowed manufacturing firms very little flexibility. The two credits
provided the Government with sufficient foreign exchange to increaoe the
amounts allocated to the industries then participating; at the samse time the
credits enabled the Govarnment to relax some of its controls in order to study
the effects of liirited liberalization. Encouraged by the results, the Govern-
ment, in the summer of 1966, announced a far reaching import liberalization
program, which covered 59 priority industries, including all sectors partici-
pating in the IDA credits (Appendix I contains a complete list). This program
had the support of the India Consortium. The third and fourth credits were the
Association&s share of the assistance rendered by the members of the Consortium.
The immediate effect of the liberalization was a substantial improvement in the
availability of foreign exchange for production imports: almost all firms in
the priority industries, which account for about 75 to 80 percent of all indus-
trial production, received licenses in ample amounts as and when needed.
6.        When the scarcity of foreign exchange was no longer a constraining
factor, mantufacturers could direct their fuUl attention to production and
marketing aspects. However, at that time a number of economic factors, which
are discussed further below, had already begun to have adverse repercussions
on the growth of domestic sales of many industrial firms; some of them, which
already were familiar with export markets, were able to compensate slackening
domestic demand partly by stepping up export sales. In general, industrial
production has increased consistently since the first credit for industrial
imports was made in 1964., as the following table shows for some major
products; more detailed figures on capacity, targets and actual production

production estimates for 1968/69,. are given in Appendix II:

7.        The liberalization of import licensing procedures has not only made
it possible for most industries to expand or at least to maintain their pro-
duction during the last few years, but the new system, which was complemented
by other measures of industrial decontrol, had a number of beneficial indirect
effects. Since the market sharing mechanism, which was inherent in the former
system, has been removed, firms can compete more effectively with each other.
To improve their competitive position, many industrialists are attaching greater
importance than before to design and product development and to reduction of
costs while in the past the limited competition and the higher profitability of
new products had led many companies to neglect these aspects. In general it
can be said that the liberalization of production import licensing procedures
and the relaxation of other controls have led to significant improvements in
the industries.
8.        After introduction of the new program, the amount of foreign exchange
available to the Government for production imports was at first limited, since
bilateral aid commitments had yet to be negotiated, and requirements of many
firms were satisfied almost entirely from the IDA credits, which accounted for
over 90 percent of total licenses issued to these sectors in 1966/67. (See
Appendix III for details.) In 1967/68 the IDA share of total licenses issued
declined to about 55 percent and is expected to remain at about that level.
9.        All four previous IDA credits have been fully disbursed.  Appendices
IV and V show disbursements by sector and by quarter.



-5-
B. Information Gathering Procedures
10.       At the time of the first IDA credit for industrial imports, it was
agreed between the Government and the Association that the procedures for
establishing and keeping records within the foreign exchange allocation and
licensing system should be improved so that such records would become a more
effective tool in determining foreign exchange policy. An amount of $100,000
was set aside under the credit to finance the employment of consultants to help
the Government in a review of existing information gathering procedures, to
identify major shortcomings and to make recommendations for their correction.
Part of that amount was earmarked for the acquisition of some record-keeping
equipment.
11.       In October 1965, the firm of Booz, Allen & Hamilton International,
Zurich, started work on this project. The consultants submitted their report
in March 1966.  On March 28, 1968, the Government invited 20 Indian firms of
consulting engineers to submit proposals for implementing the system recommended
by Booz, Allen & Hamilton International. Proposals were to be submitted in
early May 1968.
12.       It is unfortunate that the improvement of the information gathering
procedures, which was considered urgent in 1963, has still not been carried
out. There is no question - and this was again confirmed by the recent mission
- that the development of a sound data system should have the highest priority.
Recently, the use of a computer has been made available to the Central Con-
troller of Imports and Exports, through which office most licenses are issued,
and the Government told the mission that it has plans to develop the computer
program without further delays.
III. THE IDA SECTORS
A. Present Licensing Procedures
13.       The IDA industries are working today under basically the same set
of rules as at the time Credits Nos. 92-I1 and 97-IN wiere approved.  The
measures which the Government took in the summer of 1966 to relax adminis-
trative controls over the Indian industry have not been changed substantially.
The industrial licensing system has been somewhat further relaxed, and the
procedure for issuing maintenance import licenses has been recently revised
in order to assure that the licenses, iwhich are issued on a continuous basis,
are more closely related to consumption of imported inputs. The procedures
for the issuance of maintenance import licenses were judged generally
adequate by most of the firms visited or interviewed by the mission. Most
license applications are processed within two to three months, which the
firms consider reasonable, except in cases where disagreement arises with
regard to indigenous availability of certain goods. A brief description of
the entire licensing system can be found in Appendix VI.



- 6-
B. General Performance
Production and Capacity Utilization
14.       As stated earlier in this report, production in 1967/68 of most of
the IDA sectors was higher than in 1966/67 (compare Appendix II for production
figures); this was particularly true in the sectors producing for the agri-
cultural market. Demand for agricultural inputs, such as fertilizer, pesti-
cides, tractors, small motors and engines, is continuing to increase at a
rapid pace, largely as a result of substantial governmental expenditures, a
groTing awareness among farmers of the benefits to be derived from such
inputs, and liberal financing facilities. The output of tractors in 1967/68
increased more than 25 percent over the previous year even though a shortage
of tires forced most manufacturers to slow down or stop production for about
two and one-half months. Except for pesticides and small electrical motors,
the demand for these products exceeds the domestic production capacity.
15.       Due primarily to the Government's policy of fiscal restraint,
which led to a reduction of Government orders in most of the non-agricultural
sectors and to a simultaneous slowdowJn of private investment, production in
1967/68 in most of the IDA industries did not reach the levels that had been
expected. In a few sectors, such as those producing heavy commercial vehicles,
machine tools and particularly textile machinery, output in 1967/68 even was
down from 1966/67, but many other industries registered increases. For
example, the manufacturers of automotive components benefitted from the grow-
ing spare parts market required to service the vehicle fleet in use and from
the increased production of lightweight commercial vehicles. Impressive
growth was achieved by the aluminum industry, which raised output in 1967/68
by more than 30 percent over the previous year in response to a campaign for
the substitution of aluminum in the production of engineering products such
as electrical equipment and cables and aires.  A similar success was accom-
plished by the synthetic rubber industry.
16.       Cutbacks in Government purchases were immediately and strongly felt
in all those capital goods industries which sell a large share of their pro-
duction to the Government and its agencies. As the following table shows,
sales to the public sector account for more than half of total production in
some major product lines:
Public Sector Purchases
Product                         As a Percent of Production
Commercial vehicles                            50
Machine tools                                  60
Cutting & small tools                          40
Electrical equipment                           70
Electrical cables & wires                      75
Pesticides                                     60



- 7 -
17.       In 1968/69 all IDA sectors expect demand to be higher than in
1967/68; Appendix TT shows the Government's production forecast for these
industries. Sales in the commercial vehicle, electrical equipment and cables
and wires sectors are likely to be higher mainly as a result of larger govern-
ment purchases and the tapping of new markets. The machine tool, cutting tool
and castings and forgings industries should have larger sales from increased
purchases by the Railways and the introduction of additional lines of more
sophisticated machine tools. Sales of fertilizer, pesticides and other agri-
cultural inputs should go up as a result of continued substantial govern-
mental expenditures in the agricultural sector.
18.       Mainly  as a result of the slower pace of economic growth during
the last two years, the utilization of installed manufacturing capacity re-
mains low in many industriee, in particular the sectors producing heavy
electrical equipment, mining and industrial machinery and machine tools.
However, it must also be noted that many firms uncritically accepted the high
growth forecasts made some years ago, wihich were given a certain degree of
sanctity in Plan documents, and added to their capacity despite indications
of a slowdown in industrial expansion. The following table shows the mission's
estimate of current utilization of capacity in selected industries:
Product                   Percent of Installed Capacity Utilized
Commercial vehicles                               60 2!
Agricultural tractors                             80
Automotive components                             60 - loo 2/ 3/
Machine tools                                     55

& mining equipment, paper mill

Pesticides                                        50
Synthetic rubber                                 1002
Steel castings and forgings                       40
1/ For 5 ton and heavier vehicles only.
2/ Recent capacity additions which are not yet fully utilized due to
start-up problems are excluded.
3/ A range is quoted since many different products are manufactured in
these sectors.



- 8 -
19.       In 1968/69, overall utilization of capacity is expected to rise
together with production, since only very few expansion plans are scheduled
for implementation.
20.       Partly as a result of the liberalization measures taken in 1966,
which allow and even encourage domestic competition, the variation in utili-
zation between the better and poorer firms is quite pronounced in some sectors.
Even in those industries, where the sector-wide utilization rate is low, some
firms are operating at close to full capacity; these firms have been able to
build up a strong competitive position either by manufacturing a better quality
product or by employing more dynamic marketing techniques. For example, among
the commercial vehicle manufacturers, one (which has about 40 percent of the
heavy trucks production capacity) is selling all it can produce, while others
which together account for an equal percentage of production capacity are only
working between 15 and 40 percent of capacity. Similar differences in utili-
zation can be found in a number of other sectors.
21.       However, it must be kept in mind that all capacity utilization
figures should be taken with great caution. First, the basis for arriving at
the capacity of installed machinery varies sometimes not only between, but even
within industries, e.g., whether machines are operated on a one-, two-, or
three-shift basis. Secondly, additions to capacity which are possible with
local machinery frequently become known to the Government only long after they
occur. Thirdly, "full" utilization of rated capacity is often difficult to
attain due to lack of skilled labor or supervisory personnel, frequent repairs
of machines, etc.
IiPort Content and Maintenance Imports Requirements
22.       The direct import content of products can be divided into three
categories:
(1) components and semi-finished parts;
(2) raw materials, including processed raw materials such
as alloys and sheets, bars, rods, circuits; and
(3) spare parts (including some production tools) for the
machinery used.
As far as components and semi-finished parts are concerned, the attraction of
producing in a protected domestic market has led to the rapid development of
local production capacity. As a result, components presently imported for es-
tablished products, such as trucks in the range between 3 and 9 tons, basic
machine tools, electric motors, cement machinery, etc., have been reduced to
the point where little room appears to be left for further import substitution.
The components still imported are required in India in such small amounts, or
are so complicated to manufacture, that domestic production could be achieved
only at very high cost. For newer products such as tractors, heavyweight and
lightweight trucks and more sophisticated machine tools, the import content
still is substantial, but is being reduced rapidly in almost all cases.

23.       Imports of raw materials have also been reduced substantially as
more and more of these materials are becoming available locally. India
already can supply most of its own needs for such materials as iron, ordinary
steel, aluminum, castings and forgings. Many alloy steels will be produced
in India in substantial quantities in the next few years. But the basic
materials for the production of eaiz industrial raw materials such as copper,
zinc, lead and asbestos will continue to be imported since India lacks the
necessary mineral resources.
24.       Imports of spare parts for the machinery employed presently
account for about 5 to 25 percent of total import requirements, varying
from sector to sector.
25.       The following table shows the estimated average direct import
content of various products:

26.       !hile the import content of many products has been reduced per
unit, the introduction of new products with higher initial import content and
the expected increase in output wrill result for many sectors in a higher
absolute level of imports in 1968/69 than in 1967/68.
Scale of Industries
27.       In many sectors the number of producers is large, as the following
table shows:
Number of Major Producers
Commercial vehicles                        7 2/
Agricultural tractors                      5
hutomotive components
Tires                                    7

Cement mill equipment                    9
Phosphatic fertilizer                     35
Pesticides                                15
In most sectors, a smaller number of producers would be more economical.2/
However, the rate at which new undertakings are added has dropped considerably
in the last few, years and it is likely that the number of producers in most
sectors, except for those few which are still relatively new (like tractors),
will for the foreseeable future be stabilized at about the present level.
Production Costs
28.       In general, production costs in India are higher than in developed
countries. This is due partly to the proliferation of units in most sectors
referred to in the preceding paragraph and the resulting low volume of pro-
duction per unit, but even more to higher prices for-materials and components
and to low labor productivity.
1/  Not including two ordnance factories producing trucks.
2/ For example, it is unlikely that all seven commercial vehicle manufacturers
would be viable economic producers in the long run, even if steps were
taken by the Government--as the Bank has long suggested--to remove restric-
tions on the demand for road transport in India.

29.       Imported raw materials are subject to duties ranging from 15 to
27-1/2 percent ad valorem, For some materials wihich are being imported to
supplement local production, such as lead, zinc and rubber, an additional
excise tariff is imposed to bring the landed price into line with the
domestic price. Indian firms usually import for their oin account rather
than through distributors and, except in the case of the largest firms, their
quantity requirements are such that they usually cannot achieve the highest
volume discounts available. Moreover, because of uncertainty about future
aid commitments, the Government has not felt able to allow individual firms
to negotiate long-term contracts with suppliers which means that they have
to pay spot prices which are usually higher. 'Only recently has the Minerals
and Metals Trading Corporation of India (iMTC) been given permission to
enter into long-term delivery contracts for copper. Imported components and
semi-finished goods are subject to a duty of 40 to 60 percent ad valorem.
30.       Domestic raw materials are generally, except for some basic items
such as pig iron and mild steel sheets, more expensive than the landed cost
of comparable imports. Appendix VII shows a comparison between domestic
and international prices for some basic raw materials.
31.       The search for further substitution of domestic raw materials for
imports has, in a number of instances, taken the form of using an entirely
different material as, for example, aluminum substituting for copper as con-
ductor material, rayon for nylon plies in tire production, PVC for paper as
cable insulation, and alloy bars for alloy tubes in ball bearings.
32.       Domestic components are frequently more expensive than the landed
cost of their imported counterparts as a result of the higher prices of local
raw materials and the small volume manufactured.
33.       Another factor which adds to the cost of manufacture is the rather
high rejection and wastage rate for many domestic materials and components.
34.       The efforts expended in import substitution have resulted in sub-
stantial foreign exchange savings over the last decade, though often at a
rather high cost to the economy. The Government may wish to consider the
idea of establishing for each product or group of products a limit in the
license for production imports, within which each manufacturer would be
free to import any restricted item and even some which are banned. As
long as such a limit could be fixed at a level which would avoid a major
impact on the balance of payments, this would not only ensure that the
items which are most uneconomical to produce in India (and therefore the
most expensive) would no longer be made domestically, but would also expose
domestic producers generally to at least limited international competition.
Such a modification in the import licensing system would also offer a
solution to many frustrating and time-consuming disputes about the present
administration of the "banned" list.



- 12 -
35.       W1age rates went up considerably in the last two years, when the
cost of living rose as a result of higher food prices, since large portions
are paid in the form of dearness allowances. Still, wage rates in India
are quite low compared with the rest of the world. The average pay for a
skilled worker in industry is around Rs. 300 per month and for an unskilled
worker about Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 per month. Lower wage rates, however, do
not contribute as much as one would expect to a more favorable cost structure,
because almost all companies have excess labor. Labor relations have been
unstable, particularly in the context of political uncertainties in some of
the important industrialized States such as West Bengal and Bihar. Enforce-
ment of labor laws has also been fraught with difficulties. Consequently,
major reductions of the labor force in response to cutbacks in production
have not been found feasible and few firms have been able to adapt their
work force fully to requirements of production or to obtain adequate pro-
ductivity levels from the labor employed.
Financing Costs
36.       Since many purchasers (especially government agencies) have been
slow to make payments in the last year or so, and because of the increasing
use of credit as a sales device, the amount of receivables carried by most
of the firms has increased substantially. Payment time for all but the
most liquid firms has lengthened correspondingly to the extent that many of
the firms are now taking 60 to 90 days to pay off their suppliers. The
net result is that bank advances to the engineering sectors have growm by
about 75 percent over the same period a year ago. These increased short-
term borrowings at rates in the 9 to 1l percent per annum range have
affected considerably the awareness of the cost of working capital among
many of the firms. As a result, firms have generally brought inventories
dowon to a more reasonable level.
37.       Firms which went ahead wTith capital investments during the last
two years were usually able to finance a large portion of total requirements
from internal sources and had little difficulty in getting the balance of
long-term funds needed from banks or other sources. A number of
firms which cancelled or postponed capital outlays did so mainly out of
pessimism over future sales and profits prospects. Neither the availability
nor the cost of financing seem to have been a constraint in making expan-
sion plans.
Prices and Profits
38.       All formal price controls have been abolished in the IDA sectors,
but informal controls in terms of guidelines (as in the case of auto
ancillaries) or in similar forms (as for example in the case of tires) still
exist. In most sectors prices are also influenced by the Government through
its large scale purchases. However, increased competition has led to price
reductions between 10 and 40 percent in many of the established product lines,
such as cables, certain items of electrical equipment, ball bearings, steel
castings, some industrial machinery and one or two automobile ancillary pro-
ducts.



- 13 -
39.       Profits fell in almost every sector in 1967/68, due to increases
in production cost and, in some instances, reduction of sales or cutbacks
in prices. However, there are large variations in profitability between
sectors and among firms within a sector. For instance, the battery and
valve manufacturers still have an income before depreciation and taxes
of about 30 to 40 percent of gross assets employed while the machine tool,
commercial vehicle and industrial and mining machinery sectors are only
achieving returns between 5 and 15 percent.
Summary
40.       The present situation of industry in India can be summarized as
follows: Now that foreign exchange for production imports has been readily
available for some time, it is possible for industrialists to recognize the
other factors constraining efficient production, to assess their relative
importance and, to the extent that matters are wsithin their control, to
deal with them effectively. Design and technology improvements are being
initiated, production controls are being strengthened to assure consistent
quality, action is being taken to reduce costs by bringing down inventory levels
and by attempts to improve labor productivity, and mosT firms are making
efforts to improve their competitive position in general. It will take some
more time before major achievements will be evident, because this is
necessarily a gradual process, as has been recognized by earlier IDA missions
to India, but there is no doubt that the industry is aware of the problems and
has set out to solve them.
C.  Exports
h1.       The importance of increased export earnings for India's balance
of payments situation has been consistently emphasized by the Bank, most
recently in paragraphs 41 - h5 of the "Note on India's Current Economic
Situation and Foreign Aid Requirements", distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 1, 1968 (R 68-61). Being aware of the urgent need for
higher exports, the Government of India has, in the last year or so, intro-
duced various export promotion schemes, such as cash subsidies, drawbacks
on import and excise duties, replenishment of import licenses for raw
materials and components on a preferred basis, provision of certain
indigenous raw materials at "international" prices, credit facilities, tax
concessions and foreign exchange facilities for export marketing efforts.
These schemes are described in Appendix VIII. Partly as a result of these
promotion efforts, exports of engineering goods - though still accounting
for only 2 percent of total exports - are showing substantial improvement
and, as the following table indicates, export sales during the first nine
months of the Indian fiscal year 1967/68 were about 25 percent larger than
during the same period in 1966/67.

Exports of Engineering Goods
(excluding iron and steel)
Rs. Million   US$ Mlillion
1960/61                   85           17.8
196h/65                  143           30.1
1965/66                  169           35.5

Apr./Dec. 1966           165           22.0
Apr./Dec. 1967           205           27.3
The Government estimates that 1968/69 exports will be about 35 to 50 percent
higher than in 1967/68. Recently some substantial export orders for power
equipment, railway wagons and steel products, with a total value of over
US$)40 million,have been secured.  Some of these contracts were won by Indian
firms in open competition on a global scale.
)42.      Also encouraging is the change in the regional distribution of
exports of engineering goods (excluding iron and steel) during the last ten
years:
1956/57               1966/67
Exports to:            In Percent of Total   In Percent of Total
Africa                            23                    20
Asia (including Middle East)      72                    46
Europe                             1.5                  25
of which East block               _                    8
U.S. & Canada                      0.5                   6
Other countries                    3                     3
of which Latin America            -                    1.5
The heavy increase of exports to European countries, where the markets are
highly competitive, is particularly impressive.
43.       However, there is a serious risk that the present interest in
export sales, which are often made at marginal cost, will deteriorate iwhen
local demand picks up again. The cash incentives are not sufficient to
compensate exporters fully for the high cost of materials and components,
and they face the export market ilth a cost disadvantage.  In addition there
are some other factors which inhibit further export growth, such as outdated
design, variations in quality, restrictions written into collaboration agree-
ments, high shipping costs, lack of an adequate sales organization, and unfa-
miliarity of potential customers with Indian products. When these problems
have been solved satisfactorily, Indian industry may well achieve further sub-
stantial increases in export sales.

IV. THE PROPOSED CREDIT
44.       The proposed credit of US$125 million would provide capital goods
and agricultural chemicals to the Indian oconomy by financing imports of raw
materials, components, spare parts and some balancing equipment required by
manufacturers of commercial vehicles, machine tools, electrical equipment,
fertilizer, pesticides and similar products. The same sectors would be
covered as in the fourth industrial imports credit. These sectors account
for most of the capital goods, agricultural inputs and industrial raw materials
produced in India. The range of goods to be imported would also be the same
as under the fourth credit. An amount of US$2 million would be set aside for
balancing equipment.
A. Economic Justification
45.       The Economic Report distributed to the Executive Directors on
January 10, 1968 (R68-6) and the updating Note, distributed on May 1, 1968
(R68-61), described India's current economic situation and foreign aid require-
ments for 1968/69. As can be seen in those documents, the combined effects
of the continuing industrial depression, the relatively low volume of public
sector plan expenditures, and the continuing influence of the recent devalu-
ation of the rupee tended to keep down the volume of imports, while the
relaxation of controls, and the added emphasis on fully meeting demand for
fertilizer and pesticides, acted in the opposite direction. Overall, the
volume of non-food imports remained low, lower than in all of the previous
years except 1966/67. However, imports financed by project aid having fallen
by about US$150 miUion, other non-food imports increased, probably by more
than US$200 million in 1967/68.
46.       In view of the likely increase in industrial production in 1968/69
by about 5 percent over the previous year, and the need for a further increase
in fertilizer imports, it now appears that non-project, non-food imports may
show a further rise of about US$150 million in 1968/69. Calculations on aid.
requirements for 1968/69 are presented in the updating Note (968-61), which
also considers policy alternatives if the required aid should not be available
(paragraphs 46 and seq.).
47.       The Note also explains the need for a large share of this aid to
take forms other than financing the foreign exchange costs of specific
investment projects. To repeat the argument briefly, India needs foreign aid
because of its extreme poverty. Yet its natural and human resources and its
past investment policy combine to make it relatively advantageous for India
to manufacture much of the finished capital equipment it needs. The total
imports of India are relatively modest; they never exceeded US$3 billion,
thus amounting to less than US$6 per capita in recent years; and only a small



- 16 -
proportion of this figure has been used for the import of finished capital
goods. On the other hand, India must import many raw materials, sophisticated
components and products for which established capacity is not yet adequate,
like fertilizer or some special steels. Clearly, aid limited to financing
imports of capital goods could make but a very small contribution to financing
India's investment needs.
48.       The past four industrial imports credits, as well as the proposed
new one, make an important contribution to investment. Precise
calculation is impossible, but it is clear that within only a few months of
disbursement, the import of production goods financed by the credits yields
an overall increase in the production of investment goods and agricultural
chemicals which is a large multiple of credit disbursements. Indirectly, the
return from the credit is even greater since the industrial imports credits
play an essential role within the total non-project aid provided by the India
Consortium. These credits not only contribute to the total aid required, but,
because of their being untied as to the origin of imports, they help increase
the efficiency with which country-tied credits can be utilized. The continu-
ation of the liberalized import policy introduced in June 1966 depends on
both these factors - the availability of sufficient non-project aid and adequate
flexibility in its use.
B. Production Estimates
49.       Many of the sectors covered expect to achieve significant increases
in their production in 1968/69. Production estimates for 1968/69 are shown
in Appendix II. In all but a few of them sufficient idle capacity is avail-
able to allow substantial production increases without further investment.
All sectors should be operating at higher capacity utilization levels than in
1967/68. Since most firms in the IDA sectors have, in -the last year or two,
brought their materials inventories down to a more reasonable level which they
are expected to maintain for some time to come, increased production will
fairly promptly result in higher import orders.
C. Fe     x   hLe   Reauirements
50.       The foreign exchange requirements of these sectors during 1968/69
have been estimated at about US$225 million. (See Appendix IX for details).
The total amount of licenses issued to firms in the IDA sectors, and the IDA
licenses which are part of the total, are shown in Appendix III. As of
March 31, 1968, the Gavernment has issued foreign exchange licenses, in the
expectation that they would be covered out of IDA credits or free foreign
exchange earnings, in an amount of US$170 million in excess of previous IDA



- 17 -
credits. At the same time, licenses to be covered out of future U.S. AID
and West German credits had been issued in amounts of US$100 million and
US$10-15 million, respectively. Licenses to be issued in 1968/69 should be
about equal to consumption of previously imported goods, since under the
current policy import licenses are issued on a replenishment basis.
D. Administration of Proposed Credit
51.       The procedures to be used for the issue of foreign exchange licenses
would be as laid down in the Import Trade Control Policy for 1968/69, described
in Appendix VI. As in the case of the previous industrial imports credits,
there will be no specific procurement procedures. The recent mission to India
has confirmed the finding of earlier missions, that manufacturers, to the
extent that they do not have to purchase components from certain sources such
as their collaborators, make every attempt to find the optimal source of supply.
Past credits have financed purchases from many different countries including
not only the traditional exporting nations, but numerous others in Africa,
Asia and Latin America. Disbursements under the proposed credit would again
be made only against foreign exchange expenditures within member countries of
the IBRD and Switzerland.
52.       The time lag between issuance of a license and the payment of foreign
exchange by the commercial bank in India for the goods imported under the li-
cense is between 3 and 18 months. Withdrawal applications to the Association
cover foreign exchange expenditures made anywhere between 1 and 12 months
before receipt of the request by the Association, with a weighted average in
recent months of about 20 weeks. This means that the last withdrawal appli-
cation exhausting the fourth credit, which was received in May 1968, covered
imports which, on the average, had been licensed some time around early 1967
and that the fourth credit was sufficient, broadly speaking, to finance
foreign exchange payments which had been made up to the end of 1967. However,
in keeping with its policy of meeting in full the foreign exchange require-
ments of the 59 priority industries as and when needed, the Government has
continued to issue licenses upon application.
53.       With regard to disbursements under the proposed credit, the
Association would continue to refinance expenditures under "IDA licenses" on
the basis of withdrawal applications submitted to the Association after the
fourth credit has been fully utilized.  However, no withdrawals would be made
on account of expenditures prior to January 1, 1968. The disbursement of
the previous IDA credits on a quarterly basis is shown in Appendix V. It is
estimated that withdrawal applications will be received at the rate of about
US$12-15 million per month, and that the credit would be fully disbursed
during the first quarter of 1969.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
54.       The proposed credit is sound and economically justified.  It
would help provide capital goods and agricultural chemicals to the Indian
economy by supplying part of the foreign exchange requirements of manu-
facturers of such goods.
55.       The Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$125 million to
India on the usual IDA terms. To ensure that the purpose of the credit
would be achieved, the Government of India has confirmed that:
(a) during the period ending March 31, 1969, it will continue
to make available to the firms in the IDA sectors all foreign
exchange needed for the import of sufficient materials, com-
ponents and spare parts to assure that these firms will not
be constrained by a lack of foreign exchange in their production
for the domestic civilian market and for export;
(b) in accordance with the current licensing procedure for
maintenance imports and unless otherwise agreed with the
Association, it will continue to issue licenses as and
when needed by the firms in the IDA sectors to provide
the basis for continued production; and
(c) it will continue to allow firms in the IDA sectors to
acquire and operate imported balancing equipment required

APPENDIX VI
PRESENT LICENSING PROCEDURES
Industrial License
1.        The industrial license used to be the primary tool of the Government
in guiding the general course of industrial development and was mainly intended
to ensure geographic dispersal, to balance investment among different products
and to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of large industrial
groups. However, this license has now lost its overriding importance. Thirty-
eight industries have been entirely exempted (a list of these industries is
shown in Appendix X ). The development in most other industries is influenced
by the existence of excess capacity as well as by the liberalization of the
procedures for expansion and diversification. During the last year, agri-
cultural tractors and power tillers were added to the list of exempted
industries, and the Government has repeatedly emphasized its intention to pro-
ceed further with decontrol as and when circumstances permit.
2.        The industrial license is still a constraining factor in all sectors
where production is at full capacity, such as tires and batteries, but also
in all cases where for a permissible expansion (within 25 percent of presently
licensed capacity) imported capital goods are required.
Capital Goods License
3.        The licensing of capital goods imports has long been the major
control device in the establishment, expansion and diversification of indus-
tries. Such licenses are issued by the Capital Goods Committee (CGC) on
which several ministries of the Government and the Planning Commission are
represented; all licenses are matched with existing sources of foreign exchange,
mostly bilateral aid. The criteria used by the CGC have never been clearly
formulated or publicly announced; however, it seems clear that such factors
as future foreign exchange savings and priority of the industry within the
Plan are taken into consideration. The procedure is very time-consuming,
primarily because each application is closely scrutinized to avoid import of
goods which are available domestically. To facilitate the enforcement of this
policy, the GOI annually publishes lists of items, the import of which is
either completely "banned", on the ground that they are domestically availablet
or "restricted" to cases where imports are necessary to supplement indigenous
production.
4.        It is to be noted, however, that the development of the local
capital goods industries has allowed many expansion and diversification pro-
jects to be carried out with local machinery, thereby lessening the dependence
of manufacturers on the CGC; this process will continue, particularly in view
of the present diversification plans in the machine tool and heavy mechanical
equipment sectors.



- 26 -
Maintenance Import License
5.        With respect to maintenance import licenses, major improvements
have been made since the devaluation. Basically, the firms belonging to the
59 priority industries have received, and are cont'nuing to receive, sufficient
licenses to import all raw materials, components it and spare parts for their
machinery which they require in order to manufacture as much as they can sell.
For nearly two years now licenses have been issued on a continuous basis as
firms applied, provided they could show that goods representing 60 percent of
the previous license value had actually been shipped or that for 90 percent of
the license value letters of credit had been opened. This procedure has been
slightly modified as of April 1, 1968. Licenses are now issued on a direct
replenishment basis, which means that a firm can request a license at any time
to replenish the amount of imported raw materials and components consumed
during the previous three to six months, provided the unutilized portion of
outstanding licenses in hand on the date of application is less than the CIF
value of the consumed items which the new license is intended to replenish.
6.        For some specified industries with long lead times such as industrial
and mining machinery, the licensing authorities can issue import licenses for
a value in excess of the consumption shown if the applicant justifies such a
request. However, not all industries with long lead times have been included
in this list of exceptions (e.g., the heavy electrical equipment sector is not
mentioned) and therefore amendments will be necessary.
7.        The continuous replenishment concept should further improve the
production imports licensing procedures, provided enough flexibility is ex-
tended in its application to take account of major increases or cutbacks in
production.
8.        Each import license lists the items which the company is authorized
to import for the production of a group of products, including items which in
the past had to be licensed by the Iron and Steel Controller. The values of
individual items to be imported are not specified and firms are able to import
practically any listed item up to the full value of the license. Thus, when
placing orders, firms are assured that items ordered can be cleared by the
customs authorities, although in many cases there are still substantial delays
due to actual customs procedures.
9.        Licenses for spare parts for the machinery used in the production
are now issued upon separate applications which have to be filed on an annual
basis. However, to provide for emergency cases, the general import licenses
1/ Including replacement parts needed to service products manufactured
and sold previously.



- 27 -
for raw materials and components are also valid for the import of spare parts
up to 25 percent of the value of such licenses.
10.       The import of raw materials, components and spare parts which are
deemed available indigenously is also "banned" or "restricted".  Disputes
about the administration of the "banned" list are frequent. Often items
which have been banned are not yet available, or not in adequate quality,
not in the small quantity required by a firm or not within a reasonable
delivery period. The Government appears to apply the banned list rigidly
and the delays experienced by many firms in this context are substantial.
11.       Production import licenses are generally valid for 12 months; in
some cases where licenses are issued under certain credit sources which expire
less than 12 months after the issue date of the license, the validity is
accordingly shorter. The license must be valid when the goods to be imported
under it are dispatched. To allow for delays which are beyond the control of
the importer, a general grace period of 30 days is allowed. Licenses which
have not been utilized within the original period of validity can be, and
usually are, revalidated for a period up to six months.  But, revalidation is
a cumbersome procedure. The limitation of original validity to 12 months has
resulted in difficulties for some firms with long lead times. Under the
direct replenishment system currently used, it should be possible to issue
in all cases where sophisticated components are included licenses which are
valid for, say, 2h months.
12.       In accordance with earlier recommendations of IDA, the entire
production imports system as described above is now also applicable to public
sector undertakings.

APPENDIX VIII
EXPORT INCENTIVE SCHEMES
Cash Subsidies
1.        These are paid at basic rates of between 10 and 25 percent of the
FOB value of exports on many items manufactured by the engineering industries,
including commercial vehicles, power cables and dry batteries (10 percent);
electric motors, transformers, control- and switchgear, alternators, pesticides
and insecticides (15 percent); industrial machinery, machine tools and iron
castings (20 percent) and steel castings (25 percent). An additional cash
assistance was only very recently instituted: exporters of certain specified
products receive a further amount of 5 or 10 percent if the FOB value of their
total export sales during the period March 1, 1968-February 28, 1969, exceeds
by at least 10 percent their exports during the previous 12-month period (e.g.,
machine tools and iron castings, +5 percent; electric transformers and control-
gear and switchgear, +10 percent). About 11 percent of total exports (by
value) are presently covered by cash subsidies. The value of total cash sub-
sidies disbursed amounted to Rs. 24.7 million in 1966/67 and about Rs. 65
million in the first eight months of 1967/68 alone. However, almost constant
changes in the cash assistance rates and additions to, and deletions from, the
list of items eligible for such assistance have led to considerable confusion
among the exporters. The mission has met many manufacturers who did not know
the cash assistance rate presently applicable to their products. Very recently
the Government decided that the rates presently in force would not be changed
for a year.
Drawbacks
2.        Drawbacks on import and excise duties are basically intended to
compensate the manufacturer-exporter for the total amount by which the raw
materials and components used in the exported article have been burdened on
account of such duties. For most finished goods it is very difficult to
identify exactly that part of the sales price which is due to import and excise
duties paid by the exporter or his local suppliers. For that reason drawback
rates on a general basis have been set for a number of articles. In respect
of all other exported goods the drawback rates are fixed by the Government
upon application by the exporter. If other manufacturers wish to export an
identical article, the published drawback rate will apply; if, however, the
import content is different, a new drawback rate has to be set. A number of
problems arise out of this: the procedure for the fixing of a rate is very
cumbersome and time-consuming; it sometimes takes many months. As to raw
materials, only the amount actually contained in the finished product is
recognized; material wasted in the production process - which is unavoidable
and can be substantial - is not taken into account. Industrialists believe
that the drawback almost invariably is less, sometimes by a substantial degree,
than full compensation.



30 -
3.        The uncertainty about the amount of the drawback rate makes it
very difficult for exporters to quote a price, particularly so since export
prices seldom include a profit which is large enough that out of it a lower
drawback payment than anticipated could be made up. In addition, substantial
amounts of working capital can be tied up for long periods.
Preferences and Penalties in Licensing
4.       Under the import trade control policy for the current year, all
firms, which exported at least 10 percent of their production(valued at pro-
duction cost)in 1967/68, will obtain foreign exchange from the source of their
choice for their maintenance imports and will also receive preferential treat-
ment when they apply for licenses for capital goods to expand or improve their
installed production capacity. Under this system the first preference in
utilization of IDA money will be given to exporters. Not many firms in the
IDA sectors will meet the 10 percent requirement.
5.        However, by the same token ten industries were singled out and
specific export obligations were stipulated for them. In these industries
only those firms which exported more than 5 percent of their production in
1967/68 will have their maintenance import requirements met in full and to
the extent possible from preferred sources. The requirements of companies
which in 1967/68 failed to achieve this minimum export performance, even
though they have been in production for more than five years, will not be met
from preferred sources and are liable to be cut in the event that available
foreign exchange is insufficient. Most important among the industries which
are subject to this export obligation are the automobile ancillaries. In some
sectors of this industry a few major producers passed the 5 percent mark in
1967/68, and other producers are in a position, with some effort, to increase
their overseas sales in the current year to 5%. But there are many small
manufacturers in this industry who have little or no real long-term export
potential and who should not be forced to incur the additional overhead ex-
penses necessarily connected with attempts to sell abroad.
Replenishment of Iort Licenses for Raw Materials and Co=~nents
6.        Exporters of a great number of specified products receive, upon
proof of export, "import entitlement" licenses to replenish from the most pre-
ferred sources the imported raw materials and components used in the manu-
facture of the exported products. The extent of replenishment, i.e., the
value of the import license for which the exporter is eligible against each
exported product, is expressed in terms of a percentage of the FOB value of
the export, set forth in a list which is published annually.
7.        For firms receiving import licenses financed by IDA credits, this
replenishment or "import entitlement" license has no direct advantage. How-
ever, unlike regular licenses such as those financed from IDA funds, these



- 31 -
import entitlement licenses may legally be transferred to other firms
manufacturing similar products. It seems that there are a great number of
mostly small-scale manufacturers who do not receive general maintenance im-
port licenses in large enough amounts or in the currency they wish to use, so
that they are willing to purchase "import entitlement" licenses at a premium.
The premium presently is said to be about 15-25 percent. Some exporters are
able to export with a profit primarily on account of this premium.
Provision of Certain Categories of Indigenous Iron and Steel at International
Prices
8.        To compensate manufacturers of engineering goods for exports for
the high price level of local iron and steel, the "Joint Plant Committee
Engineering Goods Export Assistance Fund" was constituted by the Government.
From this fund fabricators are reimbursed - upon proof of completed export -
for part of the difference between domestic and international prices for pig
iron and certain categories of steel used to manufacture the exported goods,
including necessary wastage.
Export Credit Facilities
9.        Short term pre-shipment credit granted by commercial banks to
exporters of engineering products is extended at 6 percent per annum; the
commercial bank can discount such credit at the Reserve Bank of India at 4-1/2
percent per annum.
10.       Medium term export credit by commercial banks is extended to the
exporter at 6 percent interest per annum and may be refinanced with the In-
dustrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) at the rate of 4-1/2 percent per
annum. Such refinancing is generally available for periods up to seven years,
and in exceptionally deserving cases for a maximum period of ten years. Before
the IDBI will discount such credits, a guarantee by the Export Credit and
Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) for two-thirds or, in the case of small exporters,
nine-tenth; of the credit has to be secured.
11.       Even though both these refinancing facilities are given irrespective
of the net liquidity position of the lending commercial bank, and credit so
extended is not counted against the net liquidity position, some commercial
banks are said to be rather reluctant to enter into such credit agreements,
mainly because they have to carry part of the risk and because the profit
margin is very small after the expenses have been deducted from the 1.5 percent
spread.
Tax Concessions
12.       Tax concessions for export marketing, to encourage exporters to
develop their marketing competence, have recently been announced as part of



- 32 -
the 1968/69 Budget, in the form of an "export markets development allowance".
Tax payers (except foreign-held companies) incurring expenditures for the
development of export markets will be allowed deduction of 150 percent of such
expenditures as advertisements and pub]icity, distribution costs, maintenance -
outside India - of an export promotion office or agency, travel costs for
export promotion trips, and performance of services - outside of India. - in
connection with export contracts.
Export Promotion Travel
13.       Firms which have a record of export performance (Rs. 500,000
minimum amnual export performance) receive, upon their application, blanket
foreign exchange licenses to cover necessary business trips, the purchase
of specifications, market studies, advertising, and participation in overseas
exhibitions, trade fairs and trade centers. Under these blanket licenses,
travel clearance and foreign exchange are available on very short notice.
Snaller firms with no export record on the other hand apparently find it
difficult to receive a. license promptly when needed; applications for ad hoc
licenses are at times processed with such delays that the prospective exporter
cannot compete effectively in foreign markets.
Public Relations
14.       The Government is presently considering (i) the establishment of
an autonomous organization with the task of internal and external publicity
for India's exports by developing integrated publicity programs and coordina-
ting the activities of the various institutions presently engaged in this
field and (ii) the allocation of an amount equivalent to 1 percent of export
earnings for expenditures on commercial publicity within India and abroad. If
the proposed new organization would concentrate internally on the improvement
of the export consciousness of industrialists and externally on projecting the
image of India as an industrializing country, its contribution could be
valuable.
