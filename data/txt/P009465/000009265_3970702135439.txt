CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1  Preamble
This report presents a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for
the Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
(RRMP-II) under the Ministry of Communication (MoC),
Government of Bangladesh, in which an estimated 121 ha of
land will be acquired and around 8700 persons displaced.
The report has been based on various pertinent documents,
including the Project Concept Paper and Project Appraisal
Report. Discussion with the MoC, RHD and the World Bank and
at an inter-ministerial meeting has been extremely useful
in improving the document.
Most importantly, the report draws upon a socio-economic
survey  conducted  by  The  Christian  Commission  for
Development in Bangladesh (CCDB) during December 1993 and
January 1994. Multidisciplinary Action Research Centre
(MARC) has provided full technical assistance in the
preparation of this Report.
1.2  Project Background
The Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh (GoB)
undertook RRMP-II with financial assistance from the World
Bank in the north western region of Bangladesh at an
estimated cost of US$ 220 million. The project aims to
improve the existing highways and roads through rehabili-
tation and maintenance activities and the construction of
necessary by-passes/additions to avoid congestions near
major urban centres and erosion from the Padma river.
The tentative lengths and descriptions of the proposed by-
passes and new additions are as follows :
i)   Rajshahi-Nawabganj Alternate Route   (12 km): This
stretch of road will pass through thinly populated
agricultural land;
ii)  Natore By-pass (6.0 km): Four km will be built on an
existing embankment while the remaining two km will
require acquisition of land;
iii) saidpur Town By-pass (5.0 km) : Four km is through a
semi-urban area and one km is through agricultural
land;
iv)  Ghagot River Realigned Route  (0.8 km): Realignment at
the bridge across Ghagot river will require acquisi-
tion of land along a strip 0.8 km long; and
1



v)   Dasuria intersection  (0.5 km)   : The intersection
will pass through thinly. populated agricultural land
and would require acquisition along a 0.5 km strip.
The alignment of the proposed roads and by-passes
necessitates the acquisition of land in Eive geographical
locations. The total quantity of land was earlier estimated
around 120 hectares (RHD/detailed designs), but it was
stated to be much higher in the most recent socio-economic
survey conducted by CCDB. It is very likely that there has
been a substantial over-estimation of land in the socio-
economic survey, particularly in Saidpur where considerable
confusion existed among the affected persons as they had
still not been served with Section 3 notice. The revised
estimate of the amount of land to be acquired is 121 ha,
subject to confirmation after the joint verification
exercise.
It is estimated that the acquisition of land will directly
and indirectly displace a considerable number of persons,
around 8700, who will be worse off as a result of losses of
assets such as land, houses and trees, and/or through
disruptions of their economic activities.

The maps of the 5 project sites are attached to this
Chapter. The following table (Table 1.0) gives the status
of land acquisition at the 5 project sites, at the time of
concluding the socio-economic survey.
.1.3  Goals and Objectives of RAP
The Resettlement Action Plan for RRMP-II has two main
goals, namely,
1.   Ensure a fair compensation for all persons who are
directly or indirectly affected by land acquisition
for the project, and
2.   Evolve a modus operandi to implement resettlement
activities in an effective and efficient manner.
In achieving the above goals, the Resettlement Action Plan
has the following specific objectives :
a.   Develop a Policy Framework by clearly defining various
categories of project affected persons (PAPs) and
specifying their entitlements to compensation as
admissible       under   the   law   and   project
conditionalities;
b.   Assess the socio-economic status of the PAPs prior to
land acquisition, which should serve as a benchmark
for future reference, and find out about the PAPs' own
views on various resettlement issues;
c.   Determine the quantities of compensation in cash and
kind that is payable to each PAP under the adopted
policy framework; and
d.   Formulate    an    implementation    strategy    and
organisational structure to carry out the resettlement
of PAPs.

CHAPTER 2
COHPENSATION AND RESETTLEMENT POLICIES
2.1  The Basis of Resettlement  Policies in RRMP-II
Acquisition of land for RRMP-II will be under the legal
framework of the 1982 Ordinance (see Annex 1). Resettlement
of the displaced persons involving payment of compensation,
physical   relocation   (where   needed),   and   economic
rehabilitation will be guided both by the provisions of
this Ordinance and Operational Directive 4.30 of the Worl
Bank.
The 1982 Ordinance has a number of weaknesses which give
rise to several well known problems. The most serious among
them is the determination of cash compensation for land on
the basis of registered land prices, which are in general
substantially undervalued in order to avoid stamp duties on
land transfer. Inspite of the recent (1993) amendment
raising the additional premium from 20 to 50 percent, the
compensation is unlikely to ensure equivalence with the
prevailing market price. There are also no provisions for
the resettlement of squatters. The deficiencies in the
existing legal framework for land acquisition have been
pointed out and remedial measur-es suggested. by several
studies, including the recently concluded FAP-15.
Furthermore, the World Bank has a set of guidelines
specified under its Operational Directive 4.30 (See Annex
2) compliance with which is binding for all Bank funded
projects involving land acquisition. The fundamental
principle underpinning OD 4.30 is that the PAPs should not
be worse off as a result of land acquisition and adequate
efforts must be built into the project to ensure this.
All these pressures for a more humane approach to dealing
with persons displaced involuntarily by an infrastructure
project involving land acquisition has created a condition
in Bangladesh which is congenial for the modification of
the existing legal framework. This is evident from the
1993. Amendment to 1982 Ordinance and the incorporation of
many new elements in the Revised Resettlement Action Plan
for   the  Jamuna   Multipurpose   Bridge   Project.   The
Resettlement Action Plan, while staying within the broad
limits of law, purports to take advantage of this mood of
creative rethinking and take a few more steps towards
making resettlement as fair as possible from every angle.
The development of this policy package has benefitted from
several interactions with the main interest groups : the
PAPs, RHD and the World Bank. In particular, the
inter-ministerial meeting of January 25, 1994, chaired by
the Secretary, Ministry of Communications, GOB, which
approved the proposed policy package after a thorough and
critical review, was very useful. Various modifications
suggested in this meeting have been incorporated in the
policy package used for this action plan.
11



Lastly, the compensation and resettlement policies adopted
hereunder have also benefitted from a socio-economic survey
(see Chapter 3) of all PAHs at the 5 project sites
involving land acquisition. Since the two exercises were
carried out simultaneously, it was not possible to base the
policy package on a quantitative analysis of the survey
data, but there was enough feedback from the field to
inform the policy formulation process on types of losses
*            and people's expectation on compensation.
2.2  Types of Losses : Direct and Indirect
Land Acquisition results in two broad types of losses :
direct and indirect. The direct losses stem from the loss
of land (a valued asset by itself in overcrowded and
predominantly agrarian Bangladesh) and anything else of a
permanent or semi-permanent nature that stand on acquired
land, such as a house, a shop or a tree. Indirect losses
result from a dislocation or economic disruption caused
either through the loss of possession or access to an asset
or in one's residential status which leads to higher cost
or a lower income. For example, a sharecropper of long
standing will suddenly find that he has no opportunity for
sharecropping after his landlord had lost the land he used
to lease. Likewise, a live-in wage labourer in a farm house
which has been acquired, will find himself without a job
after the farmer moves away.
The major categories of losses along with distinct sub-
categories are listed below.
A. Direct Losses
1. Land      : homestead
: agricultural
- crops
- orchards & bamboo groves
- ponds/ditches (cultured or uncultured)
- fallow/grazing
others (eg commercial)
2. Structure : houses
- bedrooms
- sitting rooms
- bed-sitter
- bed-store
- store
- cowshed
- kitchen
- toilet
shops
industrial units (factories, rice
milling yards)
3.-Trees     : fruit trees
- large
- medium
- small
timber & wood trees
12



- large
- medium
- small
D. Indirect Losses
1. Use right over homestead/shop land :
- for squatters (unauthorised)
*                               - for sons/relatives (authorised)
2. Access to farming land :
*                               - for share croppers
- for leaseholders
3. Possession of mortgaged property :
- land collateral
- house collateral
- tree collateral
4. Business : - trading
- processing/industries
5. Employment: - wage earners (eg farm house acquired)
- salaried jobs (eg factory acquired)
2.3  Entitlements-and Entitled Persons : Principles, Strategies
and Application
2.3.1     Some General Principles :
It has already been noted that the loss of a productive
asset, such as land, houses or trees, implies two types of
losses : a loss of wealth, and a loss of income (future
stream). A resettlement policy consistent with OD 4.30
should provide for compensation on both counts.
The compensation for losing ownership should ideally be
fixed at the market price of the asset at the time of
paying compensation, so that the affected person can
replace his lost asset with something comparable from the
market, with or without the assistance of the authorities.
Likewise, compensation for losing potential income from the
asset should be fixed at the total loss of income over a
period of time, reasonably assumed to be required to
overcome the dislocations caused by land acquisition. Such
a period will differ from asset to asset and will generally
vary between six months to a year (or more in some special
cases).
When ownership and possession of property vest in the same
person, he/she will be entitled to both types of
compensation. However, when these are separated, as in case
of share-cropped land or a rented shop, the compensation
for possession/use right has to be shared according to the
conditions underlying such possession/use arrangements.
In order to avoid manipulations in the assessment and
payment of compensation, it is necessary to follow a firm
cut-off date to ascertain entitlement of the right people.
13



For the purpose of this resettlement plan the cut-off date
for the identification of entitled persons in respect of
direct losse1 will be the date of serving section 3 notice,
while for indirect losses it will be the date of the socio-
economic survey conducted by CCDB subject to later
confirmation.
2.3.2     Compensation strategies
Most of the identifiable losses, except the squatters'
claim to some land where they can move their houses or
shops, have been recognised in law and provisions made for
their compensation. However, problems occur in the
prescribed methodology for determining compensation. For
example, the 1982 Ordinance specifies the 'market value' of
a property as its compensation. However, it mentions the
date of serving section 3 notice as the reference period
for prices and describes a methodology in terms of 'taking
into account the average value, to be calculated in the
prescribed manner, of the properties of similar description
and with similar advantages in the vicinity during the
twelve months preceding the date of publigation of notice
under section 3' (see page 55, Annex-1).
The strategy that has been followed in the RAP is to
harmonise between the legal framework and OD 4.30 by
preparing entitlements that are in principle covered by
law, and reformulate a methodology to reflect the true
intent of the law, and pay the difference between the old
and the new interpretations in the form of some benefit
from the project. In fact, a similar procedure has been
followed in the Jamuna project which was acceptable to GoB
and the World Bank.
It is interesting to note that the 1982 Ordinance does not
stipulate compensation to be payable to 'owners' of
property, but to persons 'interested', which could very
logically be interpreted to include persons in possession.
Furthermore, the law also provides for compensation on
account of 'consequences resulting from change of residence
or of place of business', and for 'damages resulting from
diminution of the profits of the property' between the
dates of first notification and eventual evacuation. Those
provisions could be stretched to cover various cases of
indirect losses including loss of income by sharecroppers,
resident wage labourers and businessmen.
Entitlement and entitled persons are discussed below in
respect cf various direct and indirect losses.
2.3.3     Loss of Ownership and Possession of Land
a.   Entitlement for Ownership :
The legal owners of land to be acquired at the time of
serving section 3 notice are the entitled person for the
loss of ownership, while those in possession of the land at
that time will be entitled to compensation for the loss of
possession (ie use right).
14



The entitlement for ownership should be the replacement
value of land at the time of paying compensation, as
ascertained by a Land Valuation Advisory Team (LVAT), which
is defined in Chapter 5 in respect of its composition and
Term of Reference. The Team will take note of the quality
and quantity of land and make use of different methods and
sources in arriving at as accurate a price of land as
possible along with estimates of price inflation. LVAT's
report will form the basis for the final determination of
compensation by the Deputy Commissioner (PC). Stamp duty
would be exempted if a purchase of land (or waterbody) is
reported within six months of the receipt of compensation.
The exemption would be for upto the amount of land one can
buy using the compensation money.
A question has often been raised about the option of 'land
for land'. It would generally not be necessary in case of
RRMP-II which involves strip acquisition and does not
appear to present problems of land availability. In the
case of squatters when Khas land is available, land for
land will be applicable. In all other cases, including the
squatters when Khas land is not available, the cash
compensation will take care of the need for replacement
land (CCDB will be available to facilitate this process,
particularly  in  case  of  'poor'   and   'handicapped'
households).
In order to have an accurate estimate of land price it is
necessary to categorise land in a sharper manner than has
been done in the past in acquisition schedules. In this
regard it is recommended that agricultural land be
categorised by cropping intensity and waterbodies by their
piscicultural status. band categories should also include
fallow and orchards/woodlots.
b.  Entitlement for Possession (covering sharecroppers,
mortgagors etc)
The compensation for losing the possession of land, owned
or otherwise, should depend on the type and quality of
land which determine its potential for income generation.
Compensation should match the lost income over a period of
disruption following acquisition. In case of agricultural
land it should be approximately the value of one rice crop
for 1-crop land, one and half rice crops for 2-crop land,
and 2 rice crops for 3-crop land. These prices are
estimated at takas 150, 200 and 250 per decimal for single,
double and triple crqpped lands respectively for RRMP-II.
This component of compensation for land will be treated as
a project cost, although it could be covered under law by
making a more flexible interpretation of section 8 of the
1982 qrdinance.
The same principle will be followed in case of other types
of land such as ponds, orchards, etc. In case of
unproductive land such as fallow land or dereiict ponds, a
minimal return will be computed based on local conditions.
In case of sharecropping, the income compensation should be
15



shared between the parties along the line of sharecropping
arrangements. If someone has leased in farm land he would
be entitled to the entire amount of income loss
compensation, provided he has cleared his annual leasing
fees. Mortgagors would, on the other hand, be entitled to
a return of their loan balance out of the cash compensation
for iand in addition to the compensation for losing
possession.
Persons in possession of homestead land should not receive
any possession benefit, since they will receive a similar
benefit for the structure/s.
Implementation Difficulties
Implementation difficulties will arise in ascertaining the
true owner of properties and their accurate market value.
The former results primarily from an antiquated and
inefficient method of land record.system. The problem can
be redressed by a rapid updating of records with the full
cooperation of DC's office and that of the Directorate of
Land Records and Surveys (DLR). Problems also arise in case
of multiple and/or absentee owners.
2.3.4     Loss of ownership and Occupation of Structures
The legal owners of structures to be acquired on their
occupants at the time of serving section 3 notice are
entitled to compensation.
Owners of structures, ie houses, shops, factories etc, are
to be compensated in a manner similar to land, ie payment
of replacement value at the time of acquisition.
Fortunately, law does not stipulate such prices to be
obtained from some obviously underquoted official records
as in case of land, so that a reasonable price can be fixed
through the joint verification exercise based on procedures
currently followed by the Department of Public Works.
However, structures differ from land in two important ways:
(1) they can sometimes be moved; and (2) they can be built
on land which is not owned.
The movability of some structures leads to an alternative
option of compensation in the form of transportation cost
for moving the structure plus reasonable cost of repair on
account of damages incurred in dismantling, transport and
re-installation.
Law also provides for 'reasonable expenses' on account of
change of residence. To quantify of such a reasonable
expense one could identify be the rental cost of a
comparable house for the period when the acquired house is
either. being translocated or a new one being built or hired
in the new place of residence. It is similar to hotel
expenses paid to a government functionary on transfer.
Furthermore, the estimate of compensation could be based on
16



a period of 3 months in case of a residential structure, 6
months for a shop and a factory.
In order to simplify matters a household involved in the
loss of a structure may be paid a lumpsum compensation up
front to defray all transfer related expenses. For RRMP-II
the recommended compensation is Tk. 300 per household member
subject to a minimum of Tk.l,000 and a maximum of Tk.
3.000.
Squatters and Uthulis
Structures on land which is not owned by the owner of the
structure, give rise to the case of squatters, Uthulis and
grown up children in separate households who have not yet
inherited homestead land. This latter category (children
with houses on father's land) and relatives/friends having
a structure with permission, is somewhat different from the
squatters to the extent that they may continue to enjoy the
same privilege in their father's or relative's new
homestead. The squatters by contrast are viewed in law as
unauthorised   settlers  and  hence  evictable  without
compensation. It is however not possible to take such a
strong position against them, and in fact a formula has to
be found to maintain their standard of living after the
acquisition in order to comply with 00 4.30 of the World
Bank.
It has been decided that the squatters and Uthulis be given
a costs/grant equivalent value to a 2.5 decimal plot of
homestead land in case the DC or RHD fails to provide them
with alternative Khas land. As suggested earlier any stamp
duties in purchase are to be exempted.
Indirect losses from a transfer of residence/business are
covered under loss of income.
2.3.5     Loss of Ownership and Enjoyment of Trees
The entitled persons are those who own and/or enjoy the
'fruits' of the trees. Since trees are almost universally
on ground owned or possessed, the entitled person in
respect  of  trees  will  invariably  be  entitled  to
compensation for land.
Trees should, however, be separately counted and valued,
whether they exist in orchards, homestead land or
agricultural fields. Caution needs to be exercised in
putting value on land so that trees are not double counted.
The usual entitlement is the market value of trees as
determined during the joint verification survey where a
forestry expert is supposed to determine the price. There
is considerable variation in prices between the regions and
species as well as between one tree and another. In fact
variation in tree prices would be higher than in land
17



prices. The market survey on trees therefore need to be
conducted with competent people, preferably involving a
forestry expert or a horticulturist.
Tree loss also leads to a loss of income particularly in
case of fruit trees. Therefore, an assessment is needed of
annual income from a tree, keeping in mind that such
incomes are derived from fruits, dead or pruned branches
and leaves (green and/or dead). In order to make
computations easy a fixed percentage of value may be
assumed to be the annual income derived from a tree.
In addition tp the compensation for the trees and their
fruits, the entitled persons will be allowed to cut the
trees and take away all salvageable materials leaving the
site empty and ready for the construction contractor to
move in.
2.3.6     Loss of Income Without Direct Loss of Asset
The types of income losses that stem from the loss of
ownership and/or possession of an income generating asset,
have already been covered under land, structures and trees.
The entitlement was confined to loss over a fixed period,
not exceeding one year, during which the productive aeset
was presumed to be replaced. There are however income
losses that occur from dislocation in terms of access to
employment sources/sites caused by land acquisition, even
though the affected persons do not lose any productive
asset.
There is a provision in the 1982 Ordinance that-can be
interpreted to cover income losses from acquisition
affecting 'persons interested' [section 8 (d) of 1982
Ordinance]. Of all the income categories that could qualify
for compensation, the ones that deserve the highest
consideration are those of wage labourers and businessmen.
Wage labourers living in farm households will suddenly find
no place to go and no employer to work for. Likewise, a
business in trade or processing may take a loss of income
for months on end if the business has to be suddenly
transferred to a new place.
There are two things that need to be recognised and acted
upon in developing a compensation package on income losses.
First, the project for which land is being acquired is
expected   to   generate   new   employment   and   income
opportunities. If it is not so, then the project should not
have been undertaken in the first place. Second, there will
be need fgr a re-training of the PAPs, so that they can
take on new jobs.
Principally, the most accurate approach would be to give
income loss compensation ex-post on the basis of an actual
assessment of losses while keeping provisions for job
retraining when needed. For this accurate income data has
18



to be collected as benchmark for PAPs falling into these
categories. Later they have to be monitored after land
acquisition, both to assess changes in income and also to
identify training needs.
Accurate income data, however, are difficult to establish
and an estimation of the magnitude of income loss from land
acquisition is likely to be a complex matter. In view of
these reasons, it has been decided that for agricultural
labourers and factory workers a compensation for wage
losses be paid up front as 120 days' wages at the rate of
Tk.80 for skilled workers and Tk.30 unskilled workers. They
may also be given preferential access to construction work
within the project.
Compensation for loss of business will be determined by the
Joint Verification Team.
2.4  Organisational Responsibility for Payment
The DC shall be responsible for effecting payment of
compensation for land, structures and trees. All other
payments   to  entitled   persons   following   from   the
Compensation and Resettlement policy will be effected by
scDB.
2.S  Summarised Entitlement Policy Package
The Entitlement Policy packages for different categories of
losses from acquisition are summarised below in the form of
3 boxed matrices for easy reference.
It needs to be emphasised that there are many different
ways of categorising losses suffered by persons on account
of land acquisition.
one such categorisation was presented earlier under section
2.2 where losses were first divided into direct (physical
asset) and indirect (derived, primarily showing up in a
loss of income) types. Under section 2.3 above the losses
were analysed Under each of :;he broad items of physical
assets; (land, structures and trees) covering both direct
or indirect losses (re sub-section 2.3.3 to 2.2.5), and
separately as losses of.income occuring without any direct
loss of asset.
For the entitlement policy package it seemed logical to
make some further modifications and present them under the
following eight categories within 4 broad groups of losses.
A.   Loss of stock of, and flow from, owned land which is
apquired
i.   Agricultural land including ponds, trees/orchards
and income losses till these assets a-re replaced.
19



ii.  Homestead  land including structures/shops  and
dislocation costs till these are replaced or
relocated.
B.   Loss of asset on land not owned but acquired
iii. Structures on unauthorised (eg govt Khas land) or
other people's (eg father, relative) land.
C.   Loss of employment income from loss of access to other
people's assets : agricultural land, shops, factories
which are acquired
iv. Agricultural land for sharecropping/leasing.
V.  Agricrltural land for mortgaging.
vi.  Rented house or commercial structure.
vii. Employment/income   sites   (eg   farm   house,
factories).
D.   Loss of income from disruption in profession resulting
from loqses noted above
viii.     Business or industry (from owned or rented
premises).
Apart from these eight categories of losses which relate to
land acquisition directly, there are disruptions and losses
caused by the project itself. For example, it was seen in
the socio-economic survey that a large community of
fishermen at Saidpur were going to be affected by the
northern bypass which would go through a Bil which was
their fishing ground. Compensation for the land in the Bil
should take account of its productive value for fishing.
The environmental impact on the Bil itself will be looked
into, before finalising the alignment/design, to minimise
the effects in terms of permanent loss of fishing grounds.

CHAPTER 3
SOCIO-ECONOKIC SURVEY
3.1  Objectives of the Survey
The socio-economic survey had three main objectives
-    Provide a profile of the PAPs so that all personnel
involved in the implementation of the RAP are
familiarised with who they are dealing with, thus
enabling  them  to  formulate  an  area  and  social
category-specific implementation strategy; and
-    Identify   the   PAPs   and  their   entitlement   to
compensation in a comprehensive manner, thus providing
the basis for an updated estimate of the compensation
budget;
-    Provide benchmark information for evaluating the RAP
in future.
Although there was a survey carried out by SARM about a
year earlier, a fresh survey was considered necessary
mainly because the earlier survey did not cover all persons
affected by land acquisition.
3.2  Coverage and Methodology of the Survey
The socio-economic survey covered all households and
institutions affected by RRMP-II at the five project sites.
A team of 30 field investigators, 2 field supervisors and
3 Area Managers conducted the -survey on the basis of a
questionnaire specially developed for the purpose. The
field staff were trained at CCDB Dhaka over a 3-day period
under the guidance of the full RAP planning team. Fieldwork
was initiated in early December 1993 and concluded at four
of the five sites by mid January 1994. At the fifth site
(Saidpur) initial work on the Southern by-pass was
abandoned when the authorities decided to change the plan
in favour of a northern by-pass in order to avoid land
acquisition difficulties. Field survey at this site was
initiated in the 3rd week of January 1994 and concluded by
early February 1994.
Data were computerised, edited and tabulated using both
SPSS and Cobol.
3.3  A Categorisation of the Project Affected Households (PAHs)
The survey identified 1365 households with 8744 persons
(4585 males and 4159 females) as affected by the project at
the five sites. There were in addition 17 institutions
which were affected (see list at Annex-3). For the purposes
of this report the affected households were divided into 6
broad analytical categories which are mutually exclusive.
These are
26



Direct Lovers (physical assets lost)
1.   Only Agricultural Land Losers
all  asset  losing  households  which   lost  only
agricultural land (including orchards, ponds, fallow,
etc) but no homestead land;
2.   Only Homestead Land Losers
all asset losing households which lost homestead land
only  (along  with  structures  &  trees),  but  no
agricultural land;
3.   Homestead + Agricultural Land Losers
all asset losing households which lost both homestead
and agricultural land;
4.   Squatters
asset losing households which lost a structure (a
house, shop, cowshed, etc) but no land; this category
includes sons who live in father's land in separate
households;
Indirect Losers (no physical assets lost)
5.   Sharecroppers (etc)
all non-asset losing households which lost access to
or possession of (other people's) agricultural land on
a sharecropping, leasing or mortgaging basis; these
households may also have other persons who were
indirectly affected, such as wage labourers or factory
workers.
6.   Wage Labourers (and Other Income Losers).
all households which did not lose any asset or access
to agricultural land, but were affected by loss of
income from economic disruptions caused by the
acquisition of their employment sites, such as a farm
house, a shop or a factory.
It needs to be pointed out that these categories are
household categories and not loss or entitlement (to
compensation) categories. Keeping in view the main
objectives of the report, the categorisation has naturally
been based on types of losses, but it is essentially a way
of giving a household a principal denomination among the
many  combinations  of- losses  that  it  may  actually
experience. Such a denomination is expected to be helpful
for the implementation personnel i, 'aling with individual
EPs. Households, defined as a cooki. unit, continue to be
an extremely important socio-economic unit in rural
societies. This is where the EPs reside and their
perception   and   reaction   to  land   acquisition   and
resettLement policies formed and nurtured.
A perusal of the six categories mentioned above will show
that the first four categories comprise households which
have lost a physical asset : land, structures, trees. These
households may have individual members who have lost in
some indirect fashion. But the last two categories are
27



households which have lost only in indirect way.
The distribution of the PA households at the 5 sites into
these six broad categories are shown in Table 3.1. Overall,
the agricultural land (only) losers are the largest
category containing about 42 percent of the total
households surveyed followed by squatters (21 percent). A
look at the composition of households at the five sites
will reveal some striking differences between the sites.
At Natore, for example, the squatters are the single
largest category containing about 36 percent of all project
affected households, followed by homestead (only) losers
(21 percent) and wage-labour households. By contrast,
Saidpur, Ghagot and Rajshahi have agricultural land (only)
losers as the largest category of households. Dasuria, on
the other hand, has a more even balance between households
losing only agricultural land and those losing both
agricultural   and   homestead   land.   Some   important
implications  for  the  resettlement  action  plan  are
immediately obvious. For example, the squatters problem in
Natore can by no means be underestimated; structure losers
constitute 57 percent of all affected households and among
them squatters are in majority.
Table 3.1B presents the picture in terms of female headed
households. Overall, these constitute 12 percent, the
highest proportion (17 percent) being among the squatters
in respect of household categories in the Natore area.
3.4 Some Socio-economic Characteristics of the PAPs and PAHs
A rough profile of the project affected population is given
below in terms of some broad socio-economic characteristics
of the PAPs at the 5 project sites.
3.4.1     Some  Demographic  Characteristics  : Household
Size, Sex Ratio, etc
The household size, sex ratio and dependency ratios,
along with the age-sex composition of the project
affected persons are shown in Tables 3.2A and 3.2B by
PAH categories and areas respectively. The largest
households (average 9.8 members) were among those who
lost both agricultural and homestead land, while the
smallest were among the wage labourers (4.2 members)
an?d squatters (4.5 members). For obvious reasons, PAPs
at Natore showed the smallest family size (5.1) while
it was uniformly higher at the four other places (7.0
to 7.6).
The overall dependency ratio was 74 percent, with the
lowest among agricultural land losers (68 percent) and
in Saidpur (63 percent), the highest being among
agricultural-cum-homestead land losers. It is somewhat
surprising that the squatters and wave labourers did
not show the lowest dependency ratio is expected,
since normally both males and females in these
households remain employed.
In Tables 3.2A and 3.2B, 40 percent of the male and 47
percent of the female PAPs were found to be married;
3.5 percent females were widowed and 0.3 percent
divorced. Widowhood and divorce rates were the highest
among the squatters (5.4 & 0.4 percent, respectively)
as a PAH category and at Dasuria (8.2 & 1.4 percent,
28



respectively) among the 5 areas.
3.4.2     occupational Structure
The (primary) occupational structure of the
household heads among the PAPs is shown in Tables
3.4A & B. Overall, the top three occupations were
agriculture (32 percent), agricultural labour (23
percent) and trading (10 percent). There was a
much   greater   proportion   (37  percent)   of
agricultural labourers among the squatters, which
was  followed  by  trading    (14  percent)  and
transport labour (13 percent). Barring Natore
(urban) and Dasuria (a market), the other three
areas showed a high incidence (46-53 percent) of
agriculture as an occupation of the household
heads.
Considering all members of the households above
age ten (Tables 3.5A & B), agriculture (24
percent) and agricultural labour (15 percent)
continued to dominate male occupations, apart
from students (27 percent). Among the squatters
however the picture was very different with
agricultural labour (30 percent) dominating their
employment. Among women older than 10 years,
housewives dominate (61 percent), followed by
students (22 percent).
The highest female participation in an occupation
other than home care is among the squatters (13
percent); of those working females about half are
in agricultural labour. The lowest percentage Qf
female students are from squatter (8) and wage
labourer (10) households. Among the 5 areas, -once
again Natore was different with a preponderance
of agricultural labourers (22 percent) and very
few farmers (9 percent) among all males aged 10+
years.
3.4.3     Educational Status
Overall, among household heads 42 percent males
and 65 percent females were found to be
illiterate, while 56 percent males and 75 percent
females  never  completed  primary  school  (see
Tables 3.6A & B). The picture was much worse
among wage labourers (82 percent male & 89
percent female illiterate) and squatters (64
percent male and 84 percent female illiterate).
Of all the areas Natore is the worst (52 percent
male and 73 percent female illiteracy) while
Saidpur seems to be the best performing with only
17 percent male and 46 percent female illiteracy.
In addition, there was a remarkably high
percentage of females with SSC or higher level
education, including some with graduate degrees.
The ethnic diversity of the area may have been a
factor influencing higher than usual female
literacy. This certainly could be a resource
which may become useful during the implementation
of the RAP.
Among all persons 10 years or more of age (see
Tables 3.7A & B) 30 percent males and 42 percent
?.9



females were illiterate. Illiteracy was very high
among the wage labouring and squatter females (77
and 70 percent, respectively). The wage labourer
males were even worse (78 percent illiterate).
3.4.4     Income
The  income  distribution  among  the  project
affected households is shown in Tables 3.8A & B.
It is clear that wage labourer's annual earnings
were   the   lowest   (Tk.9,800),   followed   by
squatters' (Tk.11,500) among the six household
groups. The average income was around 83 thousand
takas   annually   if  an  exceptionally   rich
industrialist affected by Land Acquisition was
included. The average came down to Tk.25,800 by
excluding this case. There was a good proportion
of rich farmers (more than 10 percent) with
earnings above 60 thousand takas per month.
In terms of areas the highest average income (Tk.
B7 thousand) was reported at Dasuria, with its
small number of PAHs, mostly engaged in business
and trading. The next highest average household
income was reported at Saidpur (Tk. 51 thousand).
The relative strength of Saidpur economy is
indicated by the more than 43 percent households
who were above the Tk. 36,000 income mark, of
whom 21 percent were above the Tk. 60,000 mark,
as compared to Dasuria's  28 and  14 percent,
respectively. It must be added that income data
requires much greater scrutiny to ascertain its
accuracy.
3.5  PAP Preferences on Some Resettlement Issues
The socio-economic survey attempted to elicit the views of
the PAPs in respect of a few key issues on the resettlement
process, such as self-managed resettlement, types of
assistance desired and the preferred relocation site. The
summary findings are presented below. It is hoped that
these along with the considerable field notes collected
during the survey will be useful in developing the detailed
resettlement programme.
3.5.1     Self-managed Resettlement
There was an overwhelming support among PAPs for
self managed resettlement. The survey revealed
that nearly 96 percent considered a fair and
quick compensation to be enough to help them
resettle.   The  only  group  among  which  a
significant proportion felt there was need for
more was, not surprisingly, the squatters. About
6 percent of the squatters fell into this
category (see Table 3.9A). In respect of areas it
was Ghagot where the largest demand (15 percent)
was heard for assisted resettlement.
3.5.2     Assistance Wanted by PAPs
Overall, the most popular demand for assistance
was for house construction (86 percent), followed
by land purchase (38 percent), as seen in Table
3.1OA. The squatters were the most vocal group in
30 -



expressing their demand for assistance in a
variety of fields, the most dominant being land
purchase (90 percent), followed by education (63
percent). Among the areas (Table 3.10B), Natore
articulated the strongest demand for assistance
in land purchase (96 percent), followed by a
demand for assistance in education, health and
shelter. Saidpur distinguished itself by a-100
percent vote for cultural and sports programmes,
followed  by  land  purchase  (88  percent)  and
education (87 percent).
3.5.3     Preferred Relocation Sites
The most preferred relocation site amongst the
PAPs was an adjoining village (80 percent, see
Tables 3.8A & B), particularly for homestead
losers (91 percent). Resettlement arranged by the
government, ie on Khas land, was generally not
preferred except for a small fraction (7 percent)
of squatters. During focus group discussions it
was revealed that the lack of preference stemmed
from a poor opinion about the cluster village
programme of the previous regime. Among farmers,
the plots alloted in these settlements were
considered to be very inadequate as a farm house.
The landless group, on the other hand, objected
to these arrangements because of their disadvan-
tageous location from the viewpoint of getting
employment.
Among the areas (Table 3.11B) a nearby village
was the dominant choice in all the areas, except
that Ghagot reported about 39 percent households
who did not know.
3.6  Estimates of Entitled Persons and Households
Individuals and households may both be entitled to
compensation. But to ascertain true ownership of physical
assets, particularly land, a proper verification of records
is needed, which will be done as part of the land
acquisition process. Pending this, what can be given easily
are estimates of entitled households for physical assets
and entitled persons for certain indirect losses such as
wage labour. Tables 3.12A & B show them for each loss type,
by household categories and areas respectively.
It may be noted that, overall, agricultural land losers
were the largest group (703) while structure losers were
not far behind (520), the latter being equally divided
between squatters and homestead land owners. The largest
concentration of agricultural land losers was in Rajshahi
(376) while that of structure losers was in Natore.
3.7  Types of Losses by PAH Categories
Table 3.13 lists all the eight broad types of losses with
sub-categories, incurred by each of the 6 broad categories
of PAHs as stated by them in the socio-economic survey.
The land figures in this Table however are not. reliable,
which limits their usefulness. It shows, however, the
magnitude of non-land losses, which are more reliable
estimates.

CHAPTER 4
WORX PLAN AND IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
4.01 Approach
The importance of a well conceived organisational framework for a
successful implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) cannot
be. over emphasised. This in turn requires a clear understanding of the
tasks involved, their sequencing in time and interlinkages, and the
overall time frame within which various activities are to be completed
for synchronising resettlement with construction.
once the activities and time schedules are clearly delineated, ie a
workplan is prepared, it is easy to identify the types and quantities
of required personnel and how they should relate to each other. At
that stage it would be easy to develop a complete organisational
framework.
4.02 Temporal Parameters of the RAP
There are three important milestones in formulating the RAP
imnplementation schedule in order to achieve the objectives and
synchronise it with the construction schedule. These are :
a.   Date of Start :
Implementation will formally start when the RAP is agreed upon
between GoB and the World Bank. It is expected that this would
happen somezime during the 2nd half of May, 1994.
b.  Vacating the Acquired Land
At Dasuria and Ghagot, the two smaller components of RRMP-TI,
land is to be handed over to the contractors by March 1994, while
at Rajshahi, Natore and Saidpur, land will need to be handed over
in July, 1995. Since four months' prior notification is required
for eviction, such notices are to be given by November, 1994 at
Ghagot and Dasuria and by March, 1995 at Rajshahi, Natore and
Saidpur.
c.   Completion of the Resettlement Process :
The process of resettlement which, in a broader sense, includes
economic rehabilitation, will continue for some time after the
physical relocation of the PAPs. This is the period when the
true impact of the project, in general, and physical dislocation,
in particular, will be manifest and real grievances aired. The
need for monitoring these impacts and undertaking appropriate
corrective measures in terms of grievance redressal, income
support, job retraining etc will be felt more intensely during
this period. The RAP envisages this period to last at least nine
months from the time of relocation. Assuming that the last PAP
is relocated in July -1995, the resettlement process should
continue till at least upto March 1996. The resettlement work
plan has been scheduled accordingly to extend over a period of
24 months ie May, 1994 to April, 1996.
56



1.03 The Main Activities and Their Time Schedule
The main activities in the implementation of the Resettlement Action
Plan within a time frame of two years are briefly described below.
a.   Approval of RAP
The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is expected to be approved by
the authorities in May, 1994 after going through a due process
of scrutiny by GoB and the World Bank at different levels.
Formally, therefore, the RAP will be deemed to have started
immediately after its approval, althouqh a number of steps has
already been taken which are closely linked to implementation,
namely the appointment of CCDB as the implementing NGO and the
conduct of a benchmark socio-economic survey.
b.   Establish RRMP-II/RN IN RHD
The principal responsibility for the implementation of the RAP
lies with RHD, although CCDB will share this burden with them.
An infrastructure will need to be put into place with the
capability to coordinate and administer a complex programme
involving several thousand displaced persons and a host of
organisations/agencies at different geographical locations.
Offices will need to be set up, personnel hired (or obtained on
deputation), trained and deployed. It is estimated that this
process will bake approximately two months (April-May, 1994).
C.   Establish CCDB RU
Like RHD, CCDB will also be required to set up is full-fledged
Resettlement Unit in the field as well as at the headquarters.
CCDB has had the benefit of an early start in the sense that its
involvement in preparing the RAP has already given it an
acquaintance with the content of the plan, as also an exposure
to the PAPs and the field conditions. The infrastructure which
was used during the field survey can now be consolidated and
extended to take on the tasks of RAP implementation. It is
expected that CCDB's RU will be fully operational by May 1994.
d.   Training of Resettlement Personnel
People who will be involved in implementing the RAP need to have
a proper knowledge about the processes of land acquisition and
resettlement, so that they have a broad understanding of the need
for it, its legal and administrative framework, its potential
impact on the PAPs and the constraints in the process of
compensation and resettlement. Most importantly, it is essential
that all personnel of the RUs of RHD and CCDB are made fully
aware of their duties and responsibilities and the importance of
efficient implementation of each component of the RAP for its
overall success. In addition, senior officials in the Ministry
of Communication and other involved Ministries as well as the
DC's and other senior staff in the six Districts should also be
briefed on the RAP, so that they recognise their role in ensuring
inter-departmental cooperation and coordination.
The training materials for the resettlement personnel and various
senior officials in the Ministries and the Districts can mostly
be deriv,ed from the RAP document and several studies/reports on
the subject under some other recent projects (eq Land Acquisition
and Resettlement Study Under the Flood Action Plan, the Revised
57



Resettlement Action Plan of Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project).
The training of resettlement personnel is scheduled to be
completed over a period of three months starting in June 1994.
e.   Joint Verification
One of the most important steps in determining compensation is
the establishment of an accurate estimate of the quantity and
quality of properties lost in land acquisition. The existing
procedure involves a joint field verification by the technical
staff     representing  land  administration,  public  works,
agriculture  and  forestry.  Various  studies  have  indicated
potential weaknesses in this exercise, which ultimately lead to
an unsatisfactory estimation of compensation with all the related
problems. The RAP will aim for a more accurate estimation of
losses by including some element of academic expertise in the
joint verification exercise.
The estimated time required to complete the joint verification
in the field is around five months, ie May-September 1994.
4.04 Public Information Campaign
To make the task of implementation simpler there will be a public
information campaign directed primarily towards the PAPs.
Followin9 the example of Jamuna Bridge Project, thirty village
level  fleld workers will  be recruited and  trained by the
implementing NGO and utilised for the campaign which will aim at
making all PAPs understand their rights, entitlements and
procedures for obtaining compensation and seeking redressal to
their grievances, if any. The PAPs will also be fully briefed
about the need for their cooperation in ensuring that correct
information is given for determining the compensation- package,
and explaining how fallacious information and attempts at
manipulation by any one (PAP or govt functionaries), will result
in delays and sufferings.
A brochure in Bangla will summarise the compensation policy and
other necessary information. It will be explained and distributed
in public meetings to be followed up by a door-to-door campai9n.
Posters and leaflets will constitute additional information
materials. The public information campaign will start in May 1994
and last for six months.
4.05 Market Survey and Land Valuation
A market survey will need to be conducted, preferably coinciding
with the joint verification exercise, to ascertain the current
value of different types of land at each proje-t site. The
rationale for such a survey is to improve upon the existing
practice of ascertaining land prices based on sales records at
the sub-registrar's office, which are universally known to be
depressed in order to reduce the high rate of stamp duty. It is
necessary to represent the main interest groups and technical
skills in a land valuation advisory team that will be responsible
for the market survey on land.
The land market survey will start in June 1994 and be completed
by September 1994.
58



4.06 IJsue of ID Cards and Finalisation of Entitlements
PAPs are to be identified in accordance with the Entitlement
Policy adopted for the RAP and the establishment of ownership of
property after the serving of section 6 notice under the 1982
Ordinance.  In case of disputed or   absentee ownership the
resolution will await the completion of appropriate legal and
administrative procedures.
For all other cases an ID card with photographs will be prepared
and issued to the Entitled Persons (EPs), which will have to be
produced in makinq claims to various entitlements. There will be
a PAP Household File which will record all actions taken in the
process of compensation and resettlement on a real time basis and
keep them in a computerised data base.
On conclusion of the joint verification of acquired property and
the market survey on property prices, a revised estimate of
individual packages of entitlements in cash and kind will be
prepared by the implementing NGO with the assistance of the TA
Consultants and its MIS unit. This will be immediately conveyed
to the project authorities to ensure payment at the stipulated
time.
The identification of the PAPs can start after about two months'
from the beginning of joint verification and conclude in about
six months le July-December 1994.
4.07 Disbursement of Cash Compensation
Disbursement will start as soon as the entitled persons are
identified and their entitlements finalised. The DC will be
responsible for effecting the compensation for land, structures
and trees. All other payments to the entitled persons as
determined by the Compensation and Resettlement Policy will be
handled by the implementing NGO. This activity is expected to
last for a period of about ten months starting from September
1994 and ending in June 1995.
4.08 Legal Possession of Land by RHD
The legal possession of land by RHD is contingent upon the
completion of the land acquisition procedure which culminates
with the payment of compensation and the subsequent gazette
notification. This activity will therefore run simultaneously
with cash compensation, starting in September 1994 and concluding
around June 1995.
4.09 Identification of Land for Resettlement
There is a large number of squatters, mainly in Natore, who will
need to be rehabilitated. There are various resettlement
programmes including the distribution of Khas land which will
take care of many of the displaced squatters. It is unlikely
however to have all the squatters and other homestead losers to
be settled under these programmes. In that event replacement land
will need to obtained from the market, a task for which some
handicapped households may require assistance.  This activity
will spanx the period September-December 1994.
59



4.10 Notification of Eviction
Four months' advance notice is required to evict a person from
acquired land. In case of Dasuria and Ghagot such notice will be
served in November 1994, while for the other sites it will be
served in March, 1995.
4.11 Resettlement of Persons Provided with Land
This activity will be confined mainly to the squatters of Natore
and consist of assistance with building houses and reconstructing
a community life and work environment. It will be convenient if
the displaced persons can be brought under an existing
development programme. The resettlement of these persons is
expected to take about seven months starting in December 1994 and
ending in June 1995, while the reconstruction of their community
life and work environment will continue through till the end of
the project in Harch 1996.
4.12 Possession of Land by Contractor
For Dasuria and Ghagot the time for handing over land to the
contractors is March 1995; for the rest it is July 1995.
4.13 Monitoring of the Impact of Resettlement
This will unfold over a long period of time. These will need to
be monitored on a systematic basis and reviewed from time to
time. An important element in this monitoring will be the
identification  of  grievances  and  various  implementation
bottlenecks requiring early attention.
The monitoring exercise will start from the time of eviction
notices are served and continue throughout the entire RAP phase.
60



CHAPTER 5
ORGANISATIONAL FRAMEWORK
5.1  Basis and Approach
A delineation of the activities envisaged under the Resettlement
Action Plan for RRMP-II in Chapter 4 forms the basis of the
organisational framework presented in this chapter. For each of
the major tasks, the agency/personnel required to perform them
and the network of support that need to be drawn upon had become
reasonably clear. It is true, nevertheless, that many unknown
factors and procedural delays could emerge during implementation
and jeopardise both the organ'isational framework and the time
schedule. Therefore, it is necessary to have a flexible attitude
towards the framework, particularly in respect of personnel
needs, so that one does not have to compromise on timing, if
there is a trade-off.
5.2  Broad Division of work
The overall responsibility of implementing the RAP lies with RHD,
while CCDB, the implementing NGO will share the burden in a
complementary fashion. The principal role of RHD is to provide
the superstructural support of all government agencies and
functionaries as well as ensure smooth flow of .,nds to
facilitate implementation without constraints and delays. CCDB
on its part will ensure a smooth implementation at the grassroots
levels using its long experience of interaction with the poor and
the disadvantaged. In addition, three multi-profession bodies:
a Joint Verification Team (JVT), a Land Valuation Advisory Team
(LVAT) and a Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) : will provide
valuable support in dealing with some crucial areas in
implementation that demand visible neutrality and/or the
representation of different skills/interests.
The project will establish three Resettlement Offices, one each
in Rajshahi, Natore and Saidpur. For each of the three offices,
RHD will appoint a sub-divisional engineer (SDE) to be designated
as Resettlement Officer in charge, with support of his regular
staff. The Additional Project Civil Works Director (Additional
PCWD) under the project, located in Rajshahi, will serve as Chief
Resettlement Officer, supervising the work of three area
Resettlement Officers and being the overall coordinator for
implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan.
CCDB will have a Central Resettlement Unit headed by a
Coordinator, who will lead a team of professionals including a
Socioloqist (Deputy Team Leader), a Legal Advisor and
Statistician. Each of the three field offices of CCDB will be
headed by an Area Manager, who will work in close collaboration
with the RO of RHD. The Area Managers will each be assisted by
3 inspectors, a 5-member Survey Team, 10 field workers and other
support staff. In addition, CCDB will obtain the services of
technical assistance Consultants with required analytical skills.
5.3  Linkage BDetween Civil Works and Resettlement
The Organisational framework of the RAP is illustrated in two
diagrams. Diagram 3 shows the relationship between the
61



construction side and the resettlement side of the project. As
mentioned before, three offices will be established, because
there are three sites with major resettlement activities. The
offices at Rajshahi and Natore will both liaise and coordinate
with the PCW office at Rajshahi, while the office in Saidpur will
coordinate with the PCW office in Rangpur. At the HQ level the
entire resettlement unit will relate directly to the Chief
Resettlement Officer.
5.4  Linkages within the Resettlement Framework
Diagram 4 illustrates the links between various components of the
organisational framework for implementing the RAP. The Chief
Resettlement Officer (CRO) under the Project Director (PCWD) will
be responsible for coordinating meetings and liaising between
RRMP-II Resettlement set-up and the ministries and agencies. The
CCDB coordinator will maintain a close liaison with CRO, while
the Area Managers of CCDB will liaise with the Resettlement
Officer (RO) who are at the level of the sub-divisional engineers
CSDE).
There will be a Joint Verification Team for each district to be
convened by the relevant Resettlement Officer. Likewise there
will be a Land Valuation Advisory Team for each district.
However, there will be only three Grievance Redressal Committees,
one for each field office who will cover all the five sites.
5.5  Composition and Terms of Reference for Major Components
Given below are brief descriptions of the composition (including)
requisite qualifications of key lpersonnel) and a brief ToR of the
major elements in the organisational framework.
5.5.1     Chief Resettlement Officer (CRO)

5.5.2     Resettlement Officer CRO)
Background :
1.   To implement the Resettlement Action Plan for RRMP-II, the
project will establish three resettlement offices, in
Rajshahi, Natore and Saidpur respectively. At each office
there will be personnel appointed by RHD and a field unit
of CCDB.
2.  The Resettlement Office will be managed by a Resettlement
Officer - RO (at the level of sub-divisional engineer). The
field unit of CCDB will be managed by an Area manager
reporting both to the RO and to CCDB Headquarters.
3.  The Resettlement Officer tRO) will be directly responsible
to the Chief Resettlement Officer, except in approval of
payments above the authority of a sub-divisional engineer,
which will be channelled through the Project Manager.

by CCDB as entitlement under the Resettlement Policy.
63



lo.  Submit regular progress report to the CRO on payment of
compensations and relocation of people.
5.5.3     Implementing NGO: CCDB
Background:
1.  The World Bank's Operational pirective 4.30 requires that
the organisational framework for   managing resettlement
must be developed during preparation and adequate resources
provided to the responsible institutions. The organisation
responsible for resettlement should be strengthened when
entities executing infrastructure or other sector-specific
projects lack the experience and outlook needed to design
and implement resettlement. In this case the choice was
made to involve non-governmental organization (Christian
Commission for Development in Bangladesh) in planning,
implementing and monitoring resettlement.
2.   The fundamental principle underpinning the World Bank's OD
4.30 is that PAPs should not be worse off as a result of
land acquisition and adequate efforts must be built into
the project to ensure this. The involvement of an
organization like the CCDB, working at grass-roots level
for the rural poor for many years is one of the steps taken
to ensure that the mentioned goal is reached.
Objectives :
The main objective of CCDB is to assist RHD in the planning and
implementation of a Resettlement Action Plan for RRMP-II. Because
of its long experience of working with the poor at the grassroots
level, it is expected to represent the interests of the PAPs in
various decision making and implementation activities that will
have an impact on their life and living standard.
Mode of Work :
i.  Overall planning and finalisation of resettlement schedule
in consultation with CRO;
ii.  Participation in joint verification of acquired property
and conduct market survey of property through the LVAT to
obtain prices for use in finalising compensation packages;
iii. Identification of PAPs by categories and issuance of ID
cards;
iv.  Finalisation  of  entitlement  package  for  all  PAPs  in
consultation with TA Advisors and LVAT;
v.   Information dissemination to PAPs on their entitlements and
resettlement procedures;
vi.  Effect payments linked to all entitlements in the Policy
with the exception of land, structures and trees;
vii. Assistance to PAPs in obtaining compensation for land,
structures and trees, in consultation with CRO;
viii. Assistance to PAPs in grievance redressal in consultation
with Grievance Committee;
64



ix.  Assistance to PAPs  in physical  resettlement  including
finding of suitable homestead sites for persons losing
homesteads with the help of DC's offices;
x.   Special assistance to vulnerable PAPs including squatters,
female headed households etc in their physical and economic
rehabilitation in conjunction with other development pro-
grammes (CCDB, DC's office, other development organisation/
agencies in the governmental and non-governmental sectors);
xi.  Liaison with the Administrative office of RRMP-II,  the
Ministry,   various   government   and   non-governmental
organisation to ensure synchromisation and coordinate
smooth transition from acquisition to resettlement (RU);
xii. Monitoring all activities and reporting on progress and
constraints to relevant quarters in a timely fashion using
modern technology (RU + CCDB).
xiii. CCDB should also develop a monitoring system to provide
information on the progress of the programme, particularly
in relation to the engineering work schedules and to look
at any problems arising in the process. It is specifically
required to monitor the vulnerable as well as indirect PAPs
to   ascertain  their   relative   socio-economic   status
(including employment and income) after land acquisition.
CCDB will direct recruit the persons needed to establish
this monitoring system and the system should be functional
during the full duration of the resettlement process.
5.5.4     Land Valuation Advisory Team
Background
1.   The  World  Bank has  a  set  of  guidelines  under  it's
Operational Directive 4.30, which is binding for all Bank
funded projects involving land acquisition. OD 4.30
stipulates that persons whose land is acquired shall
receive equivalent replacement land or the replacement
value of the land lost. The latter principle will be
followed in the case of RRMP-II.
2.   Land acquisition in Bangladesh is covered by the 1982 LA
Ordinance. This Ordinance stipulates that land shall be
compensated according to its market value plus a premium of
50% in consideration of the compulsory nature of the
acquisition (amended in 1993 to increase from 20 to 50%).
At present the DC bases th3 calculation of market, in most
cases, on the value of similar properties in the vicinity
as recorded in sales deeds registered during the twelve
months preceding acquisition. Because sales deed values are
under-reported to avoid stamp duty, this has led to people
not being compensated at market or replacement value.
Objectives :
3.   The objective of the Land Valuation Advisory Team is to
assist the DC arriving at a compensation standard which
fulfills the requirement of OD 4.30 of compensation at
replacement value. The main task of the Team is to Purvey
the land market in the areas where land will be acquired
for RRMP-II, and establish the current market value for
65



different categories of land. These values will be used to
determine the replacement value for the land being
acquired. It is the requirement of the World Bank, that the
compensation paid by DC, including the 50% premium,  is
equal or more than the replacement value.
Composition of Team
4.   A Land Valuation Advisory Team will be appointed for each
of the Districts where land acquisition will take place.
The composition of the team is as follows
(a) Resettlement Officer - RHD (for the resettlement
office concerned : Rajshahi, Nato-e or Saidpur), as
.convener;
(b)  Assistant DC Revenue or District Land Acquisition
Officer for the district concerned;
(c)  CCDB  Area  Manager  (for  the  resettlement  office
concerned : Rajehahi, Natore or Saidpur;
(d)  An independent consultant (to be contracts by CCDB and
to participate in all teams).
5.  The  Land  Valuation  Team  will  be  appointed  by  an
Administrative   order   issued   by   the   Ministry   of
Communications. The Teams will. be advising the Deputy
Commissioners concerned and report directly to them.
Mode of Work :
6.   Information on land values can be obtained from a variety
sources, and it the responsibility of the Team to make use
of different methods, some of which are :
-    information from District Revenue Office;
-    information from land registration offices, including
valves reported in sales deeds;
-    survey among land owners  in the area,  preferably
through group discussions;
-   -obtain land transaction histories on plots in the
area;
-    information from land brokers.
7.   The Teams may have to make use of field assistance in the
collection of data. Such costs will be borne by CCDB.
Reporting :
8.   The Teams shall submit their findings on the report to the
Deputy Commission, with copies to the Chief Resettlement
Officer (RHD) and CCDB, not later than 4 weeks after
appointment.
9.   The  report  shall  outline  the methods  that have  been
applied. It shall explain and carefully define the types of
66



land categories being used in the report. The Report shall
also establish the expected annual rate of inflation on
land prices, and estimate market value at the time of
eviction (ie mid 1995)
10. Land values shall be given in Tks. per decimal for
different types/qualities and locations.
5.5.5     Grievance Redressal Committee (ORC)
Background :
1.   The World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30 requires that
adequate mechanisms are established to deal with grievance
and appears raised by project affected people. Experience
also shows that effective grievance redressal mechanisms is
a precondition for smooth implementation of a resettlement
policy.
2.   The 1982 LA Ordinance has established appeal procedures.
The Grievance Redressal committees under RRMP-II, will be
complementary to these procedure.
Objectives :
3.   The objective of the Grievance Redressal Committees is to
hear individual grievances by people affected by land
acquisition in relation to the Resettlement Policy for the
project. Where a grievance concerns issues covered by the
appeal procedures outlined in the 1982 Ordinance, the
Committee will forward the case with their recommendations
to the DC. Where a 9rievance relates to project specific
definitions of entitlement and entitled persons, the
Committee is em?owered to make a final decision.
Mode of Work :
4.   The Ministry of Communications will by an Administrative
Order establish a Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC)
workin9 for the Resettlement Offices in Rajshahi, Natore
and Saidpur respectively.
5.   The composition of the Committees is
(a) the respective Resettlement Officer of RHD, or anyone
appointed by him;
(b) the respective Area Manager of CCDB, or any one
appointed by him;
(c) a member of the Union Parishad in the Union were
complainant is registered as entitled persons.
6.   A project affected persons/entitled person has 1 months
notice to   appeal to the GRC after receipt/issued of
Identify Cards in the his/her personal entitlements (if the
two actions take place at different times). The appeal has
to be in writing and be submitted tO the RHD resettlements
office.
7.   The GRC shall handle an appeal not later than 1 month after
it has been received. The GRCs shall keep written report of
67



all appeals received, and minutes of their meetings. The
complained shall receive a writing statement on the
decision/recommendation of the GRC.
B.   The  Resettlement  Officer  of  RHD  functions  as  the
secretariat of the GRC.

CHAPTER 6
RESETTLEMENT BUDGET
6.1  Basis of the Compensation Budget
The Entitlement Policy agreed upon by the Government of
Bangladesh and, the World Bank, a list of awardees prepared
earlier SARM Associates and the latest (Chapter 2) socic-economic
survey by CCDB constitute the basis for calculating the
compensation budget for the RAP.
In determining the compensation for land to be acquired,
considerable uncertainties exist about their quality, prices and
inflation rates over the next one year. These uncertainties can
be removed significantly after the )oint verification of property
losses and a proper land market survey. Pending these events,
however, some assumptions had to be made about the best possible
estimate under the circumstances. These are discussed below, with
particular emphasis on land.
6.2  Determination of Compensation for Land
Land is the single most important item in the compensation
package. A proper compensation for it entails both an accurate
estimation of its quantity and quality, and hence price. The
assumptions made in this regard are discussed below.
6.2.1 Estimates of Land to be Acquired
The estimation of land to be acquired was a difficult task
primarily because the joint verification exercise had not been
carried out till the time of writing this Report. In its absence
all fiqures on the amount of land acquired are subject to errors
of various types depending on the method of estimation.
There were large variations between SARM estimates based on
geometrical methods using and CCDB results based on the
statements by the affected persons.
It is possible that acquisition figures have in general been over
estimated or overstated by the PAPs in the survey. It certainly
was true in case of Saidpur where the northern by-pass was
decided upon during the course of the survey and none of the
respondents had any clear idea about what proportion of their
plots were actually going to be acquired. The situation became
further confused because the surveyors had reportedly considered
two alternative alignments in one section of the by-pass.
For preparing a budget for the RAP, the latest estimates provided
by RHD have been accepted as the most accurate ones for the total
land at the 5 project sites. -
Rajshahi             59.50 ha
Natore               29.50 ha
Saidpur             26.01 ha
Ghagot                3.69 ha
Dasiria               2.55 ha
Total                121.25 ha
69



6.2.2 Estimation of Land Price
According to the Entitlement Policy adopted for the RAP, land has
to be compensated at the current market price, ie that prevailing
at the time of paying the compensation. Technically speaking, it
not only calls for an accurate estimate of the prevailing market
price, but also a method of ectimating the potential rate of
price inflation in the short run. Experience has shown that land
prices shoot up at phenomenal rates wherever a new project comes
in, particularly in case of infrastructural projects. Therefore,
the land prices have been increased by 80 percent over the
current price for calculating the compensation. Most recent
estimates already show an average inflation of around 25 percent
over the last quarter. A price list of land (agricultural &
homestead) is at Annex 4. It needs to be pointed out that the
inflation factor has been taken care of in the budget through the
item Physical Contingency.
6.3  Compensation for the Loss of Other Assets
6.3.1 Trees
The number of trees of different sizes and species on land that
is going to be acquired has been obtained from the socio-economic
survey. The prices for major species of trees at different
project sites were collected through d quick market enquiry.
6.3.2 Compensation for Structures
The socio-economic survey by CCDB provided data on the number,
size and building materials of all structures consisting of
dwelling units, kitchens, cowsheds, shops, rice processing yards
etc, along with their prices as estimated by the PAPs. These
prices were increased by 20 percent to reflect a more realistic
compensation cost. A price list of structures is at Annex-4.
6.4 Compensation for Indirect Losses
The different types of indirect losses have been extensively
discussed in Chapter 2. Annex-4 presents a list of them with
brief explanations on the adopted rate of compensation for each.
6.5 Budget for RAP
The budget for carrying out the RAP of RRMP-II project is shown
in Table 6.1 below in two parts. Part A shows the estimated
budget for each area with a breakdown by the 8 loss categories
mentioned in the policy matrix with sub-categories under some of
them. Part B shows the implementation costs along with provisions
for unforeseen costs and inflation.
The total budget is 280.7 million takas of which 61 percent is
for compensation, 11 percent for implementation and 27 percent
is allocated to physical contingencies.
