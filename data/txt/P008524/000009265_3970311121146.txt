MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SUPPORT
TO THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed Credit in the amount of SDR 10.1 million (US$15 million equivalent) to the Kyrgyz
Republic, to provide medium term foreign exchange loans to private enterprises to help support
transformation of the enterprise sector. Technical assistance will be available to support the
enterprises, and to assist the Government in promoting an efficient financial intermediation
sector.
A. SECTORAL CONTEXT
2.          Enterprise Sector. The Kyrgyz Republic Government (KRG) began economic
reform, stabilization and structural adjustment in 1991, much ahead of other countries of the
Former Soviet Union (FSU). The quality of the privatization program is being substantially
improved, its scope expanded, and implementation accelerated. All small scale enterprises and
35 percent of all fixed enterprise assets have been privatized by end 1994, and an additional 35
percent expected by end 1996. The private enterprise sector is growing rapidly as a result of
new entries spurred by other on-going economic and institutional reforms. The KRG and the
emerging private sector need support to ensure success of the reform program. Enter pr i s e
reform and restructuring are needed to correct the distortions of the old system. Most
enterprises lack access to raw materials, consumables and spares and thus cannot operate
efficiently. Realization of improvements in productivity at the enterprise level will require, inter
alia, a change in the incentive system for, and modes of operation of, workers and managers;
new investment in critical debottlenecking equipment, modernization of obsolete plants and
incremental working capital; and substantial technical assistance to develop and implement
business and investment plans, including adoption of modem management, marketing and
distribution techniques. External assistance to address these problems in a systematic manner
is urgently required. IDA will complement other donor actions in this area and support
interested enterprises with technical assistance on a limited cost-sharing basis.
3.          Financial Sector. In spite of significant progress made in implementing far
reaching monetary and credit policies, the Kyrgyz economy still lacks adequate financial
institutions and instruments, as well as a trade and banking regulatory environment. Commercial
banks lack the infrastructure, skills and institutional and financial capabilities required for
efficient financial intermediation, and are generally undercapitalized. Past inflationary pressures,
at the outset, have significantly eroded their capital base. Savings mobilization has been at a low
level due to a variety of factors characteristic of an economy in transition, including hitherto
negative real rates, and limited access to, and eroding public confidence in the security of bank
deposits. Non-performing loans, in several commercial banks are increasing as enterprise
reform progresses, hard budget constraints are imposed, and a rising number of enterprises fail



-2-
to service loans. Most Kyrgyz banks are unable, under these conditions, to meet the financing
needs of the enterprise sector. However, KRG's implementation of economic reform and
stabilization measures and the improved banking supervision capacity of the National Bank of
Kyrgyz Republic (NBK), the cei%tral bank, which has also expanded freedom of entry to new
private banks, are yielding encouraging results. A steep decline has been registered in the rate
of inflation, from 1,000 percent in 1992/93 to 1 percent a month since September 1994. Interest
rates have been deregulated and are now positive in real terms, and the fully convertible local
currency, the KGS, has even been appreciating vis-a-vis the US dollar and neighboring
currencies. These favorable developments are improving the enabling enviromnent for financial
intermediary lending operations. Some of the better managed medium size private banks have
maintained a satisfactory but still limited, capital base, including the privately owned German-
Kyrgyz Industrial Bank Orient. The latter has been selected competitively by NBK to be
associated with a reputable international bank, to manage IDA funds, on a contractual basis,
under the investment component of the project. Thus institution building for accrediting local
banks as financial intermediaries will be initiated, and expanded under the project.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
4.          The principal objective of the project is to assist private enterprises, to
successfully adapt to a market economy. The project will provide technical assistance for
enterprises to develop business and investment plans, supported with loans in foreign exchange
for investment and incremental working capital. A second objective of the project is to help
build a reliable financial intermediation capacity in the country. A first step in strengthening
the financial capacity is to develop restructuring, privatization and recapitalization plans for
selected banks. Several donors are providing early assistance to the NBK towards these goals.
As agreed with KRG the Credit will only supplement such donor assistance as needed. With
parallel co-financing from the Japanese grant, the project will accordingly assist NBK and the
Ministry of Finance to undertake a diagnostic audit of the Savings bank, and a preliminary
review of the insurance sector.  A third objective is to assist Government in project
implementation and coordination through provision of consultant services and traimng of local
Kyrgyz staff.
5.          The project will be supported by the proposed IDA Credit and by a proposed
grant of US$2.5 million from the Japanese Government. It consists of (i) a US$16.2 million
investment lending component to be co-financed by a Credit allocation of $14.2 million to be
channelled through a Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD), established
by GOK as a financial intermediary vehicle to provide medium term foreign exchange loans to
private enterprises; and (ii) a US$3.9 million technical assistance component including (a)
US$2,420,000 for management of the FERD; (b) US$630,000 for technical support to
enterprises; (c) US$350,000 for financial sector studies; (d) US$350,000 for project co-
ordination; and (e) US$150,000 for audit of project accounts. An amount of US$200,000 for
contingencies is allocated from the IDA Credit. Local contributions amount to US$780.000 to
be provided by the Kyrgyz Orient bank under the technical assistance, and US$2 million
equivalent by enterprises and local banks. Early implementation of this technical assistance has



been initiated with an advance of $950,000 from the Project Preparation Facility and a project
preparation grant from the Japanese Governnwnt of $854,000, approved in 1994 to cover the
costs of short-term consultants for about 30 to 40 enterprise diagnoses, and establishment of
small regional information centers for enterprises.
6.          As local banks are insufficiently capitalized and do not currently meet IDA
accreditation criteria, the proposed FERD will intermediate IDA funds and lend directly to
private entenprises to immediately respond to their urgent demand for resources. However, local
banks will not be displaced by these interim arrangements, from investment lending activities
because (i) a private local bank will be closely associated in the implementation of the lending
component; (ii) EBRD and other donors, such as KfW and the USAID's Central Asian-American
Enterprise Fund (CAAEF), will provide technical assistance, loan and equity investment
resources to the private sector through banks either as risk-takers or as agents; and (iii) other
local banks are expected to provide local currency co-financing, and in future to repurchase the
loan portfolio of the FERD. In anticipation of future accreditation of local participating banks,
the FERD is structured as an Anex wholesale fund to provide accredited banks with refinancing
resources.
7.          Investment sub-loans  will finance  critical productive  equipment for
debottlenecking, and product quality improvements. Sub-loans may also finance industrial
building rehabilitation, excluding land acquisition and development of housing and office
building. Incremental working requirements will be eligible for financing either as part of a
project investment program or on a free-standing basis. On the basis of visits to some 50
enterprises, a pipeline of 27 eligible enterprises was developed, requiring a total estimated
investment amount of US$49 million, and total requested loan amount of US$34 million. This
pipeline does not overlap with projects identified so far by EBRD and KfW  which target
different sizes of firms, and sectors.
8.          Tenns and Conditions. KRG will relend the proceeds of the IDA Credit through
the FERD to finance the credit component, and assume the cross currency risk between US
dollar and SDR. Funds relent under the credit components and enterprise support to FERD will
be denominated in US dollars. Beneficiary sub-borrowers will assume (i) the foreign exchange
risk between the US dollar and the Kyrgyz Som, and (ii) pay market-determined interest rates
equivalent to rates charged by local banks for US dollar denominated loans for investment. Such
rates currently average 20 to 40 percent a year, but are expected to decline to 15 to 18 percent
as more hard currency resources become available. IDA financed subloans for technical support
to enterprises will bear a rate equivalent to the rate of 5-year (hereinafter medium tern) US-
Treasury Bonds plus a 2 percent margin. The Govemrnment will make a subsidiary Loan and
charge the FERD a variable interest rate corresponding to the rates for long-term US Treasury
Bonds. The FEPJD on-lending rates on IDA funds will be reviewed regularly, and if necessary
revised in a marner acceptable to IDA. Such rates should, on average, be close to those of
EBRD and C.AAEF, which will be also market determined. Maturities of sub-loans to final
beneficiaries will be limited to a maximum of eight years including grace periods of up to one
year. The FERD will receive the funds for a period of 15 years, including five years of grace



- 4 -
starting after the date of Credit effectiveness. The bulk of the sub-loans are likely to have a life
of 1 to 8 years, i.e., witl sub-loan repayment schedules generally shorter than the underlying
subsidiary Loan repayment due from FERD to KRG. Consequently, during IDA's ten-year
grace period, foreign exchange fund reflows to FERD from sub-loan repayments will be recycled
and relent under the same conditions for the same purposes as the original sub-loans. Before the
end of this period the FERD is expected to have sold its portfolio to local banks and to be
phased out after reimbursing the Govemment.
C. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
9.          A Project Administration Unit (PAU), consisting of two local professionals has
been established in the State Commission on Foreign Investment and Economic Assistance,
GOSKOMINVEST, to monitor execution of the FERD management contract, and ensure liaison
and co-ordination between the IDA, NBK, Ministry of Finance and other eventual agencies
during project implementation and supervision. GOSKOMINVEST role also includes
negotiations on behalf of Government of all agreements. The PAU will contract with the FM
for the execution of the project. The PAU may propose termination of the FERD management
if it is not satisfied with performance and if IDA agrees. The PAU has responsibility for
ex-post reviews of sub-loans approved.
10.         The FERD is a Government owned financial intermediary, with designated
authorized officers, and whose management will be contracted out to a reputable private
international bank, as Fund Manager (FM). The latter will be closely associated with the
Kyrgyz Orient Bank, a private conmmercial bank, selected in agreement with IDA, to be its
counterpart. The FERD will assume the commercial risks and lend directly to borrowing
enterprises in the first phase of the project, pending accreditation of local participating banks.
Such a private management arrangement by a reputable private international bank is expected
to attract local and foreign private investors by ensuring independent and accountable
decision-making for len-ding and technical assistance support to enterprises.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
11.         Project sustainability will be aided by availability of equity capital from the US
financed Central Asian-American Enterprise Fund (CAAEF) which will soon be operational in
the Kyrgyz Republic where an office is being established. The market-based selection criteria
to be applied by the FM, and the technical assistance made available to selected borrowers, will
increase the probability that viable and efficiently run enterprises are beneficiaries of IDA funds.
This would spur economic activities and facilitate the supply response. The FM/FERD activities
are expected to progressively establish privately-led, sustainable capacities for investment
banking and private business/investment consulting through intensive on the job training of
Kyrgyz professionals and bankers. Cost recovery will be sought through application of market-
determined rates for lending, and partial recovery of the cost of technical assistance support on
a matching grant basis.

E. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST EXPERIENCE
12.         Experience shows that disbursement of financial intermediary lending operations
can be hampered by an unlstable macroeconomic environment, and the absence of market-
determined, positive interest rate structures. Political pressure and interference in the decision-
making process, which contributes to volume lending by inexperienced and financially unsound
financial intermediaries, have also contributed to non performance of Bank Group funded loans.
These factors which are present in varying degrees in the Kyrgyz Republic, have been taken into
account in designing project institutional arrangements. Firstly, substantial progress is being
achieved in macro-economic and monetary and credit policies. Interest rates are now positive
in real terms and the local currency is fully convertible. Secondly, the investment demand has
been carefully assessed, and a detailed pipeline of projects developed in close collaboration with
enterprises, and the lending component conservatively sized at $14.2 million against an estimated
demand of $34 million. Thirdly, project preparation has focused on providing preliminary
assistance to enterprises to prepare their business and investment plans. Finally the institutional
arrangements for implementation by-pass weak, Government-dominated banks, and minimize
political interference by contracting out management of lending and technical assistance support
to reputable private local and foreign banks. Such arrangement should ensure a high degree of
local ownership and sustainability. The effectiveness of project institutional arrangements will
be assessed around March 1997, during a Mid-Term Review of project implementation, and
corrective action taken.
F. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
13.         This project is consistent with the first Country Assistance Strategy discussed by
the Board on April 22, 1993. An Economic Report was circulated to the Board in May 1994.
The objectives of IDA's assistance program for the Kyrgyz Republic are to: (i) facilitate
restoration of growth without which poverty reduction would not be possible; (ii) support the
emerging private sector; and (iii) support the Government in protecting vulnerable segments of
the society during transition. The initial IDA program envisaged a blend of policy-based and
sectoral investment credits, complemented by a comprehensive analysis of sectoral issues. This
strategy was broadly realized through the completion of two country economic reports, four
sector studies and the approval of four credits: a Rehabilitation Credit (US$60 million
equivalent); a Privatization and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC) (US$60 million);
a Social Safety Net Credit (US$17 million equivalent); and a Telecommunications Credit (US$18
million equivalent). The Rehabilitation Credit was designed to lay the foundation for the policy
dialogue while financing critical imports and technical assistance in key areas of the structural
reform program. The enterprise restructuring program backed by the PESAC supports: (i) the
reduction of the State role in economic activity through privatization, liquidation or passive
restructuring of selected enterprises; (ii) improvements in governance of those enterprises that
remain temporarily in the public sector; and (iii) removal of market imperfections, price and
trade distortions and barriers to entry and exit.



- 6 -
14.         The proposed Private Enterprise Support Credit (PESP) is designed to support
successfu post-privatization performance of fonner SOEs through improvements in management
etficiency, productivity, marketing and profitability. The project will develop the institutional
foundation for financing projects with high financial and economic returns, and fits well into the
Bank Group country assistance strategy for the Kyrgyz Repuulic. The project will complement
the measures being supported under PESAC and other IDA operations. Under the proposed
FY95 Agricultural Privatization and Enterprise Adjustrnent Credit (APEAC) the reform process
will be intensified and focused to restructure and privatize remaining monopolies, particularly
in the agricultural sector. IFC is actively involved in development of the mining sector and its
Foreign Investment Advisory Service is advising the Government. In the financial sector, IDA
and donors are focusing on developing the banking infrastructure and providing assistance for
audits, studies and training. This operation provides limited technical assistance to the financial
sector to complement and deepen other donor activities. This will be followed by an FY96
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC), under preparation, which would assist in developing
a comprehensive program of financial sector reforms, and development strategy.
G. AGREED ACTIONS
15.         As agreed during Negotiations, the Goverrnent has established the Fund for
Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD), and appointed the head of the Project
Administration Unit. The following will be conditions of effectiveness of the Credit: (a)
signature of the management contract for the FERD; and (b) signature of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and the FERD. Finally, the Government has also agreed
to undertake jointly with IDA a Mid-Term Review of project implementation by March 31,
1997.
H. ENVIRONMENT
16.         No major environmental issues are foreseen under the project, as most Kyrgyz
manufacturing and processing industries, with the exception of the mining sector, are generally
environmentally benign. On the basis of the current sample of preselected privatized enterprises,
no environmental liabilities have been identified, in part because of the relatively benign nature
of the enterprises involved. However, as Kyrgyz environmental regulations are not always
adequate or effectively enforced, particular safeguards will be implemented by the Fund
Manager. IDA and KRG have jointly prepared a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP),
including revision of environmental regulations and development of the required institutional
capacity for implementation of such regulations. in accordance with Bank guidelines, the
proposed project has a B environmental rating applicable, whenever deemed necessary by IDA
and the FM, to beneficiary enterprises. Consequently, subproject appraisal, procurement and
supervision procedures, will include assessment of environmental risks and requirements for
safeguards for sub-projects financed.  A  simplified manual on Environmental Review
Procedures, will be used accordingly by the FM.

I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES
17.         The primary program objective categories are private sector development and
economic management. The project supports the strengthening of the private enterprise sector
and the development of a market economy. It also assists local banks to improve their financial
and economic appraisal of investment projects.
J. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
18.         Benefits. The proposed project will support the Govermment's economic reform
and privatization programs, through efforts to help ensure the successful post-privatizaticon
performance of former SOEs. Improvements in management efficiency, productivity, marketing
and profitability of privatized enterprises will also yield tangible economic benefits for investors,
workers, and the country as a whole. The project will deve.op the institutional foundation for
providing financing to projects with high financial and economic returns, and technical assistance
to enterprises in developing well formulated business plans. It will also contribute towards
institutional reform of the financial sector, which will be supported further by a subsequent
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit.
19.         Risks.  There are three main risks associated with this project:  (i) slow
implementation of new economic policy and legal and regulatory reforms for private enterprise
development; (ii) slow project implementation and Credit disbursement; and (iii) political
pressure, and opposition to required enterprise downsizing, product diversification and quality
enhancement. The first risk is being mitigated through understandings reached under the IDA
supported Privatization and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC), approved in June
1994, the Policy Framework Paper, and the first year IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF) approved in July 1994. The second and third risks will be mitigated by
contracting management of the FERD to a reputable private international financial institution
associated with a local pri ate bank. Only privatized enterprises submitting satisfactory corporate
governance structures and business plans will be eligible for technical assistance and FERD
finance. The lending component ha-s been conservatively sized at $14.2 million, and the
enterprise support component designed to also accelerate implementation of subprojects by
enterprises. Progress towards this and other project objectives will be reviewed during the Mid-
Term Review of project implementation scheduled for March 1997, and corrective actions taken
as needed.
