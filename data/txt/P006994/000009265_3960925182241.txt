PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ITABO C(AL TERMINAL AND POWER ENGINEERING PROJECT (LOAN 2369-DO)
Highlights
1.       The loan 2369-DO (US$ 3.8 million equivalent), helped to finance:
i) feasibility and engineering design for a coal unloading port in Haina
and transport facilities to Itabo power plant, ii) enviromental study and
engineering design for the installation of an ash-handling facilities in
the Haina/Itabo area, iii) technical assistance and engineering studies to
rehabilitate existing thermal power plants and iv) technical assistance to
carry out one-year of CDE's electricity losses reduction program. The
project was only partially successful in meeting its objectives because,
even though the engineering studies for coal unloading in the port of Haina
were finished, CDE abandoned this study due to public opposition to its
location and decided to undertake the studies for locating the unloading
port in another site (off-shore south of Itabo power plant). The other
studies included in the project were completed and some of them have been
implemented or would be implemented under the power sector rehabilitation
and distribution project,
2.       The project was completed in November 1986, or about one year
later than the target completion date. Implementation of the distribution
component was the major cause of this delay, and it was due to lack of
counterpart funds, and human and material resources (vehicles), which
prevented the Consultants from carrying-out the field work as planned.



DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ITABO COAL TERMINAL AND POWER ENGINEERING PROJECT (LOAN 2369-DO)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1      Bank Lending to the Sector
1.1.1    Since 1976 the Bank has made four loans to the Transportation
Sector totalling US$ 100.8 million (Annex 1.1). The loan.being analyzed
now to finance technical assistance to tte transportation and the power
sectors, included an additional amount of US$ 3.8 million.
1.1.2    The Bank Group had an operation in 1969 with Loan 646-DO which
included inter alia financing a power plant for the privately-owned
Falconbridge ferronickel plant. In 1980, Loan 1782-DO included a program
to finance imports after a hurricane; local funds generated by the loan
financed two gas turbines at Los Mina (near Santo Domingo). Other than
these two loans indirectly related to the power sector, Bank involvement in
the transportation and Power sectors was limited to the activities
discussed in paragraphs 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 below. Thus, the first involvement
with the Power Sector is the Loan 2369-DO, Itabo Coal Terminal and Power
Engineering project, which is the subject of this report.
1.1.3    In the transportation sector, the Bank has made four road
maintenance and reconstruction loans (Loans 1316-DO, 1738-DO, 1784-DO and
2609-DO). The First Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Project (Loan
1316-DO), amounted to USS 5 million and provided for the reconstruction of
a section of the main road connecting the capital with Santiago, the second
most important city of the Dominican Republic. The Project Performance
Audit Report of 1981 indicatins that project implementation wan, generally
developed as planned, but p:ice increases forced a reduction of the scope
of the project as it took 2.5 years to achieve congressional ratification
and effectiveness of the loan. The second loan, for the Emergency Road
Construction Project (Loan 1783-DO), amounted to US$ 25 million. It
supported the reconstruction of 150 km of roads connecting the agricultural
areas of the north-west with Santiago, the center of the region. Because
of its emergency nature, the project was initiated without adequate design
standards, which led to revision, resulting in an unfinanced gap closed by
a Bank-approved transfer of funds from the Second Road Maintenance and
Reconstruction Project (Loan 1784-DO). The Project was completed with a
time overrun and cost increases, but once completed, remained economically
justified. The third loan, for the Second Road Maintenance and
Reconstruction Project (Loan 1784-DO), amounted to US$ 35 million. The
loan supported the strengthening and expansion of the national road
maintenance capacity and included a reconstruction program for primary and
secondary roads. The fourth loan, needed to complete the Third Road
Reconstruction Project (Loan 2609-DO), amounted to USS 35.8 million, and
helped to finance the construction of about 150 km of roads, iniciated
under the Loan 1784-DO, and improvement of about 100 km of rural roads.



-2-
The Project is progressing satisfactorily, except for the reconstruction of
section two of the Santiago - San Francisco Macoris road. The last
supervision report estimates that the project will be completed in
September 1989, at about the time expected at appraisal.
1.1.4    The Bank had had ne involvement in the port subsector until 1980
when discussions began with the Government and the Corporacion Doninicana
de Electricidad (CDE) which led to the Bank making two Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) advances. The first, in September 1981, financed part of a
study contracted by CDE for a proposed coal unloading terminal. The
second, in January 1983, was to finance primarily an environmental impact
study due to the introduction of coal handling operations into the Haina
area and Freliminary engineering for an ash disposal system.
1.2      Power and Transportation Sector Organization
1.2.1    Power Sector Organization
1.2.1.1 The most important institution in the Power Sector of the
Dominican Republic is the Corporacion Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE), an
autonomous electric utility company which operates the main public service
and reports directly to the President of the Republic, establishes
operating and development program for the power sector and proposes
electricity tariffs for the' President's approval. For many years, the
country has suffered electricity shortages as a result of inefficient
policies and institutions, and the precarious financial situation of the
power sector. As a result cf the lack of reliable supply of electricity by
the public utility (CDE), since the early 70's there has been a rapid
development of the installation of emergency units. Generation of these
units is not known, but could possibly be as high as 252 of CDE sales.
Five large industrial consumers also have a generation capacity which, in
1985, amounted to 27Z of CDE's generating capacity and produced the
equivalent of 282 of CDE's own generation. The ferronickel industry
(Falconbridge) account for 732 of this capacity. In recent years, due to a
reduction of its own activity, it has been selling a significant amount of
energy to CDE, which in 1986 amounted to 13.7Z of CDE's o', net generation.
The Consejo Estatal de Azucar (CEA) has 62 MW of bagasse-fueled units, and
generatea mainly for its own use.
1.2.1.2 The re ponsibility for formulation of energy policies, energy
administration, planning and development, and setting of energy prices are
scattered amoung various Government entities and institutions. The
National Planning Office (ONAPLAN) is responsible for national economic
planning, including energy planning; the Comision Nacional de Politica
Energetica (COENER) is an advisory body to the President of the Republic,
in charge of planning and policies for the energy sector. Both ONAPLAN and
COENER are under the Technical Secretary of the Presidency. But, ro clear
definition of responsibilities exist. The Instituto Nacional de Recursos
Hidraulicos (INDRHI) is responsible for planning, studying, and programming
all hydraulic and hydroelectric works and for the operation and maintenance
of publicly-owned irrigation systems.



-3-
1.2.2    Transportation Sector Organization
1.2.2.1 The Transportation Sector is formed basically by institution of
two subsectors: transportation and ports. Transportation, which includes
roads construction and maintenance, is carried out by the Secretariat of
State for Public Works and Communications (SEOFC). The SEOPC is
responsible for transport policy, planning, construction and maintenance of
roads. Ports are owned and managed by the Dominican Port Authority *APD)
and the Department of Ports of the SEOPC. There are fixteen commercial
ports, nine serving foreign trade, two tourism and four domestic coastal
traffic.  Three ports are privately operated.  The ports of Haina, Santo
Domingo and San Andres serve Santo Domingo and handle two-thirds of the
foreign traffic; they are owned and managed by APD.
1.3      Basic features of the Power and Ports Subsectors
1.3.1    The Dominican Republic (about 50,000 km2) covers the eastern
two thirds of the lsland of Hipaniola and has a population of about six
million. The population is concentrated on the southern coast,
varticularly around the capital and principal industrial area at Santo
Domingo. Power infrastructure followed the pattern of dense settlement
witn the urban population receiving preferential access to electricity. In
1986, only about 382 of the total population received electric services.
1.3.2    Only limited fossil energy sources (lignite reserves and minor oil
deposits) have been identified in the Dominican Republic and these do not
appear to be commercially exploitable. Hydroelectric potential is much
more promising with an identified capacity of 1,800 MW but only about 25?
of its potential has been or is in the process of being exploited. During
the pre-1973 era of relatively inexpensive oil, the country's energy
consumption was founded on oil imports. By the early 1980s, imported oil
produced 92? of the electric power and oil accounted for more than one-
third of all imports. This heavy dependance on imported fuel has and is
expected to continue. CDE, ownes and operates about 64Z of the country's
power generating and distribution facilities. In 1987, eighty percent of
CDE's generationg capacity was thermal.  Power system losses in 1986 were
about 32.5Z of net generation and the efficiency of its power plants was
extremely low.  In 1987 there were under construction: Itabo II Coal Plant
(125 MW) by CDE, two hydro projects (the 25 MW Rio Blanco and the 150 MW
Jiguey Aguacate) by INDRHI and two bagasse fueled thermal plants (60MW) by
CEA. It is estimated that these additions in capacity would just meet the
potential growth of demand for the next few years under acceptable
reliability conditions.
1.3.3    In 1980, nine ports handled the Dominican Republic's foreign trade
of around 4.5 million tons of which the Haina Port handled about 1.2
million tons and it was expected that its share would increse upon
completion of the container terminal under construction in 1983. Haina
also contains the country's largest sugar refinery and CDE's largest coal
thermal plant (Itabo I) located at short distance west of the port. Itabo
II is being built in the same location and is expected to be commissioned
in September 1988. The Dominican Port Authority (APD), will eventually own
and manage all the ports. In 1983, it controlled the port of Haina but its
activities were quite limited. It was intended that technical assistance
to APD wouald be included in the Itabo coal terminal project.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION A_D APPRAISAL
2.1      Origin and Rationale for the Project
2.1.1    The project has its origin in discussions held in October 1980
with Dominican Republic officials while a Bank's mission was evaluating the
competitive position of Puerto Plata vis-a-vis other caribbean port
facilities. During thiz mission CDE officials informed the Bank that its
generation expansion plan contemplated installation of four 125 MW plants
in the period 1983-90. It was estimated that the four units would require
about 1.5 million tons of coal annually. In addition, three existing
plants owned by CDE with a total generating capacity of 30 MW and three 66
MW units owned by Falconbridge were expected to be converted from oil to
coal. This would increase the needs for port facilities and a new coal
terminal was needed. The Itabo area (10 km West of Santo Domingo), where
the CDE owns land and generating plants, was mentioned as a possible site.
The Dominican Republic officials decided to study the feasibility of
constructing a new coal terminal.
2.2      Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.2.1    In response to a request by the Government, a Bank ports mission
in December 1980 initiated discussions with the Government and CDE of a
port facility to handle the import of coal for the thermal power plants
being built at Itabo near the port of Haina. Utilizing funds from the PPF
advances (paragraph 1.1.4), CDE engaged two consultants to undertake: (a)
the design of the coal handling facilities; and (b) an environmental impact
study of the introduction of coal in the Haina area and a plan for ash
disposal. By June 1983, these assignements were well advanced and a Bank
mission appraised a project in 1983 for the construction of the coal
terminal and related installations. However, in view that the proposed
site, within the prrt jurisdiction, was not acceptable to CDE, it was
agreed to postpone action on the construction loan but instead to process
an engineering loan which would provide the necessary funds to complete the
two consultants' contracts, the cost of which it was apparent would exceed
the maximum available from the PPF (two advances of US$ 500,000). It was
agreed that the engineering project would also include financing high
priority programs to increase the efficiency of CDE's generating and
distribution facilities.
2.2.2    The Itabo Coal Terminal and Power Engineering Project, was to
finance continuation of the studies mentioned above as well as some minor
improvements in CDE's power generation and distribution facilities. This
jroject would be executed by CDE, who also would provide the local funds
required. Since this project included only an engineering loan, its
objectives for institutional improvements were quite limited. It was
intended that measures to improve the operational, institutional and
financial performance of the executing agency would be included in a future
project to be prepared on the basis of the studies to be financed by this
project. Accordingly, these aspects of the project were treated only very
briefly in the President's Report (there was no Staff Appraisal Report).
The recently approved loan for implementation of the power sector
rehabilitation and distribution project, includes technical assistance and
training and a broad action Plan for Institutional, Financial, and
operational improvements.



2.2.3    The Project Description in the President's Report provided that
the propesed engineering loan would finance the cost of studies, technical
assistance, and detailed engineering for the proposed Itabo coal unloading
terminal in the port of Haina and related installations, for rebabilitation
of CDE's generating plants, and for reduction of losses in CDE's
distribution system. It would cover the following aspects:
(a) coal terminal study and design consisting of a feasibility study
for a single berth coal discharge wharf in the port of Haina and
transport facilities to the storage yard of the Itabo power plant,
detailed engineering for the same facilities and preparation of
contract documents for construction;
(b)  environmental impact study and design of ash handling
installations, including an analysis of all environmental effects
resulting from the introduction of roal transport and firing in
the Haina/Itabo area, and final engineering for installations for
the transportation of ash from the Itabo plant to a disposal site;
(c) technical assistance and engineering studies required for
improvement of the generating efficiency of CDE through the
rehabilitation of existing thermal power plants, and improving
operating procedures and spare parts and inventory management; and
(d) technical assistance in the implementation of the program to
reduce losses in CDE's distribution system, including specialist
adxisors to CDE's Commercial Department.
2.2.4    The appraisal mission estimated the total project cost at USS 4.3
million, including US$ 1.0 million to refinance the PPF advances; US$ 3.64
million of the project cost was to be foreign exchange. The Bank loan would
cover 100% of foreign costs as well as 23? of local expenditures for the coal
terminal, environmental and ash handling studies. CDE would finance the
remaining local costs.
2.3      Negotiations, Board Presentation, Loan Signature and Effectiveness
2.3.1    Negotiations for the proposed engineering project were held in
Washington and Santo Domingo and were succesfully completed on October 27, 1983.
The Board approved the Loan on December 20, 1983. Representatives of the Bank,
the GoveLnment and CDE signed the Loan and Project Agreement on January 23,
1984. The Loan amounted to US$ 3.8 million; the term was 17 years, including 4
years grace. The interest agreed was a variable rate of 0.5X per annum above
the cost of the Bank's qualified borrowings. December 1984 was set as project
completion date and June 30, 1985 for loan closing date. The Loan was made to
the Government to be on-lent to CDE on the same conditions. The loan became
effective on February 1985, almost one year later than originally forecast, due
to delays of loan ratification by the Dominican Congress.

2.4      Major Covenants in the Loan and ProJect Agreements
2.4.1    Annex 2.1 contains the major covenants of the loan and Project
Agreements. The compliance by the Government and CDE were generally
satisfactory, except as regard to the furnishing of the audit reports to the
Bank on the agreed dates.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.1      Project Implementation Schedule
3.1.1    Annex 3.1 shows the actual and e;-pected project implementation
schedule, and details of each project cor.ponent are given below.
3.2      Implementation of the coal terminal study
3.2.1    The coal terminal study and design were carried out by consultants
under a contract approved by the Bank for financing under the PPF in August
1981. The draft final report was submitted in October 1983. Since this
engineering loan was not submitted to the Board until December 1983 and, because
of delayed approval of the project by the Dominican Congress, it did not become
effective until February 1985, the work originally visualized as part of the
project was essentially completed before it was officially initiated. The
design submitted was generally satisfactory and followed guidance which had been
received from CDE in July 1982 when the recommended location in the consultants'
siting study was approved by CDE and the Government agencies concerned.
However, by the time the design was submitted, CDE had decided to consider
building the coal terminal in the open sea directly south of Itabo instead of
inside the port of Haina. The consultants were requested to provide
hydrographic and foundation data for the off-shore site and in March 1984
submitted a report on this subject. CDE then began to take steps to prepare
studies for the proposed off-shore terminal and, in April 1985, the Bank
furnished CDE draft terms of rcference for the necessary consultants' services
and in June 1985 informed CDE that it had no objection to the short list of
consultants from whom CDE proposed to invite proposals. These were received
and, in May 1986, CDE was prepared to award the contract for the feasibility
study and design. However, by this time, the funds from Lesn 2369-DO were fully
committed and no other source of funds was available. As a result, the coal
terminal project was at least temporarily abandoned. The power sector
rehabilitation and distribution project to be partially financed by the recently
approved Bank loan, includes as part of the action Plan agreed with the Bank, a
feasibility study (expected to be completed by September 1989) and detailed
engineering design of the least cost solution for CDE of an offshore coal
unloading terminal, including sea and inland transportation, and storage
facilities at the site plants. The offshore alternative would be compared for
economic purposes with the coal terminal in the Haina port.



-7-
3.3      Implementation of Plant Rehabilitation Component
3.3.1    In November 1982, CDE signed a contract with consultants to
perform an evaluation of the country's major thermal power generating
facilities and to prepare a report with preliminary recommendations to
correct the existing problems to bring the plants up to their original
design performance. The evaluation report, completed in May 1983,
identified deficiencies and recommended ways to improve overall operation
of the system. The 1983 report particularly noted that both the Haina and
Santo Domingo stations have been operating below rated capacity and well
below design efficiency. Accordingly a rehabilitation program for these
plants started to improve its availability, capacity, and efficiency.
3.3.2    CDE began its rehabilitation program with the overha..l of the
Haina units 4 and 1 in the years 1984 and 1985 respectively, the first
using its own funds and the second with financing arranged by the major
suppliers. Lack of counterpart funds prevented CDE from completing the
planned rehabilitation program. Beginning the summer of 1985, CDE's
program was accelerated with the beginning of works under the following
three major contracts: (i) A US$ 21 million contract for the rehabilitation
of the Santo Domingo station; (ii) a US$ 21 million contract for
rehabilitation of the Haina station (units 2, 3, 5 and completion of 1);
and (iii) a contract - partially financed by IBRD Bank loan 2369-DO - to
complement the Haina station rehabilitation project which included the
development of the following programs: preventive maintenancc, outage
management, management information system, and computerized thermal
performance monitoring. Improvement in the availability and reliability of
the Haina station were the major goals of these programs.
3.3.3    Because of difficulties in providing counterpart funds,
implementation of contracts 3.3.2 (i) and 3.3.3 (ii) above were partially
completed and only unit 8 in the Santo Domingo station and units 5 and 3 in
the Haina station were fully rehabilitated. The engineering contract
(3.3.3 iii above) financed by the Bank was completed and the consultant
produced all program manuals and its recommendations for implementation.
The nearly total absence of funding for basic operational supplies and
important spare parts, with a concomitant shortage of preventive and
routine maintenance contributed to a rapid deterioration in capacity and
performance of all units, including those which were recently
rehabilitated. Rehabilitation of the remaining units as well as the
implementation of a well planned continuing preventive maintenance program,
and other recommendations made by CDE's consultants are part of CDE's
1988-1993 investment program. The Bank will partially finance - under the
loan for the power sector rehabilitation and distribution project approved
June 7, 1988 - the required spare parts and specialized technical
assistance.
3.4      Implementation of Loss Reduction Program
3.4.1    On May 4, 1984, CDE signed a contract with consultants for
technical assistance to help CDE in the implementation of a program to
reduce energy distribution losses (mainly non-technical losses), including
specialists advisors to CDE's Commercial Department. The Consultants'
services ended in November, 1986. The initial scope of work assigned to
the consultants consisted of technical assistance to CDE to: (i) solve all



-8-
matters related to irregular consumers; (ii) make metering improvements for
single and three phase consumers; (iii) improve the reliability of
measurements at plant and substation levels; (iv) improve meter calibration
procedures and technology; and (v) train CDE's staff in above activities.
Subsequently the scope of work was augmented to include asststance to CDE
in the electronic data processing related to customer billings.
3.4.2    As a result of the consultants' work some improvements were
achieved in the data processing system used by the Commercial department
(billing, customer service, meter installation), as well as in the
procedures used to control illegal use of electricity and methods utilized
for inspection of illegal installations and its regularization
(disconnection and connection of service). Ambitious goals for the
reduction of losses were established, based on the assumptions that
sufficitnt human snd material resources would be assigned.to the program,
but this was not the case. CDE's critical financial situation did not
allow the complete implementatin- of the Consultants' recommendations.
Despite this situation, non-teci... -al losses were reduced frt'.n 18X to 10Z,
but technical losses continued to increase as the distribution networks
continued to deteriorate and no significant investments were made. To
assist in the implementation of the non-technical loss reduction program
CDE has obtained a loan from AID (US$ 3.0 million). Reduction of technical
losses would be possible through the implementation of the recent loan
approved by the Bank to finance the power sector rehabilitation and
distribution project.
3.5      Implementation of the environmental impact study
3.5.1    On August 2, 1982, CDE signed a contract with consultants to
prepare a Master Environmenta' Plan for the zone of the coal-fired thermal
electric plants near Haina. The study was to cover effects of the
operation of these plants on air, water and soil pollution. The estimated
cost of the service, to be completed in four months, was US$ 187,920. In
February 1983, the contract was modified in several respects including: (a)
an evaluation of Coal Operations on Refined Sugar Shipped from Haina
(agreed cost US$ 32,145); and (b) Siting and Preliminary Design of an Ash
Disposal System (US$ 238,745). The Bank agreed to finance these studies
from the second of the two PPF advances made for this project but it soon
became apparent that the Coal Terminal Design work and the environmental
studies would cost more than the funis available from the PPF and it was
necessary to delay some of the environmental studies while the engineering
loan was processed. In May 1983, the Bank received the envirnomental and
ash disposal studies which provided acceptable solutions to the problems
involved. This project (Loan 2369-DO) was then formulated including
additional environmentally related work (Monitoring of Air Pollution and
Detailed Engineering for Ash Disposal, US$ 585,000). The final report on
these tasks was submitted in March 1986. The results of the studies will
provide very useful input when it is decided to proceed with a coal
terminal (para. 3.2.1). Also, on the basis of these studies, implementation
of the a3h disposal system for the Itabo plants would be carried-out as
part of the Power Sector Rehabilitation and Distribution project. The Bank
is providing financing to cover the foreign currency requirements for the
works, consultant services, and inattuments for project monitoring.

3.6      Project Costs
3.6.1    Actual and appraisal forecast costs of the various projects
components are given in Annex 3.2. Except for the increased cost of the
loss reduction program (see para. 3.3), the final costs were rather close
to the initial estimates. Actual and appraisal forecast of the project
financing is shown in Annex 3.3.
3.7      Changes in Closing Date, Allocation of Loan Proceeds and
Disbursement
3.7.1    The closing date was postponed to December 31, 1986, or about one
year later than the appraisal estimated date. This was necessary to allow
CDE the completion of the distribution loss reduction study. Annex 3.4
compares the forecast and actual loan allocation by categories, which were
close to the estimate; and Annex 3.5 presents the actual accumulated
disbursement by semesters.
3.8      Performace of Consultants
3.8.1    There were three consultants involved in the project, which
according to CDE and Bank staff who supervised the project, had a
satisfactory performance.
IV. OBJECTIVES AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.1      Proiect ObJectives
4.1.1    The objectives of the project were to assist CDE: (i) to bring the
pla-ned Itabo coal terminal project in the port of Haina to the level of
engineering and economic analysis necessary for Bank Board consideration;
(ii) to improve the availability and reliability of the Haina Power
station; (iii) to implement a distribution losses reduction program; and
(iv) to prepare an environmental impact study and design for ash handling
facilities.
4.1.2    The project was only partially succes._ 1 in meeting its
objectives, because it failed to bring the coal terminal in the port of
Haina, one of the main components of project, to the level of detailed
engineering and economic analysis as was expected at appraisal, because
when the engineering design was completed, CDE decided to consider building
the coal terminal in the open sea directly south of Itabo power plant.  The
other components of the project were completed satisfactorily, and the
resulting studies were used as a basis for project preparation, and its
implementation would be carried out as part of the Power Sector
Rehabilitation and Distribution Project, partially financed by a Bank loan,
which was approved on June 7, 1988.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      CDE
5.1.1    CDE's management and operational staff performed their specific
duties well, considering the difficult conditions prevailing in the company
during the project implementation stage. CDE's institutional performance
deteriorated significantly. This was due to the financial constraints as a
result of inssuficient tariffs increases, high energy losses, inefficient
operation of its generating facilities, overstaffing, and high turnover in
management positions. This situation is being addressed in the context of
the Power Sector Rehabilitation and Distribution Project.
5.2      The Bank
5.2.1    The Bank's performance during project preparation and
implementation was adequate. Bank's staff who supervised the project were
flexible in accepting CDE's request for minor changes in the project scope.
However, project supervision was not carried-out in depth, and efficiently,
because of the lack of definition on the division responsible for overall
supervision of the project, and the lack of coordination and sufficient
communication between the transport and energy divisions (prior to the
Bank's reorganization).
VI. LESSON TO BE LEARNED
6.1      Project implementation
6.1.1    The studies carried-out by consultants could have been completed
in a shorter period of time, in particular the distribution component of
the project, if the human and material resources allocated by CDE to the
project would have been as expected. In future operations in the Dominican
Republ:ic, the Bank should make sure that the all required staff and
resources necessary are made available by the executing agency to ensure
complecion of the project within the period of time established during
appraisal.

REF: Comments on World Bank Report (Loan 2369-DO)
We are pleased to enclose our comments in reference to the World
Bank Report on Loan 2369-DO.
1.       COAL TERMINAL
A Feasibility Study was carried out by PRC Harris Consultants for
a Coal Terminal at Puerto Haina, with a final report submitted in October,
1983. Due to the high cost of the project, CDE authorities at that time
did not encourage its construction. An alternative solution was considered
and consisted of locating the terminal just off-shore from where the Itabo
Units are located. Hydrografic studies were carried out by PRC Harris on
this new location. After new tendering, the consulting firm Soros &
Associates was hired to prepare a new Feasibility Study of the off-shore
coal terminal, which would take as a reference the study of the coal
terminal at the Haina Port. This firm was also to carry out the final
designs for construction, in the event the project was found technically
and economically feasible.
This new Feasibility Study was not able to be accomplished due to
the fact that financing from Loan 2369-DO was not available. Only 931
(US$1.497 million) of the originally estimated total cost (US$1.606
million) for the design of the coal terminal was disbursed.
2.       ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY & ASH DISPOSAL
An Environmental Impact Study was carried out by a subsidiary of
the Ebasco Corporation called Envirosphere. This study was performed at
the same time as the PCR Feasibility Stuiy for the Coal Terminal. During
its execution, new studies found were to be required and the contract value
had to be increased with World Bank concurrence.
Finall), the design for the Ash Disposal System was carried cut
and finished in 1986, after tendering the contract among local firms and
awarding it for the construction of the system. Again, the project was not
able to be implemented due .o lack of financing. CDE should give first
priority to the implementation of this project as the beginning of
commercial operations with Itabo II is imminent, and will duplicate the
amount of ash generated at Itabo.

Besides the Environmental Impact Study financed under the loan, a
Coal Contamination Vigilance Program was designed, to start with the first
delivery of coal to Itabo. This program envisaged positioning of monitors
for coal dust in strategical unloading and transport areas. This program
lasted one year. It was determined to extend the program one more year
but, due to lack of funds under Loan 2369-DO, the second year was not
implemented. Horeover, there are even now consultant invoices pending
payment. We consider that this program should be reactivated, increasing
the range to include the effects of S02 (Sulphur Dioxide) in the Haina-
Itabo area.
There was apparently no coordination by CDE in supervising the
disbursement of funds under the loan due to the fact that the scope and
cost of the Loss Reduction Program increased. Funds destined to other
studies under the loan were used in the Loss Reduction Program leaving
other studies unfinanced and unfinished and without the possibility of
including any modifications required to their scope.
Yours sincerely,
Ing. Jose R. Jimenez

nuestros comentarios relativos al Informe del Banco Mundial
sobre el Pr6stamo 2369-DO.
1.- TERMINAL DE CARBON
La  con.ultora   PRC  Harris   realiz6   el   Estudio  de
Factibilidad de una Terminal de Car-bt  dentro del Puerto
de Haina, el cual finaliz6 en Octubre de 1983.  Debido al
elevado costo del proyecto, las autoridades de la CDE de
esa 6poca desestimaron su ejecuci6n. Se plante6 la
alternativa de ubicar la Terminal de Carb6n en alta mar
frente a la costa donde estan localizadas las unidades de
Itabo.  La PRC Harris hizo los estudios hidrogrAficos en
esta nueva localizaci6n. Por media de un concurso, se
contrat6 a una nueva firma, Soros & Associates, para

realizar un nuevo Estudio de Factibilicad para la
Terminal de Carb6n Mar Afuera, teniendo como referencia
el Estudio de la Terminal de Carb6n dentro del Puerto de
Haina.    Esa  firma -tambi6n  debia  relizar  los diseRos
definitivos para construcci6n en el caso de que fuera
t*cnica y econ6micamente factible. Este dltimo estudio no
ha podido realizarse por falta de finaciamiento debido a
que los fondos del prdstamo 2369-D0 estaban totalmente
comprometidos. PAra el Diseno de la Terminal de Carb6n
solo se *jejecut6 el 93%. (US$1.497 millones) del estimado
de costo total original de dicho estudio (US$1.606
millones).
2.- ESTUDIO IMPACTO AMBIENTAL Y DISPOSICION DE CENIZAS
El Estudio de Impacto ambiental fu6 desarrollado por la
Envirosphere subsidiaria de la Ebasco Corporation. Dicho
I  ',.A '  realizado  paralela  con  el  Estudic  de
Factibilidad de la Terminal de Carb6n. En la medida que
se   fu6   desarrollando,   surgieron   nuevos   estudios
colaterales requieriendose la modificaci6n del monto del
contrato, siempre can la aprobaci6n del Banco Mundial.

Finalmente,   se  incluy6  el  Disego  del   Sistema  de
Disposici6n de las Cenizas 6eneradas por las Unidades de
Itabo. Este diseno finaliz6 en el 1986, realizandose un
concurso   pbblico   entre   firmas   locales   para   la
construcci6n del sistema. Luego de recibir las ofertas,
el   proyecto   no   pudo   realizarse   por   falta   de
financiamientn.  La  CDE  debe  darle  importancia  a  la
eiecuci6n de este proyecto debido a la entrada inminente
en servicio comercial de Itabo II, lo cual duplicarA el
vol _men de cenizas generadas en Itabo.
Con relaci6n al Estudio del Impacto Ambiental, tambi6n se
incluy6 dentro del prestamo el Programa de Jigilancia de
la Contaminaci6n del Carb6n, a raiz del inicio del
suministro de carb6n a Itabo por el Puerto de Haina. Este
Programa contempl6 el emplazamiento de monitores para el
polvo    del    carb6n    en    lugares   estratOgicamente
seleccionados dentro del Area de influencia de la
descarga y transporte del carb6n desde el Puerto de
Haina.    El programa  tuvo una duraci6n  de un ano. Be
decidi6 extender par un ago mas el programa, pero debido
a 'tA' los fondos del pr6stamo 2369-DO se hab;an agotado,
el -egundo aWo qued6 inconcluso, inclusive hay facturas
de 1;: consultora que quedarn pendientes de pago.

Consideramos   que   este   programa   debe   reactivarse,
inclusive, se debe aumentar el alcance para incluir los
efectos del SO2 en el Area Haina-Itabo.
Aparentemente  no  hubo  una  buena  coordinaci6n  en  la
fiscalizaci6n de la ejecuci6n de los fandos del prtstamo
por  parte de  la CDE debido a que el  alcance oara el
Programa de Reducci6n de P6rdidas fuL aumentado y por
consiguiente, su costo. Esto traio como consecuencia a
que parte de los fondos destinacas a otros estudios
contt?mplados en el pr6stamo se utilizaran en el l'rograma
de Reducci6n de P6rdidas quedando unos iconclusos y otros
sin   poder   incluir   modificaciones   en   su   alcance.
