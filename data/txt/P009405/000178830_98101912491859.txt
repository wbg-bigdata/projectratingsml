APPRAISAL OF THE
JUTE INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
(i)       The Government of Bangladesh has requested IDA financing of a jute
industry rehabilitation project including spare parts needed for maintenance.
The proposed US$20 million IDA Credit would be made to the Government of
Bangladesh, which would (a) onlend US$9.9 million for mill rehabilitation
to individual mills through the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC),
and onlend S$0.5 million for consultants services and training to BJMC and
(b) provide US$9.6 million of foreign exchange to individual mills for purchase
of maintenance spares. The proposed U5$10.4 million to be provided for mill
rehabilitation, consultants services, and training would finance 75% of the
rehabilitation cost excluding duties and taxes. The US$9.6 million would
finance about half of the imported spares and equipment over the next three
years. The other half would be financed from bilateral sources. The Eighth
Imports Program Credit (which the Board approved in February 1980) excluded
financing of spares for the jute industry in view of this Project. Further
monitoring of the jute action programs undertaken under previous import
program credits would be executed under this proposed Credit.
(ii)      The jute industry is Bangladesh's most important industry, employs
about 205,000 workers, and accounts for about 30% of the value added in the
organized manufacturing sector and about 50% of total exports. The Project
would focus on the improved maintenance and rehabilitation of the machinery
of 66 jute mills and on further upgrading of the organization, procedures
and finances of the industry. Thus the Project would help the industry to
stay competitive with producers of polypropylene fabrics and other producers
of jute goods and help assure continued earnings of foreign exchange and
continued employment.
(iii)     IDA has been involved over the past five years in assisting the
Bangladesh jute industry by: (a) providing foreign exchange for import of
maintenance spares in the Fourth through Seventh Imports Program Credits;
(b) drawing up action programs for the improvement of marketing, production
planning, maintenance, organization, management and finances; and (c) providing
technical assistance credits to improve jute factory maintenance and to develop
a model plant to test the production of cloth from a blend of jute and cotton
fibres (jutton). Jute growing has also benefitted from a Jute Development
Project (Credit 765-BD) which is expected to reduce the cost of raw jute sup-
plies to the industry. The proposed Project would continue IDA's involvement
in Bangladesh's jute industry over the next three years.

APPRAISAL OF THE
JUTE INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR _/
Structure of the Industrial Sector
1.01      The industrial sector is an important element in the Bangladesh
economy.  It produces basic consumer goods, provides agriculture with key
inputs, accounts for about 60% of export earnings, and employs some 2 million
workers, although it accounts for only 8% of GDP. Industrial performance has
a critical bearing on resource mobilization and is potentially an important
source of rapid economic growth. A large number of industrial units in
Bangladesh were originally established to supply the two wings that comprised
Pakistan. The separation of these markets, consequent upon the independence
of Bangladesh in 1971, substantially reduced capacity utilization in the
industrial sector. This was compounded by a shortage of foreign exchange to
purchase raw materials and spares, inexperienced management, and labor unrest,
especially in the years immediately succeeding independence.
1.02      As a result of nationalization of many of the country's industries
following independence, most of the large and medium scale enterprises are in
the public sector and consist of approximately 275 units organized under the
administrative control of 7 corporations (namely jute, textiles, chemicals,
steel and engineering, food, cement and forestry). The public sector now
accounts for 65% of the value-added in industry, 85% of manufactured exports,
and 25% of the industrial labor force. Although the listing of industrial
activities open to private investment has been expanded, the public sector
corporations continue to dominate basic industries. To date, denational-
ization/ disinvestment of industries in the public sector has been on a minor
scale.
1.03      The public industrial sector includes the country's largest export
oriented industry (jute) and import substitution industries (textiles, chem-
icals, pulp and paper). The jute manufacturing and cotton textile industries
constitute close to half of the industrial capacity in Bangladesh and have
essential links to the agricultural, rural, and cottage industry sectors of
the economy. In FY79 the jute industry contributed about 30% of the value
added in the organized manufacturing sector and about 50% of total exports,
and employed 205,000 workers. The cotton textile industry, the second largest
industry in Bangladesh, accounts for about 15% of value added in the manu-
facturing sector, employs 76,000 workers, and produces about 60% of the
country's total yarn requirements.

Bangladesh - Issues and Prospects for Industrial Development, December 5,
1978.

Production and Capacity Utilization
1.04      Production in the industrial sector has improved, though slowly,
particularly since FY74, due to the improved availability of raw materials,
intermediate goods and spare parts, and a higher domestic demand for manu-
factured products.

(Weighted on value added)
1.05      Despite improvement in production, many enterprises suffer from
low capacity utilization.  While average capacity utilization was about 65%
in FY79, it was particularly low in chemicals (50%), engineering (50%), steel
(49%), and foods (40%) for various reasons. Common factors include:
(i) irregular and insufficient raw materials supply; (ii) equipment breakdown
and poor maintenance; (iii) insufficient labor training and migration to the
Middle East; (iv) administrative delays linked to excessive centralization;
(v) frequent power cuts; (vi) inadequate transportation; (vii) lack of spare
parts and components linked to foreign exchange shortage; and (viii) insuf-
ficient working capital, which prevents adequate procurement of spares and
components and, in some cases, insufficient raw materials. Thus, low capacity
utilization is only a symptom of many serious problems affecting production
efficiency. Under the Fourth to the Seventh Imports Program Credits, speci-
fic action programs were developed with GOB to help rectify these problems,
particularly in the jute, textile, and pulp and paper industries.
Investment
1.06      Since 1973, GOB's general policy on industrial investment has
gradually shifted towards encouraging private sector activity. In FY79,
limits on private sector investment were waived and private sector invest-
ment was permitted in 10 sectors previously reserved to public firms. The
net impact of these policy changes is reflected in the tentative allocation
of resources during the current Two-Year Plan and in the rising levels of
term lending finance to the private sector. In the Two-Year Plan (FY79-FY80),
Tk 8.2 billion was targeted for industrial investment, with about Tk 2.5
billion (or 25% more than in FY78) allocated for private sector investment.
In FY79, loans sanctioned by DFCs increased from Tk 1.1 billion in FY78 to Tk
1.3 billion (or by about 3% in real terms assum ing an inflation rate of 15%).
All public sector investments are compiled under the Annual Development



Program (ADP) which is prepared by the Planning Commission and approved by the
Executive Committee of the National Economic Council--of which the President
is the Chairman. To remove administrative obstacles and to facilitate imple-
mentation of public and private projects, GOB recently established a "High-
Powered Board" within the Ministry of Industries with a mandate and power to
resolve administrative difficulties.
Export Performance and Prospects
1.07      From FY77 to FY79, Bangladesh's manufactured exports have risen from
US$219.7 million to US$375.3 million, or by 71%, (Table 1-2) with significant
growth rates for timber products (363%), handicrafts (198%) and leather (197%)
which, however, started from a very small base. These growth rates have been
offset to a great extent by the stagnation, in real terms, of jute goods
exports.  Other factors that have influenced the rate of growth have been the
dominant orientation of Bangladesh's industrial development toward import
substitution and the low profitability in some areas of export industry.

Strategy for Industrialization
1.08      The Government's strategy for industrialization focusses on private
sector promotion, export development, and increased efficiencies of public
enterprises. The Eighth Imports Program Credit focussed on the development
of a comprehensive export policy/strategy, including removal of supply con-
straints for non-traditional exports, increasing effectiveness of export
incentives, and improvement of data collection and analysis necessary to
monitor export performance. Public sector units are being given more autonomy
to help improve their operational and financial performance and to remove
constraints affecting their performance. Moreover, the Government is attempt-
ing to rationalize the industrial base with emphasis on efficiency in capacity
utilization and domestic resource use, and reorganization and consolidation of
the structure of existing public sector units. The Project is an example of
these attempts concerning the jute industry subsector.



II. HISTORY OF THE BANGLADESH JUTE GOODS INDUSTRY
Historical Background
2.01      Jute has been grown in the Ganges delta for centuries because
Bangladesh has some of the best jute growing lands in the world. While over
30 varieties exist, only two--Corchorus capsularis (white jute) and Corchorus
olitorius (tossa jute)--are widely grown. Both cultivation and processing
of jute are labor intensive. Fiber from the plant is obtained by retting
(steeping) the stems in water and then separating the fiber from the bark by
hand.
2.02      The first woven jute fabric was produced in a handloom mill at
Serampore in India around 1840. It was soon recognized as a strong packaging
medium in the form of sacks, and increasing demand led to the opening of
the first power driven mill at Barnagore near Calcutta in 1856. By this
time, the major technical difficulties encountered in spinning had been over-
come and it became possible to produce finer fabrics (i.e., hessian) for
packaging of finer commodities (e.g., sugar) as opposed to coarse sacking for
packaging coarser commodities (e.g., foodgrains).
2.03      In Scotland in the mid-nineteenth century, Dundee--having had a long
history of flax spinning and weaving--began manufacturing jute goods in power
driven mills. By 1920, Dundee operated about 30 mills and was second only to
India as a supplier to world markets. Also, other European countries set up
their own industries, although they were much smaller with only limited ex-
ports. Rapid escalation of labor costs during the twentieth century forced
a steady reduction in the number of European jute mills. Now only few mills
remain that produce mainly specialized products.
2.04      After World War II, the first serious long-term difficulties devel-
oped for the jute trade world-wide because of unreliability of supply and
unstable prices. Demand was strong, but transport difficulties and coal
shortages in India limited supplies. Consumption was restricted to about 80%
of pre-War levels. These difficulties accelerated the search for jute sub-
stitutes and gave impetus to efforts to improve techniques for bulk handling
of commodities.
1947-1960
2.05      The partition of India in 1947 had a major impact on world jute
trade. Prior to partition, India accounted for over 96% of raw jute produc-
tion, most raw jute exports, 57% of world jute production capacity, and 85%
of world jute goods exports. After partition, all 108 mills were located in
India, while 71% of the jute growing areas (including the best lands) were in
East Pakistan. Most marketing and financial resources were also in India.
Therefore, India expanded its raw jute production to replace the raw jute
supplies from Pakistan. In 1948-49, India launched a "grow more jute"
campaign which--among other things--distributed seeds at subsidized rates,
established seed farms, supplied fertilizers, and promoted line-sowing (which
is more productive than traditional broadcast sowing).

2.06      On its part, Pakistan decided to establish its own jute manufactur-
ing industry and developed its manufacturing, marketing, and financial capa-
bilities. It gave full support to the jute industry in the Six-Year Develop-
ment Program (1951-57) and extended to it a package of incentives including--
among other things--preferential access to capital, tax concessions, and
export incentives. In 1951, the first jute mill, Bawa Jute Mill (privately
owned), was established in East Pakistan. In the same year construction
started on Adamjee Jute Mill which was, and still is, the largest jute mill
in the world with 2,083 hessian and 940 sacking looms in 1979. The industry
expanded rapidly; by 1960, 15 mills--with a total of 9,272 looms--were operat-
ing. At that time, Pakistan processed 1 million bales of raw jute annually,
or less than 20% of its total raw jute output.
1961-1970
2.07      During 1961-70, the U.S. tufted carpet industry expanded rapidly and
demand for carpetbacking cloth (CBC) increased substantially. Indian mills
were quick to equip themselves to capture this new market and by 1966 had
installed and put into production 2,850 broad looms for the manufacture of CBC.
2.08      In East Pakistan during 1961-70, 33 new mills were opened, old mills
were extended as fast as the supply of new machinery allowed, and the total
number of narrow looms installed more than doubled to 22,250. The first broad
loom plant at Adamjee did not come into operation until 1964. However, by
1970 a total of 2,233 broad looms were installed--partly in new broad loom
mills and partly in composite mills (having narrow and broad looms).
Effects of the Export Bonus Scheme
2.09      In 1959 Pakistan instituted an export bonus scheme to alleviate
its foreign exchange difficulties. A multiple exchange rate system was used
to avoid outright devaluation. Under the export bonus scheme, some exports
continued to receive the rupee equivalent of export receipts at the official
rate; however, for specified items, exporters were given--in addition--bonus
vouchers equivalent to a certain percentage of export value.  These vouchers
could be used to finance imports or sold to others.  While the price of
vouchers fluctuated, the effective exchange rate for exports was substantially
higher than the official rate.  Exporters were in effect being subsidized by
the consumers of imports financed by the vouchers.  The export bonus scheme
was used to discriminate against raw jute exports for a decade. Jute goods
exporters received bonus vouchers from FY60 on, while raw jute exporters
received bonus vouchers only in FY71. Even then, raw jute exporters were
entitled to bonus vouchers worth 10% of their export earnings, while exporters
of jute manufacturers were entitled to 40%.
2.10      The results of the such discrimination were many.  Farmers' incomes
were reduced, while jute manufacturers were given a high level of protection.
As most manufacturing was controlled by non-Bengalis, profits (estimated at
about 10-15% of sales value) were largely remitted to the West Wing. Profit
levels apparently remained high, even in periods (e.g., 1968) when value
added was negative. There were few incentives to manage mills efficiently.



- 6 -
Production per loom declined from 31.7 tons in FY61 to 27.5 tons per year
in FY70, compared to a feasible output level in excess of 55 tons per year.
This was in an industry with no material shortage problems.
2.11      On the positive side, the establishment of the jute industry created
jobs in an area where employment opportunities were scarce. By the end of the
1960's, the jute industry employed about 150,000 people, and Pakistan's share
in manufactured jute exports had risen from negligible amounts to 44%.
1970 - 1980
2.12      The civil unrest that immediately preceded the birth of Bangladesh
in 1971 caused complete stoppage in mill production. Non-Bengali mill owners,
managers, and supervisory personnel left the country and were replaced by
inexperienced management. Moreover, civil disturbances and neglect of main-
tenance--partly due to lack of spares--resulted in substantial deterioration
of the machinery, particularly the more sophisticated spinning frames and
backprocessing machines. In 1972, the basic structure of the industry also
changed when the Government labeled "abandoned property" 44 of the 77 mills--
including some of the largest and best run--and nationalized them. Subse-
quently, as part of the Government's program to nationalize all medium and
large-scale industry, the remaining 33 mills (owned by Bengalis) were national-
ized. A holding company, the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), was
created to run the mills.
2.13      In the years following independence, BJMC's operations deteriorated
substantially. Jute mills produced items that raised the least number of prob-
lems in manufacturing, rather than those that could be sold. The mills lacked
working capital, and their losses and interest burden increased. Subsequently,
BJMC, GOB, and foreign aid agencies developed programs to halt any further
deterioration and to help bring about improvements.
2.14      Past Investment Programs.  In the 1970's, BJMC executed three invest-
ment programs. First, BJMC completed programs in 8 mills (i.e., Mymensingh,
Dacca, Rajshahi, Sonar Bangla, Nawab Askari, Ashraf, Karnafuli, Delta), which
had started prior to independence, but were interrupted in 1971. Completion
of these programs cost Tk 140 million (US$9 million) and was necessary to make
the previous investments productive. Second, in 1975 BJMC started executing
a Balancing, Modernization, and Replacement Scheme for 9 jute mills (i.e.,
Adamjee, Nishat, Carpeting, M. Rahman, Pubali, Peoples, Daulatpur, W. Rahman,
Anowara), which cost Tk 160 million (US$10 million). Since BJMC developed
this investment program without an industry wide survey, it is questionable
whether it was the least cost solution for the industry (intermill transfer
of machinery was not considered) and to what extent the investment was econo-
mically and financially viable. Both programs were financed by loans from the
government (ADP) through BJMC to the individual mills at 9% for 25 years with
a five-year grace period. These two programs are relatively small compared
to BJMC's gross fixed assets of Tk 3.2 billion (US$205 million) in FY79 at
historical values. Third, BJMC established a plant (Gulfra Habib) for manu-
facturing spare parts, one trial plant for manufacture of jute plastics, and
is in the process of creating two jute carpet factories. These new investments
total Tk 104 million (US$6.7 million).

2.15      Foreign Assistance.  In the mid-70's, several foreign aid agencies
designed complementary assistance programs for the jute industry. From 1974
to 1978, the U.K. (ODA) financed (a) assistance to Adamjee Jute Mills covering
organizational matters, process and quality control, material utilization,
plant productivity, personnel policies and procedures, training and cost
accounting; (b) marketing assistance to BJMC; (c) execution of a mill-by-mill
survey to assess the balancing, modernization, and replacement requirements of
individual mills; and (d) execution of a jute marketing study which concen-
trated on raw jute pricing policies. The latter two programs were in conjunc-
tion with IDA's assistance (para 2.16). From 1976 to 1980, the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) provided technical assistance and
machinery for local manufacture of spare parts (Gulfra Habib, para 2.14).
From 1975 to 1980, UNIDO/UNDP provided technical assistance through a project
manager, who reviewed raw jute purchase and other organizational aspects,
a quality control advisor, and a productivity team.
2.16      IDA has been involved in Bangladesh's jute industry since 1975, when
it conducted a study that was the basis for the jute industry action program
of the Fourth and Fifth Imports Program Credits. These programs focussed on
the most urgent problems at that time, i.e., marketing, production planning,
and maintenance work. In 1977, sufficient progress had been made to tackle
more directly the problems of mill efficiency and profitability. This was
the major focus of the action program under the Sixth Imports Program Credit,
which broadened the scope of previous efforts and introduced measures to
strengthen the organization, management, and financial aspects of BJMC. The
Seventh Imports Program Credit focussed on the implementation of pending
actions agreed under the previous Credits and introduced a new focus on export
development. The impact of the action programs was positive. Since FY75, the
jute industry has made substantial progress in strengthening its operating
position. Annex 1 shows the present status of the action programs, focussing
on the areas of marketing, maintenance, organization and financial management,
operational and financial performance.
III. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
Past and Present World Export Market
3.01      World Consumption of Jute Goods.  From the mid-50's to the mid-60's
world consumption (excluding China) of jute goods expanded by an average of
4.1% per annum to about 3 million tons. Thereafter, it declined by an average
of 1.3% per annum to an estimated 2.7 million tons in 1976 (Table 3-1).

and Thailand)                     630              880        22         33

This decline reflects a sharp drop of consumption in the developed countries
from 1.4 million tons of jute during 1967-69 to .87 million tons in 1976--
about a 7% annual decline. The share of developed countries in world consump-
tion declined from 49% to 32%. This decline was mainly due to changes in
consumer preferences to prepackaged food, technical innovations in transpor-
tation, and handling of agricultural produce, all of which negatively affected
the utilization of jute wrapping and sacking materials. High and unstable
prices for raw jute and jute goods, uncertain supply and qualities following
independence of Bangladesh, and major strikes in India in 1974 were other
factors that also led to the use of synthetic substitutes. Textile polyolefins-
polypropylene and polyethylene began making significant in-roads into all the
major end uses of jute--sacks, bags, industrial cloths, and carpetbacking.
3.02      Consumption in the centrally planned countries increased slightly
from 230,000 tons to 260,000 tons, representing 10% of the market. In non-
producing developing countries, consumption increased slightly from 625,000
tons in 1967-69 to 660,000 tons in 1976, representing 25% of the market. In
producer countries (India, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Thailand), consumption
increased substantially from 630,000 tons to 880,000 tons. Thus, the share
of producer countries in world consumption increased from 22% to 33%.
3.03      World Trade of Jute Goods.  The volume of trade of 1 million tons
in 1978 represented 45% of world consumption of jute goods. Trade declined
by about 4% annually from 1967-69, faster than the volume of world consump-
tion. This was mainly due to the sharp decline of imports by developed
countries from 887,000 tons in 1967-69 to 568,000 tons in 1978. However, the
United States remains the major importer of jute goods (mainly carpetbacking),
accounting for 28% of all imports in 1978. The share of imports of centrally
planned countries declined in absolute terms but remained at around 10% of
total world imports. Imports of developing countries also declined slightly
in absolute terms, but given the shrinkage of the total world imports, their
percentage increased from 26% in 1967-69 to 35% in 1978:

The product mix of exports has not changed substantially over the last six
years. In FY74, hessian accounted for 33% of world exports by volume, sacking
for 33%, carpetbacking for 20%, and other jute products for 14%. In compar-
ison, in FY79 hessian increased only marginally to 38%, sacking to 35%,
carpetbacking to 22%; whereas, other jute products declined to 5%.
3.04       Synthetics.  On the other hand, world consumption of polypropylene,
which is an important substitute for jute, increased by 20% per annum during
1966-76.  Although it has certain technical disadvantages against jute (e.g.,
has low melting temperatures, is difficult to dye and print, is slippery--which
affects handling, stacking, and its utility for secondary carpetbacking--and
has less appeal to taste in decorative applications), polypropylene also has
certain advantages (e.g., is tougher, water resistant, lightweight, and con-
tours easily). Since technological developments are likely to overcome the
technical disadvantages, price competitiveness and reliability of supply will
be the key factors in future demand for jute goods. Technological research
on jute and development of improved products will also be important.
3.05      Prices.  In the past, prices for all major jute goods had been basic-
ally in line with those of competing polypropylene fabrics, except from 1971
to 1974 and in the second half of 1979. Due to power shortages and strikes
in India and Bangladesh, there was a shortage of jute goods, and their prices
were substantially higher than those of competing polypropylene fabrics. As
of December 1979, hessian and carpetbacking prices had almost doubled, and
sacking prices increased by about one-third as compared to the average of FY79.
Since the price of polypropylene did not increase substantially, its competi-
tive advantage improved considerably. For example, in the fourth quarter of
1979, the price for 6-ounce jute secondary carpetbacking was 33i/square yard
(delivered), or 57% above the comparable price of polypropylene fabric, which
was 21//square yard (delivered). Similarly, for 40", 10-ounce hessian, the
price was 34.84/square yard, or 81% above the comparable price of polypropy-
lene, which was 19.34/square yard:

However, in 1980 the jute goods supply situation began to improve, reducing
jute goods prices substantially.
Past Trends in Bangladesh's Exports
3.06      In FY70, Bangladesh's exports reached a record level of 564,000
tons, representing 44% of the world export market in that year, but fell
to a low of 369,000 tons in FY75 (35% of world market). However, in FY76,
Bangladesh recaptured part of the market and, thereafter, became the major
exporter of jute goods and held about 47% of the world export market. About
85% of Bangladesh's exports are in three markets: sacking, to the developing
countries; hessian, to the developed and developing countries; and carpet-
backing, to the developed countries, particularly the U.S.A. India is the
only other major exporter of jute goods, but has decreased its exports in
view of sharply increasing domestic consumption in recent years.

3.07      During FY79, BJMC could not take full advantage of a buoyant hessian
and carpetbacking market because of production constraints--such as power
shortages 1/ and labor unrest--which resulted in exports of only 453,000 tons
as compared to 522,000 tons in FY78, a fall of 13%. However, a 28% average
price increase raised export earnings from jute goods from US$250 million in

captive power in individual mills. However, GOB considers the scarce
foreign exchange to be better spent on improvement of the overall power

FY78 to US$268 million in FY79. 1/ As compared to FY78, the product compo-
sition in FY79 showed a decline in sacking from 47% to 43% and in "other
products" from 3% to 2% (particularly cotton bagging), with an increase in
hessian from 35% to 38% and maintenance of the share of carpetbacking at 16%.
This demand shift from sacking to hessian is different from previous years,
which showed a shift from hessian to carpetbacking, with sacking maintaining
its share. Also, since 1969, Bangladesh has been producing lighter fabrics to
meet the shift in demand. However, during FY78 and FY79, the product mix
between heavy and light cloth remained about the same as in FY77.
Future World Export Market
3.08      Prices.  The high jute goods prices prevailing in early 1980 enabled
BJMC to make profits for the first time in its history (para. 9.08). While
these high prices may enable BJMC to take short-term profits, they may result
in long-term losses. Jute might lose part of its market permanently if prices
for jute goods remain substantially above those for polypropylene. This would
encourage polypropylene producers to invest in additional production capaci-
ties. A similar situation existed in 1974 when prices of jute goods increased
sharply due to supply constraints, and when jute lost permanently market shares
to the polypropylene competition, particularly in primary carpetbacking. A
similar danger of permanent market loss also exists for sacking, secondary
carpetbacking, and hessian, although these jute fabrics cannot be substituted
by synthetics as easily as primary carpetbacking.  BJMC and GOB are aware of
the delicacy of the situation and were trying to reduce the high prices in
early 1980, particularly for hessian and carpetbacking. Although Bangladesh
controls about half of the market, lower prices for its own products did not
bring the prices down given the shortage. The most effective measure to
decrease prices was increased production. Although this was difficult because
power shortages and labor strikes are beyond the control of BJMC, BJMC and the
Government made attempts to increase production through additional shifts and
improved handling of labor disputes. High priority must also be given to
improving the reliability of the power system. By April 1980, slightly in-
creased production and a slack in demand due to the upcoming recession in
the US have reduced prices for jute carpetbacking slightly below those of
comparable polypropylene, but prices for hessian remained at the high level
prevailing at the beginning of 1980.
3.09      An FAO study of October 1979 expects polypropylene prices to rise
only marginally, although oil prices increased substantially from an average
of US$12.7/barrel in the first three quarters of 1978 to US$18/barrel in July
1979 and US$24/barrel in December 1979. Polypropylene prices are not highly
sensitive to increases in crude oil prices. A 10% increase in crude oil price
would require only about a 2% increase in polypropylene prices to offset the
higher cost. Since crude oil prices increased by about 50% from mid-1978
to July 1979, one would theoretically expect a 10% price increase for poly-
propylene during this period. However, since polypropylene is a basic commo-
dity, its price is subject to wide fluctuations depending on demand and supply
1/   Calculated in Taka, which includes an 11% appreciation of the E against
the Taka from FY78 to FY79. Export prices are quoted in UK h.

and even varies widely between Europe and North America. In Europe the price
increased from US$541/metric ton in the third quarter of 1978 to about US$1,045/
metric ton in September 1979, an increase of 93%. In the U.S., the price
increased over the same period of time from US$595/metric ton to about US$639/
metric ton, an increase of 7%. In spite of these wide fluctuations, certain
trends can be projected.
3.10      The FA0 study points out that polypropylene capacity utilization
is well below the desired level of 85% and is expected to remain at that level
in the future, since considerable capacity is under construction. Moreover,
producers often can absorb cost increases because propylene monomer is pro-
duced in an integrated process with another coproduct (ethylene) to which
producers can allocate part of the crude oil cost increases. In conclusion,
polypropylene prices are projected to increase more slowly than increases in
costs of production might indicate.
3.11      Prices for hessian must decrease substantially to compete with
synthetics prices effectively. Further easing of supply constraints are
expected to decrease all jute goods prices to competitive levels by the middle
of 1980. BJMC and IDA project the following average prices for jute goods
for FY81 and thereafter:
--------------Tk per ton----------------
Actual               Projected                (%)
December 1979   Average for FY81 to FY84   Decrease

These prices would be low enough to compete with prices of comparable poly-
propylene fabrics (para 3.05, Table 3-3), yet high enough to enable the
Bangladesh jute industry to make adequate profits. 1/
3.12      Quantities.  Even assuming competitive prices for jute goods with
polypropylene fabrics, the world market for jute goods is expected to increase
only by about 2% annually over the next five years because of competition from
synthetics and technological changes in handling prepackaged foods. The demand
for hessian is expected to increase by about 2% annually, and the demand for
sacking is projected to stay at about the 1980 level. The decreasing demand
for jute primary carpetbacking is expected to be overcompensated by increasing
demand for secondary carpetbacking, resulting in a projected overall annual
increase of 2%. Consumption of jute goods in developed countries is projected
to decline marginally, which would be counterbalanced by an increase in the
consumption of jute goods in developing countries.
Bangladesh's Future Export Market
3.13      BJMC's Export and Production Plan.  BJMC projects jute goods prices
to drop sharply in FY81 (para 3.11), but to remain at the FY81 level until FY84.

payments.

At the same time BJMC expects to increase its export volume by 3% p.a., thus
increasing its market share from 46% in FY79 (453,000 tons) to 51% in FY84
(566,000 tons). This is reasonable given the high quality of Bangladesh's
jute, its relatively cheap labor, and the improved quality of its jute goods.
India is expe-ted to continue to sell more jute goods on its internal market,
thus limiting exports. European producers are projected to decrease their
production in view of rising labor costs.

3.14      Exports of 566,000 tons in FY84 imply total production of 615,000
tons to allow for domestic sales. This is the maximum production BJMC is
expected to achieve in FY84, assuming increased production efficiencies partly
from rehabilitation, but also continued power shortages and labor strikes. 1/
BJMC's export and production plan appears basically sound in view of historic
trends and the present situation. Below is an attempt to assess whether the
proposed strategy is close to the optimum.
3.15      Optimal Export/Production Levels.  Bangladesh's optimal level of
production is mainly a function of (i) the raw jute prices, (ii) the conver-
sion costs, (iii) the sales prices for jute goods, and (iv) the rate of change
of these parameters at varying levels of exports (elasticities). In FY79,
most mills made financial losses. The level of production maintained in FY79
minimized short-term financial losses, since virtually all mills covered their
short-term variable costs. However, from an economic point of view, all mills
made profits in FY79 2/. Economic costs of production--which excludes interest,
depreciation and half of the wages (shadow wage rates of 0.5)--are substan-
tially lower than the financial costs of production. Moreover, by assuming a
shadow exchange rate of 1.25 (Tk 19.4=US$1), economic revenues are 25% higher
than financial revenues, though economic raw jute costs are slightly higher
than financial costs. By applying the price elasticities -1.2 for hessian,
1/   In FY84, production capacity would be 736,000 tons.  Assuming 84% capa-
city utilization (similar to that achieved in FY79), BJMC's total
production would be 615,000 tons.
2/   Economic profit per ton in the weakest mill for each product was Tk 2,098
for hessian (Meghna), Tk 971 for sacking (Anowara), and Tk 2,094 for
carpetbacking (Ashraf). This economic profit is about 15% of sales
prices, compared to about 50% financial loss on sales prices of these
mills.



- 14 -
-1.1 for sacking, and -1.6 for carpetbacking suggested by ECL consultants
(para 6.04), BJMC's economically optimal exports in FY79 would have been
520,000 tons (Annex 2) and optimal production 560,000 tons. At that level
the average economic cost of production of the marginal (highest cost) mill
would be equal to the marginal economic revenue in hessian, sacking, and
carpetbacking based on FY79 costs and prices. In comparison, BJMC's actual
exports were only 453,000 tons and actual production only 501,000 tons.
3.16      From FY80 through FY84, the economic and financial parameters are
expected to be more favorable than those of FY79. The optimal export level
is estimated at 646,000 tons in FY80 and 730,000 tons in FY84 (Annex 2), which
is substantially higher than the export targets. During this time, even the
highest cost mills are expected to be economically viable in all three product
lines. If prices drop substantially more than projected and/or costs rise
faster than projected, the highest cost mills may become uneconomic and the
question of closure of mills would be considered.
3.17      Optimal Product Mix.  BJMC has little flexibility in determining
its product mix. First, the structure of the existing machinery limits the
product mix. Carpetbacking looms can basically only produce carpetbacking,
although Indian manufacturers have succeeded at times to produce hessian cloth
on carpetbacking looms, though under additional costs. Conversion of sacking
looms into hessian looms is feasible, although certain losses in efficiency
result. Such conversion has to be linked to conversion of heavy yarn spinning
frames into light yarn (required for hessian) spinning frames, which is feas-
ible but costly. Second, a certain minimum production of sacking (estimated
at 25% to 40% of total production) is necessary for utilization of jute wast-
age and low quality jute. Third, the existing market limits flexibility in
product mix. Continuity of supply is essential for maintaining the market.
For example, should BJMC stop producing carpetbacking cloth if prices were to
drop temporarily below economic costs of production, BJMC is likely to lose
that market permanently. In conclusion, BJMC has only little room for deter-
mining its product mix strategy. However, BJMC is adapting its product mix
periodically within existing flexibility to maximize financial and economic
profits. While in the past five years sacking made the least financial losses
and carpetbacking had the best growth chances, BJMC projects hessian to bring
highest profits in FY84 (Tk 1421/ton) and to have the best growth potential
(8% p.a.) based on strong demand in early FY80. BJMC would also attempt to
increase its exports of carpetbacking from 75,000 tons in FY79 to 99,000 tons
in FY84, about 6% per annum, since expected profits for carpetbacking are
Tk 730/ton in FY84. BJMC would maintain its production of sacking with a
projected loss of Tk 355/ton in FY84. BJMC more than covers its variable
costs on sacking, which justifies continued production. Should the slump in
demand for sacking during FY80 turn out to be only temporary, BJMC would make
profits also in this line in the future. In any case, the projected exports
are below the projected optimum level in each product line (Annex 2). BJMC
would continue to review its strategy and seek for measures to make all
product lines profitable. The proposed product mix appears reasonable under
the circumstances and involves only minor adjustment costs for the structure
of the machinery, by converting some sacking looms to hessian.

3.18      The optimal product mix and the optimal export/production level
are very sensitive to changes in raw jute prices, conversion costs and sales
prices, which fluctuate widely. GOB and BJMC have a certain influence on
these parameters, given that (i) BJMC consumes about one-half of the raw jute
crop of Bangladesh; (ii) Bangladesh's export of raw jute constitutes about 80%
of world exports; and (iii) BJMC holds about half of the world export market
of jute goods. Therefore, a half-yearly review and the elaboration of a strat-
egy for optimal product mix, export levels, and pricing of raw jute and jute
goods is essential.
3.19      At present, the Ministry of Jute and BJMC are closely monitoring
historic prices and exports of raw jute and jute goods. A price advisory
committee decides on policy measures concerning raw jute such as the Statutory
Minimum Price, the level of export tax, and the Minimum Export Price. A dif-
ferent price advisory committee that meets quarterly determines the jute goods
export prices and desired production levels. However, these decisions are
mainly based on past developments and not on an in-depth analysis of likely
future developments resulting from alternative policy measures. Therefore, GOB
has agreed to create by December 1980 in the Ministry of Jute (Chart 1) a
special cell that would attempt to develop, and update half-yearly, a medium-
term optimal price and export plan for raw jute and jute goods, taking into
account the interdependence of quantities of raw jute and jute goods exports
from Bangladesh, their relative price elasticities, the level of the raw jute
export tax, etc. The staffing and functions of such a cell have been discussed
and agreed with GOB.
3.20      Research and Development.  To expand the limited world market for
jute goods, Bangladesh should continue to develop new fields of application
for jute goods and make further efforts in research and development. Some
promising developments have occurred in the cultivation and processing of jute.
Advances--as supported under the jute project (Appraisal Report No. 1587-BD of
December 29, 1977)--have been made towards high yielding varieties and towards
better retting procedures. Moreover, UNDP finances an advisor to the Jute
Research Institute in Bangladesh. BJMC is investigating the feasibility of
jute plastics production in a pilot plant. An application of jute for clothing
by merging it with cotton (jutton) is presently being studied under an IDA-
financed technical assistance project. BJMC has invested in two new mills
that are to produce jute carpets, a relatively new product. Two additional
units are considered to be set up in the private sector. Strengthening of



- 16 -
marketing and promotion efforts is also underway with technical assistance
from ODA/UK. BJMC has taken steps to increase the number of overseas sales
offices and the staff.
IV. RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIES AND PRICES
4.01      BJMC's major raw material is jute, which represents 50%-65% of the
total production cost. In FY80, the 525,000 tons of jute goods projected to
be produced by BJMC will require about 3 million bales of raw jute 1/ which
is about half of Bangladesh's annual jute crop (5 million to 7 million bales,
depending on weather conditions and the acreage sown). Virtually all the
other raw jute is exported. Over the past six years the raw jute exports
ranged from 1.7 million bales (FY78) to 2.3 million bales (FY76), and stock-
keeping in Bangladesh ranged from .2 million bales (FY78) to 2 million bales
(FY76).

4.02      FY80 projections, based on sowing reports, indicate a jute growing
area of 1.8 million acres (including 300,000 acres affected by drought) with
a projected crop of about 5.5 million bales which would be 20% less than last
year's crop. In spite of the low production, the raw jute price remained
sluggish in the first half of FY80, mainly on account of a large carryover
1/   Three million bales are 536,000 tons.  Thus eleven thousand (11,000)
tons would be wastage.



- 17 -
of 2.0 million bales in July 1979, of which BJMC held 0.8 million bales, and
the public and private traders the rest. As a result of the drought and insuf-
ficient retting water, a large part of the crop was low quality jute which sent
the price to Tk 40/maund in October 1979, less than half the statutory minimum
price of Tk 1'5/maund. However, the price for high quality jute (Tossa) re-
mained high at about Tk 190/maund, so that BJMC's average stockholding price
was Tk 133/maund. Given an anticipated carryover of 1.7 million bales, average
raw jute prices are projected for FY81 to remain at about the FY80 level (para
9.11).
4.03      In the past, the mills had three major problems--which have since
been eliminated--in raw jute procurement. First, in FY77 the mills were unable
to buy sufficient quantities of raw jute directly from the jute growing areas
due to shortage of working capital. Upon GOB instructions, the commercial
banks now provide timely credit to mills so that they can build up their stocks
in December to a level equal to six month's production, which is adequate.
Second, prior to 1977, the mills' raw jute purchases were completely decentral-
ized. Some mills would compete with each other (in addition to competition
with private traders), and in some cases, the mills were not able to buy suffi-
cient raw jute. Therefore, in 1977, BJMC appointed a director of raw jute
purchase, who created 200 purchasing agencies in jute growing areas. BJMC now
centrally monitors the jute purchases by the mills, who are now able to compete
effectively with private traders. Third, during FY78, GOB interfered in the
purchasing policy of the mills and asked them to adhere to a maximum purchas-
ing price, which private traders ignored. As a result, the mills could not
buy sufficient amounts of raw jute, but had to buy more later from private
traders at substantially higher prices.
4.04      In an attempt to develop an acceptable pricing structure for raw
jute and to arrive at a realistic allocation of raw jute between the mills
and exports, Economic Consultants Limited (ECL) did a study on raw jute mar-
keting and pricing mechanisms for GOB.  ECL's recommendations, submitted to
GOB in February 1979, included proposals for reorganization of raw jute market-
ing and the development of an export strategy and optimal pricing structure.
Many of the proposals have been discussed and agreed upon with GOB and the
proposed cell within the Ministry of Jute (para 3.19) would monitor imple-
mentation and further improve policy measures towards raw jute pricing,
production and exports.

V. ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES
Background
5.01      The Project would focus on the rehabilitation of jute mills and
on institutional upgrading of the organization and procedures of the jute
industry. At present there are 66 jute mills, 2 manufacturing units (acces-
sories and spares for jute machinery), a jute plastics plant, and 2 additional
jute carpet mills (to come on stream in 1980), all of which are fully owned
by GOB and supervised by the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) which
was established in 1972 (para 2.12). BJMC is a Government corporation under
the authority of the Ministry of Jute. Six specialized jute mills have been
disinvested in the past, but there are no proposals currently under discussion
for further disinvestment of jute mills.
Management
5.02      A Board of Directors, appointed by GOB, manages BJMC.  The Chairman
of the Board is the chief executive of BJMC. The other Board members are the
6 operational directors of BJMC. The present chairman was appointed in early
1979 and is expected to remain in his post for at least 3 years. GOB's new
policy to view the chairman's position as a medium term appointment allows
the chairman to play a more effective management role. Up to 1976 BJMC's
chairmen remained on average less than 1 year. With the exception of the
finance director, who was appointed in September 1979, and of the marketing
director who was appointed in early 1980, BJMC's directors have been in their
positions either since the establishment of BJMC or since creation of their
respective departments within BJMC, so that there is sufficient continuity
in BJMC's management.
5.03      The competence and qualifications of BJMC's management are adequate.
Its effectiveness will be further improved in the wider context of the project.
The proposed reorganization (para 5.05) would relieve BJMC's management from
too much detail and would enable it to concentrate on the broader issues.
Moreover, a management information system (para 5.26) for effective data col-
lection, processing, and a systematic review of mill performance is being
implemented.
Organization
5.04      Chart 2 shows the present organizational structure of BJMC, which
has six departments at headquarters that provide the central administration
to all mills. Each department is headed by one director. Also, BJMC has
four zonal offices--two in Dacca, one in Khulna, and one in Chittagong, each
headed by a general manager. Each zonal office has on average 17 mills,
which is too many for effective supervision. Zonal offices have only an
advisory function: their main activity is data collection and serving as a
contact point between the mills and the head office. Each mill has a board
of directors, which supervises its activities. However, the mill boards
supervise mills inadequately, since they have met on average only every three
months. Each mill board has one of BJMC's directors as a member. Given that



- 19 -
there are 6 BJMC directors for 66 mill boards, it was not practical for them
to meet more often. The membership of BJMC's directors on the mill boards
has added to their already heavy workload.
5.05      To eliminate these shortcomings ECL/PA consultants made a proposal
in the framework of their jute sector study (para 6.04) for BJMC's and the
mills reorganization. In June 1979, a GOB Study Group somewhat modified the
proposal, which now consists mainly in (i) increasing the number of zonal
offices from 4 to 9 thus reducing the average number of mills in each zone
to 8; (ii) giving to zonal general managers full responsibility for the per-
formance and supervision of the mills and direct line authority over mill
managers; (iii) streamlining the organization of BJMC's head office. The
regrouping of jute mills is shown in the Map and the proposed organization of
BJMC's head office in Chart 3.
5.06      The new zonal general managers will visit, inspect and review each
mill at least once every two weeks. In order to minimize travelling time, the
zonal headquarters are located as close to the geographical center of each
zone as possible. Each zone will have six experienced deputy general managers
responsible for all operational aspects except for exports which are centrally
controlled by the marketing division of BJMC. They are to assist the zonal
general manager but will not have authority over mill management. The pro-
posed basic line responsibility of the zonal general manager would be to the
chairman of BJMC, but BJMC's directors will continue to exercise supervisory
control within their functional responsibilities.
5.07      The mill boards will be replaced  by an Executive Committee which
will be chaired by the zonal general manager and will include the mill manager
(who also acts as secretary of the committee), the zonal chief of the accounts
department, the mill production manager, and the mill technical manager. Con-
ceptually, the mill manager is to be the chief executive of the mill with all
the necessary powers and authority.
5.08      Within the BJMC Head office, the directorate of research and qual-
ity control and the directorate of production planning will be merged into a
directorate of planning and research, and a directorate of production and
quality control. BJMC's chairman will be relieved from supervising the now
unwieldy chairman's department, whose functions will be divided between a new
directorate of administration and the secretary of BJMC. Internal audit will
be allocated to the director of finance. Vigilance and the inspection team
will remain directly under the chairman.
5.09      The proposed reorganization Df BJMC and the mills is sound.  It
would delegate authority to zonal general managers, thus relieving BJMC
directors from day-to-day mill affairs and ensuring proper supervision of
mills. The proposal has been approved by BJMC's Board and is likely to be
approved by a GOB interministerial committee in mid-1980. While the proposal
clearly spells out the major features of the reorganization, the detailed
implementation, including staff transfer from headquarters to zonal offices,
and a review of functions, procedures, and staffing of headquarter offices,
needs to be prepared. BJMC agreed to employ a management consultant for



- 20 -
preparing the detailed implementation of the reorganization by September 30,
1980 and to have the new organization in place by September 30, 1981. Terms
of reference are attached in Annex 3.
Staff
5.10      At the end of FY 1979, BJMC's staff was 1,067 of which 864 were
working at the headoffice, 96 in the branch offices in Chittagong and Khulna,
and 107 in the 4 zonal offices (Dacca I, Dacca II, Chittagong, Khulna).

The jute mills employ 23,260 staff of which 4,490 are officers.
5.11      BJMC is on the whole properly staffed.  However, there are weak-
nesses in the cost and budget section in the finance department (paras 5.23
and 5.24). The major problem is staff quality rather than quantity. Compared
with the private sector and employment opportunities abroad, particularly in
the Middle East, BJMC's salaries (set by GOB) are low and make it difficult
to attract and retain qualified personnel (particularly engineers and accoun-
tants), although a recent 30% increase of the salary scales for all public
sector employees improved BJMC's competitiveness as an employer. The pro-
posed reorganization would not require additional staff, since functions and
staff from headquarters would be delegated to the increased number of zonal
offices.

Workers
5.12      BJMC's jute mills employ approximately 205,000 workers of which
143,000 regular workers, 61,000 badlis 1/ and 1,000 temporaries. The workers
are rated in four skill categories, which determine the basic wage.
Table 5-2: SKILL AND WAGE CATEGORIES OF JUTE MILL WORKERS
Basic Wage
Skill Category        Number of Workers    Taka/Month
Highly skilled              3,000                370
Skilled                    86,000                335

Unskilled                  22,000                270
143,000
62% of the workers are either skilled or highly skilled, 22% semi-skilled and
16% unskilled. The total wage differential due to skill is 37% and the steepest
increase between individual categories is 18% from the semi-skilled to the
skilled workers. In addition to basic wages, workers receive fringe benefits,
such as housing, medical and conveyance allowances, festival bonus (one
additional monthly salary), 14 days sick leave, 10 days casual leave, and one
day annual leave for each 18 working days. In total, monetary fringe benefits
amount to about 50% of basic wages. Also,the mills provide low cost housing,
often on the mill site, for about 10% of the workers. The number of workers
employed decreased from 153,000 in 1972 to 132,000 in 1975, remained constant
until 1977 and increased to 135,000 in 1978 and 143,000 in 1979. The recent
increases became necessary because (i) increasingly frequent power failures
require additional personnel to make up for production losses (40,000 tons in
FY79; 15,000 tons from July-October 1979) in extra shifts; and (ii) higher
production targets and lighter fabrics require the activation of additional
weaving looms (about 2,100 from 1977-79).
5.13      Several active and influential unions represent the jute mill
workers in their dealings with management. Labor unrest is common, but gene-
rally focusses on issues related to individual mills. BJMC estimates that
production losses due to labor unrest in FY79 were of the order of 20,000 tons.
Wages in the public sector, which are reviewed by a wage commission, were
raised in November 1978 and May 1979 by a total of 44% based on the pay level
of 1974 and payable retroactive from July 1, 1977. The increase represents
an average annual increase of 8.8% during the five years from 1974-79 com-
pared to an annual inflation of about 7% for the same period.
5.14      Absenteeism of workers, which reaches up to 30% during the harvest
season, is a minor problem. It is basically dealt with by the system of
1/   Badlis are stand-by workers, appearing every morning at the mill site
and ready to fill temporary vacancies due to leave, sickness, and
absenteeism. Their level of skill and experience is comparable to
that of the regular workers.



- 22 -
having temporary workers (badlis) fill the vacancies (para 5.12 footnote).
Moreover, BJMC intends to increase its social facilities, i.e., mill-site
housing, schools and medical facilities, in order to settle more workers and
their families in the immediate neighborhood of their work-place. Progress
will be slow because absenteeism is a structural problem of Bangladesh's
economy, given that more than 50% of the workers continue to have a stake in
agriculture and leave mills during the agricultural peak seasons.
Incentive Systems
5.15      In FY78, BJMC designed three incentive systems to reduce absenteeism
and increase productivity: an attendance bonus scheme, and two other schemes
designed to improve production. These schemes were not particularly effective
and they are being reviewed at present, to bring about appropriate changes.
5.16      BJMC has a piece wage rate, for its weavers and finishers, who
account for about 60% of all workers in the mill. A substantial wage increase
in FY79 (para 5.13) has increased the productivity and lowered absenteeism.
However, workers in the spinning and preparing departments, who are key workers
in the production line, are paid a flat daily rate. As a result, there is no
incentive for them to increase production or to improve their attendance
record, particularly since the average wage of a spinner is lower than that
of a weaver. As part of the proposed project, BJMC would install scales for
weighing spinning production (para 6.09). This would enable implementation of
an incentive scheme for spinners to reward individual productive efforts (and
calculation of accurate spinning efficiencies, which at present are not avail-
able in any mill). An incentive scheme for back processing personnel would
be linked to spinning production by paying them the average spinning bonus
earned in their appropriate section, i.e., light yarn spinning or heavy yarn
spinning. BJMC agreed to employ a consultant by September 30, 1980 to review
and prepare a production incentive scheme particularly for workers in the
spinning and back processing departments. After review of the consultants'
report GOB/BJMC would adopt such scheme by January 1, 1982.
Training
5.17      Past Training.  In 1973 BJMC started several training programs
which included training of in-mill supervisors, managers and BJMC staff in
Bangladesh and abroad. Up to 1977, BJMC trained only 1,159 employees. However,
in connection with the Action Program under the Sixth Imports Program Credit,
BJMC englarged and diversified its training programs and trained 2,846 employ-
ees from 1977 to August 1979. These training programs were well received by
BJMC's staff and were successful to upgrade their skills. However, they were
still rather limited in scope, particularly concerning workers and their
supervisors.
5.18      Proposed Training Centers.  In 1979, BJMC again reviewed its train-
ing needs in the light of a proposal made by ECL/PA consultants in the frame-
work of the jute sector study (para 6.08) and proposed to set up nine training
centers, one in each of the proposed nine zones for on-the-job training of



- 23 -
supervisors, process workers and mechanical personnel. Three of the training
centers would also concentrate on training management personnel, thus supple-
menting existing training of BJMC personnel at management institutes in Dacca
and abroad. The centers would be set up in existing facilities like schools,
clubs, etc., which would require a minimum of additional construction. Only
two training centers would be located in completely new facilities. The pro-
posed location would permit easy daily travel for attendants from surrounding
mills, except in one zone where dormitory facilities will be constructed.
The training centers would be equipped with surplus machines from the mills.
5.19      At headquarters, BJMC would set up a separate training division to
concentrate on design and administration of courses. It would be manned by
a general manager, manager, training officer, and six subsidiary employees.
Training departments at the zonal offices, staffed by a manager, training
officer, and three office personnel, would be in charge of executing and
administering the actual training in the training centers. Trainers would
be selected mainly from experienced mill officers and supervisors. At the
mill level, a senior member of the mill's management would implement and
administer the training program for the mill in addition to his normal duties,
and he would receive extra payment for it.
Internal Audit
5.20      After years of understaffing, BJMC's audit is adequately staffed.
Sixteen audit teams (for 72 units) execute two rounds of account audit and one
round of inventory audit per year and mill. The audit division also audits
the head office account. With increased staff the internal audit division
was able to almost catch up with current financial statements of mills. As
of the end of 1979, the internal audit of FY78 is practically complete and
for FY79 all inventories and about half the accounts have been audited and
completion is expected in June 1980. Under the proposed reorganization (para
5.08), the audit division will be transferred from the chairman's department
to the finance directorate. This is acceptable, because most of the audit
work is related to individual mills, so that there is no conflict of interest
within the directorate of finance.
External Audit
5.21      External auditing of the jute mills and the head office, although
improved, continues to be behind schedule, mainly because of a general short-
age of external (private) auditors. The audits of FY76 and FY77 are now
virtually complete. For FY78, 48 final reports (out of 72) have been issued.
BJMC agreed to gradually reduce the backlog of audits according to an agreed
schedule, so that its own accounts and those of each individual mill are
audited within six months of the end of each fiscal year starting with FY81.
Cost Accounting
5.22      While the present system shows the total cost of each product
(i.e. hessian, sacking, and carpetbacking), it does not provide for actual
and standard costs of the products at various stages of processing. Thus



- 24 -
it is not an adequate tool for cost control. The action program of the Fifth
Imports Program Credit initiated the development of a Process Accounting System
(PAS), which was designed by EWP consultants of Dacca under an ODA grant. The
PAS has created four production cost centers (back processing and spinning,
winding, weaving, and finishing), and a number of auxiliary cost centers,
(power house, mill workshop, etc.), for the overhead. With PAS, the actual
cost for each product (fabric costing) is compared with the standard, and
variations need to be explained by the head of the cost center. BJMC is cur-
rently testing PAS in two mills (Bangladesh Jute Mills and Jessore Jute Mills)
to allow, if necessary, for appropriate modification. Reception of PAS at the
mill floor level has been cool. This is not surprising, since PAS introduces
tighter control than the existing system. Although PAS may require slightly
more staff, the improved cost control is expected to justify the additional
expenditures. BJMC agreed to implement PAS in all mills starting July 1, 1981
(the beginning of the fiscal year).
Consolidation of Accounts and Financial Planning
5.23      Consolidation of the mills' accounts and BJMC's financial planning
could be improved substantially. Presently, BJMC's accounts and the consol-
idated mills' accounts for the past 4 years are provisional. Wage increases
retroactive to 1976, disinvestment of units often involving legal claims, and
the final allocation of GOB subsidies to the mills make the accounting unusually
difficult. However, in spite of these difficulties, BJMC should be able to
provide consistent, comprehensive consolidated financial statements three
months after closing of books.
5.24      Also, BJMC's budgetary process needs to be improved.  Individual
mills prepare annual budgets along guidelines established by BJMC, which even-
tually has to approve the budget. The budget has three elements, i.e., the
cash budget, the revenue budget, and the capital expenditure budget. BJMC's
head office consolidates the budgets in part to determine the total foreign
exchange requirement for capital expenditures, (development budget), and
spares as well as materials procured abroad, (non development budget). Often
the approved budgets underestimate costs and overestimate revenues with no
adjustments during the year, in most cases. Further, mills compare actual
monthly performance with the budget by dividing the latter by 12, which makes
the control process meaningless, since it does not take account of seasonal
variations. Moreover, BJMC and the mills do virtually no medium term finan-
cial planning. To improve the consolidation of BJMC's and the mills' accounts,
and BJMC's financial planning, BJMC agreed to employ a professional account-
ants firm for a two year period by December 31, 1980. Terms of Reference
are in Annex 4.
Management Information
5.25      The present management information system does not provide an ade-
quate basis for management control. At headquarters, data collected is often
insufficiently focussed on relevant aspects and data are not processed ade-
quately, partly because data is incongruent and overly voluminous. At the



- 25 -
mill level, not all the information generated periodically is presented to
the mill managers in time and in an orderly fashion to allow identification
of problems and corrective action. Moreover, the requests for increased data
from headquarters puts an increasing burden on the mills.
5.26      Under the action program for the Sixth Imports Program Credit,
EWP consultants developed a Management Information System (MIS). It reduces
and standardizes the information flow from the mills to BJMC. The number of
proformas has been reduced from about 200 to about 60. The MIS has been
tested in 4 mills, where it has been well received. BJMC has formally decided
to implement the MIS.
5.27      At present, MIS does not provide for (i) aggregation and analysis
of the mills' production information, (ii) consolidation of the production
information with raw materials purchase, and sales information, and (iii)
standardization of information flow within BJMC, including monthly report-
ing to the Board.  The MIS should be extended to cover these areas, (initial
steps in this direction have already been taken, para 5.28), and EWP consul-
tants could carry out this work.  BJMC agreed to hire a consultant by
September 30, 1980 to extend the proposed MIS to also cover information flows
at headquarters. Financing for the management study (para 5.09), the produc-
tion incentive consultant (para 5.16), the professional accountants firm
(para 5.24), and the MIS consultant is provided under the proposed credit.
5.28      BJMC has started a system of monthly operational reviews, which are
discussed by the Board of Directors. They monitor mill performance concerning
production, loom output per hour, wastage, production costs, (including jute
cost), export sales rates, and profitability. Annexes to the reviews include
consolidated cumulative income statements from the beginning of the financial
year up to the reporting month and the cumulative profit or loss of each mill.
Each monitoring category lists the worst and the best performer. Also, target
figures are compared with actual performance, although only on a consolidated
basis. After evaluation, the Board decides on follow-up actions with respect
to the worst mills. The monthly operational reviews are an excellent start
for effective monitoring of mill performance and for taking corrective steps.
Once the new zonal offices are operable, with their general managers in place,
the zones would execute such reviews.
VI. THE PROJECT
Project Origin and Evolution
6.01      One major objective of the action programs under the Fourth to
Seventh Imports Programs Credits (para 2.16 and Annex 1) and of the Project
is to increase the production efficiency of the industry, which is estimated
to have considerable potential for improvement. Some principal causes of low
production efficiency are: (i) the poor state of equipment, (ii) unbalanced
capacity; (iii) shortages of skilled labor and management--which is closely
related to the first problem; and (iv) large scale absenteeism, power short-
ages, and labor unrest. While production efficiencies have improved (e.g.,



- 26 -
weaving from 43% in FY76 to 53.6% in FY79 1/), further improvements are pos-
sible and necessary.
6.02      The poor state of equipment, which was observed during a survey
initiated by IDA in 1975, prompted BJMC to organize maintenance task forces
(MTF) to improve maintenance and spare parts utilization. As a result, stan-
dards of routine maintenance throughout the industry have improved over the
past three years. Also, availability of foreign spare parts--financed from
the Import Program Credits--and of local spare parts has improved considerably.
However, large scale and intensive rehabilitation, particularly of mill side
machinery, 2/ is important to improve production efficiency further.
6.03      The major bottleneck for increased production and for more efficient
use of the existing weaving equipment is that the spinning departments of the
mills have not been able to produce yarn in sufficient volume and quality to
permit looms to operate efficiently. One reason is that there was a continu-
ing shift to lighter fabrics for market reasons. While this shift slowed down
in FY79, the imbalances created during the previous years are still a serious
problem. Lighter yarns require more spinning time than heavy yarns; as a
result, the relationship between spinning equipment and weaving equipment has
changed, requiring more spinning equipment to keep a fixed number of looms
operating. Another reason is that two of the three makes of spinning frames
installed in Bangladesh are relatively inefficient and need modification in
order to increase their output (these frames are no longer marketed).
6.04      Economic Consultants Limited (ECL)--as part of the Sixth Imports
Program Credit action program and paid by ODA/UK--executed a mill-by-mill
survey (Jute Sector Study) to assess balancing, modernization and replacement
(BMR) requirements of the jute industry. They submitted their report in
December 1978. A GOB interministerial study group reviewed the report and
submitted papers with a modified proposal in June 1979. The proposals,
embodied in the Project, aim at minimizing investment in view of the marginal
financial viability of the industry, the high cost of new machines, and low
labor cost in Bangladesh. The Project concept is based on the following
principles:
(a) balancing of machinery on an industry wide basis (instead of
by individual mills); intermill transfer of machine surpluses
in some mills would, to a certain degree, offset deficiencies
in others, thus saving considerable investment;
(b) three-shift working of the spinning and backprocessing depart-
ments would increase spinning capacities sufficiently to avoid
purchase of new machines and allow utilization of the most
1/   Spinning efficiencies have also improved, but figures are not available
since spinning production is not weighed at present. BJMC has agreed
to install an adequate number of scales to enable weighment.
2/   Winding, spinning and back processing machines as opposed to looms.



- 27 -
efficient machines (Mackies), thus avoiding major rehabilitation
of the most inefficient machines (FLCB and FLTM); at the same
time, major intermill transfer of machinery would be avoided;
(c)  utilization of domestic spares for rehabilitation to the extent
possible, given the high cost of foreign spares.
6.05      Thus the Project aims at making best use of existing equipment in
Bangladesh, thus reducing to a minimum investment requirements. The intermill
transfer of machinery should not pose any problems, since BJMC has transferred
somue machines in the past.  Also, three-shift operation of the spinning and
backprocessing departments would not pose any problems. At present, BJMC
operates satisfactorily three shifts of spinning and back processing in all
CBC mills and in 12 narrow loom mills, and should meet no major difficulties
in doing so in the remaining 40 mills. Moreover, local production of spares
has improved in the past years, and BJMC can save valuable foreign exchange
and provide domestic employment by purchasing domestic spares to the extent
feasible.
Project Objectives
6.06      The objectives of the project are to (i) increase the technical pro-
duction efficiency through rehabilitation and maintenance, and balancing of
existing production facilities; (ii) continue to improve the organization,
management, and finances of the jute industry through reorganization, incen-
tive systems, and training programs.
Project Description
6.07      The proposed credit would be for two purposes:  (A) financing of a
rehabilitation project consisting of (i) rehabilitation of light yarn (i.e.,
hessian warp, hessian weft, and sacking warp), winding, spinning and back
processing machinery, coupled with the introduction of a third shift (from
existing two-shift operation) in these departments of 40 narrow loom mills;
(ii) intermill transfer of 41 machines from mills with surplus machines to
those with deficiencies; (iii) provision for precision dial-type scales for
weighing spinning production in each mill; (iv) establishment of training
centers; (v) reorganization of the industry; and (vi) introduction of a man-
agement information system and a new accounting system; and (B) financing
spares for regular and preventive maintenance of all machinery.
VII. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Project Cost for Rehabilitation
7.01      The cost estimate for rehabilitation is based on a detailed mill-
by-mill survey executed from 1976-79 by the Maintenance Task Force (MTF) by
stripping down machinery in each mill and assessing which parts need replace-
ment. The MTF recorded for each mill: (a) the type of machines installed



- 28 -
listed by maker, type, and age; (b) the number of machines of that type in
each group ; (c) an itemized list of spares for that machine type; (d) the
source of supply--local or foreign; (e) the numbers required of each spare
item; and (f) the cost in taka or dollars according to source. A mill may
have up to 25 different machine groups, each requiring approximately 200
separate spare items ranging from tens to thousands of units. The cost of
required spares, which the MTF assessed at 1977 prices, was increased by 31.5%
to cover price increases from 1977 to 1981, when last delivery is expected.
This is in line with past and expected inflation for this period of time at
an average of 7%. The import component of the required spares for rehabili-
tation is estimated at 62%, with the other 38% produced domestically. The
c.i.f. cost for the weighing scales is estimated at 1980 prices since procure-
ment is expected in 1980. The cost for training centers is based on detailed
cost estimates on civil works. Completely new facilities will be constructed
in two zones, and a dormitory facility for trainees will be built in one zone.
The other zones would use existing facilities like schools and clubs with a
minimum of additional construction.
7.02      The total rehabilitation cost is estimated at Tk 262.9 million
(US$16.98 million):

Annex 5 shows that the estimated rehabilitation cost for individual mills range
from Tk 24 million (US$ 15,600) for Eastern Jute Mill to 43.5 million (US$2.8
million) for Adamjee Jute Mills (which consists of five individual mills).
The cost of the proposed rehabilitation is relatively small, representing only
about 4% of the mills' total assets of Tk 5.9 billion. BJMC presently is not
considering any other major investment programs, except normal improvements of
civil works at the mills and two new jute carpet mills totalling about Tk 300
million (US$19.4 million). The proposed relatively small investment program
is reasonable given that the industry has limited growth potential. The total
rehabilitation cost minus taxes and duties is estimated at Tk 217.1 million,
or US$13.98 million. The proposed credit for rehabilitation would amount to
US$10.4 million, or 75% of total project cost excluding taxes.



- 29 -
Financing of Maintenance
7.03      The maintenance requirements for spare parts for the jute mills has
been about Tk 300 million (US$20 million) annually over the past two years.
About 40% of the total supply has been met from imports; and the balance of
60% from local sources.
7.04      BJMC estimates the spare parts requirements for the next five
years at Tk 350 million annually. BJMC projects that the percentage of
locally produced spares will gradually increase from 63% in FY81 to 77% in
FY85 (Table 7-2) as a result of increased and improved domestic production
of spare parts.

The average imports of spares would amount to Tk 110 million per annum (US$7
million). Over a three-year period, total imports would be around US$21 mil-
lion. The proposed credit would include US$9.6 million to finance about half
of the imported spares and equipment for regular and preventive maintenance
over the next three years. The other half is likely to be financed from
bilateral sources, as in the past. This would allow continued IDA financing
for part of the imported maintenance spares, which had been financed by pre-
vious imports program credits but had been excluded from the Eight Imports
Program Credit in anticipation of the inclusion of these funds in this pro-
posed credit.
Financing Arrangements
7.05      IDA would make the proposed credit of US$20 million to the Gov-
ernment of Bangladesh. However, the onlending arrangements for rehabilita-
tion would be different from those for maintenance. For rehabilitation,
GOB would make loans to individual mills (for spares and scales) and to
BJMC (for training and consultants) totalling up to US$10.4 million at 12%
interest per annum for ten years including a three year grace period. 1/
1/   The expected life of rehabilitation is 7 years, and the maximum
implementation time 3 years.



- 30 -
Individual mills would finance the other US$6.6 million equivalent of the
project cost, including duties and taxes from cash which jute mills are expec-
ted to generate partly as a result of lower interest burdens due to the agreed
capital restructuring (paras 9.14 to 9.16). For maintenance, GOB would provide
the foreign exchange up to US$9.6.million which individual mills would buy from
GOB through the Bangladesh Bank with cash from their working capital. The same
procedure is used under the Sixth and Seventh Imports Program Credits.
VIII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Management
8.01      BJMC's technical directorate will exercise overall control and
supervise coordination of the project through zonal offices. Mill managers
will be responsible for implementation of rehabilitation and maintenance in
their own mills. Maintenance has improved substantially over the past three
years and mills would be capable to execute the rehabilitation adequately.
As quickly as receipt of necessary spares allows, mill engineering squads
would rehabilitate groups of inter-linked machines in the back processing
chain to maximize benefits accruing from rehabilitation and to enable measure-
ment of these benefits. Zonal engineers will monitor progress and report back
to BJMC. They and the MTFs will ensure proper utilization of spares, keep
check on methods and techniques employed in rehabilitation work and assist
in solving problems should any arise. They will ensure that the numbers of
engineering squads employed on the project and their capabilities meet the
mills needs. At present, each mill employs for rehabilitation an engineering
squad the size of which varies according to mill size. Each mill has on
average 32 men working on rehabilitation. This number of engineers is over
and above the mill's normal engineering complement who are employed on day-
to-day regular and preventive maintenance programs. At present, the rehabil-
itation squads are executing some rehabilitation, which is limited due to the
lack of rehabilitation spares. Rehabilitation work will be extended to
desired levels on receipt of spares supplied under the proposed project. The
size of the work force would then be increased for full scale rehabilitation.
Qualified local personnel is available.
Procurement
8.02      Since 1977, spares procurement in BJMC was decentralized to indivi-
dual mills. The decentralized system proved beneficial in reducing time
delays and supply problems. However, mills still have the option to combine
their procurement in the most advantageous group to order parts common to
them all, thereby increasing the bulk and possibly getting a better price.
Spare parts for the project will be procured under the same system.
8.03      Procurement procedures of BJMC are basically satisfactory and in
line with Bank Group guidelines. Invitations to tender will be published in
the local press. This ensures sufficient coverage, since all foreign spare
parts manufacturers are locally represented. For the supply of foreign spares
for this project, basically only four foreign manufacturers produce spares for
the machines manufactured by them: James Mackie for winding, jute spinning



- 31 -
and preparing machinery; 1/ Douglas Fraser for winding, carding and certain
types of batching equipment; Sweitzer for their own type of cop winder; and
Leesona Holt for their own roll winding, pre-beaming, and dressing machine.
Some spares for these machines are produced locally, but others are proprietary
items. Accordingly, three types of procurement procedures would be followed
for equipment, spares and materials under the proposed project: (i) inter-
national competitive bidding would be used for contracts above $50,000 equiv-
alent for domestic and foreign spares while allowing standard IDA local sup-
pliers preference criteria; (ii) for proprietary items, contracts would be
allotted after negotiations or competitive bidding among licensed manufacturers;
and (iii) for contracts below $50,000 equivalent, the mills/BJMC may procure
through international shopping in accordance with agreed procedures. Civil
works contracts for the training component would be awarded on the basis of
local bidding. For contracts above $50,000 IDA would review the mill's pro-
curement decisions after contracts have been signed and prior to submission
of the first withdrawal application to IDA. Thus, disbursement of about 30%
of the credit amount would be subject to IDA's post award review.
Disbursements
8.04      For equipment and spares (other than for the training component),
IDA would disburse against 100% of the foreign cost or against 100% of local
cost ex-factory in cases where local engineering companies won contracts in
competition with foreign companies, on the basis of withdrawal applications
forwarded to IDA. For the training component, IDA would finance 100% of the
foreign cost and 90% of the local cost. For consultants' services, IDA would
finance 100% of costs. The proposed Credit is expected to be fully disbursed
within 36 months, i.e., by July 1983.
Implementation
8.05      Preparation of tenders, tendering, and delivery of spares are
expected to be completed within 10 months after Board approval of the credit.
However, some mills could start rehabilitation prior to delivery of rehabil-
itation spares, provided the mill manager and zonal engineer consider that
the existing spares stock is sufficient for rehabilitation without harming
day-to-day and preventive maintenance. Such spares taken from the maintenance
stock, but used for rehabilitation, would be replaced on receipt of rehabili-
tation spares.
8.06      The present arrangements for spares ordering, stocking and utiliza-
tion are satisfactory. Each mill has its own spares stock, which is normally
maintained at a level sufficient to enable regular and preventive maintenance.
Whenever the number of spares falls below a minimum, more spares are ordered.
The minimum is calculated on the basis of the speed of utilization, the supply
time, and the shipping cost per order. All spares entering and leaving the
stock are recorded, and at the end of the fiscal year books are reconciled
1/   A unit for the manufacture of spares under license of James Mackie was
set up in India in the early sixties to supply the Indian Jute Industry.
This unit could be another potential supplier.



- 32 -
with actual stocks. The spares for rehabilitation would be kept in the spares
stock of each mill, but accounted for separately.
8.07      The time needed to complete rehabilitation in all 66 mills will
depend on the extent of required rehabilitation in individual mills and timely
delivery of all rehabilitation spares. However, the majority of mills should
be completed by the end of the second year after commencement. Rehabilitation
of larger mills like Adamjee, Peoples, and Platinum, and those requiring
extensive rehabilitation, may continue into the third year.
8.08      Detailed plans for introduction of third shifts, intermill transfer
of machinery, implementation of the reorganization, the production incentive
scheme, and training have been discussed and agreed with BJMC.
Project Monitoring
8.09      BJMC would submit quarterly operational statistics similar to
monthly operational reviews (para 5.28) and half yearly progress reports on
(i) utilization of the funds for maintenance and rehabilitation broken down
by individual mills and (ii) implementation of the organisation, management
information system, process cost accounting, training centers and incentive
scheme, intermill transfer of machine units, and introduction of third shifts.
BJMC's internal and external audit would check proper utilization of the
spares to be purchased under the proposed loan.
IX. FINANCIAL SITUATION AND PROSPECTS
BJMC's Finances
9.01      BJMC and the jute mills are separate financial entities.  GOB owns
directly the share capital of the jute mills and that of BJMC. As supervisory
and coordinating agency, BJMC charges its administrative expenses to the mills
to recover its operating costs. The share that each mill has to pay depends
on its number of looms relative to the industry's total. BJMC's operating
costs, which include expenditures of headquarters and the zonal offices, have
been reasonable, but increasing from .52% of total sales in FY78 to .58% in
FY79, mainly due to increase in headquarter staff and a shortfall of antici-
pated exports:
Table 9-1: BJMC ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS
FY76    FY77    FY78    FY79
BJMC's Operating Costs (million taka)    14.6    15.3    21.1    26.0
% of Total Jute Mills' Sales                  .50     .52      .52     .58
9.02      BJMC's assets (Annex 6) normally consist only of its office equip-
ment at headquarters and zonal offices valued at Tk 20 million. However, in
the past BJMC also had the function of maintaining the liquidity of the jute



- 33 -
mills in view of their continued financial losses. Thus, BJMC was in charge
of allocating GOB cash subsidies and loans to individual jute mills and pro-
viding some cash for them through commercial bank debentures and overdrafts
(para 9.15). BJMC disbursed on a provisional basis to jute mills about three-
fourths of the funds obtained (Tk 1.0 billion in FY79) and kept the other
fourth (Tk .29 billion) in its cash account to help mills which are short of
cash.
9.03      With the proposed capital restructuring (paras 9.14 to 9.16) and
the anticipated profits (para 9.17) the need for continued subsidies will
be eliminated, and BJMC's role in maintaining the mills' liquidity will be
reduced substantially.
Consolidated Mills' Finances
9.04      Past Financial Performance.  Between FY73 and FY79, the jute mills
made losses totalling Tk 3,290 million (US$212 million), of which Tk 280
million in FY76; Tk 530 million in FY77; Tk 950 million in FY78; and Tk 610
million in FY79 (Annex 7). The per ton income statements (Annexes 8 through
12) show that, with the exception of FY78, sales prices fully covered raw
material and conversion cost, while depreciation, administrative expenses,
and interest charges were only partially recovered.
9.05      In absolute terms, hessian made the largest losses and sacking the
smallest, as shown below:

Compared to the respective share in production, carpetbacking shows the largest
losses and sacking the smallest.
9.06      Financial performance varied among the 66 mills.  In FY79, 6 hessian
and 12 sacking mills made profits, but carpetbacking mills did not. Table 9-3
shows the variation between the mills on a taka per ton basis:

Financial Net Profit (Loss)    329   (4,422)    613  (1,883)    (669)  (5,599)
The sales prices differed by 4% due to quality premiums and sale of more
sophisticated fabrics by the best mills. The cost of goods sold in the best
mills was between 26% and 32% lower than that in the worst mills. Generally,
the major reasons for differentials are more efficient purchase and use of raw
jute, higher spinning and weaving efficiencies, and better mill management.
However, the performance of some mills was worse than others due to factors
outside the influence of mill managers, such as power failures, higher
absenteeism, and older machinery that operates at slower speeds and has more
frequent breakdowns than newer machinery. Depreciation varied up to 174%
between the best and the worst mills, reflecting different age, cost, and
capacity utilizations of plant and machinery. Interest charges per ton of
production in the worst mills, which in FY79 were up to 189% higher than in
the best mills, point out the urgency of the capital restructuring proposed
by GOB (paras 9.14 to 9.16).
9.07      While it is necessary to improve the operating performance of the
jute industry as a whole, the variations within the industry show that it is
also important to raise the performance level of the worse mills. The monthly
review system (para 5.28) and the proposed reorganization (paras 5.05 to 5.09)
should promote this.
9.08      FY80 Finances.  During the first four months of FY80, the jute
mills made profits of Tk 191 million, due to sharply increased sales prices
(36% over FY79) and lower raw materials cost (9% below FY79). Between July
and October 1979, 52 units showed profits totalling Tk 392 million, and 14
units made losses of Tk 201 million. For FY80, total profits before taxes
are projected at Tk 850 million (US$54.8 million), and the financial projec-
tions (para 9.17 to 9.19) show continued profitability (on a consolidated
basis) over the next five years.

Factors Affecting the Financial Performance of the Jute Mills
9.09      The major factors affecting the operating performance of the jute
mills are (i) sales prices, (ii) raw material costs, (iii) factory wages, and
(iv) interest charges on short and long-term loans. In FY79, r'w material
costs amounted to about 50% of total cost, factory wages to 25%, and interest
charges to 8%. Table 9-4 below shows that price increases of 54% between
FY76 and FY79 were surpassed by a 59% increase in raw material costs, a 129%
increase in factory wages, and almost matched by a 48% increase in interest
charges. Losses peaked in FY78 when raw material costs increased by 32% and
factory wages by 70%, while sales prices increased by only 21%.

9.10      Sales Price.  Sales prices for jute goods have more than doubled
(109%) since FY76.  The price boom began in the second half of FY79 and peaked
in the middle of FY80.  Sales prices for average jute goods are expected to
stabilize in FY81 at Tk 10,925 per ton, which would be 85% above the FY76
sales price. Hessian has profited most from the price increases (129%),
followed by sacking (98%) and carpetbacking (73%). At present, all product
lines make profits: hessian, Tk 2,530 per ton; sacking, Tk 1,631 per ton; and
carpetbacking, Tk 85 per ton.
9.11      Raw Materials Cost.  Expenses for the procurement of raw jute are
the single most important cost element. Raw jute costs per ton increased
59% from FY76 to FY79. However, due to a large crop of bad quality jute and,
in part, due to better raw jute procurement (para 4.04), raw jute costs
dropped by 9% in early FY80. In FY81 raw jute costs are expected to drop
another 1% (para 4.02).
9.12      Factory Wages.  Wages per ton of jute goods have increased by 129%
since FY76. Contributing factors were (i) a 44% public sector wage increase
in FY79, retroactive from July 1, 1977 (FY78); (ii) the policy of reimbursing
75% of wages lost because of power failures introduced in FY79; (iii) an
increase of fringe benefits paid by the mills; and (iv) higher piecework
rates in production. This total benefit package has increased productivity
of workers and has reduced absenteeism. However, it appears that any further
substantial wage increases would only increase production costs without
further improving production efficiencies.
9.13      Interest Charges.  Interest charges per ton have increased by 48%
since FY76 and now represent 8% of total cost and 6.6% of the sales price.
Continuous losses have consumed the equity base, and mills have to carry an



- 36 -
interest burden of up to 26% of sales revenues. Although in FY80 the finan-
cial situation of many mills has improved, the interest burden of many mills
is so heavy that they continue to make losses and cannot establish a sound
equity base. Therefore, GOB has proposed to restructure their capital to
debt/equity ratio of 60:40 (para 9.14). This and the expected profits will
reduce the interest per ton from Tk 828 in FY79 to Tk 309 in FY84.
Capital Restructuring of Jute Mills
9.14      The consolidated balance sheets of the jute mills (Annex 13) show
the deteriorating trend in the financial position of the jute mills from
FY76 to FY79. Total assets in FY79 were Tk 5,950 million, while long-term
debt and current liabilities accounted for Tk 7,710 million (130% of total
assets, implying a negative equity base of Tk 1,760 million (US$113.5
million) caused by the continued losses since FY73.
9.15      Financial assistance by GOB, new bank borrowings in the form of
debentures, and the accumulation of arrears have kept the jute mills liquid
during the past years. GOB assisted with Tk 820 million of export subsidies
in FY78 and FY79, loss subsidies of Tk 784 million between FY74 and FY79, an
interest free loan of Tk 500 million in FY75, and equity infusions of Tk 300
million in FY78 and FY79, altogether totalling Tk 2,404 million (US$155.1
million). Janata Bank and Bangladesh Bank subscribed to Tk 200 million of
debentures issued by BJMC in FY74 on behalf of the mills, and the mills them-
selves issued debentures of Tk 300 million to Janata Bank and six commercial
banks in FY74. Arrears of principal and interest on long-term loans from
Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB) totalled Tk 160 million at the end of FY79,
and from Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha (BSRS) Tk 200 million. Most of the
assistance was channelled through the BJMC Head Office, which released funds
to the mills according to need.
9.16      During negotiations for the Eighth Imports Program Credit, GOB
agreed to establish for each mill by not later than December 31, 1983, a
long-term debt/equity ratio of 60:40, by (i) conversion of GOB loans into
equity amounting to Tk 880 million in FY80; (ii) cash infusions by GOB to
repay Tk 477 million of debentures; (iii) cash infusions by GOB to repay
Tk 1,698 million of long-term debt to BSB and BSRS; and (iv) additional cash
infusions by GOB of Tk 525 million. This amount would be reduced by any
profit which the jute industry would make from FY80 to FY83. To monitor the
impact of the capital restructuring at the mill level BJMC has worked out
five-year financial projections, which show satisfactory debt equity ratios
for each mill.
Projected Financial Performance of Jute Mills
9.17      The financial projections for the consolidated finances of the jute
mills are in Annexes 7 through 15 and the underlying assumptions in Annex 16.
The salient financial indicators are summarized below:

/a Sharp decline is result of rapid equity build up due to proposed capital
restructuring.
These projections take into account the capital restructuring and the result-
ing interest savings. From FY81-FY84 the jute industry is projected to make
annual profits of about Tk 33 billion (US$21 million). These profits would
represent about 5% of total sales and also 5% of total assets. The equity
would be built up substantially from Tk 1.76 billion in FY79 to Tk 2.53
billion in FY84.
9.18      Projected profits for hessian (Annex 9) are the highest, varying
between Tk 2,530 and Tk 1,104 per ton. Sacking (Annex 10) is expected to
make profits of Tk 1,631 per ton in FY80 and Tk 49 per ton in FY81, but
moderate losses thereafter because of a lower sales price. However, sacking
revenues would continue to cover fully production costs, most of the admin-
istrative and selling expenses, and part of the interest. Carpetbacking
(Annex 11) is projected to make a small profit of Tk 85 in FY80 and moderate
profits thereafter, varying between Tk 673 and Tk 792 per ton. BJMC's product
mix strategy is based on these financial results (para 3.17).
9.19      The projections show that the financial profitability of the jute
industry is highly sensitive to changes in sales prices and production costs.
During FY81 to FY84, any one of the following events would reduce the profits
to roughly zero: a 5% drop of the average sales price, a 12% increase of raw
materials cost, a 22% increase of factory wages, or a 13% increase of conver-
sion cost. Given the limited influence on sales prices, strict cost control
is imperative if profitability is to be maintained after FY80.



- 38 -
Financial Rate of Return of the Proposed Rehabilitation Project
9.20      Financial benefits from the proposed rehabilitation project accrue
from (i) profits on additional production, due to the increased spinning and
weaving efficiencies of the jute industry, and (ii) lowering of conversion
costs due to rehabilitation of the spinning machinery, as compared to increas-
ing conversion costs without rehabilitation. The financial rate of return
(before tax) of rehabilitation in constant 1979 Taka is estimated at 26%,
which is satisfactory (Annex 17). This is based on the following assumptions:
(i) 30% of the hessian production above the FY80 level is due to the rehabili-
tation, 50% for sacking production, and 20% for carpetbacking. The other pro-
duction increases are assumed to be due to better management, better utiliza-
tion of raw jute, better maintenance etc.; (ii) the level of conversion costs
without the project would be 0.5% higher in FY82 (the first year of project
impact) and would increase annually by 0.5% up to 4.5% in FY90 (the last year
of project impact). Assuming that lower sales prices would reduce the net
financial profit of additional production to zero (i.e., only benefits from
(ii) would accrue), the financial rate of return would be 17%, which is
still acceptable.

10.01     Costs for the proposed maintenance are current expenditures, which
are financed from current revenues. Any benefits from maintenance are expec-
ted to accrue during the same year by maintaining the existing production
levels. Thus, a rate of return was not calculated for maintenance expendi-
tures. The economic rate of return (ERR) (para 10.02) has been calculated
only for machine rehabilitation, which is assumed to enable about 30% of
the projected production increases (para 9.20). Benefits from institutional
improvements, which are assumed to account for the other 70% of the production
increases, have not been included in the ERR calculation. Apart from these
quantifiable benefits, the Project is expected to have also qualitative bene-
fits by increasing valuable foreign exchanges earnings from US$268 million
in FY79 to US$443 million in FY84 and maintaining employment for 205,000 mill
workers and for about 15% of Bangladesh's farmers who grow jute.
Economic Rate of Return
10.02     The economic rate of return has been calculated at 44%, which is
fully satisfactory (Annex 18). Such a relatively high rate of return can be
expected from a rehabilitation project where, normally, a marginal investment
enables substantial production increases. The cost stream consists of the
rehabilitation investment over three years. The benefit stream over ten years
consists of (i) the economic profits of additional production attributed to
the rehabilitation investment and (ii) savings of conversion costs which are
assumed to increase without the project. Thus, the costs and benefits are
similar to those used in calculating the financial rate of return (para 9.20),
but were adjusted using the following assumptions:



- 39 -
(a) a shadow wage rate of .5; this reduces economic costs com-
pared to financial costs by about 12.5%, given that wages
account for about 25% of costs;
(b) a shadow exchange rate of 1.25 (US$1=Tk 19.4); this inc,reases
the economic revenues by 25% compared with financial revenues;
costs increase only marginally (for foreign spares and
supplies and for 25% of the raw jute cost which is assumed
to be exportable);
(c) economic cost of raw jute equal to 110% of the domestic price,
in view of the raw jute export tax;
(d) omission of depreciation and interest on assets existing
prior to the project.
Assuming that lower sales prices reduce the net financial profit of additional
production to zero and economic prices are adjusted respectively, the economic
rate of return would be 34%, which is still fully satisfactory.
Risks
10.03     The risks concerning the project are minimal, since the proposed
investment has been kept at a minimum to keep the industry in good operating
condition with most emphasis put on operational improvements.
10.04     The risks concerning the industry as a whole are acceptable.  On
the one hand, strong competition from synthetics and supply disruptions due
to power failures and labor unrest will continue to be a major risk for the
jute goods market, and adverse price movements of raw jute and jute goods may
cause substantial financial losses. On the other hand, recent oil price
increases and a trend to natural fibers have given jute goods somewhat better
prospects. Given the low labor cost and the backward linkages of the jute
industry to the agricultural sector, Bangladesh has a comparative advantage
towards producers of other jute and polypropylene fabrics. Thus, revitaliza-
tion of the industry is fully justified.
XI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED
11.01     The action programs concerning the jute industry agreed under the
Fifth to Eighth Imports Program Credits would be monitored under the proposed
Credit. For the audit of individual mill accounts and for BJMC's accounts, a
new plan has been agreed (Annex I, Attachment 2(viii)).



- 40 -
11.02     BJMC agreed to:
(a) employ a management consultant by September 30, 1980 for
preparing the detailed implementation of the reorganization;
the objective is to have the new organization in place by
September 30, 1981 (para 5.09);
(b) employ a consultant by September 30, 1980 to review and pre-
pare a production incentive scheme for workers with particular
emphasis on incentives for workers in the spinning and back
processing departments. After review of the consultants'
report GOB/BJMC would adopt such scheme by January 1, 1982
(para 5.16);
(c) to gradually reduce the backlog of audits according to an
agreed schedule, so that its own accounts and those of each
individual mill are audited within six months of the end of
each fiscal year starting with FY81 (para 5.21);
(d) implement a process accounting system by July 1, 1981 (para
5.22);
(e) employ a professional accountants firm for a two-year period
by December 31, 1980 (para 5.24);
(vi) hire a consultant by September 30, 1980 to extend the proposed
management information system to information flows at head-
quarters (para 5.27).

JUTE INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
PRESENT STATUS OF THE ACTION PROGRAMS
UNDER THE FOURTH TO SEVENTH IMPORTS PROGRAM CREDITS
1.        Impact of the Action Programs.  Since 1975, the jute industry has
made substantial progress in strengthening its operating position.
2.        Marketing and production planning have improved substantially as a
result of several measures taken by BJMC. Prior to 1975, many mill managers
had chosen to produce those items which raised fewest problems in manufactur-
ing, rather than those which could be sold. The net result was an inventory
accumulation of goods with limited sales potential and shortages of items in
relatively better demand. These shortcomings have since been eliminated.
Following the preparation of a diagnosis report prepared by a marketing advisor
financed by the United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA), BJMC
established an appropriate organization and procedures for marketing. Other
recommendations for a training program, establishment of marketing research
and a market information system are now under implementation by a marketing
consultant (financed by ODA) who joined BJMC in January 1979 for two years.
In addition, BJMC has strengthened its sales efforts by establishing three
overseas sales offices. With the assistance of a UNIDO expert who started
work in January 1977, BJMC improved its quality control which was reflected
in a substantial reduction of claims for substandard material. Under the
action program of the Fifth Imports Program Credit, the Ministry of Jute has
established an export inspection service. These measures have helped in a
relative improvement of the market position of Bangladesh's jute goods, vis-
a-vis her other major competitors, and the quality of Bangladesh's jute goods
now seem to be equal to those of India. However, notwithstanding these improve-
ments, substantial increases in research and development are necessary to find
new uses for traditional products as well as new end uses for jute in order
to achieve the longer term objective of recapturing at least part of the world
market previously lost to synthetic fabrics. UNDP is providing assistance to
Bangladesh on research and development for the jute industry, and efforts to
develop jutton (a blend of jute and cotton fibers) continue under IDA technical
assistance.
3.        There is also a marked improvement in maintenance since 1975.  Main-
tenance Task Forces (MTFs), originally consisting of expatriate consultants,
and subsequently of their local engineering counterparts, have drawn up and
are implementing specific maintenance programs for each mill. Maintenance
standards have improved substantially. Purchasing procedures for spare parts
have been streamlined and local production of spare parts under CIDA technical
assistance started in mid-1979.

ANNEX 1

4.        Organization and Management.  In 1977, BJMC established unit boards,
chaired mostly by its six directors, for each of its 77 mills. However, it
was discovered that this span of control was excessive and led to inadequate
supervision of mill operations. In line with ECL's and IDA's recommendations,
BJMC now proposes to reduce the burden upon the directors by grouping mills
into nine zones, each under a general manager who would control not more than
nine mills. Such groupings would reduce the span of control of directors to
nine officers and will permit better use of scarce management skills and
facilitate the tapping of economies of scale by gradually integrating the
operations of adjacent mills. In particular, BJMC will establish training
units in selected mills within each group. BJMC has also established an
incentive scheme, designed to reward both management and worker performance.
This system is presently under review, and appropriate changes are likely to
be implemented by early 1980. Finally, in connection with the Sixth Imports
Program Credit, Bangladesh consultants (EWP) financed by ODA/UK, have designed
a management information system. BJMC is currently preparing the system for
implementation. The same consultant has devised a process accounting system
for the mills that would give better control on wastage and better data for
decision-taking. The system is being tested and will be implemented in some
mills in early 1980.
5.        The measures implemented under the action programs have already
resulted in an improvement in the operational performance of BJMC's mills and
have helped to contain a deterioration of the financial performance. Weaving
efficiencies ov overall installed weaving capacity improved from 43% in FY75
to 53% in FY79, and production increased by 15% over the same period rising
from 432,000 tons to 494,000 tons despite a shift to lighter fabrics. How-
ever, the full benefits of this improvement were offset by rising raw jute
costs and increased conversion costs. Poor weather conditions decreased
jute yields and raised raw jute prices by about 84%, while conversion costs
were significantly affected by an average 30% wage rate increase in FY78.
Higher losses were averted by an 82% increase in selling prices, by careful
monitoring of the mix of production, and by containing the rate of increase
in conversion costs vis-a-vis the rate of inflation. Overall, BJMC's operat-
ing losses were held to Tk 608 million in FY79, considerably below the
Tk 790 projected (Table 6).
6.        The table below shows key indicators of BJMC's performance compared
to previous years and targets agreed for FY79 as part of the Seventh Import
Program Credit (additional indicators and other details are given in the
attachments). For monitoring purposes, targets and costs are expressed in
constant FY79 values:

7.        On the basis of firm export orders and adequate stockholdings of
raw jute to meet these orders, BJMC projects operating profits of Tk 849
million. As of December 1979, operating profits were about Tk 450 million
for FY80, thus reversing the trend of losses from FY75 to FY79. For the
medium term, i.e. until 1985, the return to profitability is expected to be
maintained. However, the level of profitability would be significantly
influenced by changing patterns in product mix demand over which BJMC has
limited control and by the impact of mill rehabilitation and financial re-
structuring. The effect of these and other variables would be monitored every
six months during the course of supervision of the ongoing Imports Program
Credit. During these missions, operating projections would be updated and
corrective action recommended to maintain current levels of profitability.

JUTE INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Calculation of Economically Optimal Production Levels
1.       The economically optimal production would be at a level where sales
prices per ton equal the economic cost of the highest cost jute mill. It is
assumed that with increased production the sales price would be lower due to
elastic demand. The calculation below does not take into account a lowering
of production cost with increased production so that the optimal production
level is somewhat underestimated.
2.       Assumptions for economic prices and costs are:
(i)  shadow exchange rate of 1.25 (US$1=19.4 taka);
(ii) shadow wage rate of 0.5;
(iii)  economic cost of raw jute is 10% above the financial cost,
25% of raw jute is exportable. The other 75% could not
be exported due to lack of sufficient processing capacity
abroad;
(iv) omission of depreciation (sunk cost);
(v)  omission of interest (transfer payments).
3.         Actual and projected taka per ton sales price and selected cost
elements for financially weakest mills (The FY80 financial projections were
calculated by assuming that the cost differential between the average costs for
all jute mills in FY79 and the highest cost mill would persist in FY80):
