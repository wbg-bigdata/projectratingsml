PREFA..'E
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews and evaluates the
implementation and performance of the Jute Industry Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1032-BD) in Bangladesh.   The US$20 million credit was ap,proved on
June 4, 1980, declared effective on July 22, 1980, and closed on June 30,
1986, after three extensions. At project closing US$14.1 million (71% of the
credit) was disbursed, and $5.9 million was cancelled.
The PCR w&s prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Division
of the Asia Regional Office of the Bank, and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report, legal documents, supervision reports, internal Bank
memoranda, and data provided by the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJHC)
and the Bangladesh Jute Mills Association (BJMA).
The PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department. The draft
PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments, and they are appended to the
Report as Annex 7.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADFSH
JUTE INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1032-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.      Credit 1032-BD was approved on June 4, 1980, declared effective on
July 22, 1980, and closed on June 30, 1986. The US$20 million IDA credit was
provided to GOB for revitalizing the jute mill sector through:
(a) improvement of production systems by balancing, modernization, and
replacement and preventive maintenance of the machinery in the mills;
(b) institution building through improved organizational structure, better
cost control and accounting systems, and expanded management/staff training;
and (c) improving the capability of GOB for policy analysis and strategic
planning for the jute sector. At project closing, US$14.2 million was dis-
bursed and the rest was cancelled.
2.      IDA has been involved in Bangladesh's jute industry since 1975 when
it conducted a study that was the basis for the jute action programs of the
Fourth and Fifth Imports Program Credits. These programs focussed on improv-
ing marketing, production planning and maintenance work. In 1977, under the
Sixth Imports Program Credits, the problems of mill efficiency and
profitability were focussed on, the scope of previous efforts were broadened
and measures were introduced to strengthen the organization, management and
financial aspects of BJMC. The Seventh Imports Program Credit focussed on
the implementation of pending actions agreed under previous import credits,
and introduced efforts towards export development. In FY87, IDA completed a
sector report (Report No. 6161-BD) which analyzed in detail the key issues
facing the jute sector and made recommendations.
3.      The key objective of the project--reviving a declining industry
through improving efficiency of the mill sector and restoring its financial
viability--has not been met. While efficiency and productivity of individual
machines has improved as a result of the project, these gains neither trans-
lated into overall improvements nor were adequate to overcome adverse changes
in costs and consequently, the mill sector is in worse shape today than it
was five years ago. Compared to the late 1970s, overall productivity and
efficiency during FY84-86 are lower or about the same (para. 5.02). In the
caae of the public sector (BJMC) mills, unit conversion costs (US$/ton) have
increased by about 80X over this period compared to about 461 increase in
unit sales price (para. 5.07); although some of this adverse cost/price ratio
was dampened by lower raw jute price, overall losses were substantial.
Financial performance of private (BJMA)1/ mills was generally similar. From
FY80 to FY86, losses of BJMC and BJKA mills amounted to about 11% of total
sales, or about Tk 3.9 billion. In FY86 alone, the jute mill sector losses
totaled about Tk 2.4 billion representing roughly 0.51 of GDP at current
1/ BJMA: Bangladesh Jute Mills Association - an association of private
mills.



- vi -
market prices. As a result of the large and continuing losses, the financial
restructuring, implemented under the project, was unable to restore the
financial viability of the mills.
4.      The project components designed to strengthen the institutional
aspects--reorganization of BJMC, and strengthening of its MIS, financial/
process accounting and budgeting systems, production incentive systems, and
establishment of Jute Strategy Cell--have also not achieved their objectives.
The organization study has been completed, but so far few of its recommenda-
tions have been implemented. The MIS is operational, but the data it
receives is not thoroughly checked and there.ore, the quality and consistency
of reports is poor. A production incentive scheme and a process accounting
system were developed by consultants, but neither has been implemented
because of lack of enthusiasm by BJMC and its reservations on the proposed
schemes. The audit backlog was cleared up, but audit reservations were
carried forward year after year without remedial actions, corsequently
defeating the ultimate purpose of the audits. The Jute Strategy Cell is in
operation, but there are serious doubts on the effectiveness of the cell to
perform strategy formulation tasks within a bureaucratic setting. The train-
ing center is perhaps the more successful component of this credit. Despite
its share of problems, it has trained since FY85 some 990 officers and 2,110
staff/workers in the mill sector, and the feedback from the trainees has been
encouraging. Mid-way during project implementation, about half the project
mills were denationalized. This move adversely impacted on the institution
building and the rehabilitation components (paragraph 4.02).
5.      The project failed to realize its objectives because GOB did not
address the basic issues, closing down of inefficient mills and inadequate
autonomy of BJMC. GOB interventions, in raw jute price support schemes and
public and industrial sector wage setting and its policy limiting the
autonomy of mill managers in operational and employment issues resulted in
not only the continued operation of inefficient high cost mills, but also
inflexibility in reducing conversion costs. This lack of attention to key
performance determinants dwarfed any gains from ircprovements at machine
level. The private sector was also adversely influenced by GOB policies and
the control of a large part of the industry by the public sector--the prac-
tices and polices of the latter exert tremendous influence on the overall
operating norms and environment of the industry. Further aggravating the
problem, world market demand for jute goods was depressed, and competition
from synthetics increased.
6.      In summary, even though the project did nor meet its objectives,
valuable lessons have been learned, particularly on tht importance of
autonomy to the success of public enterprises and the need for efficient exit
policies for reversing the decline of marginal industries (para. 7.03). A
number of GOB policies/actions--labor market interventions leading to
rigidities, financing of losses through the budget or the banking system--
have prevented exit of unviable and inefficient firms, thus making it dif-
ficult for the more efficient firms to grow and prosper.
7.      To arrest and reverse the continued deterioration of the jute mills,
immediate COB actions should be directed to: (a) restructuring/closing of
high cost BJMC mills which is critical in order to achieve efficient produc-
tion and to produce competitively priced products; (b) increasing autonomy of
BJMC to enable it to operate along commercial lines; (c) restructuring the
mills' debt buedens; (d) increasing wages only in line with productivity; and
(e) effectively implementing the institution building efforts envisaged under



- vii -
the project. These efforts would need to be complemented by efforts to reduce
instability in the raw jute market. This PCR also suggests a possible
approach for restructuring of BJMC mills (para. 8.03). Restructuring of the
private sector mills has aLready begun, with the full or partial closure of
about four mills. Ironically market forces ar's closing down mills in the
private sector which may probably be more efficient than many of the public
sector mills.
8.    Comments from BJHC, contained in Annex 7, are generally consistent with
IDA's observations reported in the text.They also elaborate factors that
impeded Project implementation, and reveal that BJMC data relating to its
performance and use and disbursement of the Credit do not coincide with those
reported to or maintained by IDA.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
JUTE INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1032-BD)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) approached the International
Development Association (IDA) to arrange financing for the proposed Jute
Industry Rehabilitation Project in March 1979. Preappraisal was carried out
in September 1979 followed by an appraisal in December 1979. In June 1980, IDA
approved a credit of US$20 million in support of the project. The project
focussed on the improved maintenance and rehabilitation of the machinery of 66
jute mille, institutional and financial strengthening of the Bangladesh Jute
Mills Corporation (BJMC), and the establishment of a strategy formulation cell
within government. The project was closed on June 1986, and the last disburse-
mEnt was made in January 1987.
1.02    The US$20 million credit was made to GOB which:  (a) on-lent US$9.9
million through BJMC for individual mill rehabilitation, and US$0.5 million to
BJMC for consultant services and training; and (b) provided US$9.6 million of
foreign exchange to individual mills for purchase of maintenance spares.
1.03    In the course of project implementation, 35 BJMC mills were denational-
ized starting from December 1982. These denationalized (BJMA) mills were
originally allocated US$6.07 million. At project closing, only about US$1.82
million was disbursed, all of which took place when the mills were still under
BJMC. The remainder of US$4.25 million was cancelled because outstanding
obligations between the denationalized mills and the development banks--
Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB) and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha (BSRS)--remained
unresolved. At project closing, out of the US$13.93 million allocated for BJMC
mills, approximately US$1.57 million was unutilized and therefore cancelled.
Consequently, of the US$20 million credit, US$5.82 million was cancelled,
US$12.36 million was disbursed to BJMC, and US$1.82 million was disbursed to the
private mills.
1.04    The project failed to realize its objectives mainly because GOB did not
address key issues of excess capacity and autonomy. Operational, financial and
economic performance of the jute mills have deteriorated during the period FY80
to FY86. From FY80 to FY86, BJMC and BJMA mills losses amounted to over Tk 3.9
billion which is about llX of total sales. In FY86 alone, the jute mill sector
losses totaled about Tk 2.4 billion, representing roughly 0.5X of GDP at current
market prices.
1.05    To arrest the continued deterioration of the jute mills, immediate GOB
actions should be directed towards developing a restructuring plan for the whole
industry, which will address, among others, issues such as the
closure/rehabilitation of inefficient and high cost mills, increasing autonomy
of BJMC mills, reducing the mills' debt burden, reducing instability in the raw
jute market and ensuring that wage increases remain in line with productivity
gains. This plan will also have to take into account the ongoing and projected
decline in jute goods prices and develop the least cost approach to lowering the
conversion costs in the industry.

II. SECTOP4L BACKGROUND
A. The Industrial Sector
2.01    Bangladesh's manufacturing sector accounts for about 12% of GDP and 8%
of total employment. The modern manufacturing sector, consisting of public
sector and large-scale private units, generates 58% of value added, but employs
only 18% of the manufacturing labor force. Small and cottage industries account
for most of the employment (82%) in the sector and the remaining 42% of the
total value added. The public sector's share has declined continuously since
mid-1975 and currently constitutes about 40% of total fixed assets in the modern
manufacturing sector, compared to about 90% in 1972.
2.02    Despite the manufacturing sector's relatively small size, it plays a
prominent role in the country's external trade. Mostly due to jute products,
it currently accounts for almost three-fourths of total merchandise exports.
About 30% of value added in modern manufacturing now originates in export
activities. Ban&ladesh has very limited natural resources and depends on imports
for most of its raw materials. Given the import intensive nature of industry,
manufactured exports, especially non-traditional exports, will have to continue
to expand rapidly to meet the gzowing import requirements, if the sector is to
grow rapidly without creating undue pressure on the balance of payments.
2.03    At the time of independence in 1971, the Government of Bangladesh took
over all enterprises considered abandoned by their non-Bangladeshi owners. The
Government also nationalized all units owned by Bangladeshis in cotton textiles,
jute and sugar manufacturing. As a result, public ownership of fixed assets in
modern manufacturing increased, from about one-third to almost 90%. The private
sector was also excluded from jute export trade, insurance and banking; its role
was limited to business activities with fixed assets below Tk 1.5 million.
2.04    The loss of entrepreneurs and managers, physical damage to assets and
infrastructure, loss of export markets and the transition to public ownership,
all disrupted the sector. By FY75 industrial output had declined to 75% of its
FY69 level. Government emphasis on rehabilitation of existing units and higher
capacity utilization helped industry rebound, and industrial output increased at
an annual average rate of 7% during FY75 to FY81. Nevertheless, the FY69 level
of industrial output was regained only in FY79.
2.05    In June 1982, the Government introduced a New Industrial Policy aimed at
l5beralizing industrial policies, denationalizing selected public enterprises
and improving the remaining and promoting the private sector. Following intro-
duction of this new policy, the government denationalized 27 textile mills,
constituting 45% of the country's spinning and 57% of its weaving capacity, and
35 jute mills accounting for about 40% of total production capacity.
Furthermore, 474 other industrial enterprises and 2 nationalized commercial
banks have been divested, and the private sector has been allowed to enter the
banking sector. As a result, Lhe number of public industrial corporations was
reduced from 11 to 6, and large amounts of debt were converted to equity.



-3-
2.06    In the past two years, as a result of the improved policy environment,
good exchange rate management, and favorable macroeconomic developments, the
industrial sector has grown an average of 9% per annum, while non-traditional
exports achieved annual growth rates of 30-40%. Most of the sector's growth has
come from labor-intensive industries like garments and light engineering.
2.07    Sustaining the present high rate of industrial growth with heavy
emphasis on labor-intensive industries is an important element in the
government's policy to meet domestic demand, expand export markets and create
employment outside agriculture.
B. Jute Sector
2.08    Overview.  Jute is the principal export product of Bangladesh, account-
ing in fibre (raw jute) and processed (jute goods) form for about US$470 million
in annual export earnings, or about 58% of the country's total export earnings
in PY83-FY85. The jute sector, because it is highly labor-intensive, also
provides about 10% of all employment in the economy. The sector's overall
contribution to GDP is about 7Z and of monetized GDP, about 15X. Consequently,
the performance of the jute sector is crucial to Bangladesh's economy.
2.09    World market demand conditions are a critical determinant of the perfor-
mance of the jute sector. About 90Z of all jute production is exported; two-
thirds in the form of jute goods, and one-third in raw jute. Bangladesh is the
largest supplier of jute in world trade; the country accounts for 30X of total
world jute production, and 55% of total world exports of jute and jute goods.
Jute supply policies in Banglades0 thus, exert an important influence on world
supplies, and ultimately on demand 4ince growth in world demand is quite depend-
ent on assured supplies of jute at prices which are competitive to the prices of
synthetic substitutes. Over the past 15 years, synthetic substitutes, mainly
polypropylene, have provided intense competition to jute in all major end-uses
and markets.
2.10    World import demand for jute has been stagnant over the past decade.
Average export prices of jute have declined by 15% in real terms from the
already low levels in the 1970s. The predominant reason for the stagnant level
of world demand was a reduction of jute use in North America by about 50%. In
North America, technological advances in bulk-handling, new materials for carpet
backing, and other products resulted in a decline in demand. Decline of jute
demAnd in African countries can be attributed to difficulties in the balance of
payments and declining agricultural production. In Latin America, import
restraints on jute, protection of domestic fibre production, bulk-handling, and
the increased used of synthetics contributed tc the decline of jute imports. In
Western Europe, the demand was stagnant. In centrally planned economies, jute
demand increased by only 21 per annum. In other developing countries, jute
imports increased by about 6% per annum.



-4-
2.11    Raw Jute.  Acreage and production of raw jute have declined from over
2.3 million acres and 6.6 million bales in FY66-71 to 1.6 million acres and 5.3
million bales in FY81-86 respectively. The decline was the result of the large
fall in relative profitability of jute cultivation vis-a-vis rice. Raw jute
prices have fallen steadily in real tirms and by the early 1980s, average prices
were 50X lower than in the early 19709. While this large reduction in raw jute
prices was a significant factor in keeping jute goods prices competitive with
synthetics, it was insufficient to compensate for both the lower sales prices on
jute good, and higher production costs in the mills.
2.12    A major cause of the poor performance of the jute sector is the
instability of raw jute supplies and prices. Steps need to be taken (para 2.15)
to prevent the occurrence of periodic and very costly disruptions in the jute
market, as most recently evident when raw jute prices more than doubled in FY85
and subsequently, collapsed in FY86. Raw jute accounts for 50-601 of the
production costs of jute goods, and as a result this instability also affects
very adversely the viability of the mill sector.   See reference on p.2 of Annex 7..
2.13    Mill Sector.  Following the nationalization of the jute mills, a holding
company, the BJMC, was formed to run the 68 jute mills in the country. The
denationalization program in 1982 left BJMC with 33 mills; the remaining 35
mills are in the private sector. Total jute goods production in FY86 was about
460,000 tons of which 602 was produced in BJMC mills while the remaining 402 was
produced in the private mills. In terms of the installed capacity, BJMC also
accounts for about 602. In FY86, the mill sector employed some 183,000
employees of which 66X are in BJMC. Export earnings in FY86 was about Tk 8,8
billion or about 1.92 of GDP at current market prices.
2.14    From FY75 to FY,9, BJMC's jute mills accumulated losses amounted to
about Tk 2.8 billion or 192 of the annual value of sales. Inevitably, COB
financial assistance was called upon in the form of cash subsidies, export
subsidies, and equity infusions totaling Tk 1.7 billion. In the period of FY80
to FY86, BJMC and BJMA jute mills continued to make losses that amounted to
about 112 of total sales. The total financial losses during this period was
over Tk 3.9 billion. About Tk. 2.2 billion of these losses were financed by
budgetary subsidy and cash infusions, while the remaining losses were financed
through loans. While the jute sector remains by far the most important source
of foreign exchange earnings, it has paradoxically become a large financial
drain on Bangladesh's economy.  See reference on pages 2-3 of Annex 7.
2.15    In FY87, IDA completed a sector report 1/ which analyzed in detail the
key issues facing the jute sector. As discussed in the report, future prospects
of jute exports are not encouraging. Competition from synthetics and weak world
import demand are likely to keep prices at depressed levels. Over the next

No. 6161-BD, June 23, 1986.

decade, Bangladesh's export are not likely to grow by more than 2% p.a. in
volume and 1.4% p.a. in value terms. Even achieving these growth rates would
require substantial policy improvements, reduction in the costs of production
and the instability of raw jute prices and output. Briefly, the report made the
following recommendations:
(a)  Price and supply instability in the raw jute market should be
reduced through: improving jute market information, buffer stock
operation and strengthening of nrivate storage activity; intro-
ducing variable export taxes and subsidies; improving raw iute
procurement policies by mills; and stabilizing acreage under jute
and improving yields;
(b) Operational efficiency of the mill sector should be improved
through: capacity rationalization, improved labor-productivity
and wage-determination process, financial restructuring of the
mill sector and increased autonomy of the BJMC mills; and
(c) Institutional capacity of the government to plan, monitor and
implement the jute policy and assist in product and market
development should be strengthened.
III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Origin
3.01    Most of the jute mills were established in the 50s and early 60s.
During the liberation period, the mill sector suffered tremendously--loss of
management and supervisory staff, neglect of maintenance, work stoppages and
war damages. In the years following independence, BJMC's operations
deteriorated further. The main bottleneck to improved production and produc-
tivity were lack of maintenance, poor production planning and inefficient yarn
production facilities which were not only run down, but also not suited to
production of lighter yarns whose requirements had increased with the shift to
lighter fabrics. In the mid-70's, several foreign aid agencies designed com-
plementary assistance to halt and reverse the deterioration. IDA has been
involved in Bangladesh's jute industry since 1975 when it conducted a study that
was the basis for the jute action programs of the Fourth and Fifth Imports
Program Credits. Under these two and subsequent three program credits, IDA
assistance focussed on improving marketing, production planning, preventive
maintenance, strengthening of the orgarnization, management and financial aspects
of BJMC and export development. In conjunction with IDA, UK's Overseas
Development Administration financed consultants for undertaking a mill-by-mill
survey to assess the balancing, modernization and replacement needs of BJMC
mills.



-6-
3.02    A GOB interministerial study group reviewed the consultant's BMR program
(para. 3.01) and submitted in June 1979 to IDA a modified proposal aimed at
minimizing investment--industry wide balancing (instead of individual mills)
through inter-mill machinery transfer and rehabilitation rather than new
investment--in view of the marginal financial viability of the industry, the
high cost of new machines and low labor cost in Bangladesh. In support of the
project proposal submitted by GOB, IDA approved a US$20 million credit (1032-BD)
in June, 1980.
B. Objectives
3.03    The objectives of the project were to:  (i) increase the mill sector's
production and efficiency through rehabilitation, maintenance and balancing of
existing production facilities; and (ii) continue to improve the organization,
management, and finances of the jute industry through reorganization, financial
restructuring, improved financial management systems, production incentive
systems and training programs.
C. Project Components
3.04    To achieve the stated objectives, the US$20 million credit was targeted
for the following areas:
1. Production Systems Improvement Component
(a) Rehabilitation of yarn winding, spinning and back processing
machinery in all the jute mills.
(b) Introduction of a third shift from the existing two shift
operation in the back processing and spinning department of
40 mills.
(c) Transfer of about 41 spinning/back processing machines from
mills with surplus machines to those in need of such machines.
(d) Preventive maintenance program for the entire production
facility in all the mills.
2. Institution Building Component
(a) Program of training including the establishment of about 9
training centers, one in each zonal offices.
(b) Organizational strengthening of BJMC and mills.
(c) Improvement of decision-making and cost control through estab-
lishment of MIS, introduction of process accounting system, and
improvement of the budgeting system.



-7-
(d) Introduction of production incentive scheme in the back
processing department through designing of the scheme and
provision of dial scales to measure production.
(e) Strengthening institutional capacity for analyzing long-term
strategic issues through establishment of a Jute Strategy Cell.
3. Financial Restructuring of BJMC Mills
COB agreed under the Eighth Imports Program Credit to establish for
each mill by December 31, 1983, a long-term debt/equity ratio of
60:40 via conversion of debt to equity and cash infusions. This
agreement was also included under this project.
3.05    The total project cost was estimated at US$37.98 million and is
presented in Table 3.1 below.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Start-up
4.01    The credit became effective on July 22, 1980.  Following credit
effectiveness, the project commenced without delays.
B. Change in Project Scope
4.02    Denationalization.  In the course of project implementation, a major
change occurred in mill sector. Subsequent to the New Industrial Policy,
between 1982-1986 GOB denationalized about 35 BJKC mills by transferring up to
51X of the shares to the former Bangladeshi owners. GOB currently retains a
maximum of 49% ownership in the denationalized mills.
4.03    After denationalization, all project activities and efforts ceased in
the denationalized mills either because of legal problems or lack of interest
on the part of the new mill owners. The denationalization also affected the
overall project: intermill transfer stopped, BJMC's overall operations were
disrupted, and for a few months it and GOB were preoccupied with
policy/operational issues arising from denationalization.
4.04    IDA proposed to BJMC and GOB an arrangement whereby the amount
originally allocated for the 35 denationalized mills be made available from GOB
to the private mills, on exactly the same terms provided in the Credit
Agreement, with the BSB and BSRS acting as administrative agents on behalf of
GOB. These on-lending arrangements were finalized in December 1984 after about
18 months. As a precondition for the denationalized mills to participate in
this proposed arrangement, the mills' outstanding long-term liabilities with
BSB and BSRS had to be resolved. The main contentious issue related to the
increase in liabilities resulting from massive exchange rate devaluations after
1971. Unfortunately, the mills' overdue obligations with BSB and BSRS remained
unresolved at project closing, and only recently has agreement been reached
among GOB, BSBIBSRS and the mills on settlement of the overdue accounts.
Consequently, out of the allocated US$6.07 million, only about US$1.82 million
was disbursed which took place when the mills were still under BJKC; no disbur-
sements took place for the private mills after denationalization. The undis-
bursed US$4.25 million (21.2% of the credit) allocated for the denationalized
mills was cancelled.
C. Implementation of Project Components
1. Production Systems Improvement Component
4.05    With a view to improving the productivity and efficiency of production,
the project included efforts in two directions: improving yarn production
system through rehabilitation of back processing and spinning machinery, inter-
mill transfer of such machinery and the introduction of a third shift in the
back processing department, and improving the overall production system through
enhancement of the preventive maintenance program.



-9-
4.06    Rehabilitation of Yarn Production Machinery.  BJMC's head office exer-
cised overall control and supervised co-ordination of the rehabilitation works
through the Zonal Offices. The project included rehabilitation of about 3,700
machines, of which about 2,700 1/ have been rehabilitated by the time the
project closed. Spares have been received/ordered for about half of the remain-
ing machines which would be rehabilitated ozer the next 12-18 months; the
remaining machines would not be rehabilitated. Delays occurred in implementa-
tion of this component because of:
(a) lack of coordination between ordering of spares by the mills and its
procurement by BJMC. In many cases, not only specifications of
spares were incorrect, but unwanted spares were procured;
(b) lack of orderly scheduling and a clear rehabilitation plan
at the mill level;
(c) delays in disbursement of IDA funds as there were about 2,000
withdrawal applications;
(d) delays in delivery by suppliers; and
(e) reluctance on part of mill management to stop operation of
machines targeted for rehabilitation.
4.07    Intermill Transfer of Machines.  At appraisal, the balancing aspect of
the project called for the intermill transfer of an estimated 41 spinning/back
processing machines from mills with surplus machines to those with deficiences.
As a result of denationalization the intermill transfer of machinery between
BJMC mills and the denationalized mills ceased. Furthermore, changes in
product-mix, subsequent to appraisal, made the original plan redundant.
Consequently, BJMC dropped the implementation of the intermill transfer of
machinery after receiving concurrence from IDA in June 1984.
4.08    Introduction of Third Shift.  The project called for an introduction
of third shift working on millside (spinning and back processing) in most mills
to balance the weaving production. The original plan was to introduce a third
shift after the intermill transfer of machinery has taken place. Although the
intermill transfer was not fully implemented, most mills are presently operating
three shifts.
1/ While the project was intended to cover mainly rehabilitation of yarn
production machinery, at initial stage of the project a few mills also
rehabilitated some weaving machines.



-10-
4.09    Preventive Maintenance.  Under the Import Program Credits, BJMC set up
Maintenance Task Forces and the credits provided foreign exchange for imported
spares for preventive maintenance. To continue this support at an enhanced
level, the project included US$9.6 million to finance about half of the
estimated ($21 million) imported spares and equipment needed over a three year
period for regular and preventive maintenance. The other half was to be
financed from bilateral sources. BJMC had to use its internal resources or ADP
funds for buying the foreign exchange provided under the project. In recent
years BJMC has been spending about US$25-30 million annually on repairs and
maintenance as indicated in its income statement; accurate estimates are not
available on the level of preventive maintenance--total or the foreign exchange
component. Total withdrawals made by BJMC under this category amounted to about
US$4.6 million and the remaining US$4.6 million was either cancelled or reallo-
cated to other categories.  Annen  7, p.6 cites disbursements of US$4.9 million.
2. Institutional Building Component
4.10    Establishment of Training Centers.  Nine training centers were to be
established under the project to provide on-the-job training to management,
supervisors, and workers. Out of the envisaged nine centers, only three centers
were to be newly constructed with the other six located in existing facilities.
Actual cost of civil works for these centers was about US$480,000 as compared to
the appraisal estimate of US$130,000; the overrun was financed through realloca-
tion of funds from another category. All nine centers are operational, although
the following problems persist: (a) lack of sufficient machinery for trainee use
because the intermill transfer, as part of which some machines were to be allo-
cated to the centers, was not fully implemented; and (b) the discontinuation of
budgetary funds for running these centers. The mills are bearing full costs of
these centers.
4.11    Reorganization of BJMC and Mills.  Under the project, BJMC was to employ
a consultant by September 30, 1980 to review BJMC's organizational/operational
processes and make recommendations on measures which would enable BJi(C to
operate as a commercial entity. While the consultant selection was finalized by
end-1980, the study did not commence until March 1985, about 5 years later.
Firstly, delays occurred in finalizing the draft agreements. Then the
denationalization process took place, and government committees were set-up for
reorganization of public sector corporations. New government
policies/directives were established in line with recommendations of these
committees. The TORs were redrafted to take these into account, reapproved by
GOB/IDA, and agreements renegotiated. The consultants submitted their report to
BJMC in August 1985.
4.12    The consultants recommended that BJMC be reorganized and individual jute
mills be operated on fully commercial basis as independent profit centers.
BJMC's Marketing Division should be established as an international marketing
agency to secure orders for both BJMC and private mills. Minimum export prices
for jute goods should be abolished. The newly created Bangladesh Jute
Corporation should be allowed to purchase raw jute at prevailing market prices



-11-
and resell them to jute mills. Autonomy in hiring and discharging employees be
granted to mill managers or a welfare subsidy be provided to the mills for the
imposed overmanning.  BJMC's Board should be expanded to include experienced
business executives, professional personnel and Ministerial representatives so
that the Board representation is broadened and deepened. Several positions were
proposed to be eliminated. Finally, the study recommended computerization of
inventory control, proper financial planning and budgetary control, and
strengthening the internal auditing function.
4.13    Most of the consultant's recommendations have not been implemented by
GOB/BJMC and the organizational structure and operational processes at project
closing resemble those at appraisal except for some minor changes.
4.14    Improving Management and Financial Accounting System.  In order to
assist BJMC with improving its management systems, funds were provided in the
project for BJMC to engage consultants in the areas of financial accounting,
MIS and process accounting.
4.15    By December 31, 1980, BJMC was to engage an accounting firm to assist in
improving its financial accounting and to consolidate accounts of BJMC and the
jute mills. Consultant selection was completed by early 1981, but finalization
was delayed because of lack of agreement between BJMC and the consultants on
proposed fees of US$750,000 which were substantially higher than the estimated
budget ($440,000). In end-1982, BJMC recommended that the component be dropped
citing efforts it had undertaken since appraisal to strengthen its accounting
procedures and cost and budgeting controls, and the changed circumstances par-
ticularly with regards to the fewer number of mills under its control following
the denationalization. Because of BJMC's reluctance and the above reasons, IDA
concurred with BJMC.
4.16    As part of the Sixth Import Credit, a Management Information System
(MIS), was developed to reduce the voluminous data and reports, and to standard-
ize the information flow from the mills to BJMC and other offices. Under the
project, it was agreed that BJMC would engage a consultant by September 20, 1980
to extend the existing MIS system. For the reasons cited in para 4.15 above,
the MIS consultant was also not engaged. At project closing, the MIS is capable
of supplying daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly reports. Computerization of
other important information on raw jute stock, procurement and others have been
completed. Unfortunately, the input data is often not thoroughly checked and
consequently the quality and consistency of the MIS reports are not very
satisfactory.
4.17    Under the Fifth Imports Program Credit, a Process Accounting System
(PAS) system was developed with a view to enabling BJMC to estimate
standard/actual costs at various stages of processing. The existing accounting
system did not provide this and as a result was not an adequate tool for cost-
control. Under the project, BJMC agreed to implement the PAS in all mills by
July 1981. A consultancy firm introduced the PAS on a trial basis in two mills
in 1980. Following the trial runs, BJMC senior management, especially financial



-12-
staff, had serious reservations on the utility of a comprehensive cost account-
ing system. It was felt that: (i) there was no practical means of quantifying
the gains in relation to the costs of implementing the PAS; (ii) preparation and
submission of monthly accounts as recommended by the consultants would take more
time than current reporting system; and (iii) under the recommended system, the
profitability position of the mills would be available in about one and half
months while the present system was providing reports to the mills in about two
weeks. BJMC also doubted the capability of the proposed accounting system to
provide element-wise cost structure at various stages of processing. As a
result, the PAS remained unimplemented at project closing.
4.18    Production Incentive Scheme.  The purpose of the production incentive
scheme was to improve the productivity of the spinners and workers in the back
processing departments. While weavers, which account for about 60Z of the
workers, are paid on piece rate basis, the spinners are paid on flat rate.
Consequently there is no incentive for spinners to improve productivity or
attendance. The project included design of a suitable system and provision of
weigh scales to measure spinning production. BJMC was to employ a consultant to
review and prepare a production incentive scheme by September 30, 1980, and to
adopt such a scheme by January 1, 1982. The timetable was not met; consultants
were engaged in December 1981, and the report was submitted to BJMC in December
1982.
4.19    After reviewing the report, BJMC concluded that the consultanc's report
was not workable because it was too elaborate, complex and impractical.
Consequently, BJMC requested that the consultant proposals be implemented on a
trial basis at one of the jute mills. There was substantial delay in implement-
ing the trial run because the consultants felt that it was not part of the
contract agreement even though they initially agreed to BJMC's request. After
prolonged persuasion, the trial establishment took place in June 1985. A report
was submitted on June 1986 indicating that it was practical to implement the
proposed production incentive scheme. BJMC set up a committee to study the
consultant's report; neither BJMC nor mill management were supportive of the
consultants' claims, and most felt that the formulation of the incentive norms
was difficult to comprehend and implement. There was no attempt by BJMC at the
inception of the study to provide input into the study. BJMC believes that it
would be in a better position to design the production incentive scheme.
However, it has not made any serious efforts to design such a system. Thus, at
project closing, none of the BJMC or BJMA mills have a production incentive
scheme for the workers in the back processing department.
4.20    The project called for 42 BJMC mills to acquire weighing scales.  The
remainder 24 mills already had their weighing scales. A total of 79 scales were
procured under the project. Neither BJMC nor private mills are using these
scales because the envisaged production incentive scheme was not put in place.
4.21    Jute Strategy Cell.  Under the project, GOB was to establish a Jute
Strategy Cell by December 1980. The purpose of the strategy cell was to assisL
GOB in formulating medium and long-term strategies for raw jute and jute goods
industry.



-13-
4.22    Major problems were encountered during establishment of the cell:  (a)
Staffing of the cell was delayed because of the difficulty of recruiting local
candidates qualified for the Head of the Cell; (b) there was strong resistance
by lower level staff in the Ministry of Jute to bringing in an outsider as head
of the cell; (c) delays took place due to the lack of budget. These problems
resulted in delaying the establishment of the cell by about 4 years. After a
series of discussions with GOB and IDA's threat of suspending disbursement, the
cell was finally established in December 1984. A local consultant was selected
to conduct studies on jute policies and marketing strategies. Because of the
tight budgetary situation, IDA agreed in June 1984 to provide from a Technical
Assistance Credit, Tk 1.5 million for consultancy and training. Further delays
were encountered prior to the functioning of the cell which became finally
operative in early 1985. In the last 2 years since the cell has been
operational, it has had three chiefs.
4.23    At project closing, out of the allocated Tk 1.5 million available for
consultancy, only Tk 0.2 million have been used. The consultant has submitted
four reports in the following areas: (a) seasonal jute pricing behavior; (b)
price elasticities of export demand for raw jute and jute goods; (c) demand for
jute fibre stools; and (d) recent world jute market. Because of lack of ade-
quate cooperation by the Ministry Staff, the consultant has decided not to renew
the contract. Funds were also provided for overseas study tours, but so far no
tours have taken place.
3. Financial Restructuring of BJMC Mills
4.24    The capital restructuring was intended to return the mills to a more
sustainable long-term debt to equity ratio of 60/40 (1.5). The estimated and
actual consolidated capital restructuring of B-TMC and BJMA mills and GOB equity
infusions (Taka million) are presented in Table 4.1 below.

From PY 80 to FY86, GOB cash infusion amounted to Tk 2.2 billion, of which
Tk 1.5 billion went to the current 39 BJMC mills and Tk 0.7 billion went to BJMA
mills when they were under BJMC. Despite GOB cash infusion of Tk 2.2 billion,
representing over 16X more than the estimated figure, huge financial Losses
incurred by the mills particularly in FY85 and FY86, prevented the achievement
of the 60/40 ratio (Annex 5). Currently, the equity of BJMC mills is negative.
Because of the continuous losses, additional cash infusion in the order of
Tk 3.7 billion would be required to maintain a 60/40 debt-equity ratio for BJMC
mills alone.
4.25    Audits.  Al.hough there were some delays, the backlog of audits (FY7E
to FY80) of individual millo were completed in time; subsequent annual audits
were also generally completed on time. Without exception, the auditors gave
unqualified opinions as to the fairness of the financial statements and com-
pliance with the Companies Act of 191'. However, in most cases the reports also
contained reservations regarding companies procedures, and quality of internal
control and record keeping. The observations were carried forward each year as
remedial actions were not taken. Consequently, it appears that the audits have
not been used by the mill management/BJMC for maintaining financial and budget-
ing discipline.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
4.26    Procurement.  Procurement of goods and services under the project was
delayed considerably because of the lack of coordination between BJMC and the
mill managers, the difficulty of obtaining funds for imported items, scheduling
problems and the disruption caused by the denationalization of the mills.
Initially, procurement wat undertaken centrally from BJMC Head Office on behalf
of all jute mills. After the denationalization of jute mills, procurement was
transferred to the individual mills. Aside from the delay caused by the
denationalization program, BJMC had tco explain to the individual mill managars
IDA's procurement procedures compounding the delay in procurement. At least 6
months were lost when the tenders of the individual jute mills that were floated
(November 1983 to February 1984) had to be retendered when IDA informed BJMC in
March 1984 that some of the tender specifications were not in conformity to
IDA's standard guidelines. A persistent procurement problem was the import bans
on a large majority of spare parts used in the jute industry. Every time BJMC
wanted to award contract to a foreign bidder for a part on the banned list, it'
had to get a waiver from the government. This was a very time consuming process
involving a number of ministries. After numerous discussions between IDA and
the .overnment, a blanket waiver was finally obtained in the final days of the
project. The nature of the project--procurement of thousands of different types
of spore parts over a number of years--resulted in procurement being split into
thousands of small lots. Rough estimate suggests that average order size was
13gs than US$5,000.  This slowed up considerably the disbursement (para 4.28).

4.27    Of the US$20 million credit proceeds, US$8.88 million was used to pur-
chase spares and materials, US$130,000 for the purchase of weighing scales,
$4.61 million was spent on preventive maintenance, US$480,000 for civil works,
US$80,000 for consultancy services, and US$5.82 million was cancelled
(Table 4.2).

Because of lack of counterpart funds and foreign excharve, BJMC used extensively
IDA's QAR (Qualified Agreement to RLeimburse) procedures for procuring impo-ted
and domestic spares. Up until the establishment of a Special Account in Foreign
Exchange (SAFE) in December 1985, IDA processed about 2,000 QARs. To enable
faster disbursement and reduce IDA's work load, agreement was reached between
IDA and GOB in April 1985 to establish a SAFE account. Since this was the first
time a procedure of this nature was introduced in Bangladesh, it took over a
year for the account to become operational and for all GOB agencies (Bangladesh
Bank, Finance, Commercial Banks and BJMC) to agree on the procedures. During
this one year period, IDA regrettably decided not to process any QAR application
below US$10,000, and in effect all disbursements came to a standstill. By the
time the SAFE was fully operational, the project closing was only a few months
away. Even after the SAFE became operational, Bangladesh Bank's conservative
approach--not allowing BJMC to open L/C's over and above the funds available
in the SAFE, even through these L/C's would be covered by undisbursed credit
funds--slowed down the procurement. Moreover, since SAFE funds could be used
for financing of local expenditures, GOB cut-off ADP allocations. Given J1JMC's
tight liquidity problems, it could not allocate local funds from its own resour-
ces and therefore further delays were introduced.   See Annex 7, p. 16.
4.29    Other problems causing delay in disbursements i :clude the dispute
between the denationalized mills and BSB/BSRS, which carded in the cancellation
of US$4.25 million of the credit.

A.  Operational Performance
5.01    Overall the performance of the mill sector has been dismal - the sector
is worse off now than it was at the time of appraisal. The deterioration in
performance is a cumulative impact of the following: excess employment and
excess capacity, wage increases completely out of line with that justifiabLe on
commercial grounds, poor management, instability of raw jute supply and prices,
weak export demand and prices, BJMC's lack of operational autonomy, and the very
poor financial structure resulting from continuous losses. It is impossible to
relate the performance to either the effects of each of the above individual
factors or to the interventions by the project. While efficiency of individual
machines has improved, the impact of this has been negligible on the overall
performance. Performance in each oF the different areas is discussed below.



-18-
Civen the lack of adequate detailed information on the private sector mills,
most of the analysis below is based on the public sector, which in any case was
the major beneficiary of the project.
5.02    Productivity, Efficiency and Wastage.  The Tables 5.1 and 5.2 below
compares current spinning and weaving productivity, efficiency and wastage (2
year averages) to the pre-project era, and to appraisal estimates. It is based
on data from 10 BJMC mills, which account for about 70% of BJMC production. As
the tables indicate, there is hardly any noticeable change in productivity,
efficiency and wastage reduction after implementation of the project. In almost
all cases, the productivity and efficiency have not met the appraisal estimates.
Paradoxically, even though most of the project investments were directed towards
rehabilitating the spinning machinery, the spinning performance in a number of
cases has declined possibly reflecting effect of other factors, e.g., power
breakdowns, poor management and labor skills, etc.

BJMA Mills           6.8                   18.2          7.0
In general, it appears that BJMA mills are performing somewhat better than BJMC
mill.
5.04    Overall Production.  Production in the FY85-86 period was about 13X
lower than the FY79-80 levels.
5.05    Employee Productivity.  At appraisal, BJMC was overmanned; it still
continues to be overmanned. In India, the number of workers per loom average
2.7, while in Ban,'adesh it is 3.3. Despite the fact that production has
declined over th- Last few years, employment in BJMC has increased. The Table
5.4 below indicates output per worker over this period. During FY84-86, BJMC's
and BJMA's productivity per worker have declined when compared to that in of
FY79-80. Overall, BJMA has outperformed BJMC's mills.

B. Overall Profitability
5.06    Since FY72, the jute mill sector made profits in only 3 out of 14 years.
The profitability of the mills are affected by a complex array of factors:
export prices, raw jute prices, labor costs, financial charges, production
losses due to labor disputes/power failures, etc. The key factors are raw jute
and labor costs which accounts for about 50-60X and 25-30Z of the costs
respectively. In the three years that the jute mills were profitable (FY80-81



-21-
and FY83), both the world jute prices were favorable and raw jute costs low.
Between FY80-86, the mill sector's cumulative losses were about Tk 3.9 billion.
5.07    The table below (Table 5.5) provides an index comparison of unit sales
and cost indices (FY76 - 79 = 100) over the period FY76-79 and FY83-86; three
year averages have been taken to smooth out year to year changes.

/a  Each item as X of unit sales price.
/b Production cost is i-sed as proxy for cost of sales.
5.08    The table highlights the following:
(a) Overall, cost of sales have risen faster than unit sales price,
despite the fact that jute price increases have been less t1aan
that of sales price. The much higher increases in wages and other
costs more than offset the gains from lower rise in jute prices.
Estimated losses (sales price minus cost of sales) increased from
about 12% of sales in FY76-79 to 16% (BJMC) and 13% (BJMA) in
FY1984-86.
(b) BJMA has outperformed BJMC, particularly in keeping wage costs
in control. BJMC wages and salaries increased by about 72% com-
pared to 37% in the case of BJMA. This was probably achieved by
the private mills through reduction in labor rather than wages
over which they have less control.



-22-
(c) Other costs have also increased disproportionately. A large part
of the increase is due to higher power costs (due to higher
tariffs and more frequent power breakdown) and higher interest
costs (because of higher interest rates and continuous increases
in liabilities resulting form financing of losses by borrowings).
5.09    Ex-Post Rate of Return.  Ex-post financial and economic internal rates
Af return have not been computed because: ti) it is impossible to separate the
impact of BMR from the positive (adverse) impact of the other contributing
Eactors which affect the mills' performances; and (ii) since there is no reli-
able productivity/production data on rehabilitated and unrehabilitated machines,
it is also not possible to undertake cost benefit analysis of the rehabilitation
investments at the machine level.
C. Institution Building
5.10    The project components designed to strengthen the institutional aspects
of the mills sector such as the reorganization of BJMC/mills, MIS, Jute Strategy
Cell, financial accounting, budgeting, and process accounting have not achieved
their objectives. The MIS implemented under this credit is operational, but the
data it receives is unchecked and often unreliable. The audit backlog was
cleared up but audit reservations were carried forward year after year without
remedial actions, consequently, defeating the ultimate purpose of the audits.
The Jute Strategy Cell is in operation but its contribution and impact have been
marginal. Doubts have been raised over the appropriateness of having the cell
within line ministries because of difficulty of attracting qualified staff and
different nature of work of line ministries. The training center is perhaps the
more successful component of this credit. Despite its share of problems, since
FY85 it has trained some 990 officers and 2,110 staff/workers in the mill
sector.
VI. IDA'S ROLE
6.01    Given the critical importance of the jute sector in the economy, IDA
has been actively supporting efforts to improve its performance. Starting from
the mid-1970s, three Import Program Credits provided urgently needed foreign
exchange for mill rehabilitation and maintenance, and included institution
building efforts. In bringing the sector out of the precarious condition it was
in after liberation, IDA played a crucial role. Industry's performance improved
quite substantially e.g. annual average production in the late 1970s was 15%
higher than the early 1970s.
6.02    In the decade of the 80s, IDA continued its efforts, mainly through this
project, and the preparation of the jute sector report; in addition substantial
attention was given to the sector in the country economic reports. While the
thrust of IDA's attention was urgently needed rehabilitation and repairs in the
decade of the 70s, in the 80s the focus shifted to strategic and long-term
issues and the more difficult areas of policy and institutional reforms. IDA's



-23-
key contribution was highlighting, and making recommendations on issues critical
to long-term survival: improving competitiveness and efficiency of mill sector
through upgrading of BJMC and giving it more autonomy, privatization, reducing
excess employment, capacity restructuring, human resource development; reducing
instability of the raw jute supply and price; establishing capacity within the
government to undertake policy studies and analysis on key issues. While IDA's
contributions have been successful in raising the awareness of policy makers
on these issues, success in terms of actions has been limited.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01    In summary, the project neither met nor came close to meeting its
objectives. The impact of the project has been disappointing, and it appears
to have done nothing more than tinkering on the margin. The project focussed
too mnuch on repairing machinery and too little on the broader issue that the
industry's ability to compete was highly impaired because there was overmanning,
mills had inadequate autonomy and there was excess capacity. Important lessons
have been learned from this experience of failure, which are discussed below.
7.02    Improving Productivity in a Declining Industry.  The project took a
'shot gun' and extensive approach - 3,700 machines over 66 mills - to improving
industry performance. While this approach maybe suitable for a growth industry,
it is certainly not appropriate for a declining industry unless issues of
capacity rationalization and exiting of inefficient firms are tackled first.
Not only is there significant excess capacity (30-40%), but also a few mills
(accounting for about 30% of the BJMC capacity) are extremely inefficient and
have abnormally high conversion costs. A more cost-effective and beneficial
strategy would be to prepare a master restructuring plan that will enable the
sector to produce jute goods at the lowest possible cost. This master plan
should develop the least cost production plan given the existing structure of
industry which will include, among others, closure of a few high cost mills,
rehabilitation of other mills, shifting the production to low cost mills and/or
changing the production mix among different mills. The final decision will
depend on the costs involved in alternative options. Without such a clear and
well defined restructuring plan, marginal attempts to improve the technical
efficiency of individual machines will not improve the competitive position of
the jute industry. The high costs--lost exports, large budgetary subsidies--of
suboptimal operations are undermining the country's growth.
7.03    On a broader level, the failure highlights the importance of efficient
exit policies to maintaining the competitive position of industries. In case of
the jute mill sector, inefficient firms were artificially propped up by con-
tinual financial support from the budget and the financial institutions and also
exit was made more difficult by rigidities in the organized labor markets.  A
few inefficient mills are adversely affecting the future economic growth of the
nation, not only by undermining the competitiveness of the jute mill sector but
also by setting a bad precedent for the rest of the industrial sector which also
may seek the same kind of artificial support to avoid adjustment. The longer



-24-
closure and exiting of uneconomic mills is avoided, the more costly - in
financial, economic and social terms--it will become.  The sizeable action
required now is the result of avoiding a series of marginal actions and adjust-
ments over the last 10-15 years.
7.04    Improving Performance of Public Enterprises.  Lack of autonomy is a big
handicap in operating profitably, particularly in a product market where profit
margins are very thin and tight control on costs is necessary for survival.  Key
cost factors - wages, employment, raw jute prices, and ability to allocate sales
to lowest cost mills - were totally out of control of BJMC and mill managers.
Under these circumstances, improvements in machines are unlikely to translate
into overall improvements. A very important lesson learned from this project
(and IDA's two textile projects which also focussed on the public sector firms)
is that machinery upgrading and technical restructuring of public sector firms
is not likely to be successful unless real breakthrough is made in the areas of
autonomy and management accountability. In retrospect the project did not give
adequate attention to reforms in the environmental setting of BJMC.
7.05    Undertaking Policy Studies in a Bureaucratic Setting.  The project
included a laudable effort at building up a policy analysis capacity within the
government - the results are dismal. The reasons are mauy but the chief one
appears to be that bureaucratic environment and culture is incompatible with
research work. Research is not the main function of a typical line ministry and
therefore government staff, particularly the good ones, do not consider it in
their career interest to work in research units. Secondly, the government
salaries are inadequate to attract specialists. Thirdly, the working environ-
ment and culture of a typical line ministry is dramatically different from a
research setting. A more appropriate model for developing a policy studies cell
needs to be examined.
7.06    It is particularly disconcerting that so few resources are spent on
policy analysis or strategic research on jute, despite the fact that it is one
of the most important sector in the economy. There is need to establish a Jute
Policy Research Institute which works full time on strategic and policy issues
and is adequately funded to attract high quality professionals (economists,
business graduates, financial analysts, manufacturing specialists, agricultural
specialists, etc.).
7.07    Institution-building and Appropriateness of Covenants.  The project
included various institution-building efforts and related covenants. The
experience has shown that unless there is strong commitment to change at the
government and institutional level, interventions in this direction are bound
to fail. Either at the government level or at BJMC there was always a reason
for inaction. An indication of the lack of concern for institution building
is the excessive changes in BJMC management--9 chairmen over 15 years. It has
now- become clear that not only government but also BJMC were apathetic to the
deteriorating conditions, and institutional reforms were not given much
importance. Under these circumstances unless there is strong evidence of com-
mitment to change, projects should include significant changes prior to



-25-
implementation rather than studies and agreements on changes at some future
date.
7.08    Other Lessons.  In addition to the above broader lesson, the following
specific issues have been highlighted:
(a) The SAFE account was introduced towards the latter stage of the
project. The timing and way it was handled adversely affected
implementation. Just when the project staff became fully conver-
sant with IDA procedures, the procedures were changed. IDA
assumed that since SAFE procedure was so attractive, its implemen-
tation would be swift. Consequently, IDA discontinued use of old
procedures not realizing that adapting government's internal
financial rules and procedures to SAFE procedures was going to be
time consuming. As a result, for almost one year, disbursements
were held up. Change in procedures need to be carefully thought
through and adequate time needs to be given for its
implementation.
(b) A project of this nature is very difficult to manage, supervise,
monitor and evaluate, unless it includes an effective and reliable
system for detailed monitoring. Under the project while BJMC and
the mills established a monitoring system and gathered a fairly
large amount of information on the various aspects of the project,
the reliability of this information is weak. IDA disbursement
records were not maintained on a mill-by-mill basis, and as a
result, no cross checking can be done between IDA and BJMC records
of expenditures at the mill level.
'c) The assessment of needed spares was conducted over a three year
period, 1976 to 1979, and there was no updating of these require-
ments during project implementation to take into account changes
in requirements resulting from change in product mix, updated
condition of machinery, etc.
VIZI. RESTRUCTURING OF THE JUTE MILL SECTOR
8.01    The future of the jute sector will significantly influence the rate of
economic growth that Bangladesh can afford in the coming decade. While remain-
ing by far the most important source of foreign exchange earnings accounting for
half of all exports, it has paradoxically become a large financial drain on the
economy; losses of the jute mills totaled Tk 2.5 billion in FY86, equivalent to
0.5Z GDP. There are two sets of issues that must be resolved if the sector is
to corzribute to Bangladesh's development. First, how can the structural
instability in world and domestic markets be ameliorated? Second, how can the
longer term competitiveness of the sector be improved so that Bangladesh can
capitalize on its low costs and good quality jute in world markets? While



-26-
progress vill require significant policy changes and a major reorientation of
institutions to improve their effectiveness, it would also entail substantial
social costs and sizable financial investments over an extended period.
8.02    In stabilizing the markets, immediate priority should be given to the
collection, monitoring and dissemination of adequate information on the jute
market conditions. Direct intervention by the government is also required in
the form of tax/subsidy policies and public buffer stock operations. The
improvement of raw jute marketing, improved storage facilities and sizable
financial resources would be needed. In addition, strategic and policy research
needs to be substanrially strengthened and enhanced. These issues are discussed
in greater length in IDA's Jute sector report (para. 2.15).
8.03    Current jute goods rated production capacity (up to 1 million tons per
annum) is far in excess of demand in the short-term (525,000 tons), and even in
the long term (700,000 tons). Preliminary analysis of costs among different
mills under BJMC indicates that there is a difference of almost 351 in total
costs betwaen high and low cost mills. In terms of labor costs alone the dif-
ference is more than 301. Furthermore, two of the highest cost mills control
some 25Z of BJMC jute goods production. The conversion costs of these two mills
are higher by 401 (BJMC) and 531 (BJ8A) of the lowest cost BJMC/BJMA mills.
Govertment will have to develop a master restructuring plan that will address
the following issues:
(a) First the real determinants of differences in conversion cost
(especially labor cost) among different plants have to be
established. In this area, it is important to establish the
relative contribution of overmanning, type of machinery and
capacity utilization on cost differences;
(b) On the basis of identified determinants of cost differences, a
least cost program of action prepared to reduce the conversion
costs on the basis of projected demand for jute goods. The
options such as mill closures, elimination of escess labor through
attrition and/or termination grants, physical rehabilitation, and
changes in the output mix should be evaluated and their costs and
benefits should be estimated.
8.04    In addition to the physical restructuring program, rationalizing the
sector woultd also require further injection of equity and debt restructuring.
Also, GOB policies (autonomy of public mills, wage determination, etc.) that
inhibit the performance of the mills need to be amended to enable the mill
sector to be competitive in the world markets. Thus, a revitalization package
would have to incorporate GOB policy reforms, physical and financial
restructuring.
8.05    The denationalization of the jute mill sector has produced two sig-
nificant outcomes: (a) the performance of private mills' appears somewhat
better than mills under BJMC, and (b) market forces have begun the restructuring



-27-
of private sector mills with the full and partial closure of four mills. The
shutdown was a result of financial difficulties. Some 4Z of industry capacity
and about 5Z of employment in the mill sector has been affected. Given the huge
liabilities of all the BJMA mills, more mills may close. Ironically, the market
forces are closing down mills in the private sector that are probably more
efficient that those in the public sector. Therefore, it is crucial that the
restructuring should be well designed so that the economy ends up with the most
efficient production structure.

of the jamtt mills are operating Li,ird shift in order
to meet the requirenent of yarn for weaving produc-

of preventive mainteniance, the concerned jute mills
provided taka over frem their oun sources and not
from ADP because this was not covered under
deveoopiaent financing. Out of total allocatius of
USS 8.807 million actual diabursement made for
USS 4.9'2 million. The balance could not he utiliued
partly because of donationalisation of juto millo
and partly for time limitation/shortage of fund in
SAVE  a Cccount/counterpart fund in the mills to
finance import of spare parts excoding to thelir
requirement before closing of the credit.
