INTERNAT:IOXN  BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND REGOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A P[OEIOSED LOAN TO
THE REPJRLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE
CORDOBA 2 AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PRJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$21 million to
help finance an agricultural development project in the Cordoba Department.
The loan would have a term of 30 years, including six years of grace, with
interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. A portion of the Bank loan would be
used to provide investment credit to farmers on five- to 12-year terms, at
16 percent interest per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia 696-CO) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 28, 1975. Country data sheets are provided in Annex I.
3.        Since 1967 Gross Domestic Product has increased by an average 6.5
percent per annum in real terms, well above the historical average of less
than 5 percent (1950-67), and real per capita GNP has increased by an average
annual 3.2 percent. During this period, substantial structural transforma-
tion has taken place in the Colombian economy, and the country is now well
advanced in the transition from a predominantly rural,.agricultural, and
largely self-contained economy to an urban industrial economy, more oriented
towards expanding international trade.  Broadening of the country's pro-
ductive base has been accompanied by development of a modern sector which
relies to a considerable extent on imported inputs. Merchandise exportshave
increased three-fold since 1967 and, most significantly, non-traditional
exports have become a more important source of foreign exchange earnings
than coffee, increasing from 27 percent of merchandise exports to over 50
percent in 197h. Such improvements are very much needed in order to accel-
erate employment generation and to raise per capita income, currently US$500,
one of the lowest in Latin America, to a more acceptable level; despite the
rapid development of Colombia over the past seven years, it remains essen-
tially a poor country with a relatively small modern sector superimposed on
a large, traditional, and poor base.
4.        Colombia also needs to spread the benefits from growth more widely
in order to surmount problems of poverty and population pressures in both
rural and urban areas. Concentration of land ownership, technical backward-
ness, and under-employment characterize most rural areas. In urban areas,
pressures of population growth, compounded by heavy migration from the country-
side, have generated serious unemployment and a severe housing deficit. Pros-
pects for coping with these problems seem brighter as a result of the accel-
erated growth upon which the Colombian economy has embarked in the past several
years.



5.        Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural poverty
and urban unemployment in a more systemtic fashion than in the past, but
much remains to be done. In spite of the passage of an Agrarian Reform Law
and the creation of an Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA) in 1961, only
modest results have been achieved in alleviating rural poverty. Additional
legislation has been enacted which lays a better basis for land reform but
much remains to be done to raise income in rural areas. In recognition of
the problems of urban concentration and unemployment, Colombia's previous
Government placed greater emphasis on urban development, particularly in
the housing field, but despite such action unemployment continued to increase
in most of Colombia's major urban centers. The new Government, which took
office in August 1974, is striving to sustain a high rate of economic growth
while simultaneously attempting to achieve a more equitable distribution of
its benefits, inter alia, through expansion of employment opportunities and
increased investment in education, health and agriculture. There is more
emphasis on the development of agriculture and industry, and less reliance
on the urban construction sector to provide a stimulus to economic growth.
Export diversification continues to be a major component of development
strategy and the Government is currently rationalizing the export promotion
system.
6.        Colombia's post-war experience suggest that strengthening of the
fiscal system is a necessary first step to achieving the Government's
objectives.   Shortfalls in revenues resulted in chronic public finance
deficits which were major sources of inflation and impeded expansion of
infrastructure investment and social programs vital to acceleration of de-
velopment.   Tax buoyancy declined sharply in the 1973-74 period as a
result of the negative impact on Government revenue of the increased use of
tax benefits for exporters and because of administrative deficiencies.
With the exception of 1972, when there was a sharp jump in National Govern-
ment investment spending made possible by a three-fold increase in external
borrowing, deterioration of public finances has been reflected in a declining
level of investment by the National Government which dropped from an average
4 percent of GDP in the 1967-72 period to 3.4 percent in 1973-7h. The de-
terioration of the National Government's financial performance had been Accom-
panied by weakening of the capacity of the rest of the public sector (depart-
mental and municipal government and public enterprises) to mobilize domestic
resources and execute investment. In order to overcome these problems, the
new Government implemented a tax reform of major proportions in the last four
months of 197h. The reform covers almost every important component of the
tax system and represents a clear and significant improvement on nearly all
counts. While the reform did not serve to purge the revenue system com-
pletely of pre-existing defects, it stands as a landmark in the recent
history of such undertakings, both among developing and developed nations.
This is evidence that the rate of inflation, which averaged 25 percent in
1974, may now be declining somewhat.
7.        The major immediate economic problem is the weakened export
position. During 1970-73 Colombia had little difficulty in obtaining
the foreign exchange necessary to finance its development from rising
exports and a large inflow of foreign capital. In 1974, however, import
payments increased sharply, world coffee prices fell, the external capi-
tal inflow to the public sector was reduced and Colombia financed a
portion of its external resource gap by drawing down its foreign exchange



-s_.-v-   0:.  lal resseries decl ned by $87 iriL L>:n by year end,
leavoinu  .ne cc untry with reserves of $429 millior  sufficient to cover
about hz-e months of goods and non-factor servic_6 imports at the expected
1975 rate.  Preliminary estimates for 1975 indicate a balance of payments
deficit of some US$200 million which will require an increase in borrowing
from foreign financial intermediaries. The Gove=-rent is aware of the danger
posed by the weakening in the balance of payments, and since taking office in
mid-August has more than doubled the rate of depreciation of the peso, under
Colombia's flexible exchange rate policy, in an effort to hold down the
rapid growth of imports and sustain adequate incentives to exporters.
In addition the Government took measures to stabilize the economy inter
alia by introducing a fundamental reform of the country's financial
system, and is facing the need to strike a careful balance between faci-
litating a reasonable level of imports and maintaining an adequate level
of reserves without incurring too large a volume of suppliers' credits
and other short- and medium-term financial obligations. The Government
also recognizes that appropriate measures are required to increase petroleum
production so as to reverse the recent trend toward Colombia's becoming
a net importer of crude oil.
8.        Management of the Colombian economy in 1975-76 will be a
complex task, since there is the danger that contractionary forces
already set in motion by the Government's stabilization program could
be amplified by recessionary pressures from abroad. It is alread.- clear
that GDP growth during this period will be below the average of 1970-7h
and that the balance-of-payments situation will be considerably weaker.
The new economic team is aware that the economy is going through a period
of transition in which the situation could change rapidly, and is follow-
wing policies aimed at reducing inflation, =inimizing the contraction in
the rate of growth of output and employment, and protecting the level of
foreign exchange reserves. In addition, the Government is anxious to
step up its development effort. Simultaneous accomplishment of these goals
would require increases in domestic saving and investment and substantial
inflows of foreign capital.
9.        The long-term development challenge as seen by the Government
is to return the economy to the higher rates of growth achieved in the
recent past and provide increased employment opportunities and a broader
distribution of the benefits of economic growth to all segments of the
population. The Government has already achieved considerable success in
enacting fundamentel monetary and fiscal reform which should provide the
framework for increased saving and a more efficient allocation of that
saving into investment opportunities. It is now turning its attention
to achieving the goals of rapid growth and a more equitable distribution
of its benefits through initiation of a development program aimed at
accelerating agricultural and industrial growth, at increasing the parti-
cipation of the most deprived regions of the country in the development
process, at improving the productivity of the poorest population groups
through better education and nutrition, and at continuing the export
diversification drive. Special emphasis is being placed on expansion
of employment opportunities and increased investment in education, health,



-14-
and nutrition programs aimed at benefiting the poorest 50 percent of
the population.
10.       Ln order to achieve the Pafore-mentioned objectives, Colombia
will require, over the six calendar years 1975-1980, gross external
official financing totalling about $4.5 billion, of which some $600
million will be disbursed from commitments made through the end of 1971X.
The remaining $3.9 billion must be financed by new comiutments which
should average about $900 million a year- Of the latter amount, about
half would be obtained from suppliers' credits, foreign bond sales, and
borrowings from comnercial banks, and the other half through loans from
public bilateral and multilateral agencies.
11.       Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.8 billion at the end of 197h, or US$2.2 billion excluding
undisbursed commitments. The Bank's share of this external debt (dis-
bursed only) as of end 1974 was about 26 percent, but this share is ex-
pected to decline to 22 percent in 1978 as Colombia relies to a greater
extent on other external borrowing. Service on this debt was a modest 14
percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1974; exports have risen more
rapidly than debt service in recent years, and there has been a decrease
in the debt service ratio at a time when economic growth has accelerated.
The debt service ratio is expected to rise moderately and peak in the
early 1980's at about 20 percent as a result of greater capital inflows
associated with a high growth rate. The Bank's share of total debt service
is expected to peak at about 28 percent in 1975 and. is likely to decline to
18 percent by 1978. Should economic growth continue at a rapid pace, which
appears feasible, and should that growth be accompanied by a further strong
expansion of non-coffee exports and the maintenance of sound economic and
financial policies, Colombia should find it possible to secure the amounts
of external capital it needs and to service the indebtedness that this
borrowing would generate. Some of this capital will have to be provided to
finance local costs if total foreign assistance is to be large enough to
enable the country to cover its resource gap on appropriate terms and
maintain its rate of economic growth at an acceptable level.



PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIOMJS IN COLOIBIA
12.       The proposed loan--the 61st to be made to Colombia--would
bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,168.2 million
(net of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, US$881.1 million
is now held by the Bank, excluding one loan of US$19.5 million which
is not yet effective.  IDA has made one credit of US$1965 million for
highways in Colombia in 1961.
13.       Disbursements have been completed on 33 loans and the one IDA
credit. IFC has made effective investments and underwriting commitments
in 21 enterprises in Colombia, totalling about US$30.2 million of which
IFC now holds US$16.6 million. Annex II contains a sumnuary statement of
Bank loans, the IDA credit, and IFC investments as of April 30, 1975,
and notes on the execution of the 27 on-going projects.

14.       Since FY68, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified
than in earlier -ears. All three loans in the education sector have been
made since then as were five of the nine agricultural loans, five of the
six loans in the water supply sector and four of the loans for industry.
This compares with seven loans since FY68 in the sectors where the Bank
has been traditionally active, i.e., power and transport. Bank efforts
have been focused on production-oriented activities and activities which
carry social as well as economic benefits. Projects being developed will
seek to combine the objectives of increasing output and exports, with
maximum benefits in terms of employment and improving the income of the
poor, particularly in rural areas.
15.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing
contribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with particular
emphasis on projects involving small and medium size farmholdings and
industrial enterprises. The other major focus of our activities would
be in such social sectors as urban development and water supply. We
would continue to support projects in the tradi-tional sectors of Bank
lending--electric power and transportation--in those cases where support
is required for necessary institutional development. Projects are
currently in an advanced stage of preparation for industrial finance and
agricultural credit.
16.       Given the importance of sustaining a high growth rate in agri-
culture and the magnitude of the rural poverty problem in Colombia, there
is an urgent need for further Bank lending in the agricultural sector with
the dual objective of increasing output and raising the productivity and
income of small-scale farmers. We have moved increasingly into the
agricultural sector in the recent past, and we expect to make a sub-
stantial further expansion over the next few years, with perhaps as
much as one-fourth of our total lending to be made in the agricultural
sector.
17.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in
Annex I, pages 3-4. While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-fifths of
total external financing to Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their share
has decreased since then. The IDB has assisted projects in low-cost
housing, university education, agrarian reform, ports, electric power,
water supply, transportation, and industry. AID had shifted the emphasis
of its lending in recent years from program to sector loans, particularly
for education, urban development, and agriculture. More recently it has
moved in the direction of small project loans aimed chiefly at the
improvement of income distribution.

PART III: AGRICULTURE IN COLOMBIA
18.       An exceptional regional diversity in soils and climates enables
Colombia to produce a wide range of agricultural commodities for home
consumption and export. In recent years, Government policy has been
successful in encouraging use of the country's potential to diversify
agricultural production and reduce the excessive dependence on coffee.
This, in turn, has contributed to the decline of coffee from about two-
thirc to less than half of total exports. The overall rate of growth
of the agricultural sector averaged 4.6 percent in real terms during
1965-73, as compared with 2.7 percent during the first half of the 1960's.
19.       Despite the recent favorable growth performance, the sector is
confronted with serious structural problems. Agriculture employs 41 per-
cent of the Colombian labor force. While open unemployment in the sector
has been estimated at no more than 4 percent, underemployment and seasonal
unemployment together may raise the overall unemployment average for the
sector to as much as 40 percent. Average per capita income in rural areas
is only half the level of urban incomes, and rural income distribution is
skewed, with the poorest 40 percent of the rural population receiving only
12 percent of total rural income. The distribution of income is related
to the concentration of land ownership: the 1970 census showed that the
largest 10 percent of farms accounted for 80 percent of al1 farm land,
virtually the same as in 1960.
20.       The Colombian authorities have recognized that the problems of
rural poverty and unemployment cannot be solved without a change in the
structure of the agricultural sector through a production-oriented agrarian
reform. Government actions since the establishment of the Instituto
Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INOORA) in 1961 have aimed at lessening
the concentration of land ownership and income through resettlement on
publicly owned lands and on unused private land which has been purchased
by the Government; by providing irrigation and drainage in areas inhabited
chiefly by small farmers; and by granting more land titles to small farmers.
In its irrigation and drainage districts INOORA has attempted, with varying
degrees of success, to impose legal ceilings on the amount of land that
could be retained by one owner once project works were completed. Elsewhere
there has been little outright redistribution of productive land, however.
A new-phase of land reform policies was initiated by the agrarian reform
act of 1973. This bill had two main purposes:    first, to substantially
improve compensation for expropriation of well-cultivated land and thus
dispel insecurity among landowners able to embark upon agricultural invest-
ment programs and, second, to make it easier for INCORA to expropriate.



21.       As the agency responsible for agrarian reform, INCORA has
granted about 135,000 titles to 3.8 million hectares of public lands
and has acquired some 374,000 hectares of privately-owned land of which
190,000 hectares were redistributed to 11,300 families. The public
lands are mainly in new frontier regions such as the Llanos and Caqueta.
Sixteen irrigation and drainage projects, including some resettlement
and small-farm improvement, have been initiated, covering some 500,000
hectares. In addition, amendment of the Agrarian Reform Law in 1968 made
it possible for sharecroppers and tenant farmers to claim title to the
land they farm, and nearly 8Q(X)0 of them have applied to INCORA. Of
these, some 45,000 have had their claims recognized.
22.       To raise the productivity of small hoLdings requires substantial
inputs of technical assistance and credit. The IDB, through loans for the
Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA), and AID, through its agricultural
sector loans, have provided financing for improvements in research and
extension services. AID also devoted a substantial portion of its agri-
cultural sector loans to supervised credit for INCORA beneficiaries; while
these sector loans have been discontinued, as noted above, the Bank is
currently considering a loan for agricultural credit. Meanwhile, the
Government has directed its agricultural credit policies increasingly
-toward the problem of the small farmers. For example, an analysis of
the lending activity of the Caja Agraria, by far Colombia's largest
agricultural lending institution, shows that in recent years it has been
relaxing collateral requirements and progressively lending more to small
farmers.
23.       The now Lopez administration is attempting to formulate policies
which will give long-range direction to and be supportive of programs in
the rural sector. A central part of this process is the development of a
national nutrition plan which would project the nutritional needs of
Colombia and translate them into commodity needs; a separate plan would
delineate the agricultural export potential of Colombia. Together these
plans will give focus to both rural development and crop diversification
efforts.

PART IV: THE PROJECT
2h.       In September 1972, the Government and INCORA requested Bank
assistance in financing the rehabilitation and completion of 16
irrigation and drainage projects begun in earlier years. The request
reflected a Government decision that INCORA should bring ongoing land
development projects to a satisfactory level of development before
initiating new ones. Following discussions with the Bank, agreement was
rea:ched in principle that the Bank would consider financial assistance
for seven of these projects, and Cordoba 2 is the first that was appraised.
The districts are named for the political jurisdictions in which they are
located. The Department of Cordoba borders the Atlantic Ocean east of
Panama and includes the Sinu River Valley.
25.       Feasibility studies for Cordoba 2 were completed by Hunting
Technical Services, Ltd., of England during 1969-71. The project was
appraised by a Bank mission in February/March 1974. Negotiations were
held in Bogota on June 3, 1975 with a Colombian delegation led by
Dr. Cristian Mosquera, Director of Public Credit, Ministry of Finance.
26.       A project appraisal report entitled "Colombia:  Cordoba 2
Agricultural Development Project" (No. 596-Co, dated June 6, 1975 )
is being circulated separately to the Executive D±rectors. The main
features of the loan and the project are summarized in Annex III h9reto.
Project Description
27.       The project aims at the rehabilitation and completion of the
Cordoba 2 Project where INCORA has been engaged in drainage development
and agrarian reform during the past several years. It goes, however,
beyond the rehabilitation and completion of drainage works and includes
a fund to provide credit to farmers, the organization of district-level
extension services, and the improvement of services to rural communities
(education, health, water supply, electrification, and telecommunications).
28.       Project works would consist of the completion of the drainage
system on 40,000 hectares, and land leveling on 20,000 hectares to eliminate
both permanent and temporary flooding. Under the project about 6,000
hectares of permanently flooded land would be reclaimed for rainfed
agriculture and this, together with 7,800 hectares of land held in excess
of 50 hectares per existing farm to be acquired by INCORA under existing
land reform laws, would be used to settle about 1,000 families on tracts
of 10 to 15 hectares in community enterprises (Empresas Comunitarias). 1/
New settlers would be selected within the Cordoba region, where there are
many landless families. Project works would consist of construction of
primary and secondary drains (514 km), a flood protection dike and collector
canal (6.8 km), all-weather roads (168 km), culverts, bridges, and other
structures (24), fencing (342 km) and rehabilitation and enlargement of the
project headquarters buildings. Assurance were obtained from Government that:
j/ This is a form of organization favored by INCORA in which families
gain ownership of individual plots but work them in common.



- 10 -
(a) within 18 months of the date of loan effectiveness, a phased program
for completion of the existing plans for land acquisition and distribution
in the project area would be prepared by INOORA; and (b) this program
would be carried out according to an agreed timetable during the implemen-
tation period of the project.  (Section 2.09 of draft Project Agreement in
relation to Part E of the Project).
29.       On-farm development would consist of land leveling, construction
of tertiary drainage canals and access roads. Land leveling is
required as a drainage measure to reduce temporary ponding, and the
20,000 ha of leveling would be on 2,800 small farms of less than 12
hectares, as land improvement has already been completed on a major part
of the larger farms. On-farm development on the small farms of less than
12 hectares would be financed from a development credit fund to be esta-
blished under the project.
30.       Project construction and development are expected to require
five years. Direct economic benefits would accrue to some 3,800 farm
families, including some 2,000 INCORA-settled families of which 1,000
would be newly settled under the project.  The project would increase
the production of cot-ton, soybeans, maize, tomatoes, sorghum, beans,
and sesame.
Project Execution
31.       INCOORA will exercise overall responsibility for the project
and will carry out the constr`iction1 of project works, land acquisition
and settlement, the operation and maintenance of project works, and
technical and financial assistance to farmers. It is represented in
the project area by an office with some 30 technicians.
32.       INCORA will manage the development credit fund to be created
under the project which will permAit the provision of medium- and long-term
credit to small farmers, both INCORA settlers and others, for on-farm
development, purchase of farm machinery, construction of infrastructure on
livestock farms and purchase of breeding stock. Credit in the Cordoba 2
area is now largely limited to short-term production loans for larger
farmers. In respect of the new development credit fund, the Caja Agraria
will be the banking agent for fICORA under an agreement to be signed
between INCORA and Caja (Section 2.02(a) of the draft Project Agreement).
Signing of the agreement will be a condition of loan effectiveness
(Section 6.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
33.       To insure adequate technical assistance to farmers, an extension
service will be created under INCORA's supervision and administration,
with INCORA paying salaries and other operating costs. Systematic
farm planning and the introduction of improved technology will be
emphasized by the extension effort, which will complement research
and extension services already being provided in the area by public and
private entities.  Extension agents will be recruited and trained by ICA,



- Li -
-?    Ji   the :_atro In+ernacional de Agricultu-a Tropical (CIAT), and
4 and ClAD will provide technical guidance to the extension agents based
on their research programs in the Cordoba 2 area. Signature of an agree-
ment between INCORA and ICA concerning the extension service will be a
condition of loan effectiveness (Section 2.02(b) of the draft Project
Agreement and Section 6.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
34.       As previously noted, the project aims at integrated and balanced
development in the Cordoba 2 area. Social service improvements, which ex-
clude the larger urban centers within or adjacent to the project area, will
include construction of 210 new classrooms and rehabilitation of 100 exist-
ing schools; construction of six new health centers al. rehabilitation of
six existing ones; improvement and expansion of the two principal hospitals
serving the project area; provision of equipment, materials and supplies
for schools, health centers and hospitals; construction of water supply
systems in 11 villages; electrical distribution systems in four villages;
and telecommunications systems for four villages. All of the 220 primary
schools in the project area would be provided with an improved curriculum
and teaching materials. The foregoing activities would be carried out by
the Ministries of Communications, Education, Health, and Public Works and
their dependent entities, with which INCORA would renew or sign operational
agreements within six months of the loan becoming effective (Section 2.02(c)
of the draft Project Agreement). Such agreements would assure timely exe-
cution of each project element by the responsible Ministry or agency, pro-
vision of operating personnel, and coverage through the Ministry's budget
of annual operating and maintenance costs.
35.       The project would include consultant services to assist INCORA
with on-farm development, for establishing the extension service, strengthen-
ing its organization and accounting procedures, and to assist in the estab-
lishment of a system for assessing and collecting charges on beneficiaries
to recover investment as well as operation and maintenance costs. Such
consultants would be selected and employed by INCORA in consultation with
the Bank and under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (Sec-
tions 2.03 and 3.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
36.       Estimated project cost would be US$35.7 million, including physical
and price contingencies and US$3.3 million of interest on the proposed loan
during-the five-year implementation period. The loan would finance 59 per-
cent of project costs, including all the estimated foreign exchange costs
of US$16.9 million (47 percent of total project cost), plus US$4.1 million
of estimated local costs. Local-cost financing is justified on the grounds
indicated in paragraph 11 above. The balance of the local costs, estimated
to be the equivalent of US$14.7 million (1,1 percent of total project cost),
would be financed by the Government.

Project Charzes
37.       In the past, INCORA has imposed operating and mainteniance
charges on beneficiaries of irrigationi and drainage projects. However,
with the completion of Cordoba 2, DiCORA would be in a positior. for the
first time to also impose charges for recovery of investments, since by
law such charges can be levied in a district only when all planned works
have been finished and full service has been made available to all
beneficiaries. Assurances were obtained that a system of project charges
consistent with the foregoing would be progressively introduced, as works
are completed and project lands come into full production, at levels
sufficient to cover actual operation and maintenance costs, and recover
over a period of no more than 20 years from, the fanners using project
works at least 80 percent of total capital investment in project works,
Total capital investment by law is defined to include also costs pre-
viously incurred by INCORA in the project area. Recovery charges would
be computed at an interest rate of not less uhan 12 percent per annum.
The aforementioned charges would apply to all farms regardless of size.
However, farmers in the area, other than those settled by INCORA, will
under present law also be paying an- additional valorization tax based on
the increased value of the land as a result of project investment. The
aggregate recovery charges are thus certain to be close to the incremental
capital costs of the new project. (In this comnection, it skould be
noted that upon project completion 84 percent of the cultivated area in
Cordoba 2 would be in farms of less than 12 hectares, and no farm would
exceed 50 hectares). The system of project charges would be periodi-
cally reviewed with the Bank, so as to assure the achievement of the
aforementioned objective (Section 4.03 of the draft Proj-ect Agreement).
RelendinL Terms
38.       A development crecit fund of the equivalent of US$6.0 million
would be created, with the Bank loan financing 95 percent of the fumd's
disbursements and the Government contributing the other 5 percent. Sub-
loans to farmers would have to be repaid within five years in the case of
farm machinery, and within 12 years in the case of on-farm development,
physical facilities for livestock, and purchase of breeding stock. An
interest rate of 16 percent would be charged. This compares with 14 per--
cent presently charged by INCORA under the Planned Credit Program partially
financed by Loan 624-oo. The increase would be in line with the Govern-
ment's policy to bring interest rates to a level which could be expected
to be positive in real terms if, as the Government expects, the rate of
inflation declined substantially in coming years. However, there is
naturally much uncertainty about the prospective rate of inflation, and
the subloan interest rate of 16 percent might well have to be modified
if actual trends are such as to lead the Gcvernment to change the interest
rate regulations affecting agriculture loans currently in force. In such
an eventuality, the proposed interest rate of 16 percent would be subject
to review.  If the Bank and the Borrower cannot agree on new conditions
of lending within six months, new lending would be suspended until such
agreement is reached. (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).

Procurement
39.       Contracts for construction of major project works, including
drainage systems, collector canal, roads, bridges, fencing, and drainage
structures, and purchase of major items of imported equipment would be
procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
"Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits."
Project works would probably be performed under three or four contracts,
with the primary and secondary drainage systems and collector canal
(US$6.5 million) in two contracts and roads, bridges, and fencing (Us$5.6
million) in two. It is expected that most contracts for these project
works would go to local contractors who have the capacity to perform the
work and are already working in the area, and because the overall value
of the contracts would be too low to attract foreign firms. Contracts
for on-farm development (US$3.5 million), for enlarging INCORA's project
headquarters building (US$0.10 million, and for all works for improving
social infrastructure (US$1.8 million) would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local pro-
cedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. Farm machinery and livestock
financed by loans from the agricultural development credit fund (US$2.5
million) and vehicles, equipment, materials and supplies (US$1.1 million)
for the engineering and extension work and improvement of social infra-
structure would be procured locally by INCORA on the basis of not less
than three price quotations. Contracts exceeding US$50,000 would require
the Bank's concurrence prior to award. For procurement of equipment,
materials and supplies under international competitive bidding, domestic
manufacturers would be accorded a margin of preference in bid evaluation
of 15 percent or the actual tariff, whichever is lower.
Disbursement
40.       Proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed to INCORA against
42 percent of expenditures on project works; 70 percent of expenditures
on social infrastructure by the Ministries of Communications, Education,
Health, and Puiblic Works and their agencies; 100 percent of the CIF
cost of directly imported equipment; 80 percent of the cost of imported
goods purchased locally; 95 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally-
produced goods; 95 percent of amounts disbursed by the development credit
fund; 100 percent of the cost of foreign consultant services, and 95 per-
cent of the cost of such services when procured locally.
Marketing
41.       Production increases in the Cordoba 2 area as a result of the
project would, with the exception of cotton and beef, be for crops which
serve as import substitutes for which ample demand exists at prices



- 114 -
adequate to stimulate investment. Cotton and beef are already being
exported by Colombia, and the incremental production resulting from
the project would increase such exports.
Benefits and Justification
42.       The project, located in a prime agricultural district, would
provide direct economic benefits to about 3,800 farm families, 63 percent
of which occupy farms smaller than 12 hectares. Improved community
services would be provided to rural inhabitants totalling some 35,000,
and some additional employment would be generated. The additional
production would contribute to the strengthening of Colombia's balance
of payments.
h3.       The impact of the project on its beneficiaries has been
analyzed for five farm prototypes considered to be representative of
the area. It is estimated that at full development in 1985, 60 percent
of the farm families in the area would have a per capita income above
the upper limit (Us$250) for the poorest 40 percent of the population
in the country, as compared to 10 percent at present. Assuming an average
of six persons per farm family the per capita income would increase from
US$11 to US$49 on sabsistence farms, US$67 to US$263 on small farms,
from US$53 to US$420 on Empresas Comunitarias (10-12 ha farms) and from
US$533 to US$1,255 on farms sized between 15 and 50 ha.
44.       The economic rate of return when costs and benefits are discounted
over a 40-year period has been calculated at 27 percent for the Cordoba 2
project. Social infrastructure was excluded from costs in making this
calculation, and social benefits were also excluded. A shadow rate of
exchange 15 percent higher than the official rate was used to convert
foreign-exchange costs into local currency, in view of the fact that the
actual rate of exchange is maintained with the help of import restric-
tions and export incentives. A shadow wage rate 40 percent lower than
the official minimum wage was used reflecting the serious unemployment
situation in the district. A sensitivity analysis was performed whose
most pessimistic assumptions were a one-year delay in project execution,
a 10 percent increase in investment costs, and a 25 percent decrease in
benefits; this resulted in a 15 percent rate of return.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and INCORA, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article IlI, Section h (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for
loans for agricultural development projects. Special conditions of
effectiveness would be the signature and ratification of an agreement
for the transfer of funds from the Republic of Colombia to INCORA, and
of the agreements referred to above in Paragraphs 32 and 33 between
INCORA and the cooperating Colombian agencies. (Section 6.01 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
h7.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION/-
1.        Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
fully disbursed:
Ln No. 502 Irrigation (Atlantico I); US$9 million, June 1967.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1972;
current - December 31, 1975
2.        While physical works are almost completed, final payments to con-
tractors will not occur until September 1975. The delays in project execution
have been occasioned by poor selection of areas suitable for irrigation,
technical problems in the construction of irrigation and drainage works, and
non-compliance by contractors with established schedules. Agricultural develop-
ment has also been slow, due to poor project management and lack of adequate
supporting services to the farmer. However, INCORA has now appointed a very
capable Project Manager who has brought with him a competent agricultural team
who, it, is believed, have the potential to develop the project satisfactorily
under its less than ideal circumstances. Citrus has now been abandoned as a
project crop. Rice is now proposed as a temporary irrigated crop in order to
allow the leaching of salts from the soil profile. The intensive cropping
pattern needed to justify the investment in irrigation facilities will be
several years in development.
Ln No. 536 Water Supply (Bogota I); US$14 million, June 1968.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1972;
current - December 31, 1975.
3.        As of May 30, 1975, US$13.8 million or 98 percent of this loan has
been disbursed. Notwithstanding that the Project is essentially completed,
the Closing Date was postponed because of delays in procurement and to permit
final payments to suppliers.
Ln No. 575 Electric Power (Interoonnection); US$18 million, December 1968.
Closing date: original - February 29, 1972;
current - December 31, 1975.
4.        The original project was completed and commercially operational in
1971. The Bank agreed that an undisbursed balance could be used to finance a
220kv ibransmission line, Guatape - Barrancabermeja. The cost of the line is
estimated at US$7.2 million of which about US$4.1 million represents the
foreign component. For more than a year, contributions from ISA's shareholders
had been seriously overdue and ISA was unable to pay its contractors on time.
ISA ceased submitting requests for withdrawals from the Bank Loan after October
1974. Recently, most of the overdue payments were made by ISA's shareholders
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

to ISA are exrected to be made within the next two months.
Ln No. 624 Agricultural Credit II; US$17 million, June 1969.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - June 30, 1975
5.        After disappointing performance in the firs-t three years, changes in
project management and organization and an increase in technical personnel
provided the basis in February 1973 for the Bank's agreement to enlarge the
project area and include lending to small farmers under the project. As a
result, the project is now proceeding in a satisfactory manner. Almost all
project funds have now been committed, and disbursements should be completed
by the Closing Date.
Ln No. 651 Livestock II; US$18.3 million, December 1969.
Closing date: July 31, 1975.
6.        After a disappointing performance during the first three years after
signing, 1970-72, CAJA's project administration was reorganized and the project
area was extended to cover the entire country. The project has, since early
1973, progressed satisfactorily. Demand for on-farm investments is high and
disbursements have been accelerating. All loan funds have now been committed,
and disbursements should be completed before the original closing date of
July 31, 1975.
Ln No. 679 Education II; us$6.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - Juna 30, 1973;
current - July 31, 1975.
7.        Major civil works have been completed and all nine project schools
have been in operation since January 1973. However, operation of schools is
below the expected level because of inadequate organization and shortage of
local funds to meet current expenditures. Procurement of equipment and fur-
niture has been delayed. A third postponement of the closing date to
July 31, 1975 was made to permit payments to be made for expenditures arising
from contracts awarded under this project by December 31, 1974. In addition,
the original provision for equipment has exceeded actual needs, and technical
assistance previously envisaged was not required. This has resulted in
savings to the project, and a cancellation of US$1,033,303 was made effective
February 19, 1975
Ln No. 680 Highway VI; US$32 million, June 1970.
Closing date:  original - November 30, 1974;
current - November 30, 1976.
8.        The largest component of the project, the paving program, has ex-
perienced considerable-cost increases and is still experiencing delays. The

Ministry of Public Works has taken many steps (supported by the Bank) which
have reduced, although not avoided, delays and contractor bankruptcies. Due
to cost increases, the Bank's participation in the paving program has been
reduced to 15 percent. The status of the other components of the project is
more satisfactory.
Ln. No. 681 Chivor Hydroelectric Power; US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
9.        The first generating unit for the Chivor Hydroelectric Project is
expected to be put into service in mid-1976, a year behind schedule. The
project's foreign and total costs are expected to be 35 percent higher than
originally estimated. For more than a year, contributions from ISA's share-
holders had been seriously overdue and ISA was unable to pay its contractors
on time. ISA ceased submitting requests for withdrawals from the Bank Loan
after October 1974. Recently, most of the overdue payments were made by
ISA's shareholders and withdrawals from the Loan were resumed. The remaining
overdue payments to ISA are expected to be made within the next two months.
Ln No. 682 Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 197h;
current - December 31, 1975.
10.       As of May 30, 1975, about 65 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to a late project start, but the
entire project is now under execution, and it is expected that construction
activities will be finished by mid-1976 which would require a further exten-
sion of the Closing date. Recently, the Bank has been concerned over
EMCALI's financial situation and has urged that tariffs for water, sewerage
and power be increased promptly.
Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Closing date: original - March 1, 1975;
current - March 1, 1976.
11.       As of May 30, 1975, about 60 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial management and fiscal
problems. A financial crisis in early 1973 was resolved through higher
tariffs and tight budget control. Construction is expected to be terminated
in late 1975.
Ln No. 739 Land Settlement Caqueta I; US$8.1 million, May 1971.
Closing date: December 31, 1975
12.       Because of considerable price increases and unexpectedly difficult
physical problems, project objectives were reduced to about 70 percent of
appraisal targets in August 1973, halfway through the project period.    Since
then,the livestock credit program has picked up speed so that the revised
goal for this component should be achieved ahead of time. On the other hand,
the road construction program has fallen far behind schedule although it is
now proceeding at an accelerated pace. Despite these problems, the project
is making a substantial contribution to the successful colonization of the
Caqueta area.

Ln No. 740 Telecommunications II; US$15 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1975.
13.       Contracts for all Bank-financed goods have been signed and technical
consultants have been retained. However, contracts with financial consultants
have not been signed, and due to initial delavs in the procurement of project
equipment, a slippage of up to 18 months in the completion date of some of the
works in the project is now anticipated. US$2,290,000 remains undisbursed and
TELECOi4 has been informed that it will need to request a postponement of the
Closing Date to allow sufficient time to disburse for items whose procurement
has been delayed.
Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); us$88 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1978.
14.       Disbursements up to May 30, 1975 amounted to 22 percent of this loan,
only 40 percent of the appraisal estimate. Slow progress in the construction
of the vital Palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel - is the main reason for the project's
delay; the previous foreign contractor has been replaced by another firm.
EAAB's financial situation was weak, but important measures to improve it have
been taken by the Empresa.
Ln No. 742 Development Finance Companies IV: US$40 million, May 1971.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1974;
currant - December 31, 1975.
15.       This loan is fully committed.   Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Ln No. 842 Development Program and Export Expansion Project; US$60 million,
June 1972.
Closing date:  original - December 31, 1974;
currant  - December 31, 1975.
16.       The first program loan tranche of US$20 million was promnptly
disbursed, and the first DFC tranche of US$10 million is now almost fully
committed. The second tranches totaling US$30 million were canceled. The
last subproject which will utilize the unallocated balance of the loan
(US$1,632,000) is now under review. Disbursements are proceeding
satisfactorily.
Ln No. 8149 Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June 1972.
Closing date: March 31, 1978.
17.       Construction of drainage facilities is lagging far behind schedule
primarily due to the poor performance of the contractor having the major
responsibility for the drain construction financed under this loan. Steps
are being taken to either force compliance with the contract or replace the
contractor with another. It now appears that more of the project area will
be devoted to combination cattle feeding and milk production than was pre-
viously envisaged.  The returns per ha from such enterprises will not differ
too much from the field crops originally contemplated.

Ln No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$9.1 million,
October 1972.
Closing date: September 30, 1970.
18.       As of May 30, 1975, about 21 percent of the loan amount was disbursed.
Disbursements were delaved due to initial serious management problems. But
about 50 percent of scheduled works have by now been completed and the remainder
are expected to be completed in 1976.
Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million, January 1973.
Closing date: December 31, 1978.
19.       The progress of the work is generally satisfactory except for delays
in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages, which means that filling
the Santa Rita reservoir cannot be started before mid-1977, two years behind
schedule. This would be likely to lead to an energy deficit in the intercon-
nected system of at least 10 percent from 1978 to 1981. The revised project
cost estimate (US$119.2 million) is 21.3 percent above appraisal estimates,
mainly due to higher costs of the works at El Penol and Guatape. EPM has failed
to achieve the 9 percent rate of return required under the Loan Agreement and
it has fallen behind in its payments to ISA,thus contributing to the problems
experienced by the latter (see Loan 681). However, a recent substantial in-
crease in EPM's electricity tariffs has led to some improvement in the financial
situation, and EPM has undertaken to bring its payments to ISA up-to-date within
the next two months. Further increases in tariffs are now clearly in prospect.
The Borrower had not submitted requests for withdrawals under the Bank Loan
since October 1971t but recently w,rithdrawals from the Loan were resumed.
Ln No. 903 Development Finance Companies V; US$60 million, May 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
20.       Commitments of the loan were interrupted for several months last
year pending agreement on a revised interest rate. Commitments are now pro-
ceeding well, but an extension of the terminal date for cominitments will be
required as almost US$3 million of the loan proceeds are pending allocation.
Disbursements are still behind schedule, but in view of the present rapid rate
of commitment, they should be completed by the Closing Date.
Ln No. .920 Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
21.       This loan became effective on January 9, 1974.   Shortage of counter-
part funds delayed to September 1974 the opening of construction bids for the
first 22 project institutions. Construction work is therefore one year behind
schedule, but is proceeding smoothly. Procurement of teaching equipment has
been progressing satisfactorily and 40 percent of the purchase orders are being
processed. Implementation of the technical teacher training program and the
various studies for the sector analysis have not moved forward, and the Bank
has informed the Government that prompt action is necessary.

Ln No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1976.
22.       Implementation of CNR's Investment Plan is progressing satis-
factorily; track rehabilitation and maintenance, together with workshop pro-
duction, continue to improve. Project objectives probably will have to be
reduced by 35 percent because of the large increase in the price of materials.
CNR's financial picture has continued to improve because of increased traffic
and tariffs. The growth in freight traffic was hampered by Government
measures halting wheat imports via Santa Marta. However, efforts to replace
this traffic with fertilizer shipments from Barranquilla are proving reason-
ably successful.
Ln No. 971 Preinvestment Studies Project; uS$8 million, March 1974.

23.       This loan became effective on June 27, 1974. Although the Bank
has approved five sub-projects amounting to total Bank commitments of
US$4 million, as yet, no disbursements have been made under the loan. The
Bank has informed the Borrower (FONADE) that prompt action should be taken
to initiate utilization of the loan.

CORDOBA 2 AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PRtOJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Colombia
Beneficiary:          Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA)
Amount:               US$21 million equivalent
Terms:                30 years, including 6 years' grace, at 8-1/2 percent
interest
Project Description:  (a) Drainage systems on h,O000 hectares, and land
leveling on 20,000 hectares, of this INCORA land
development project would be completed. The
project would eliminate seasonal flooding and
would reclaim 6,000 hectares which are permanently
flooded.  The latter, together with 7,800 hectares
of land held in excess of 50 hectares per existing
farm to be expropriated under existing land reform
laws, would be used to settle about 1,000 landless
farmers on empresas comunitarias; in addition, another
2,800 small farms of less than 12 ha would benefit
from the land improvement program. The project would also
provide extension services and improvement of social
infrastructure for education, health, village water
supply, rural electrification and telephone service.
(b)  INCORA would manage an agricultural credit fund,
utilizing the Caja Agraria as banking agent, to
provide medium- and long-term credit to small
farmers. Subloans would be for on-farm development,
purchase of farm machinery, construction of infra-
structure on livestock farms and purchase of breeding
stock. Subloans would bear interest at 16 percent
per annum and be repayable in 5 to 12 years.
