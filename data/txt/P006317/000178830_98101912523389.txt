This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission c66mposed of
Messrs. Claudio Ferna'ndez (Financial Analyst), Emilio Rodriguez '(Engineer),
and Felipe Morris (Young Professional), who visited Brazil from August 17
to September 18, 1980. A preliminary appraisal report for three of the
State Water Companies (SANEAGO, SANESUL and CAESB) was completed by COSAN
and presented to the Bank during the post-appraisal on November 6 to 13,
1980. This report was prepared by Messrs. Ferna'ndez and Rodriguez.

BRAZIL
MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01         The Government of Brazil has requested the continuation of
Bank financial assistance for the expansion and improvement of water sup-
ply and sewerage systems in urban communities. The proposed project would
benefit urban communities in the states of Amazonas, Para, Paraiba, Goias,
Mato Grosso do Sul and the Federal District.   The proposed project was
prepared by the National Housing Bank (BNH) and the state water companies
(SWCs) with Bank assistance. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$589 million equivalent, and a Bank loan of US$180 million is recommended
to finance the foreign exchange component. The Borrower would be BNH, and
the beneficiaries,  the State Water Companies (SWCs).   The works to be
financed are scheduled for construction and completion during the four-
year period 1981-84.  It is estimated that by 1984 the project would serve
about 2.5 million persons with water supply and about 0.6 million persons
would have sewerage connections.   About 63% of the additional persons
served with water in the capital cities would be urban poor.
II. THE SECTOR
Sector Development
General
2.01          Before 1971, expansion of urban infrastructure, particularly
water supply and sewerage facilities, did not keep pace with Brazil's
overall development primarily because of institutional problems and lack
of financing. Responsibility for these services was at that time vested in
the municipalities, the level of government weakest in organizational,
technical and financial capacity.  Less than 60% of the urban population
had access to public water supply and less than 30% was connected to sewage
systems.
2.02          In 1967 the Federal Government assigned responsibility for
basic sanitation to the Ministry of Interior. The National Housing Bank
(BNH) was designated as the executing agency for t'he sector and in 1971 it
launched the National Sanitation Plan (PLANASA).
2.03         The Ministry of Health's Special Public Health Service Found-
ation (FSESP) is in principle responsible for the expansion of water supply
and sewerage services in rural areas. FSESP operates through two programs
for rural areas: basic sanitation (water supply and sewerage, including
upgrading of individual sanitary units) in small communities and sanita-
tion for areas of endemic schistosomiasis. By 1978, FSESP had built 782



- 2 -
new water supply systems and extensions to 115 existing systems to benefit
a population of about 10.0 million.   It had also constructed 42 sewage
systems to benefit a 2.3 million population. There is no comprehensive
program for these areas.   FSESP systems are being transferred to the State
Water Companies (SWCs) and BNH has started to provide financial assistance
to small communities in rural areas. Regional development agencies have
also been providing sanitation assistance to the rural population through
their integrated rural development programs.  The National Department of
Sanitation Works (DNOS) has also constructed some water works.
PLANASA
2.04         PLANASA encompasses the design, financing, construction and
operation of urban water supply and sewerage services, and the training of
the sector's managerial personnel.   PLANASA is a dynamic program whose
objectives are revised periodically. Its objectives for 1985 have been
defined as follows: (a) to provide water services to 80% of the population
in 5,700 urban communities (72% out of the total of 7,900); (b) to install
or extend sewage systems in those cities with populations greater than
100,000 where individual excreta disposal systems are no longer appro-
priate; and (c) to control and decrease pollution levels in selected water-
sheds, including those near major metropolitan areas.
2.05         PLANASA is implemented through the State Water Companies
(SWCs) formed in each state by consolidating municipal water companies.
The purpose of this consolidation was to permit economies of scale, parti-
cularly in the use of qualified staff; central review of all system de-
signs; increased financial capacity, and, when appropriate, cross-subsidi-
zation and proper operation and maintenance of municipal systems. Each SWC
is responsible for construction, operation, and maintenance of the water
supply and sewage systems throughout its state. Each SWC prepared a global
feasibility study (EVG) for its state.   Revised annually, each EVG sets
forth service level objectives, construction schedules and a financing
program.      On the basis of these studies and each state's commitment to
provide one-half of the financing for the investment program from its
revolving State Water and Sewerage Fund (FAE), BNH entered into PLANASA
Agreements with all states.   These agreements incorporated the service
level objectives of the EVGs and committed BNH to providing one-half of the
financing for the investment program.  FAE funds can be used only by the
SWC and are supposed to be sufficient in the future to finance most of the
SWC investments with the objective to progressively eliminate BNH financ-
ing.   The PLANASA financing system has been successful and provided an
orderly and stable source of funds which is unusual in the sector. Financ-
ing and operating details for PLANASA are provided in Annexes 3 and 7. The
PLANASA agreements for all SWCs included in this project were renewed
during early 1981.  The PLANASA agreements for the remaining SWCs are in
the process of being renewed.



- 3-
Institutional Development
2.06          In 1974, BNH entered into the Program of Technical Assistance
for Institutional Development of State Water Companies (SATECIA) agreement
with PAHO 1/ to carry out a technical assistance program aimed at strength-
ening the execution ability and administrative efficiency of the SWCs. The
first three-year program, completed in 1977, included the analysis of each
SWC and recommendations for improvement.   A two-and-a-half year follow-up
program to assist the SWCs in implementing improvements has also been
completed.   The programs have improved the SWCs' organization and finan-
cial reporting. In November 1979, BNH introduced a technical and financial
implementation program for SWC institutional deve:Lopment (PRODISAN).   The
program will be financed by BNH under its various lines of credit. Most of
the required studies are being carried out by local consultants.   PAHO is
helping  BNH  to  supervise  the  program.    The  Brazilian  Association  of
Engineers (ABES) is providing assistance in supervising staff training.
The objective of the training program is to train annually about 20% of the
80,000 SWC employees. To date, this target has been met.
2.07         Difficulties  in recruiting qualified[  personnel  in some re-
gions, lack of managerial training of high-level staff and high turnover of
managerial staff limit the SWCs' ability to properly plan, appraise and
supervise  projects.   Thus,  the  success  of PLANASA's  implementation  is
directly linked to COSAN's 2/ staff ability to appraise and supervise SWC
operations.   The present drawbacks of the investment programs proposed by
the SWCs are:   frequent changes;  overestimation of demand for services;
overdesign of systems; underestimation of project costs; overoptimistic
execution schedules;  and excessive dependence on consultants.   Most SWCs
require the increased involvement of BNH in project preparation and super-
vision. A detailed evaluation of PLANASA is provided in Annex 3.
Service Levels
2.08          In 1980, 74% of the urban population was connected to public
water supply and 34% was served by public sewerage.3/  There are, however,
regional imbalances.   Only about 50% of the urban population in the less-
developed states has water supply service; many communities are not sup-
plied at all.   In rural areas, there are only limited sanitation facili-
ties:  less than 5% of the households have water connections.   Only 2% of
the rural households have septic tanks, 30% have Latrines, and 68% have no
satisfactory excreta disposal  facilities.   The urban poor,  however,  are
the most severely affected by the lack of sanitation services. Many of the
urban poor are recent migrants who have squatted on the periphery of
metropolitan areas where water supply does not exist, or in centrally
located but often precarious settlements.

3/ Based on the 1979 survey of sanitation companies by the Brazilian Asso-
ciation of Sanitary Engineers. Bank most recent social indicators indicate
that the percentage of urban population with access to safe water was 89% (in
1978) and about 84% have appropriate waste disposal.

2.09         PLANASA has achieved impressive results over the past decade.
The number of communities covered by the program grew from 357 in 1972 to
2,007 in 1978. The number of households connected to water supply systems
increased from 3.1 million to 8.1 million during the same period (Annex 3).
Sector Investment
2.10         During the period 1968-80 sector investments have been about
US$5 billion, with BNH providing 56% of the funds, the State Governments 33%
and grants or other contributions  11%.   PLANASA investments represented
about 0.4% of the annual GDP and have increased considerably from an average
of US$3.7 per person in urban areas in 1969-71 to US$12.8 in 1978-80, in
constant 1980 dollars (Annex 3). Investment in rural areas for 1974-78 were
US$258 million. Data on investment in urban and rural areas are in Project
File.
2.11         BINI investments are presently limited by Government efforts to
control inflation. BNH is requesting Government authorization to both in-
crease its investment program and seek additional external resources for
PLANASA. Assurances were obtained from the Government and BNH that they will
provide the funds necessary to carry out the proposed project on schedule and
that in November of each year, the Bank, BNH and the Government will analyze
the need for counterpart funds for all Bank-financed water supply and sewer-
age subprojects during the following year.
Financial Viability and Tariffs
2.12         One of the basic principles of the PLANASA program is that the
SWCs' revenues should be sufficient to ensure their financial viability.
This requirement has not been met because tariffs have not kept pace with
inflation, and because of increases in operating costs and debt service
requirements have been substantial. As a result, some SWCs have been meeting
debt service payments,  and even operating expenses,  through   loans from
BNH/FAE and state government contributions.
2.13         On May 11,  1978,  the Brazilian Congress approved   National
Tariff Law No. 6528 for the water supply and sewerage sector. The objectives
of the Law are to: (a) relate tariffs to the cost of service; (b) ensure that
water supply and sewerage services remain affordable to the low-income popu-
lation by establishing a minimum-consumption tariff related to income
level;l/ and (c) ensure the financial viability of the SWCs.  In addition,
the Law requires that tariff studies be undertaken in accordance with guide-
lines to be set by the Ministry of the Interior.
2.14         Decree No. 82587 of November 6, 1978, contains regulations to
implement the Tariff Law. The regulations set forth the procedures for and
1/  The monthly charge for the minimum consumption (about 10 m3) is not to
exceedL 35% of one readjustable National Treasury Bond (ORTN); the combined
water and sewerage charges not to exceed 50% of one ORTN.

frequency of tariff adjustments and define the criteria to be used in design-
ing tariff structures.   The regulations establish 1983 as the year during
which SWC revenues should be sufficient to cover the sum of operating ex-
penses, depreciation, and debt service. The maximum allowed rate of return is
equal to 12% of operating investments.l/ The 1983 objective is to be reached
through a gradual program of tariff adjustments, although interim objectives
are not specified. Additional main features of the Decree are:
(a)     SWCs will submit to BNH, by March 31 of each year, five-year
investment programs and financial plans (EVGs) which will in-
clude tariff proposals aimed at gradually attaining the fi-
nancial objectives for 1983 and thereafter.   BNH will review
these studies and submit tariff proposals to the Special Secre-
tariat for Supply and Prices (SEAP)2/ in the Ministry of Plan-
ning for approval; and
(b)     consumers are to be classified in four categories,3/ and tar-
iffs are to be progressive and allow for cross-subsidization.
2.15          Unclear definition of financial objectives in 1979-82, low ta-
riffs that are not fully adjusted for inflation, and high operating costs and
debt service have caused financial difficulties. In some states, the extreme
poverty of the population makes it difficult to generate enough revenues to
cover financial needs.   Difficulties with BENH or FAE funding and growing
investment needs cause further financial problems. The Government, BNH and
the Bank, therefore agreed in mid-1980 to review at least annually the
financial situation of each SWC receiving Bank Loans and the required tariff
increases. This agreement is being efficiently implemented (see additional
details in paras. 2.25 and 7.13 to 7.15).
Evaluation of PLANASA
2.16          Despite the efforts described in the preceding paragraphs, it
is estimated that PLANASA's initial objectives will not be achieved until
1985 for water supply and until 1990 for sewerage.4/ This may in part be the
result of excessive optimism in setting the targets, particularly in the case
of sewerage.   PLANASA's effectiveness has been affected by financial con-
straints (paras. 2.11, 2.12 and 2.15).   Unclear sector priorities at the
national level, together with political interference in the SWCs, lack of
economic analysis of projects, use of questionable techniques for least-cost

tion, excluding those financed by grants and including certain current assets.

Interministerial Price Committee (CIP), which reported to the Ministry of
Finance.

analysis and project justification, and high per capita costs.  The Bank and
BNH agreed in previous Loans to use a selection criteria for subprojects
based on the choice of the least-cost alternative, using the incremental rate
of return as a cut-off criterion for investment in medium- and large-size
cities, and the per capita investment cost  for investments in small com-
munities. Because of insufficient follow-up by BNH, difficulties have aris-
en in the application of the criteria.  One of the major objectives of the
loan is the improvement and effective application of subproject selection
criteria to all BNH water and sewerage operations (para. 6.06).  Despite
these and other problems encountered by PLANASA (analyzed in Annex 3), the
program has proven to be basically sound and has achieved impressive results.
In addition to substantial improvements in access to safe water, PLANASA has
introduced a series of legal, financial, and administrative innovations
which will greatly facilitate the task of achieving the program's ultimate
objectives.
Environmental Legislation
2.17          In October 1973, the Federal Government created the Special
Secretariat for Environment (SEMA) in the Ministry of Interior to monitor
changes in the environment, establish air and water quality standards, and
coordinate all federal pollution control programs. Several laws and decrees
were issued thereafter to enforce pollution control.  In January 1976, the
Government issued a regulation classifying inland water resources according
to their uses, and limiting their contamination by setting up maximum permis-
sible concentrations of physical, chemical, and biological pollutants. Con-
trol of water pollution rests with SEMA, the state governments and multistate
committees.
2.18          Implementation of the pollution control laws will demand large
investments, and substantial operational and maintenance expenditures.  For
those cities needing sewage treatment, the total cost of services could be so
high that, even with substantial increases, tariffs would not be sufficient
to fully recover these costs. Capital contributions from the states and/or
the Federal Government, therefore, might be required in addition to BNH and
FAE debt financing. Sewerage tariffs will have to be structured to achieve,
where appropriate, cross-subsidization among the consumers, in particular
from the industrial ones, to make systems financially viable.   Studies to
establish appropriate tariff structures and levels for sewage collection and
treatment are expected to be completed by July 31, 1981 under the Greater Sao
Paulo Sewage Collection and Treatment Project (Loan 1525-BR).
Bank Participation in PLANASA Financing
2.19          Since 1971, the Bank has been assisting Brazil in the implemen-
tation of PLANASA through the financing of eight water supply and sewerage
projects, as shown in Annex 13.



2.20         Total actual and planned Bank assistance to the water supply
and sewerage sector is estimated to account for about 6% of the country's
sector investments in 1971-82. The only other external lenders to the sector
since 1970 have been: (a) the United States Agency for International Devel-
opment (USAID), which in 1971 extended a US$25.0 million loan to BNH for
urban sanitation; and (b) the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which
in 1971 provided a US$30.0 million loan to BNH for water and sewerage pro-
jects throughout Brazil.
Experience Under Previous Loans
2.21         Three of the eight Bank Loans for water supply and sewerage
(Loans 757-, 758-, and 1009-BR were completed after three-year delays. The
delays in Sao Paulo were caused by the initial failure of the State to supply
the necessary funds to complete financing, substantial technical revision of
the project, and reorganization of the executing agencies.  Service levels
exceeded expectations and the Borrower substantially improved its overall
operations.   In Minas Gerais,  the delays were attributable to the inex-
perience of the executing agency and the complexity of the project.   The
conclusions reached in the Project Performance Audit Report of April 4, 1980,
on the Sao Paulo Loans are:
(a)     the projects achieved their main objectives;
(b)     the delays caused by lack of adequate and timely state govern-
ment financing indicate the need for appropriate commitments
from the state government; and
(c)     the existence of three sector entities 1/ without a coordinat-
ing body is not conducive to efficient and effective sector
operation.
The main problems encountered during the implementation of these projects
were solved by the creation of PLANASA.   PLANASA provided the required
Government and State financing and organized the planning and implementation
of sector investments.  The creation of the SWCs to carry out the execution
and operation of works also reduced implementation problems.
2.22         Loan 1009-BR completion report stresses that the Minas Gerais
operation was the Bank's first experience in Brazil with a state-wide program
for many cities. The project was the first loan made by the Bank after the
start of PLANASA's implementation.   Initial execution delays due to poor
global feasibility studies (EVGs) and subproject approval methods resulted
in almost three years delay in project completion. The financial rates of
return were lower than covenanted due to unfulfilled assumptions that fi-
nancially viable cities would soon join COPASA and difficulties in keeping up
with high inflation rates. Nevertheless, on the overall concept the project
was successful; COPASA is a well organized company which is executing well
1/ One for water production, one for water distribution and sewage collec-
tion, and one for sewage disposal.

two additional loans. Furthermore, Bank participation contributed to sector
strengthening and has been the origin of a fruitful relation between BNH and
the Bank.
2.23          Because of the Government's desire to reduce inflationary ex-
pectations, it sought and obtained a waiver of the revenue covenants for
Loans 1525 and 1656-BR in early 1980. The waiver was conditioned on tariff
increases being approved in line with the Government's target for inflation
(45%).l/ Actual tariff increases for the eight SWCs being financed by the
Bank were higher and their average tariff increased almost 100% between 1979
and 1980.
2.24          The Bank and BNH have held regular discussions on improvement
of sector operations. The major operational improvements have been:
(a)     the enactment of the National Tariff Law and the development of
detailed guidelines for its implementation;
(b)     the delegation of responsibility for project approval and su-
pervision to BNH's regional offices, resulting in faster exe-
cution;
(c)     the establishment of a uniform accounting system for the SWCs,
which will enable BNH and the SWCs to have uniform and reliable
financial information; and
(d)     BNH participation in project appraisal, starting with this
project.
2.25          Further  improvements  to  be  achieved  through  this  project
include:
(a)     the establishment of sound economic principles  for economic
analysis and project selection (paras. 3.13 and 6.06);
(b)     the participation of BNH in project supervision (paras. 3.15
and 6.22);
(c)     the improvement of methodology for preparation of the EVGs
(para. 3.14);
(d)     the reinforcement and improvement of COSAN (para. 6.08);
(e)     the strengthening of the project SWCs (para. 4.16); and
(f)     the achievement of financial viability by the SWCs (para.
7.15).
2.26          These achievements would help BNH to be ready for sector
lending.

III. THE BORROWER
Organization
3.01      The Borrower for the Loan would be BNH, the Borrower for the last
five Bank Loans to Brazil in the water supply and sewerage sector.  BNH, a
tax exempt, Government-owned Bank dedicated to social development, was es-
tablished by Federal law in August 1964. It is administratively and finan-
cially independent and has reported since 1967 to the Ministry of Interior.
3.02      In 1979, BNH's assets totaled US$11 billion, and it granted loans
for about US$3 billion.   At that time, it had made 54% of its loans for
housing, 17% for urban infrastructure, 17% for water and sanitation pro-
jects, and 12% for studies, technical assistance and other activities. BNH
obtains most of its resources (70% of total liabilities) by retaining 8% of
all nongovernment salaries, which are deposited in a special Employee Indem-
nity Fund, (FGTS) 1/ that BNH administers. The contributions are maintained
in UPC 2/ and earn 3% interest p.a. Each worker may withdraw his accumulated
payroll contribution plus interest to purchase a house, or when he is unem-
ployed or retired.
3.03      BNH is administered by a Board of Directors (Conselho de Adminis-
tracao) and an Executive Committee (Diretoria). The Board consists of the
Executive Committee and nine counselors.   The Executive Committee is com-
posed of the President of the Board and seven Directors, all appointed by the
President of the country with the approval of the Federal Senate.   Each
Director heads one of the seven Operating Departments of BNH.3/   The top
management that assumed office in March 1979 is actively pursuing a program
of simplifying operations and improving efficiency. BNH operations are the
direct responsibility of the President and Department Directors, but respon-
sibility for decisions on routine matters has been delegated to Regional
Credit Committees.
BNH Sanitation Sector Operations-PLANASA Implementation
3.04      Since September 1967, BNH's Operations Division for the Sanitation
Finance System (COSAN),4/ under the Directorate of Complementary Programs
(DICOM) has been responsible for water and sewerage activites. COSAN has a
Superintendent and a Deputy Superintendent, three Advisers (Technical Analy-
sis and Programming, and Finance) (Annex 1) and 57 professional staff mem-
bers.   Of the professional staff members,  26 are financial analysts,  15
engineers  and  the  remaining  16  support  staff.    COSAN  has  overall

- 10 -
16 support staff.   COSAN has overall responsibility for expediting imple-
mentation of PLANASA by supervising the sanitation program and acting as a
technical and financial controller for the SWCs. COSAN is also responsible
for presenting tariff proposals to SEAP in the Ministry of Planning and
implementing PRODISAN (para. 2.06). COSAN also uses consultants to advise
SWCs, review documents prepared by SWCs, supervise works, study specific
topics and do research.
3.05      Some of COSAN's activities have been decentralized since 1976 to
its regional representatives in 11 states. The representatives are attached
to BNH local offices.   Regional office functions include monitoring loan
agreements between BNH and the SWCs, approving disbursements, updating pro-
ject execution and disbursement schedules, monitoring the performance of
Revolving Funds (FAEs) and Technical Agents (OTs), and reviewing SWC opera-
tions. Each regional office is responsible for at least one SWC. The need
for operational improvements in COSAN has been pointed out in previous pro-
jects, especially in the Southern States Project (Loan 1823-BR), which in-
cludes a US$200,000 technical assistance program for COSAN.  The Loan pro-
vides additional technical assistance to strengthen COSAN staff (para.
6.08). It is estimated that three engineers, three financial analysts, and
one economist should be hired as soon as possible.  Before negotiations, BNH
presented to the Bank a satisfactory implementation plan for technical as-
sistance to be provided to COSAN under Loan 1823-BR.  COSAN technical assis-
tance would be executed between June 1981 and December 1983. The employment
of consultants for this technical assistance on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness.   Assurances were ob-
tained that BNH would approve seven additional staff positions for COSAN
before Board presentation.   The appointment of three of these seven staff
members is a condition for loan effectiveness.   The other four additional
staff for COSAN should be appointed not later than December 31, 1981.  An
evaluation of COSAN is given in Annex 3.
3.06      Most of the supervision of water and sewerage construction works
is delegated to OTs. The OTs are highly technical and respected institutions
and are under contract to BNH (para. 6.19).
3.07      Under the PLANASA agreements (para. 2.05), the parties involved
and the basic responsibilities of each entity are as follows:
(a) SWC: set priorities and prepare investment programs, operate
systems, award contracts, make payments, prepare viability
studies (EVG) by March 31 of each year and make financial and
operating reports to BNH;
(b) State Government: provide funds each year to be deposited in
the FAE to finance the sanitation works within each state
following FAE and BNH regulations, and send to BNH annual
financial statements and projections of the state income;
(c) FAE Agent (generally the State Bank): administer FAE re-
sources in accordance with BNH regulations, collect state



- 11 -
contributions and SWC debt service payments to FAE and send
BNH related financial information;
(d)  BNH Financial Agent (generally the state Bank): transfer BNH
funds to the SWC and collect debt service payments; and
(e)  BNH: in general provide regulations for the sector, in par-
ticular determine credit conditions (interest, terms) for BNH
and FAE loans, approve feasibility reports and subprojects,
supervise the SWC and subproject implementation, propose
tariff increases to the Federal Government and decide actions
to be taken if the agreements are not complied with.
3.08      The agreements established annual targets for service levels, in-
vestments, state contributions and tariffs.  These! targets are updated an-
nually through BNH approval of the EVGs.
Financing
3.09      SWC contributions to investment are very small; almost 100% of the
investment is financed by loans or grants.   In general, BNH and each FAE
finance investments in equal parts. Investments in small communities (less
than 5,000 inhabitants), however, are 70% financed by state government
grants.   The SWCs may also receive other Federal or state grants (Fundo
Perdido). Several states now require urban developers to pay for the total
cost of water and sewerage distribution networks as consumer contributions.
The total amount of grants and consumer contributions projected in the EVGs
of the project SWCs varies from 5% to 30% of total SWC investments.  Most
Federal grants for the sector are administered by BNH, but there are no clear
guidelines for distribution of the grants (para. 7.19).
3.10      The state FAEs are funded by state contributions and the interest
on funds previously lent to the SWCs. The maximum c:ontribution represents 5%
of the state revenues (mainly sales tax).  When the state contribution is
greater than 3% of its revenues, the state can obtain additional BNH loans to
make up the difference.
Subproject Preparation and Approval
3.11      Each SWC selects subprojects which are included in the EVG for BNH
consideration.  The SWC then subcontracts with consultants for the feasibi-
lity studies (Relatorio Tecnico Preliminar-RTP) which include analysis of
alternatives.  The SWC approves the RTP and sends it to the OT which then
provides its opinion and sends the RTP to BNH for approval. COSAN formally
reviews only about 5% of the RTPs presented by the SWCs. The SWC is author-
ized to contract consultants to prepare final designs (Projeto Basico) under
BNH financing. After a cycle of review and approval similar to the process
mentioned above, BNH signs a contract (CTN) with the SWC to finance the
works.



- 12 -
3.12      Each EVG consolidates the projections for many cities.  When some
SWCs have encountered problems in preparing the EVGs, COSAN staff has parti-
cipated in preparing them. All sector investment decisions have been taken
mainly on the basis of the EVGs and the projected financial position of the
SWC.
3.13      The Bank has been providing assistance to BNH to improve both the
financial and social 1/ aspects of the EVGs. The major concern has been that
the EVGs were in practice precluding the analysis of priorities and the use
of sound economic justification since decisions were made only on financial
grounds.   BNH requires the analysis of alternatives but has provided no
guidelines.   Each consultant uses different methods which do not always
ensure that  the least-cost  solution is selected.   Appropriate  selection
criteria for Bank subprojects were agreed on under previous loans, but BNH
financed several subprojects which were not found eligible for Bank financ-
ing. Assurances were obtained from BNH that not later than August 31, 1981
it will adopt the subproject selection criteria proposed for this project
(para. 6.06) to subprojects of the SWCs financed under Loans 1656-BR, 1823-BR
and 1850-BR.   This subproject selection criteria, on the basis of a study
carried out for such purpose, will be adopted for all subprojects financed by
BNH not later than December 31, 1981.
3.14      To become financially meaningful, the EVG requires several impro-
vements. The following have already been suggested by the Bank to BNH: (a)
all revenues, costs and investments should be included and projected; (b)
full annual financial statements for the period covered by the EVG should be
prepared, including the effect of inflation (estimated at 20% for 1979 and
40% for 1980 as measured in ORTN); (c) depreciation rates should be more
realistic and standarized by BNH and fixed assets (maintained in ORTN) should
be reestimated; (d) medium-term investment forecasting should be improved;
and (e) water and sewerage demand should be estimated more realistically and
a longer projection span (8-10 years) should be used.  COSAN has agreed to
implement Bank suggestions starting in the 1981 EVGs.
Bidding and Contracting
3.15      SWCs call  for bids  and awards contracts  following Federal and
state regulations. The latter vary from state to state. BNH, the OT and the
state Bank have in the past participated in the procurement process only by
formally ratifying the procedures. Some of the procedures are not compatible
with Bank procurement rules.   Bank procurement guidelines have been ex-
plained and accepted by the project SWCs.  Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that COSAN will make sure, for all project SWCs, that Bank
procurement guidelines are followed by each SWC. COSAN understands that this
will require a more active involvement in the procurement process than here-
tofore, with a corresponding reduction in the Bank's involvement.

- 13 -
3.16      Brazilian contractors often win all contracts.   Contracts are
specified in cruzeiros and subject to inflation adjustment following a poly-
nomial formula. Construction is inspected by the SWC engineering units with
some assistance from OTs. The OTs approve all bills and send them to BNH or
FAE for payment.
IV. THE BENEFICIARIES
Background
4.01      The six beneficiaries and executing agencies for the project
will be the state water companies of Amazonas (COSAMA), Para (COSANPA),
Paraiba (CAGEPA), Mato Grosso do Sul (SANESUL), Goias (SANEAGO) and the
Federal District (CAESB). These SWCs are headquartered in the state capi-
tals and are responsible for the capital city and up to several hundred
more small- or medium-size cities. The SWCs included in the project have
been participating in PLANASA, have ongoing projects financed by BNH/FAE
and have completed EVGs.
Organization and Management
4.02      All SWCs are owned by their state governmtents.  Each has a board
of directors appointed by the state governor for a period of four years.
Subsequent to changes in state governments in March 1979, new presidents
and boards of directors were appointed for most SWCs.   Except for the
president of the board of directors, who is the chief executive officer,
each director is the working head of one of the operational departments.
The president and board of directors of the project SWCs are qualified
professionals with considerable sector experience.
4.03      SWC organization,  procedures and operations  are standarized.
Organizational structures have evolved with the assistance of SATECIA
(para.  2.06) and have departments for technical operations, administra-
tion, and finance and accounting (Organization Charts, Annex 1).  These
organizational structures are considered appropriate for the activities
undertaken. An institutional analysis of each SWC is summarized in Annex
14.
4.04      The SWCs and the state governments establish priorities for the
extension of water supply and sewerage services in each state based on
assessed needs in the communities. Engineering studies, design and super-
vision of works are executed mainly through satisfactory consultants. The
SWC engineering units, with the advice and control of the OTs, review
designs and monitor construction.   Projects are usually implemented on
schedule, and project programming and control procedures are now being
strengthened to handle the increased volume of construction during 1981-
84. Technical operations are generally satisfactory. Many SWCs, however,



- 14 -
have difficulties operating distant systems, which are separated up to
2,000 km in some states.
Commercial Operations
4.05      Commercial operations are sophisticated and generally well man-
aged so as to serve a large number of municipalities scattered over a wide
geographic area, with a high percentage of people living in relative po-
verty 1/ (50% in Amazonas and Paraiba). Consumption metering is very low
(average 40%), even in some capital cities.   Lack of metering of both
production and consumption results in unreliable assessments of unac-
counted-for water (between 10-60%), and make cross-subsidization dif-
ficult. The project provides for a substantial increase of production and
consumption metering (paras. 5.10 and 5.12).
4.06      Water consumption values are distorted in some SWCs because of
the large number of unmetered connections.   These connections are billed
for 10 m3 per month in some states and up to 45 m3 per month in others. BNH
has been made aware of his problem and is implementing gradual changes to
correct these imbalances without jeopardizing the financial position of
the SWCs (para. 7.16).
4.07      Meters  are read every month and consumers  (other than those
living in remote, inaccessible communities) are billed within 15 days of
the reading. Bills are prepared by a centralized computer and collected
through local banks and SWC offices. Computer billing needs to be improved
and BNH is testing a new billing program in SANESUL to be used by all SWCs.
Collection is efficient in most SWCs (arrears are less than two months of
billing), but should be substantially improved in Goias and the Federal
District (arrears of four months of billing).   Specific targets for the
allowable percentages of accounts receivable are being proposed for each
of the project SWCs (Annex 12-Monitoring Indicators).   Fines of 10% of
billing are levied on accounts paid more than one month late, and water is
usually shut off when payment is two or more months late.
Personnel
4.08      BNH, the Federal Government, the state governments and the SWCs
have been concerned about the efficiency of SWC operations.   The six
project SWCs are making more efficient use of their personnel as shown in
Table 4.1. Training is generally satisfactory.
4.09      A major concern is the implementation of a personnel management
system that defines functions, responsibilities and salaries.2/ COSANPA has
already begun to use such a system, while the systems of the other SWCs are in
1/ Defined as families earning three minimum salaries or less.
2/ "Plano de Cargos e Salarios".



- 15 -
various stages of preparation. These systems would define technical qua-
lifications for management staff, provide incentives for technical achie-
vement and progress within the SWCs, and set forth satisfactory levels of
remuneration. The implementation of such a system would provide stability
to qualified staff and reduce the high personnel turnover that results in
frequent changes in plans and policies. Assurances were obtained from BNH
that a system of functions, responsibilities, and salaries will be imple-
mented in each project SWC not later than December 31, 1982.

Accounting-Financing
4.10      All SWCs are using the accounting system proposed by BNH in 1976.
The accounting system is satisfactory, although its reliability needs to
be improved. Accounting results are usually available within two months
after the end of each year. Full financial statements (income, balance and
cash flow) are now produced routinely.
4.11      The financial and accounting departments are headed by qualified
personnel. All project SWCs have computerized accounting systems central-
ized in their headquarters. Financial management, however, is hindered by
the lack of adequate data processing capability and the cumbersome format
of computer reports. In addition, the reports themselves are inadequate
for managerial purposes.   COSANPA owns its computer, but the other SWCs
depend on Government data processing centers for both hardware and soft-
ware.  The lack of a strong unit in charge of computer applications and
software affects the reliability of present applications and interferes
with appropriate management of all departments. Assurances were obtained
from BNH that each SWC will create a systems analysis unit which would be
responsible for all computer software not later than December 31, 1982.



- 16 -
4.12      All SWCs have prepared EVGs for 1980-84 in compliance with BNH
regulations. The EVGs presented in 1980 by the six project SWCs need to be
substantially improved both in general format (as recommended to BNH,
para. 3.14) and in practical application. During appraisal, the EVGs were
reviewed in detail with the SWCs and means of improving them were discussed
with the SWCs.
Audit
4.13      All SWCs retain external independent auditors who are generally
satisfactory. Assurances were obtained from BNH during negotiations that:
(a) accounts and financial statements for BNH and the SWCs for each fiscal
year, starting with fiscal year 1981, will be audited by independent audi-
tors satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles; (b) by April 30 for BNH and May 31 for the SWCs of
each subsequent year certified copies of the audited financial statements
and audit report will be submitted to the Bank; and (c) that the report of
the independent auditor will include a statement on compliance with the
Bank financial covenants.   BNH external auditor should also express an
opinion as to the reliability of Statements of Expenditures to support
claims for disbursements and the adequacy of associated internal control.
BNH statements of expenditures in previous loans have been satisfactory.
4.14      In addition to the external audit,  BNH continuously monitors
project disbursements. Disbursement procedures are explained in Annex 7.
When a loan contract is signed with BNH/FAE, the SWC presents a monthly
disbursement schedule with which the BNH regional office compares actual
disbursements.   When actual disbursements are 20% below the projection,
BNH/FAE disbursements are suspended until the SWC provides a satisfactory
explanation.
4.15      Some of the SWCs are using or setting up internal auditing pro-
cedures.  The complexity of the SWCs requires the prompt establishment of
internal audit offices.  Assurances were obtained from BNH that internal
audit offices will be established in the SWCs and staffed at Bank and BNH
satisfaction not later than December 31, 1982, and maintained thereafter.
Evaluation
4.16      The six SWCs  included  in the project have made considerable
progress during the last three years. They use sophisticated computer sys-
tems, and their engineering capacity is good.  They are, however, somewhat
weaker than previous beneficiaries and will require greater assistance
from BNH and the Bank.  Annex 14 summarizes the institutional strengths and
weaknesses  that should be addressed during project  supervision.   The
Bank's institution-building efforts in the SWCs will be concentrated



- 17 -
on improving three critical areas: (a) personnel (para. 4.09); (b) data
processing (para. 4.11); and (c) internal auditing (para.  4.15).  Under
this operation Bank efforts will be centered on major policy and decision
problems affecting all SWCs and the strengthening of COSAN. Less important
problems, which the Bank will not have the capacity to supervise in this
large project, should be dealt with by COSAN with Bank general assistance
(para. 6.22).
V. POPULATION, SERVICE AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT CITIES
General
5.01      The project area, located in the center, north, and northeast of
Brazil (Map No. IBRD 15376) covers 3,867,000 km2, or 45% of the country.
The Area's 1980 population is expected to reach about 15.4 million, or
12.6% of the country's  total.   These figures are generally considered
underestimated because the project area has been the subject of recent
settlement and development programs. The 1980 Brazilian census was begun
in September 1980 and its results, to be available by mid-1981, are ex-
pected to affect the current population estimates. The population density
is 4 persons per km2, or less than one-third of the country-wide density of
14.4.  The area's climate is hot and humid.   Annex 15 contains selected
statistics for the country and each project state.
5.02      Health conditions, particularly for the poor, are inferior to
those prevailing in more developed states in the southeast and south (Annex
16).  For instance, enteritis and diarrheal diseases are frequent occur-
rences in the project area. These diseases are closely linked with unsafe
water supply and poor sanitation.
5.03      The vast project area has valuable natural resources; however,
the area produces only about 8% of the total national income. The major
economic activities are agriculture and cattle raising, which are expected
to develop rapidly in the near future. In vast areas of the states of Mato
Grosso do Sul and Goias, the potential of the soils for these activities is
very good. Development of agricultural activities in these areas is being
srongly promoted by the Government.   Summary information on the economic
resources and main development programs in the project states is in the
Project File.
Water Resources
5.04      Water resources do not limit the provision of water supply ser-
vices in the six capital cities covered by the proposed project.
1/ Sources: World Bank Tables (1980) and Brazil Human Resources Report
(1976).



- 18 -
These cities are supplied mostly from surface water sources. In addition
to surface sources, some cities use groundwater sources to supply some
isolated neighborhoods. Although the groundwater sources yield minor vol-
umes of water as compared with the surface ones,  they will have to be
maintained and expanded in the future to avoid the need for construction of
costly transmission systems.  In the city of Belem, both the surface and
groundwater systems would be needed and expanded to meet future demands.
On the contrary, in the city of Campo Grande, new surface sources are
proposed to be located 30 km from the city (para.  8.06).  In this city,
groundwater volumes of about 100 1/sec per well, could only be drawn from
600-m-deep wells drilled in basalt, with a dynamic level of about 300 m.
With the exception of Manaus and Belem, the other cities would have to
build works to regulate river flows and to ensure required volumes of water
during the dry seasons.
5.05      Water quality of all surface sources for the capital cities is
good. Conventional treatment is sufficient to produce an effluent which
meets international standards. In the city of Belem, however, the Guama
River at the intake site shows unacceptable  levels of bacteriological
contamination and high salinity requiring expensive treatment.   Belem,
with an estimated population of 900,000, has a sewerage system which serves
less than 100,000 inhabitants.   The city occupies a corner of land and
drains throughout the perimeter, including discharges in the proximity of
the water intake.   The situation will deteriorate when water supply in-
creases. Thus, measures to control sewer discharges will be studied during
project execution (para. 5.08).
5.06      The remaining medium-size cities are supplied with water from
groundwater or surface water sources. Small towns are mostly supplied from
shallow or deep-drilled wells. Groundwater quality is generally good and
requires only chlorination to meet acceptable standards.   Information on
water resources for each of the project states and capital cities is in the
Project File.
Existing Water Supply and Sewerage Systems
5.07      Water production capacity in the six capital cities covered by
the project is limited and needs expansion and/or improvement to meet
present and future demands. To reduce rationing, raw water is chlorinated
and mixed with treated water in several capital cities.   Rationing and
intermittent service due to insufficient production and inadequacy of the
distribution networks especially affects low-income neighborhoods.   The
normal capacity of many systems components has been exceeded and damages or
maintenance of one motor or pump often requires rationing.   Common needs
are: (a) expansion and improvement of intakes and treatment facilities;
(b) improvement of old water distribution systems to allow the distri-
bution of increased volumes at pressures within acceptable limits; (c)



- 19 -
extension of networks to provide services to peripheral areas; (d) in-
crease in metering coverage; and (e) improvement of operational and admin-
istrative practices of the water companies. Summary information on the
existing water supply and sewerage systems in the capital cities is given
in Annex 17. Additional information is in the Project File.
5.08       Sewage  systems  are  far  from complete  in the capital cities.
Final sewage discharges vary among the cities: (a) from part of Brasilia
into a lake, after secondary treatment, and for the remaining part of the
city, raw sewage into various creeks; (b) from Manaus and Belem screened
raw sewage, through submerged outfalls, into a river; (c) from Goiania,
Joao Pessoa and Campina Grande, raw sewage into rivers.  In Campo Grande,
the primary treatment plant, not yet in operation, lacks a sewer inter-
ceptor.   The interceptor is scheduled to be constructed next year.  The
project includes limited sewerage works in Manaus, Campo Grande, the Fed-
eral District, Joao Pessoa and Campina Grande. All capital cities urgently
need to extend their sewerage systems. Since water works are a top pri-
ority, however, and the investment capacity is limited, additional sew-
erage works will be carried out after 1983.   The master plans for waste
disposal will be prepared or updated during the execution of the project
(para. 5.11).
Population Served and Service Levels
5.09      Water supply coverage (60%) is below the PLANASA target level
for 1980 of 80% in all project states.  Only in the Federal District is
coverage at or above the average national coverage by the SWCs of 75%.
Population served by public sewerage (15%) is very low in the project
states (0-16%), other than in the Federal District, which has a sewerage
coverage of 44%.  Table 5.1 provides the mid-1980 service levels in the
project states.

5.10      Metered connections vary from 36-74% in the capital cities.  The
figures are much lower in the remaining cities.   The situation is even
worse if faulty meters are taken into account.  Water production is not
regularly metered. The project provides for metering of production
sources in the capital cities.   Assurances were obtained from BNH that
metering levels in all project cities with 100,000 or more inhabitants will
be at least 70% by 1982, and 80% by 1983 and thereafter.
5.11      Existing sewerage separates stormwater from domestic-industrial
sewage. The central parts of the capital cities have a drainage system.
Because of the lack of sewerage services, sewage from part of the popula-
tion is discharged into piped or open drains, polluting the environment.
The remaining population, a majority, rely on latrines or septic tanks.
Most of these individual systems are inadequate because of the population
density or because they overflow and are not properly maintained, pollut-
ing and contaminating underground sources from which part of the popula-
tion takes water. Assurances were obtained from BNH that Master Plans for
waste disposal studies will be executed in Manaus, Belem, Goiania and Campo
Grande by qualified consultants under terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, and that these master plans will be presented to the Bank not
later than December 31,  1983.   The studies should propose appropriate
technology solutions for areas not to be sewered, and in the case of Belem,
a comprehensive study of the coastal contamination of the Guama River in
the proximities of the water intake.
Water Production and Consumption
5.12      Lack of metering, both at the production and consumption levels,
problems with meter reading and maintenance, the large percentage assumed
as unaccounted-for water (partially due to illegal connections), distor-
tion of statistics of volumes sold to unmetered connections (especially in
Goias, Para and the Federal District) make the analysis of production and
consumption highly speculative.   Annex 18 gives statistical values for
1979 and 1980, as well as projected values for the period 1981-84. These
projections take into account the reduction of unaccounted-for water by
the implementation of metering and leak-detection programs.
Population and Demand Projections
5.13      The project area is undergoing rapid urbanization:  annual
growth indexes are 4-5% in Joao Pessoa and Belem, and 6-8% in the other
four capital cities. Specific demand studies based on available statis-
tics have been made for each capital city. Demand for additional water in
the state capitals is growing very rapidly. For the other urban communi-
ties, mostly with lower growth indexes, population projections have been
based on population estimates of the Brazilian Institute for Geography and
Statistics (IBGE). Growth rates are assumed to decline gradually. Popula-
tion, service levels, and demand statistics and projections for each state



- 21 -
are given in Annex 18.  Detailed projections for each urban community are
in the Project File.
5.14      Demand projections have been prepared for all major cities and
for the total population under each SWC. Water demand projections for each
city take into consideration: (a) the lower per capita income of the urban
poor (a large percentage of the population to be served); (b) improvement
of pressure and elimination of rationing; (c) effects of expanded metering
of house connections; and (d) demand elasticity caused by tariff increases
in real terms.   Projected growth in water sales over the period 1980-83
ranges from 6% p.a. to 26% p.a..   This compares to actual growth during
1979-80 of 8% p.a. to 21% p.a., respectively.
VI. THE PROJECT
Introduction
6.01      The project is a follow up of previous Bank operations in the
water supply and sewerage sector in Brazil. The Government requested Bank
participation in the project in 1979.  Since then, four Bank missions have
visited Brazil to assist BNH and the SWCs with project identification and
preparation.
6.02      The project will consist of the construction and extension of
water supply and sewerage systems in urban communities of the states of
AAmazonas, Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Para and Paraiba, and in the Federal
District. It is expected to be completed by December 31, 1984.
6.03      Bank staff appraised  subprojects  in the states of Amazonas,
Para, and Paraiba, while BNH prepared preliminary appraisal reports for
subprojects in Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul and in the Federal District. EVGs
for 1980 were only partially approved because of BNH's present financial
constraints.  BNH stopped all disbursement in September 1980 until addi-
tional budgetary allocations were obtained in November 1980. The project
states EVGs are still not satisfactory as investment tools. During project
preparation, the feasibility studies included in the investment program
for the capital cities were revised and approved after ensuring the use of
a proper methodology in the selection of the least-cost alternative for
each project component.   These subprojects were also and staged to keep
investment in line with financial resources, the executing capability of
the SWCs, and the supply of materials and equipments for the works. The
revised investment programs for each SWC are satisfactory to the Bank and
have been approved by BNH.
Project Objectives
6.04      The main objectives of the project are:



- 22-
(a)  to improve environmental and health conditions of the popu-
lation in the project area by providing safe water to an
estimated population of 2.5 million people, sewerage or
waste disposal facilities to some 0.5 million people and
pollution abatement in Brasilia; a substantial portion (62%
in the capital cities) of the incremental population served
would be urban poor (para. 8.12);
(b)  to continue Bank assistance to BNH for the improvement of
their project appraisal methods and the strengthening of
their supervision capabilities;
(c)  to improve the SWCs' management and organization, and help
strengthen their technical and financial performance; and
(d)  to assist the Government in the provision of adequate in-
frastructure to support the industrial and economic devel-
opment in the project states;
(e)  to reduce unaccounted-for water to 35% by 1983 and 30% by
1984 in all capital cities.
6.05      BNH approved investment programs for each SWC for the period
1981-84.   Annexes 4 and 5 show investments under the project.   Annex 9
gives financial projections for each SWC, including other investments dur-
ing the period 1981-84. In large cities (mostly capital cities), invest-
ments were based on detailed cost estimates of the main components of water
and sewage systems. In medium-size cities and small communities, invest-
ments are based on preliminary feasibility reports or the experience of the
SWC with other small cities.
Subproject Selection and Eligibility Criteria
6.06      Because of the large number of cities served by each SWC and the
consequent large number of subprojects subject to review, the Bank and BNH
have agreed to use a relatively simple selection criteria. These criteria
consist basically of: (a) the selection of the least-cost alternative; (b)
a cut-off criterion based on per capita investment cost for villages and
small communities; and (c) a cut-off criterion based on minimum incre-
mental rates of return for other cities. BNH is now willing to issue for
the first time guidelines for least-cost and economic analysis of subpro-
jects for all projects financed by BNH (para. 3.13 and Annex 10). The cut-
off criteria for medium and large cities will be expressed in relation to
the average long-term incremental cost (marginal cost) calculated on the
basis of the investment program of the project and its complementary works.
In cities with 50,000 or more inhabitants, the present tariff or that to be
implemented in the near future 1/ should exceed 75% of the marginal cost of
proposed water supply subprojects (equivalent to a return on the subpro-
ject of 5% or more). For water supply subprojects in cities with 5,000 to
1/ Based on covenanted tariffs in the next twelve months.



- 23 -
50,000 inhabitants or for all sewerage subprojects, the applicable tariff
(water or sewerage) should be at least higher than 60% of the marginal cost
of such subprojects (equivalent to a return of 1% or more).  The resulting
rates of return are higher than the cut-off criteria used in previous loans
to BNH in the water and sewerage sector. The use of marginal cost simpli-
fies the project selection (especially under large tariff variations with-
in the year), is easier to calculate, provides a useful insight of costs
structures, and is easier to understand for policy makers.  The marginal
cost analysis will also provide useful statistics oII per capita investment
costs, operating expenses and the cities where tariff surcharges and in-
tensive metering should be applied. Projects redesigned for minimum cost
and not satisfying the above conditions may be accepted by the Bank on
social grounds.   Acceptance of projects on social or economic grounds
requires a case by case analysis considering the percentage of urban poor
benefitted, the lack of alternative water sources, the impossibility of
recovering its costs by other than tariff charges, the health conditions of
the population and the evaluation of benefits on other sectors of the
economy.   These projects are likely to be in towIIs where urban poverty
prevails and large investments are needed to compensate lack of previous
investments.  Assurances were obtained from BNH that the proposed selec-
tion criteria (Annex 10) will be applied to all subprojects to be financed
under the loan. The Bank would later seek agreement with BNH and the other
signatories of the loan agreement to amend prior loan agreements to incor-
porate the same selection criteria for water supply and sewerage projects.
Project Description
6.07      The project consists of a group of water supply and sewerage
subprojects to be carried out in five states and the Federal District, and
of a technical assistance program for BNH and the SWqCs. A detailed project
description for each of the capital and main cities, and a tentative list
of medium and small cities to be benefited by the project are presented in
Annex 4. The population benefited from the project is analyzed in paras.
8.10 to 8.12.  The main components of the project are:
(a) construction of new water production facilities and expan-
sion or improvement of existing ones in the six capital
cities;l/
(b) construction of transmission pipel:ines to connect the new
water production facilities to the distribution system and
provision for additional storage capacity in the six capi-
tal cities;
(c)  extension of the water distribution systems to areas with-
out service and improvement of the water distribution sys-
tems to increase capacity in the six capital cities;
(d) financing of about 200,000 new house connections for water
in the six capital cites;2/
1/ Capital city includes the metropolitan areas of: each city.
2/ Other house connections would generally be financed by urban developers
or complementary investments not included in the project.



- 24 -
(e) provision of water meters for currently unmetered connec-
tions to meter at least 80% of all connections by 1984 in
the six capital cites;
(f) purchase and installation of production meters, expansion
of meter-repair shops, and implementation of leak-detection
and control programs;
(g) expansion of sewerage services in the cities of Brasilia,
Manaus, Campo Grande, Joao Pessoa, and Campina Grande;
(h) upgrading of existing sewage treatment plants in Brasilia
by adding tertiary processing (para. 6.11), and the con-
struction of sewage treatment and final disposal facilities
in other areas of the city;
(i)  financing of approximately 45,000 sewerage connections in
cities listed in (g) above;
(j) construction or expansion of water systems in approximately
80 medium-size cities;l/
(k) construction or expansion of water systems in approximately
66 small communities;
(1) provision of engineering and consulting services as re-
quired for design and construction supervision; and
(m)  provision of technical assistance programs, including con-
sulting services and equipment to BNH and the SWCs to im-
prove their operational capabilities.
6.08      Success in the implementation of PLANASA, and specifically of
the project, is directly linked to COSAN's ability to appraise and super-
vise projects and SWC operations. An implementation plan for the technical
assistance program under Loan 1823-BR was prepared by BNH before nego-
tiations of the Loan (para. 3.05). COSAN staff will be increased prior to
Loan effectiveness (para. 3.05).   The scope of the above technical as-
sistance program, however,2/ would not provide the indepth assistance
which is needed for the new functions and responsibilities being delegated
now to COSAN. The project provides funding to expand, complement and carry
out additional institution-building actions.   This additional technical
assistance has been estimated at US$1.3 million.
1/ Cities over 5,000 people excluding the capital are considered medium-
sized; those with less than 5,000 are considered as small communities.
2/ Estimated at US$200,000.



- 25 -
6.09      Although each of the project SWCs has its own specific institu-
tional and operational deficiencies, the project institutional building
and supervision effort should be concentrated on solving the following
problems:
(a) frequent changes of plans and policies and high turnover of
management staff, resulting from having political appoint-
ment of general managers, low salaries for high-level mana-
gement, and lack of a personnel manual (para. 4.09);
(b) total dependency on other institutions for all billing,
accounting and information programs (computer hardware and
software) (para. 4.11);
(c) lack of SWC internal audit offices (para. 4.15); and
(d) undervalued fixed assets and depreciation (para. 7.12).
Service Standards
6.10      Water service standards of the project are those common to other
states in Brazil, consisting of water supply by house connections and
sewage disposal by public or individual system.   Standards are in ac-
cordance with proper management practices and with the habits, expecta-
tions and ability to pay of the populations benefitted. Water production
schemes, main distribution facilities and sewerage works are appropriately
staged to suit the least-cost solutions.   Existing facilities in most
project cities will be upgraded and/or expanded in order to extend their
useful lives. Distribution networks will be extendled to new areas for the
purpose of obtaining the greatest impact on water service coverages. These
extensions are being designed to conform with accepted BNH standards.
6.11      The project includes the extension of waterborne sewage systems
in cities where the population density is too high to continue the use of
existing systems or where infiltration from alternative systems would en-
danger the quality of groundwater sources. The project includes improve-
ment of Brasilia's sewage treatment plants. Currently, sewage from down-
town Brasilia is discharged after secondary treatment into the Paranoa
Lake.   The capacity of the sewage treatment plants is very limited, and
plants are now overloaded.   Efficiency, measured in biochemical oxygen
demand removal, is about 60%.  Furthermore, the Paranoa Lake will not be
able to absorb the increasing pollution. Based on the recommendations of
prefeasibility studies prepared by consultants, CAESB attempted to sub-
stitute the existing system with a new one with final disposal in a more
distant water body (S. Bartolomeu River).  The Bank, the OT, and BNH did
not find the solution to be justified at this time.   Consequently, BNH,
CAESB and the OT selected a less costly alternative.   The alternative



- 26
includes the expansion of the sewage treatment plants and the inclusion of
tertiary treatment.   The implementation of this alternative will  also
allow lead time for further studies of the receiving bodies to be carried
out during the project construction period.
Status of Design
6.12      Consultants hired by the SWCs prepared feasibility studies (Pre-
liminary Technical Report-RTP) for the major subprojects.  The appraisal
mission reviewed the RTPs for subprojects in Manaus, Belem, Joao Pessoa,
and Campina Grande. BNH staff reviewed the subprojects in the remaining
three capital cities. These feasibility studies include works represent-
ing 78% of total project costs.  Bank recommendations on specific compo-
nents were agreed upon by BNH and the SWCs.  The proposed subprojects of
the capital cities are satisfactory to the Bank.
6.13      It is estimated that final designs corresponding to works repre-
senting about half of the total project cost are complete, and that final
designs for all major works will be completed before the end of 1981
Preparation of the final designs is not expected to delay project implemen-
tation. These final designs are being prepared by satisfactory Brazilian
consultants hired by each SWC.  RTPs and final designs for medium- and
small-size cities are being prepared by local consultants. Studies have
been prepared for most of these subprojects, but the studies need to be
updated. Their preparation has been taken into account in drawing up the
proposed implementation schedule (Annex 19).
Cost Estimates
6.14      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$589 million
equivalent, of which US$180 million (30.6%) represents the foreign ex-
change component.   The local component includes about US$20 million on
taxes to industrial products 1/. The project cost includes: (a) 10% of
the construction cost for engineering expenses related to the project; (b)
10% of the base cost for physical contingencies; and (c) US$93.9 million or
20.9% of the January 1981 project cost for price escalation.   Interest
during construction, not included in this amount, is estimated at US$49
million equivalent. Table 6.1 gives a summary of the investment costs for
each SWC. More detailed costs for major subprojects are presented in Annex
5 and summarized in Annex 6.
6.15      Cost estimates for those major subprojects in an advanced stage
of preparation are based on a bill of quantities and unit prices prepared
by consultants, the SWCs and BNH. Estimates for the other subprojects are
based on unit costs of similar works.   The costs are in January 1981
prices. Price contingencies for the local component were based on esti-
mates of the Brazilian price escalation index (measured in ORTN) of 10% in
1! 8% on pipes and meters, 5% on pumps, 8-16% on other equipments.

1981, 9% in 1982, and 8% in 1983 and thereafter. Price contingencies for
the foreign component were estimated at 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982, and 7.5% in
1983 and 1984.
6.16      About 200 man-months of consultant services are included for the
technical assistance to COSAN (at about US$6,500 per man-month). Comple-
tion (Table 6.1) of final engineering designs, construction supervision
and management consultants to be hired by the SWCs will require about 6,000
man-months of consultant services at an estimated total cost of US$37
million. The average man-month cost (US$6,200), which represents the man-
month rate as billed by the consulting firm for individuals, includes:
salaries, social costs, travel, and the firm's overhead and profits. The
SWCs charge most consultant services for final engineering designs and
construction supervision to each subproject as an engineering cost.  Be-
cause of the technical ability of local consulting firms (often working in
joint ventures with foreign firms), no direct expatriate consultants' in-
put is expected with the exception of the management consultants for COSAN.
Project Financing
6.17      The SWC investment programs are to be financed by loans from BNH
and the FAEs (para. 3.09 to 3.10). The Bank Loan of US$180 million would
finance the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project, representing
30.6% of the total cost of the project. The balance would be financed by
BNH funds (19.4%) and loans from the FAEs (50%). -In addition to the normal
commitment of the Federal Government, assurances will be provided by the
State Governments to guarantee the funds necessary to carry out the pro-
posed project on schedule.
6.18      The Bank loan will be made to BNH with the guarantee of the
Government. As a condition of disbursement, each State Bank and SWC will
sign separate subsidiary loan agreements (in the form of a carta reversal
expanding the PLANASA agreement) with BNH, including all general loan
conditions and the specific covenants for each SWC.  The signing of the
first agreement satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness.
The Loan will be allocated as follows but transfers of allocated funds
between the SWC projects would be subject to revision depending on the
actual execution schedule of each SWC:

Project Implementation
6.19      The executing agencies for the project will be COSAMA, COSANPA,
CAGEPA, SANEAGO, SANESUL and CAESB for programs in the project states, and
BNH for the technical assistance program to COSAN.   The individual sub-
projects are being prepared and would be supervised 1/ by competent con-
sultants retained by the SWCs.   BNH would delegate overall construction
supervision and SWC assistance to the OTs. 2/ OTs are independent tech-
nical agencies contracted by BNH to review basic preparation and supervi-
sion documents.  BNH has responsibility for coordinating the entire pro-
ject, for the financial and economic evaluation, and for the technical
assistance of the SWCs.
6.20      The project will be implemented during 1981-84.  Annual project
investments are presented in Annexes 5 and 6.   These investment tables
agreed upon will form the basis for progress reporting. The construction
schedule (Annex 19) is compatible with the executing capabilities of each
SWC. The project would be completed by December 31, 1984. The closing date
would be June 30, 1985, to allow for processing pending applications.
6.21      The Bank will review and approve all subprojects in cities with
estimated investments of US$8 million or more.   The aggregate of these
subprojects would represent about 70% of the programmed investments but
only about 10% of the total number of subprojects. Subprojects in cities
in which the estimated investment is less than US$8 million would be
approved by BNH subject to ex-post Bank review on a selective basis. This
delegation of authority to BNH to approve subprojects of less than US$8
million is consistent with the institutional capabilities of BNH and in
agreement with present Bank intentions to give BNH more responsibility for
appraisal and supervision of Bank-financed projects.
Supervision
6.22      The project should strengthen BNH and consolidate Bank and BNH
work so that sector loans could become a reality.   Project objectives,
covenants and future supervision have been conceived with that purpose.
1/   Supervision of minor works is carried out by the SWC with its own
staff.
2/ The OTs for the project states are:
Amazonas and      - CETESB (Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento
Mato Grosso         Ambiental).
Federal District - FEEMA (Fundacao Estadual de Eng. do Meio
and Goias           Ambiente).
Para              - DNOS (Departmento Nacional de Obras de
Saneamento).
Paraiba           - SUDENE (Superintendencia Desenvolvimento do Nord-
este).



- 30 -
BNH has agreed to take an increased role in project supervision, including
procurement and subproject review which would allow to sustain present
lending levels to the sector with reasonable Bank manpower input.  Bank
traditional supervision is not feasible, and a large part of supervision
will be delegated to BNH.  To this end, COSAN personnel and organization
will be reinforced (para. 3.05). Bank supervision effort should focus on
the improvement of COSAN's management and on the major institutional prob-
lems of the SWCs (para.  6.09).  COSAN  is legally entitled to control the
operating expenses of the SWCs. Several deficiencies of the SWCs (Annex
14) should then be corrected by proper supervision of COSAN with Bank
participation,  as needed:   reduction of personnel per connection,  re-
duction of accounts receivable, control of leaks and illegal connections,
improvement of billing, statistics and demand forecasts, improvement of
the progressivity of some tariffs and elimination of billing distortions,
betterment of cost accounting and higher accuracy of intermediary annual
financial statements, etc. Expected improvements are shown in Annex 12,
"Monitoring Indicators" (para. 7.29).   Adequate Bank supervision, espe-
cially during the first two years, is considered essential for project
success. The Bank's supervision effort 1/ has been estimated at about 35
staff-weeks (SWs) for Bank fiscal year 1982 and at 28 SWs per year there-
after (para.  8.13).  Assurances were obtained from BNH that its staff will
make semiannual field supervisions of each project SWC, and will submit to
the Bank (by April 30 and October 31 of each year) a satisfactory report
on the status of project implementation, financial projections, compliance
with Bank covenants, monitoring indicators and measures taken and to be
taken to improve the SWCs' efficiency.
Procurement
6.23      Purchases of project goods and services will be processed under
contracts awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines and on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Civil works contracts under US$3 mil-
lion and contracts for equipment or materials under US$0.5 million, how-
ever, may be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
and in accordance with local procurement procedures which are acceptable
to the Bank.  In cases of use of local procedures, submissions from inter-
national contractors and suppliers for bidding advertised locally will not
be precluded. BNH has already made available to the Bank a general pro-
curement notice which was published on January 16, 1981 in the Development
Forum. Assurances were obtained that BNH will update the notice annually
as long as any goods or works remain to be processed.
11 Supervision requirements have been estimated as follows: one or two
visits per year to each SWC (for the first year of project implementation
and one visit per year to each SWC thereafter).   Number of missions per
year (including wrap-up with BNH), three the first year and two thereafter;
two staff members per mission.   Each field trip will be of about three
weeks. BTO report, project and procurement review to be done in head-
quarters would be three-four weeks per mission.



- 31 -
6.24      The Bank will have prior review and approval of invitation to bid
and of proposed awards for all civil works contracts estimated to cost US$3
million or more, and for all equipment contracts estimated to cost US$0.5
million or more. For all other contracts, BNH will submit to the Bank for
review copies of each contract together with the respective bidding docu-
ments, bid analysis report and recommendations for award. In evaluation of
bids for equipment and materials, local bidders will be allowed a margin of
preference of either 15% of the CIF price or the applicable import duty,
whichever is lower.   It is expected that all civil works will be won by
local contractors.  It is also expected that the bulk of the contracts for
the purchase of equipment and materials will be awarded to Brazilian firms
or Brazilian subsidiaries of foreign suppliers. Contracts for consulting
services to be financed by the Bank will be awarded in accordance with Bank
guidelines, "Uses of Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers -April
1974."   It is expected  that all contracts for engineering design and
supervision will be awarded to local firms.
Disbursement
6.25      The loan will be disbursed on the average as follows:
(a) 59% of BNH's disbursements to SWCs on eligible subprojects
or on SWC technical assistance programs;l/
(b) 29.5% of BNH's disbursements to the states under the FINEST
II line of credit for approved subprojects;
(c) 59% of BNH's disbursements to the states under the FINEST
III line of credit for programs in small communities;
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures and 50% of local expenditures
for consulting services for the technical assistance program
to COSAN; and
(e) 29.5% of Federal or State grants allocated to the SWCs for
water or sewerage subprojects in which at least 70% of the
population benefitted are urban poor. 2/
6.26      Agreement was obtained during negotiations that Bank disburse-
ments will be increased from 59% to 72% and from 29.5% to 36% until
December 31, 1982 or when Bank disbursements reach US$80 million, which-
ever is first, in recognition of the Government's vigorous efforts to
contain public investment expenditures.   The disbursement rate would be
adjusted thereafter so that the average disbursement rate (para.   6.25)
would be achieved.
1/  The percentage disbursed is reduced by 2.7% financial or technical
charges included in BNH disbursements.
2/ Families with an income lower than three minimum salaries.



- 32 -
6.27      In order to reduce the interval during which BNH would finance
the Bank's share of project cost with its own resources, and the underdis-
bursement of the Bank loan under high local inflation rates, BNH may
request the Bank to make advance payments from the loan account into a
Special Account, to be opened in US dollars in the Banco Central do Brasil,
and would be available for financing only the Bank's share of the project
cost.   The amount deposited in the Special Account may be increased or
decreased by the Bank as required for project execution, but should not
exceed US$12 million.  BNH would be entitled to make withdrawals from the
Special Account at the exchange rate applicable on the day the expenditures
were made. Loan disbursements will be made against a statement of expendi-
tures prepared by BNH for each subproject, the detailed documentation of
which will not be submitted for Bank review, but will be retained by the
beneficiary and made available for inspection during the course of super-
vision missions.  No works or force account are envisaged.  Disbursement
procedures are explained in Annex 7. The estimated schedule of disburse-
ments, to be completed before June 30, 1985, is shown in Annex 20.
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing
6.28      The SWCs included in the Multistate Project have to carry out
several high-priority works, which the SWCs and the Government believe
should be started as soon as possible.   If works are delayed until loan
signature, about one million urban poor would suffer unnecessary delays in
obtaining critically needed water and sewerage services.   BNH has re-
quested Bank authorization for advance contracting of about 15% of total
works to be bid between between February 1 and June 30, 1981, and retro-
active financing for works executed in this period.   Given the urgent
foreign exchange needs of the country and the importance to the BNH budget
of Bank reimbursements, these subprojects will have to be delayed if the
Bank does not approve BNH's request. Advance contracting for an aggregate
amount of US$90.0 million is proposed.   The works on the capital cities
proposed for advance contracting are shown in Annex 21.  Retroactive fi-
nancing is included for works in these cities executed under authorized
advance contracting up to a maximum Bank disbursement of US$7 million (3.9%
of the loan amount).
Environmental Aspects
6.29      Since the expansion of water supply systems leads to increased
volumes of sewage, it would be necessary to construct additional disposal
facilities within the next few years. This is particularly urgent in the
city of Belem where sewage discharge is causing water quality to deterio-
rate beyond permissible standards (para. 5.05). The project will help to
expand sewerage services in several large and medium cities and prepare
sewerage master plans (para. 5.11) for the capital cities of Manaus, Belem,
Goiania and Campo Grande.  The project will help to control pollution in
Paranoa Lake (Brasilia) by the expansion of secondary treatment facilities
and the construction of some tertiary processing facilities.   The con-
struction of oxidation ponds to treat sewage before discharge in other
communities of the Brasilia metropolitan area will help to reduce envi-
ronmental pollution and health hazards.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
The Borrower
7.01       BNH is a Federal Government-owned banking institution dedicated
to development in the areas of low-cost housing, urban development, and
sanitation.  Its total assets at the end of 1979 were US$11 billion.  BNH's
primary source of funds is an 8% employee payroll contribution (Employee
Indemnity Fund, FGTS) from all nongovernment employees covered by labor
legislation (para. 3.02).   Other sources of funds include interest and
principal repayments from existing loans and investments, sale of Govern-
ment securities and deposits.
Past and Present Finances
7.02       BNH financial statements are summarized and expressed in US dol-
lars in Tables 7.1 and 7.2.  Details are given in Annex 8.  BNH's growth
during 1971-78 has been outstanding; its loan portfolio expanded 670% (40%
p.a.) and total assets grew by 570% (37% p.a.). Net receipts of the FGTS
program increased at a rate of 33% p.a. During the same period, operating
revenues grew at a rate of 34% p.a., operating expenses at 39% p.a. and net
income at 24% p.a.  BNH's annual lending reached US$3.1 billion equivalent
in 1979, which was a year of relatively slow growth in which FGTS receipts
only increased by 5%. BNH's operating expenses in 1978-79 averaged about
6% of the investment portfolio.l/
7.03       BNH requires that all its loans be guaranteed by state or muni-
cipal governments or financial institutions, or secured by mortgages. At
the end of 1979, BNH's equity was a satisfactory 13% of its total port-
folio.  BNH's major source of funds and liability is the FGTS which in-
creases by about US$1.0 billion per year. BNH's long-term debt of US$507
million equivalent was very low (15% of total assets), and debt service
represented only 1% of its net income.   BNH's creditworthiness is very
good.  The need for funds to finance housing and sanitation programs is
continuously increasing.   BNH is therefore asking the Federal Government
authorization to seek additional external funds.
7.04       Although BNH lending is very impressive (US$15 billion in the
last 9 years), BNH's rate of growth has slowed since 1975 due to the
Government policy on adjusting the ORTN. Prior to 1973, the revaluation of
the ORTN was closely related to the wholesale price index and maintained
its value regardless of inflation.   During recent years,  the ORTN has
been an instrument of monetary policy rather than an index of prices. The
increase in general prices (IGP) and the ORTN dliffered by 6.7% in 1976,
1/ The number of employees increased 15% during 1978, to 4,300. In 1980,
the number of employees is 4,500.

1/  Figures for 1979 expressed in dollars are highly distorted due to the sudden 30% devaluation on December
10,1979; the average exchange rate used for income and cash flow (27.58) differs greatly (53%) from the end of
the year rate (42.33) used for the balance sheet.

6.6% in 1977, 3.4% in 1978, 20.5% in 1979, and almost 40% in 1980 (Annex
9). Starting in 1981, the Government intends to maintain a close rela-
tionship between consumer price  (INPC)  increases and the ORTN.   BNH's
financial position is protected against inflation since all its lending
and liabilities are denominated in UPCs, and even short-term cash sur-
pluses are immediately converted to ORTN.
7.05       BNH's  lending terms  for the sanitation sector reflect social
rather than commercial considerations. Interest rates on BNH loans in the
sector vary from 2.0% p.a. to 7.0% p.a. The lower rates are applicable to
the poorer states (Annex 3).
BNH's Financial Projections
7.06       Each year, BNH prepares and presents  to the Ministry of the
Interior a three-year investment program expressed in UPC. Since 1980, the
Federal Government has taken direct control of and has been applying rigid
norms to the budget of decentralized Government institutions. Under these
norms, the budget for the following year should be prepared in cruzeiros at
the officially forecast inflation rate (52.4% for 1981) and presented to
the Planning Ministry (SEST) for approval. In 1980, the inflation rate,
officially forecast at 50%, reached 110%. Because of the limited budgetary
adjustment allowed by the Government, the investment programs of many
institutions have been considerably reduced. -
7.07       BNH's budget has not been as limited as those of other institu-
tions because the institution relies on its own resources. BNH investment
commitments, however, have been reduced. The reduction has caused concern
about the availability of counterpart funds for ongoing and future Bank
projects.   BNH financing for Bank projects, inc:Luding the proposed pro-
ject, would require a BNH commitment in 1981 of about US$720 million (19%
of BNH's preliminary investment budget).
7.08       BNH has shown local resources separat(ely from Bank reimburse-
ments in its budget. Thus the total BNH budget, including allocations to
COSAN and each SWC, depends now on the amount of Bank reimbursements, and
counterpart funds for the execution of Bank-financed projects have been
given the highest priority.  At the same time, the Government has estab-
lished priority budgetary allocations for projects with foreign counter-
part funds. COSAN's budget for 1981 has been increased in the same pro-
portion as the expected amount of Bank reimbursements.   In view of the
magnitude and number of Bank-financed subprojects, it is important to
review annually with BNH the amount of counterpart funds to be included in
the following year's budget (para. 2.11).
7.09       Preliminary data for 1980-82 indicates (Table 7.3) that invest-
ments on the order of US$13 billion are likely.   These would continue

to be financed largely by FGTS receipts and cash generated by BNH's
operations.

The Beneficiaries
7.10      The beneficiaries of this project are generally weaker than
those participating in previous Bank projects. The project SWCs are sub-
ject to large urban growth rates, expensive supplies because of the long
distance to manufacturing centers, difficulties in attracting and recruit-
ing professional staff, and lower per capita income. The project SWCs are
also more complex to manage than usual Bank project beneficiaries, since
they are responsible for one to several hundred cities scattered over wide
areas. They are relatively large companies with budgets of US$25-50 mil-
lion per year and staffs of 850 to 2,500 persons.
7.11      Considerable progress has been achieved in recent years.   The
SWCs now have planning departments which prepare the annual EVGs. Account-
ing, billing, payroll and, sometimes, inventories are computerized and
cost control measures are being implemented. Financial data, however, are
still not fully reliable, and financial statements are processed two or
three months late.  Asset revaluation, depreciation and social benefits
are frequently not adjusted until the end of the year making difficult the
interpretation of intermediary results. Under these conditions, standard



- 37 -
accounting becomes difficult to interpret meaningfully, and budgetary con-
trol is very difficult.   Wide variation in inflation forecasts makes it
preferable to present SWC financial statements in ORTN. ORTN projections
have the additional advantage that the fixed assets are by law maintained
in ORTN, and the SWC debt service payments are expr,essed in UPC.
7.12      When the SWCs were created (between 1973-79), the nominal value
of fixed assets transferred by the municipalities was recorded in books.
Incomplete fixed asset inventories and valuation, lack of correct accumu-
lated depreciation and absence of records on assets contributed by users
made the fixed assets records and estimated rates of return very inac-
curate. Assurances were be obtained from BNH that an inventory and satis-
factory valuation of fixed assets of the beneficiary SWCs will be incor-
porated in the SWCs' financial statements not later than December 31, 1982.
Revenue Covenant
7.13      Bank revenue covenants vary widely among the different projects
and are difficult to monitor  (Annex 9).   The recently enacted Tariff
Law I/provides for the sector's financial viability and its fulfillment is
being used as a target for the last two Loans 1823-BR and 1850-BR.   For
consistency within sector lending to the same Borrower and in view of
Brazilian Tariff Law, agreement will be sought in th,e near future with BNH
and the remaining signatories of prior Bank loan agreements to extend the
proposed covenant (para. 7.15) to all SWCs being financed by the Bank.
7.14      The Tariff Law requires the revenues of each SWC to be sufficient
to cover operating expenses, plus depreciation and debt service, starting
in 1983. This target is to be met progressively. Under the Brazilian Law,
the net income after depreciation (income which would produce the annual
rate of return) should be at least equal to the debt service; the maximum
annual financial rate of return on revalued fixed assets is 12%.
7.15      The Brazilian Law would normally result in excess cash since SWC
investments are 100% financed and normal working capital requirements
(about 1% of gross assets) should be lower than the depreciation rate of
fully revalued assets.   Current assets (especially accounts receivable)
are, however, not indexed, and delays in billing and collecting represent
losses in real terms. On the other hand, fixed assets are being revalued
using the ORTN index which has been increasing more slowly than inflation,
and the depreciation rate is below 2% of gross fixed assets in several
SWCs.  Thus, unless accounts receivable are properly collected and fixed
assets and depreciation realistically computed (para. 7.12), the SWCs
could end up with cash deficits rather than surpluses. The implementation
of the Brazilian Tariff Law in well managed SWCs guarantees their cash
needs and produces satisfactory rates of return.   For purposes of the
revenue covenant, it is desirable to obtain the Tariff Law objectives as
soon as possible (i.e. by 1981 rather than 1983). However, this would
1/ Law No. 6528 dated May 11, 1978 and Decree No. 82587 dated
November 6, 1978.



- 38 -
require excessively high tariff increases in real terms in some SWCs and
consequently interim financial objectives are necessary. Assurances were
obtained from the Federal Government, and BNH that the SWCs not meeting the
Tariff Law in 1981-82 will raise tariffs by at least one-third of the gap
required to comply with law in 1981, and at least two-thirds in 1982, and
that the revenues of the SWCs will satisfy the Tariff Law requirements not
later that 1983.  Satisfactory interim tariff increases for 1981 for all
SWCs being financed by the Bank were implemented before loan negotiations.
Tariff
7.16      Tariff structures for the SWCs are basically similar, with resi-
dential, commercial, industrial and public consumer categories as indi-
cated in Annex 22.  All tariff structures are progressive, with the pro-
gressivity ratio for residential consumption ranging from 1.8 to 2.5.
Tariffs for residential users are lower than for other categories.  Un-
metered consumers are charged the minimum in some SWCs while in others the
charges are based on an estimated consumption related to the physical
characteristics of the house.   The Bank has presented to BNH and the
Government several recommendations to improve the tariff structure (lower-
ing the volume at which maximum excess charges are levied, unifying the
minimum volume at 10 m3, increasing progressivity, unifying sewerage
charges as 100% of water charges, eliminating distortions between metered
and unmetered users).   These recommendations have been.accepted and are
being implemented by BNH. The tariff structures are applicable to both the
capital cities and interior municipalities. No attempts have been made to
relate charges to marginal costs.   The agreed subproject selection cri-
teria (para. 6.06) would provide statistical data on the marginal cost of
water and sewerage services in the different cities covered by each SWC.
The availability of more accurate data would allow higher charges to be
established for excess consumption in those cities with higher costs.
Average water charges are relatively high,l/ with the exception of CAESB
(the Federal District) because of past subsidies to Brasilia.   During
project execution, the high tariffs in Amazonas (COSAMA) would be reduced
in real terms. Tariffs in other states would be increased during project
execution to between US$0.10/m3 and US$0.25/m3 in September 1980 prices.
Future Finances
7.17      Financial projections for the six SWCs and the assumptions for
financial projections are presented in Annex 9. Financial statements are
presented in ORTN (para. 7.04), dividing the current value of cruzeiros by
1/ For water only the average charges in US$/m3 of September 1980 were:
COSAMA 0.30, COSANPA 0.15, CAGEPA 0.17, SANEAGO 0.13, SANESUL 0.13, CAESB
0.09. Sewerage charges generally duplicate the water tariff. These levels
of tariffs are generally higher than in other cities in Latin American
countries.

the applicable rate of the ORTN.1/ For 1981 and thereafter, the Government
intends to adjust the ORTN pari passu with the INPC. The historical dif-
ferences between the INPC and the general price index (IGP) in Brazil (8-
10% p.a.) are expected to continue, and financial projections have there-
fore been escalated at 10% for 1981, 9% for 1982 and 8% thereafter (Annex
9). Nevertheless, some expenses (unit salaries) are adjusted by law with
the INPC while others (energy price) are assumed to increase at a somewhat
faster rate than general inflation.   Financial assumptions are given in
Annex 9. A summary of selected financial data is presented in Table 7.4.
7.18      Under the agreed revenue covenant, the financial position of all
SWCs would be satisfactory. COSAMA, COSANPA and SANESUL are expected to
comply with the Tariff Law in 1981 and SANEAGO in 1982, while CAGEPA and
CAESB would fully achieve the Tariff Law targets by 1983.   In the past,
Federal and state grants, as well as BNH loans for working capital, have
provided funds needed to compensate for insufficient tariff adjustments.
States grants finance 70% of the water supply investments in small communi-
ties.   During the period of construction of the proposed project, some
additional grants have been budgeted by the state governments (especially
those of Paraiba and Mato Grosso do Sul) as well as by the Federal Dis-
trict.   Grants  (including those for small communities)  are assumed to
finance not more than 5% of investments after 1983.
7.19      The Bank has not been financing the foreign exchange component
of grant-financed sanitation works. Efficiency in the allocation of Fed-
eral and State grants distributed through BNH would be improved if these
grants are applied for poverty alleviation and to induce the SWCs to
provide services in poor areas which normally have low financial returns.
The foreign exchange component of grant-financed subprojects would be
financed by the Bank, if at least 70% of the subproject beneficiaries are
urban poor (family income below three minimum salaries).
7.20      The only risk to the financial viability of the project SWCs
after the application of appropriate subproject selection criteria would
be the implementation of indiscriminate Government price controls and
ceilings in tariff increases. Given the small effect of water cost on con-
sumer budgets and inflation indices, this risk is considered moderate.
COSAMA (Amazonas)
7.21      Amazonas is one of the poorest states in Brazil but has the
highest water tariff (US$0.30/m3).   The high tariff level is caused by
excessive personnel, high unaccounted-for water and unproductive invest-
ments.  Although major sewerage networks were installed in Manaus at the
beginning of this century, the population rebelled against sewerage tar-
iffs, and the first connections were started only at end of 1980. Future

tariffs are expected to be lower in real terms.  COSAMA's financial posi-
tion should be satisfactory, improving its working ratio 1/ from 74% in
1980 to 55% in 1984, and reaching reasonable liquidity and a debt capi-
talization ratio of 83%. COSAMA's annual rate of return would be about 7%
on revalued  fixed assets.   During the period 1980-84,  unaccounted-for
water should be reduced from 59% to 35%, while the number of employees per
thousand water connections would decrease from 8.6 to 7.3.
COSANPA (Para)
7.22       COSANPA's water  and sewerage  service  levels are very low in
water and sewerage (63% and 5.6%, respectively). The low service levels are
the result of reduced investments caused by the lack of state counterpart
funds. Considerable investments are needed to maintain present levels of
service.   COSANPA should meet  the Tariff Law objectives and achieve a
satisfactory financial position starting in 1981. Its working ratio would
be progressively reduced from 84% in 1981 to 59% by 1984, while its capi-
talization ratio (71%) and its debt service ratio (1.6) would be practi-
cally constant  during project execution.   An annual rate of return on
revalued fixed assets of about 6.5% would be achieved  in this period.
Unaccounted-for water, now disguised by the method of estimating part of
volumes billed, will be subject to analysis and Leak detection control
(para. 6.07(f)).
CAGEPA (Paraiba)
7.23       CAGEPA was the first SWC to achieve the PLANASA goals. The large
number of small- and medium-size towns (327), the higher cost of providing
water in the Northeast and insufficient tariff adjustments created a dif-
ficult financial position in 1980, requiring state grants equivalent to
29% of the operating revenues. Even so, accounts payable are excessively
high,  reducing the current ratio to 0.5.   The pe!riod 1981-83 would be
critical. To obtain financial viability, tariff increases of about 40% in
real terms should be implemented between 1980-83..  The increases would
reduce the working ratio from 94% to 60% and increase the annual financial
rate of return on revalued fixed assets from -2% to 8.5%.   During this
period sewerage investments  for medium-size cities not included in the
project would depend on state contributions. After 1983, CAGEPA's finan-
cial position would be fully satisfactory.
SANEAGO (Goias)
7.24       Goias is a poor state with 223 cities subject to rapid urban
growth due to an intensive agricultural colonization process.   SANEAGO's
service levels are the lowest of all SWCs.   Investment during 1980 would
quadruple its fixed assets, while maintaining a capitalization ratio of
about 80%.   SANEAGO's efficiency requires improvement and the ratio of
1/ Operating cost without depreciation as a percentage of operating
revenues.



- 42 -
employees per thousand water connections should be reduced from 12.7 to 9.5
between 1980-84.   The achievement of these targets should be carefully
followed up during supervision. Distortions of the estimated water con-
sumption by unmetered connections make it impossible to determine the
level of unaccounted-for water and results in inflated tariffs.   BNH is
aware of this problem and is taking gradual measures to correct it. After
reaching the revenue level of the Tariff Law in 1982, SANEAGO's financial
position would be satisfactory with annual financial rates of return on
revalued fixed assets of about 7%, capitalization ratios of about 80%, debt
service ratios above 1.5 and decreasing working ratios (57% by 1984).
SANESUL (Mato Grosso do Sul)
7.25      SANESUL was created in 1979 after the state of Mato Grosso was
divided. SANESUL was capitalized by the State, which took over most of the
previous debt service, rescheduled some loans, and is planning to provide
additional contributions to urgently needed works.   SANESUL gross fixed
assets would increase eight times between 1980-84. SANESUL would meet the
Tariff Law target by 1981. SANESUL's financial performance should improve
rapidly as a result of the benefits of projects under execution or to be
executed and tariff increases of about 30% in real terms between 1980-84.
During this period, the annual financial rate of return on revalued fixed
assets would increase from -18% to 5.9%, and the working ratio would
decrease from 131% to 54%.  The debt service *ratio would be satisfactory
(above 1.7) while debt/capitalization would increase from 37% to 78%.
CAESB (Federal District)
7.26      As is the case with most institutions operating in the Federal
District, CAESB has depended on federal grants for operation and invest-
ment funds. The architectural design of Brasilia results in high sanita-
tion unit costs.l/ CAESB's tariffs had been the lowest in Brazil. Fur-
thermore, lack of proper administration resulted in excessive number of
employees, billing of nonexistent consumers, large uncollectable accounts
receivable and unreliable data for project planning. Substantial improve-
ments have taken place during 1980: CAESB employees have been reduced by
250 persons (10%), billings have been straightened out, accounts receiv-
able are being reduced (should reach about two months' billing by 1984),
and planning has been established, the average tariffs (US$0.09/m3) are
almost three times higher than in 1979.
7.27      Although grants  to CAESB would be phased out during project
execution, important investments in water distribution and sewerage are
still planned with contributions from the Federal Government or urban
1/ The number of meters of water or sewerage networks per person in the
"Plano Piloto" is about 4m, or almost three times the amount needed in
other cities.

developers. CAESB is expected to comply with the Tariff Law by 1983, with
tariff increases between 1980-84 of about 20% in real terms. During this
period, the working ratio would decrease from 71% to 54%, the debt service
ratio would be about 1.6, and the debt capitalization ratio would increase
from 45% to 64%. CAESB's annual financial rate of return on revalued fixed
assets would be around 6%.
Financing Plan
7.28      The financing plan for the six project SWCs during project im-
plementation (1981-84) is summarized in Table 7.6. As in all sanitation
companies in Brazil, BNH and the State Water and Sewerage Revolving Fund
(FAE) will equally finance most capital expenditures, including engineer-
ing and administrative expense and interest during construction. BNH and
FAE would finance 85.6% of the capital expenditures while federal, state
and urban developers'  contributions would finance 9.7%.   Internal cash
generation would be sufficient to cover debt service requirements, working
capital, and about 4.7% of capital expenditures. Bank reimbursements to
BNH would finance about 18.9% of the total investment and 30.6% of the
project works.
Monitoring Indicators/Reporting Requirements
7.29      As in previous loans, in order to permit the satisfactory moni-
toring of investment program and financing plans, assurances were obtained
from BNH that the SWCs will:
(a)  prepare five-year financial projections to be delivered to the
Bank before April 30 of each year, expressed in ORTN. The pro-
jections would include an income statement, statement of cash
flow, balance sheet with details on water and sewerage demand,
and programmed investments by cities;
(b)  establish, not later than December 31, 1981, a system of moni-
toring indicators and executing targets satisfactory to the Bank
(Annex 12).  Under this system, each SWC would provide a semi-
annual progress report which would include:
(i)   data on progress of project implementation, including de-
tails on design completion, physical execution of the works,
forecast project cost and disbursements tables;
(ii) statistical data on the number of water and sewer con-
nections, volume of metered water billed, total and unit
volume of water and sewerage billed, average tariffs, per-
centage of population served, number of employees, em-
ployees per 1,000 connections, percentage unaccounted-for
water;



- 45 -
(iii) financial ratios (percentage of working ratio, percentage
of accounts receivable, rate of return);
(c)  prepare a report  satisfactory to BNH and to the Bank on the
execution and initial operation of the project, not later than
three months after the loan closing date. BNH will be responsi-
ble for the preparation and submission to the Bank of the Project
Completion Report on the project within four months of loan
closing.
VIII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
8.01       The economic benefits of a water supply and sewerage project are
necessarily underestimated, as many benefits are not meaningfully quanti-
fiable in monetary terms. Other benefits, (for example, enhanced property
values), cannot always be attributed to the project alone. Some well-known
benefits, such as improvement of public health, increases in effective
nutrition due to reduced internal parasites, greater well-being of the
population and effects of progressive tariffs on the distribution of in-
come and services, are simply not taken into consideriation. Therefore, the
rates of return are not comparable with those obtained in some other
sectors. The project supports Government efforts to achieve more balanced
urban development and will provide sorely needed water and sewerage ser-
vices to some of the most deprived regions in Brazil.
8.02       Project preparation and execution should contribute greatly to
the strengthening of BNH and the executing agencies  (SWCs).   The most
important aspect of this is BNH's agreement to issue sound economic guide-
lines for least-cost analysis and subproject select-ion. These guidelines
(para. 6.06) will be applied to all projects financed by BNH.
Least-Cost Analysis
8.03       Least-cost  solutions  for all  state capitals  and the city of
Campina Grande (Paraiba) were analyzed in detail.   As a result of these
analyses, investments for the first stages of water supply subprojects in
Belem, Joao Pessoa, and Manaus, and the sewage treatment in Brasilia were
greatly reduced.   Appropriate methods  for least-cost analysis will be
incorporated in all feasibility reports presented to BNH (para. 6.06).
Rates of Return and Marginal Cost
8.04       A detailed economic analysis was made of each of the state capi-
tals (details in Annex 11).  A similar analysis was made of the overall

investment program in each SWC.  The overall analyses are considered to be
only rough estimates since the SWCs' investments include dozens of cities
for which only preliminary feasibility reports are available.   Further-
more, it is difficult to exclude costs unrelated to incremental benefits,
or to determine the average design horizon (year after which volume sold
and population benefited are no longer results of the project) from the
consolidated information.  The final feasibility study of each subproject
in medium and small cities will follow the agreed criteria for proper
evaluation based on marginal cost methodology (para. 6.06).
8.05       The analysis uses a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.15 and a
shadow labor rate of 0.90.   In some cities,  some small investments not
related to incremental benefits (such as pipe replacement, maintenance
equipment or studies for future projects) have been excluded from the
analysis. The results of the analysis of the margina:L cost for water supply
at an opportunity cost of capital of 11% in January 1981 prices are sum-
marized in Table 8.1. The results for the capital cities are satisfactory:
(a) the investment per equivalent person served 1/ averages US$100 per
capita; (b) the marginal cost per cubic meter sold averages US$0.20; and
(c) the covenanted average tariffs per cubic meter sold are about 110% of
the marginal cost.  Rough estimates of the overall marginal cost for the
SWC (Table 8.1) show that present tariff levels are close (92%) to the
marginal cost while the covenanted tariffs during project execution would
be even closer (99%).   This indicates that average tariffs would have
satisfactory levels in terms of resource allocation, even though minimum
consumption charges are subsidized to make them affordable to the urban
poor (para. 7.16). Excess consumption is charged at tariffs about 50-80%
higher than the average.
8.06       The marginal cost for Campo Grande, the capital of Mato Grosso do
Sul, is relatively high (US$0.31/m3). The average covenanted tariffs are
72% of the marginal cost, while excess consumption is 120% of the marginal
cost.  The marginal cost and the investment per equivalent person served 1/
(US$179) are high because of expensive water sources (para. 5.04) and the
effect of investments in distribution that under present rationing are
assumed to result  in additional sales only after 1983.   Nevertheless,
thousands of persons would be served through the new connections, but the
amount  of water  provided would be  somewhat  limited.   It is therefore
acceptable to include the Campo Grande subproject in the project although
it does not comply with the agreed eligibility criteria (para 6.06). For
the   same   reasons   the   rate   of   return   for   Campo   Grande   under
1/ The number of persons served increases annually until the project design
horizon is reached. The equivalent number of persons served is the annual
number (at a discount rate of 11%), which would be served during the life
of the project.

the covenanted tariffs would be 8% for water supply, which is satisfactory
since many economic benefits cannot be quantified (para. 8.01). The rate
of return in Brasilia (9%) is relatively low because of the high ratio
between kilometers of pipelines and connections resulting from its urban
layout, and of past grants (and low debt service) requiring low tariffs for
financial viability.
8.07      Rates of return for the capital cities and for the SWCs as a
whole have been calculated using covenanted tariff levels as a proxy for
economic benefits (Table 8.2).   The forecasted tariff levels and volume
sold are considered feasible by the Bank and the Government. The rate of
return obtained are satisfactory. The weighted average rate of return for
investments in the capital cities (representing 78% of the total project)
is 13% for water and 12% for water and sewerage.  Rough estimates of the
rate of return on total investment at covenanted tariff levels are 10% for
water supply and 10% for water and sewerage.
8.08      These results are moderately sensitive to increases in project
cost or decreases in benefits. For the capital cities, the rate of return
for water supply decreases to 12% with an increase of 10% on project cost,
and to 10% if projects' benefits are reduced 10% simultaneously (Table
8.2).   Higher variations are unlikely.   The use of the present tariff
levels as a proxy for economic benefits reduce the weighted average rate of
return for water on the capital cities to 12%, and to 8% for the SWCs,
showing that tariff increases are required in some states, particularly
Mato Grosso do Sul and the Federal District. The rate of return calculated
using tariffs reflect only a part of the project benefits.  The results of
the rate of return can get closer to the economic rate of return of the
project if the consumer surplus is included.  Bank experience shows that
when necessary, the population is willing to pay much higher prices for
smaller volumes of water. In the project SWCs, water purchased from street
vendors by urban poor for consumption of 20-30 1 per capita reaches prices
4 to 6 times higher than the present average tariffs. At about four times
the average price for this low consumption, the benefits measured by the
rate of return are only about 45% of the total benefits, including the
consumer surplus (Annex 11). The weighted average rate of return for water
supply, including consumer surplus (Table 8.2), is estimated at 23% for the
capital cities and 17% for the SWCs.
Population Benefited and Urban Poverty Impact
8.09       It is estimated that by 1984, the project will serve about 2.5
million new consumers with piped water, increasing population coverage
from 60% (in 1980) to 73%, and the number of persons served by 52% (Table
8.4).   The project will also provide present users with improved water
quality, service pressure and reliability . By 1984, the project will also

extend sewerage services to about 0.6 million new consumers, increasing
the coverage from 15% to 21%, and increasing the number of persons served
by 39%. Follow-up sewerage projects will be studied during project execu-
tion. After project completion, the benefits and population served will
continue to grow. The small investments required to achieve this would be
partially financed by users' contributions. A rough estimate of the equi-
valent number of persons to be served during the total project's useful
life is about 4.6 million 1/ for water and 1.0 million for sewerage.
8.10       In the capital cities, the project will provide water to about
1.25 million new consumers,2/ increasing the coverage from 67% in 1980 to
81% by 1984, (increasing the number of persons served by 43%). During the
same period, sewerage services will serve 0.5 million new consumers, in-
creasing the coverage from 20% to 30%, (increasing the number of persons
served by 54%).
8.11      The impact of the project on the poverty groups,  defined as
families earning three minimum salaries (ORTN $9.2 or US$80 per month) or
less was estimated for the capital cities (Table 8.3).  About 60% of the
urban poor will have water connections by 1984. About 785,000 or about 63%
of the new customers to be benefitted from the project belong to the
poverty group.   Sewerage investments are limited to densely populated
areas, where reliance on individual solutions such as septic tanks and
latrines is not feasible.   About 48,000 urban poor (10% of the incre
mental population to be served) will be included among sewerage subproject
beneficiaries in the capital cities.
Affordability of Project Services
8.12      The Tariff Law specifies that the minimum monthly charge for
water should not exceed 35% of one ORTN (US$4.06), and the combined charge
for water and sewerage should not exceed 50% of one ORTN (US$5.80). The
existing monthly charges for minimum consumption of water range from 21% to
68% (average: 46%) of the values allowed by the Tariff Law. Furthermore,
minimum water charges are only about 1.8% of the minimum salary (Annex
8.5). As many urban poor families earn more than one minimum salary, water
is affordable to the poor.   Connection charges, which are very low, are
being phased out by BNH making water services accessible to all.   The
combined water and sewerage charges are 57% of the values allowed by the
Tariff Law and represent only about 3.1% of the minimum salary.  Under the
covenanted tariffs, the minimum water charges, even if increased in pro-
portion to the average tariff increases, would remain well below Tariff Law
allowances and below 3% of the minimum salary, which is satisfactory.
1/ See para. 8.05, footnote 1/.
2/ The equivalent number of persons served during the project's
useful life will be almost twice (2.34 million).

Project Risks
8.13      The project presents only minor technical risks since most of
the works do not involve special engineering requirements, and the country
has a well developed engineering and construction industry. Furthermore,
final designs are well advanced, and their progress will be closely moni-
tored during project execution by Bank and BNH staff. Cost escalation to
levels that would jeopardize the project's worth are very unlikely. Since
tariffs are generally low, any unforseeable cost increase could be ba-
lanced by increases in tariffs. Overall, the project presents lower than
average risks. BNH's supervisory role will be greatly enhanced during this
project. The transfer of new responsibilities to BNH for project implemen-
tation and supervision will have to be progressive, however. The benefi-
ciaries of the project are generally weaker than in previous loans to BNH,
and the project scope is equivalent to six average projects in the sector.
Bank supervision efforts (para. 6.22) would be critical, especially during
the first two years, when BNH staff is being trained and the SWCs are being
familiarized with Bank procedures. Otherwise, there would be a substan-
tial risk that the institutional improvements would not be achieved and
that implementation of the works would be delayed.

BRAZIL
MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PLANASA EVALUATION
1.01      The PLANASA program has been changed during its implementation,
adapting its programs to the experience obtained.  Operations are partly
decentralized and measures have been taken to improve the investment plan-
ning, the quality of engineering studies, and the organization and manage-
ment of the SWCs. The organization and operation of PLANASA are described
in Chapter III.
1.02      PLANASA has proven to be a well conceived system which covers
every legal, financial, management, and organization aspect. The results
achieved are impressive, considering that in 1961 the level of water and
sewerage services was the second lowest in Latin America.  The number of
cities or towns integrated to PLANASA grew from 357 in 1972 to 2,007 in
1978 (67% are communities with less than 5,000 inhabitants), while the
number of households connected increased from 3.1 million to 8.1 million.
PLANASA's investment between 1968-80 was around US$5.2 billion (Table 1)
of which about 70% for water.   Investments per urban inhabitants have
increased continuously (Table 1) and are now about US$14 per person.
1.03      Within PLANASA, BNH has established a technical assistance pro-
gram to strengthen the SWCs. As a result of this program, most of them are
using computerized systems for accounting, billing, inventories, fixed
assets,  etc.   Training has been provided to about half of the 80,000
employees of the SWCs.l/ About 27 books, 5 manual and 67 technical films
have been produced.  Ninety consultant firms work in the design of pro-
jects, while 550 construction firms with some 105,000 employees execute
the works.
1.04      The  PLANASA  implementation  program  is progressing,  although
slower than expected.   All of the 23 states of Brazil have joined the
program and more than 2,100 municipalities are now benefitted from it.
About 70% of the urban population is now receiving piped water compared
with less than 60% of a smaller urban population when the government
started the program in 1971.2/ It is estimated that PLANASA's water supply
1/ As part of the PLANASA program, BNH has organized a national sanitation
training program to improve the qualifications of both professional and
nonprofessional staff working in the sector.   BNH's target is to train
annually about 20% of the 80,000 SWC employees.

objectives will be met only around 1985.  The levels of service attained
and projected for the provision of sewerage services present a different
picture.  At present, about 28% of the population is served as compared
with 30% in 1971 when PLANASA began.   This decline of sewerage service
levels is the result of:  (i) priority given by the Government to water
supply;  (ii)  technical  complexity  of building  and operating  adequate
sewerage systems in marginal areas of the cities which lack urban planning:
(iii) relatively high per capita cost of providing sewerage services and
the existence of other low cost alternatives; and (iv) high rate of urban
population growth.  It is estimated that PLANASA objectives for sewerage
services will not be met until 1990.
1.05      In order to strengthen the execution capabilitieVof the SWCs,
BNH entered into an agreement with PAHO to carry out SATECIA,- a technical
assistance program. SATECIA program was executed between 1974 and 1980,
and provided assistance to all SWCs.  Many improvements in tariffs, ac-
counting and methods resulted from this assistance. The program was how-
ever expensive and did not fulfill BNH's expectations in relation to over-
all results, partly because of the time necessary for foreign consultants
to adapt to the language and idiosyncrasy of Brazil.   To continue the
technical assistance to the SWCs after February 1980, BNI has created
PRODISAN (Subprograma de Desenvolvimento Institucional das Companhias
Estaduais de Saneamento). This subprogram aims to provide assistance for
institution building and training to the SWCs coordinated through BNH. BNH
retained four persons of the SATECIA's staff to assist in the organization
and start-up of PRODISAN.
1.06      The main focus of the PLANASA program has been to help the states
develop their own capable and strong organizations in the water supply and
sewerage sector. To enter the program, a state must sign an agreement with
BNH establishing a statewide water and sewerage company, draw up a state-
wide sector investment plan and provide for a state contribution to invest-
ments and for the guarantee of BNH loans.  The statewide organization of
the program has four major advantages.   First,  it makes possible the
establishment of statewide tariff structures which permit a cross-subsidi-
zation mechanism within the state. In this way, wealthier cities contri-
bute to support poorer and small communities. Second, the statewide orga-
nization derives economies of scale from centralized management of the
state systems.   Third, it makes possible the development by the SWCs of
modern management systems, and fourth, the financial capacity of the
cities is enhanced since cash deficits and surpluses are shared.

1.07      The PLANASA Program is financed one-half by BNH and one-half by
the states through revolving water and sewerage funds (Fundos de Agua e
Esgotos FAEs). The participation of the state is critical for the program.
The degree of commitment with the sector and the resources of each state
have been largely different.   FAE resources are obtained from budgetary
allocations of up to 5% of the state's annual tax revenues.  In cases where
5% of a state's revenues is not sufficient to meet the state's 50% financ-
ing commitment to the program, BNH extends supplementary loans to the state
to cover this shortfall (FINEST I).  If the state allocates less than 5% of
its revenues to the program, the amount it can borrow from BNH is reduced
proportionally.
1.08      In addition to the basic lending programs for water (REFINAG)
and sewerage (REFINESG), BNH has also two subprograms (FINEST 2 and FINEST
3) geared to stimulate investments in small communities (less than 5,000
inhabitants). Under these subprograms BNH's loans are made to the states
through their financial agents and are equal to the states' funds allocated
to the small communities program. Under both subprograms the SWCs receive
directly from the states part of the funds as capital contributions (about
70%) and the rest as FAE's loans. BNH's loans to the states under FINEST 2
are aimed at replenishing the states' contributions to FAE, and thus are
limited to the amount of such foregone contributions. Under FINEST 3, BNH
loans to the states constitute an equivalent and supplementary source of
funds for small communities, thus permitting to double the amount of funds
allocated to these communities. In addition to the funds received by SWC
from BNH through COSAN, there is a line of credit to developers to finance
sanitary works for housing programs (FINEC).
1.09      BNH's lending terms for the sanitation sector reflect social,
rather than commercial, considerations.   Interest rates on the REFINAG,
REFINESG and FINEST I lines of credit vary from 2.0% p.a. to 7.0%.  The
lower rates are applicable to the poorer states. Interest rate concessions
have been granted for sewerage projects and related supplemental lending
programs (FINEST II and III). The grace period on BNH's sanitation loans
are from 18 to 54 months.  The amortization period is 18 years for water
supply loans and 30 years for sewerage loans.  Effective March 28, 1980,
BNH reduced the interest rates on all new FAE loans for water supply from
the previous 3%-6% level to 2%-2.5% and on all new FAE sewerage loans to a
flat 2%. For their services the OT charges 1.2% on each of BNH disburse-
ments. BNH/FAE finances 110% of the direct cost of contracts to include
the estimated 10% engineering and project supervision costs. The interest
on BNH and FAE loans for the project SWCs is generally lower than for many
other SWCs because per capita income of the population in the project

1.10      BNH's amortization periods reflect the useful lives of the sub-
projects financed and are considerably longer than the terms of Bank loans.
This, and the relative movement between exchange rates and the revaluation
index of the ORTN may cause the effective interest rate on the Bank loan to
exceed the onlending rates charged by BNH. Their resulting risk, as well
as the exchange rate risk would be assumed by BNH where financial position
(and higher interest rates in other loans) is strong enough to absorb both.
1.11      PLANASA should be improved during this project.  Major factors
affecting PLANASA's past performance have been:
(a) Resource Allocation
Unclear sector priorities at the national level, lack of econo-
mic analysis of projects, use of questionable techniques for
least-cost analysis and project justification, and high per ca-
pita costs.  Sound economic analysis techniques will be imple-
mented during the project (para. 3.13).
(b) Financial
Unclear definition of financial objectives for the SWCs in the
period 1979-82, low tariffs which are not fully adjusted for
inflation, high operating costs and debt service in the SWCs.
Additionally, in some states the extended poverty of the popu-
lation makes it difficult to generate enough revenues to cover
financial needs. During the project, the methodology of the EVG
will be improved and a general revenue covenant (para. 7.15)
will provide satisfactory financial viability.

ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 6
(c) Political
Political interference in the SWCs, which prevents the proper
application of a national system of priorities for the sector,
reluctance by national and municipal institutions to transfer
cities to the jurisdiction of PLANASA, and excessive turnover of
the high management of the SWCs. The implementation of a system
of functions, and responsibilities and salaries (para.   4.09)
would reduce the effects of these problems.
(d) Technical
Instability of the SWCs' investment programs, overestimation of
demands for services, oversizing of systems, underestimation of
project costs and overoptimistic execution schedules. The pro-
posed guidelines for subproject analysis and EVG preparation are
expected to eliminate these problems.
(e) Personnel
Slow processing of BNH loans and difficulties in getting quali-
fied personnel in some regions. BNH's personnel constraints for
proper supervision,  planning and project evaluation.   BNH is
studying several Bank recommendations to simplify its proce-
dures. COSAN personnel will the strengthened and technical as-
sistance will provide advice on all procedures and methods used
by BNH (para. 3.05).
COSAN Evaluation
1.12      COSAN has showed great dynamism and capacity to provide a sound
financial conceptual framework.  Other strong points on COSAN's perform-
ance have been its capacity and flexibility to adapt to the changing
environment in the country, its political independence and technical capa-
city, and an impressive experience dealing with subprojects in hundreds of
cities. COSAN staff has, however, been overwhelmed by the magnitude of the
problems in dealing with all SWCs and subprojects in Brazil and BNH's
cumbersome procedures. Additional experienced and qualified personnel is
urgently needed but has been difficult to hire because of Government and
BNH ceilings in staff and salaries. Sector information is not centralized
or processed, and the coordination with regional offices requires improve-
ments. The technical assistance provided through the project (para. 3.05)
will require a flexible approach to avoid the red tape in contracting
qualified consultants. Draft terms of reference for the technical assis-
tance to COSAN have been reviewed by the Bank and proposals would be
requested at the beginning of 1981. COSAN staff reinforcement require high
caliber professionals. The Bank has provided COSAN with a profile of the
professionals required.

MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Disbursement Procedures
Introduction
1.        As in previous loans to BNH, disbursements will be made against
statements of expenditures. This is the only practical procedure under the
circumstances where the loan is made to the financial intermediary, where
there are a large number of subprojects financed, and where contracts for
both supply and construction are generally awarded to local contractors.
The present disbursement procedure is consistent with BNH's procedures,
enables a proper control over Bank disbursements, is working satisfac-
torily in ongoing projects. The only modification proposed refers to the
establishment  of a working fund account (para.  8).   The BNH financing
mechanism and the Bank reimbursement procedures are described below.
BNH/SWC Financing Contract
2.        When any subproject  foreseen  in the Loan Agreement has been
approved by BNH, and the Bank if over the free limit, the submitting SWC
requests a PLANASA financing contract for that subproject (it may combine
two or more subprojects in a single request). This request (solicitacao de
financiamento) is submitted to BNH's financial agent, which is the state
bank in each state and also handles the state FAE.   The financial agent
then submits the request to BNH and to FAE, and formal loan agreements are
prepared establishing terms, total amount of the loan, amount of the ad-
vance payment, and repayment terms. This contract is between BNH and the
financial agent and specifies the SWC and the subproject or subprojects for
which the funds are provided. The financial agent, in turn, makes ident-
ical contracts with the SWC.   For control purposes,  BNH establishes a
financial contract number (CTN) for each contract and all subsequent pay-
ment requests must bear that number. The financing and service flows for
the SWCs is shown below:

Borrower's (BNH) Expenditure Control Procedure
3.        Expenditure control for BNH is exercised in the SWC as follows:
(a) bidding documents and final contracts for civil works,
equipment and services to be rendered for the project are
examined by the BNH to verify that the contracts do, in fact,
pertain to the subproject. the technical consultans of BNH
(OTs) review all invoices submitted against those contracts
to establish their validity as to percentage of completion,
delivery of materials, and also monitor the construction of
all subprojects; and
(b) the financial agent verifies the authenticity of documenta-
tion and verifies paid invoices against advance payment re-
quests.
BNH Disbursements
4.        Actual disbursements on the part of BNH are in two parts, an
initial advance (stipulated in the financing contract) and subsequent pay-
ments until the project is completed.   Subsequent payments may be made
against paid or unpaid invoices. A description of these systems follows.

ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 4
5.        An amount up to 20% of the total expenditure may be disbursed in
advance of expenditure. To obtain this advance payment, the SWC submits a
letter of request to the financial agent. The financial agent prepares a
request to BNH, attaching the SWC's letter and submits it to BNH for
payment. Based on this, BNH emits a payment order (Autorizacao de Paga-
mento para Aplicacao), which is paid to the financial agent who credits it
to the SWC's account after deducting the administrative and technical
service fees.   The advance payment is recovered by deducting from each
subsequent payment the same percentage that the advance represented to the
total contract. In the event that the subprojects (s) is (are) terminated
without expending the total amount of financing, any advance payment re-
maining is simply added to the loan total for amortization. In the event
of overruns,  the advance is automatically  liquidated and overruns are
generally financed by a supplementary financial contract.
6.        The SWC has two payment options.  Under the first alternative,
the SWC submits a list of invoices that it has paid, together with the
invoices, to the technical agent of BNH for review. The OT approves (or
rejects) each individual invoice, correcting the listing for rejections,
and returns all documents to the SWC.  The SWC then submits the approved
listing to the financial agent who verifies that they were paid and then
submits the list of paid invoices to BNH and FAE for reimbursement. Under
the second alternative the procedure is identical except that a list of
unpaid invoices is submitted and the request is one for an advance payment,
supported by the list of paid invoices to prove that the previous month's
advance was used to pay the invoices for which the advance was requested.
Processing of both lists is identical, and they are processed as a single
submission.
7.        On receipt of the verified list of paid invoices from the finan-
cial agent, BNH issues a payment order for 50% of the value of the request
to which the list of paid invoices is attached. This document is approved
by COSAN, and then routed to BNH's Finance Department for the payment
authorization and to have funds transferred to the financial agent. Admi-
nistrative and technical service fees are deducted.  The financial agent
then credits the appropriate account of the SWC.
Basic of Transactions between BNH, the Final User and the Bank
8.        The basis of project approval, the financial contracts, and BNH
disbursements is the UPC (Unidade Padrao de Capital). The UPC is a mone-
tary unit which is adjusted every three months in accordance with the
percentage increase granted to Federal Government Bonds (ORTN). All dis-
bursement requests by the SWCs, final contract settlements, and payments
of interest and principal are stated in terms of UPC at the conversion rate
to the cruzeiro in effect in the month in which the SWC makes the request.
BNH submits to the Bank requests for reimbursements for expenditures on



- 91
ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 4
approved subprojects (CTNs) supported by the listing of paid invoices (or
unpaid invoices as the case may be).   BNH through its OTs and auditing
staff exercises satisfactory control over subproject implementation and
over disbursements to contractors. The accounting procedures followed are
straightforward and the records will be available for supervision missions
to verify expenditures on selected projects. Furthermore, under the loan
the independent auditor of the SWCs will be required to certify that the
disbursement procedures are properly being followed by the SWC.
9.        In order to reduce the interval during which BNH would finance
the Bank's share of project cost with its own resources, and the under-
disbursement of the Bank loan under high local inflation rates, BNH may
request the Bank to make advance payments from the loan account into a
Special Account, to be opened in US dollars in the Banco Central do Brasil,
and would be available for finarncing only the Bank's share of the project
cost.   The amount deposited in the Special Account may be increased or
decreased by the Bank as required for project execution but should not
exceed US$12 million.  BNH would be entitled to make withdrawals from the
Special Account at the exchange rate applicable on the day the expenditures
were made. Loan disbursements will be made against a statement of expendi-
tures prepared by BNH for each subproject, the detailed documentation of
which will not be submitted for Bank review, but will be retained by the
beneficiary and made available for inspection during the course of super-
vision missions.  No works or force account are envisaged.  Disbursement
procedures are explained in Annex 7. The estimated schedule of disburse-
ments, to be completed before Jtne 30, 1985, is shown in Annex 20.

BRAZIL
MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STATE WATER COMPANIES (SWC) FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Notes on existing Financial Statements
1.01      All  the SWCs use a standardized  and computarized  accounting
system.   The reliability of the information is, however,  low, regarding
particularly the distribution of expenditures between the capital and the
other cities, and the segregation of costs between water and sewerage.
Historical financial statements are based on reports prepared by the ex-
ternal auditors retained by the SWCs at BNH's request. The quality of the
auditing varies also in quality, but is in general acceptable. The analy-
sis of historical statements is further complicated by the way monetary
corrections on fixed assets and liabilities are presented in accordance
with the law. This presentation distorts the income and cash flow state-
ments for purposes of cost control, rate making and comparison of financial
performance among SWCs.
1.02      High inflation rates prevailing in Brazil (about 110% in 1980)
further complicate the analysis of the SWCs financial performance: with
these levels of inflation the sum of monetary values within the same year
no longer is meaningful. Under these circumstances, and because of uncer-
tainty  regarding  inflation  ffyecasts  it  is preferable  to present  SWC
financial statements in ORTN.- Projections in ORTN have the additional
advantage that the fixed assets are by law maintained in ORTN and that the
SWC debt service payments are expressed in UPC.   On the other hand, the
ORTN value for the year constitutes only a gross approximation. Further-
more the projection in ORTN (or any hard currency) tends to underestimate
the cash needs of a SWC, since the current assets, not subject to monetary
correction would rapidly lose their value under high inflation rates. In
order to reflect this loss in the financial projections, a provision has
been included in the non-operating expenses.
Financial Projections-Inflation
1.03      Until 1973 the ORTN was kept in line with general inflation.
Thereafter, the ORTN index became an instrument for monetary policy. The
increase in general prices as measured by the Indice Geral dos Precos (IGP)
of the Getulio Vargas Foundation was higher than the increase of the ORTN
by 6.7% in 1976, 6.6% in 1975, 3.4% in 1978, 20.5% in 1979 and 40% in 1980.
Starting in 1981, the Government intends to maintain a closer relationship
1/ The ORTN (Obrigacoes Reajustaveis do Tesouro Nacional) is the monetary
adjustment index for government bonds. For each quarter the UPC is main-
tained at a value equal to the ORTN of the first month (January, April,
July, October).



_ 9c _
ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 24
between the consumer index (INPC of the IBGE) and the ORTN. The INPC was
created  in April 1979 and is being used for salary adjustments.   The
historical differences between the general price index (IGP) and the INPC
(8%-10% per year in favor of the IGP) are expected to continue. A price
contingency of 10% in 1981, 9% in 1982 and 8% in 1983 and thereafter has
been used in all appraisal projections.
EVGs
1.04      BNH requires all SWCs to prepare annually an Estudo de Viabili-
dade Global Economico-Financiero - (EVG). The EVG is a five-year financial
projection in ORTN where, demand, investment and operating costs are pre-
sented for each city, and where income, tariffs and annual rates of return
are consolidated for the SWC as a whole.   The Bank has been providing
assistance to BNH to improve the EVG preparation, particularly the finan-
cial, economic and social analysis and the incorporation of full financial
statements, including the effect of general price increases measured in
ORTN. The 1980 EVGs for all the SWCs were reviewed during the appraisal,
discussed with the SWCs and BNH and their results, substantially revised,
have been incorporated in the financial projections (pages 7 to 24). The
EVGs prepared for 1981 will incorporate Bank recommendations.
1.05      The EVG is a very important planning tool, which needs further
improvements. The EVG provides also projections of FAE and state funds for
project execution. The implementation of sound guidelines for least cost
and economic evaluation (para. 6.06) should optimize the investments con-
sidered in the EVG.
Demand
1.06      The population and population growth are only gross estimates.
The results of the 1980 Census will only be available by mid-1981. Popu-
lation estimates by the IBGE have been used, when available, and have been
complemented with the results of surveys made by the SWCs, consultants, and
other state institutions.
1.07      The percentage of population served is likely to be under esti-
mated. The number of persons per household should be somehow higher than
in the 1970 census, although the number of persons per family is likely to
be lower because construction of new houses has not coped with the growing
demand for dwellings, and concentration of population in existing ones
should result.  In addition, the number of illegal connections is consi-
dered important in several cities; users' surveys are being carried out to
eliminate illegal connections in major cities.
1.08      Water demand projections in subproject feasibility reports and
EVGs are not adequate. Projections normally use per capita demand without



- 96 -
ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 24
considering levels of unaccounted-for water, income of the population to
be served, effect of industrial, public or commercial demand and the exist-
ence or nonexistence of metering. Water demand statistics are prepared but
seldom used in forecasting.   Furthermore, lack of proper tariff adjust-
ments have induced some SWCs to create sophisticated methods to inflate the
water billed to unmetered connections. In Para, and especially in Goias,
the application of such methods reduce the reported unaccounted-for water
by about half, distort billing and reduce artificially the need for meter-
ing.   BNH and the Government are now aware of these problems and are
prepared to be correct them gradually. An important action towards reach-
ing this goal is metering: metering levels have been covenanted at 80% for
all major cities. Water demand projections have been prepared on the basis
of available statistical information for 1979 and mid-1980.
1.09      Unaccounted-for water is very high in the SWCs of Amazonas, Para
and Paraiba. Leak detection, metering and users' surveys are part of the
proposed project and should reduce the unaccounted-for water to about 30%
in the capital cities by 1984.
1.10      When one connection serves several apartments, the total volume
billed is divided between the number of apartments or "economias". These
"economias" are used as units of reference for all statistical purposes. On
the SWCs of Amazonas and Paraiba most connections serve only one residence;
the same happens in Para (with the exception of Belem). In these SWCs the
statistics for connections were considered reliable and meaningful and
were used for demand projections. In the SWCs of Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul
and the Federal District the unit used for demand projections was the
economia, but the general name "connections" appear in all financial pro-
jections.
Operating Expenses
1.11      Operation and maintenance expenses have been projected separa-
tely for water and sewerage. Unit wages are adjusted using the INPC index
plus about 3% p.a., which the Government allows for merit increases (pro-
ductividade). The biannual variation of the INPC is multiplied by 1.1 for
personnel earning less than three minimum salaries, by 1 for employees
earning 3 to 10 minimum salaries and by 0.8 for other employees.   Total
personnel expenditures used in projections assume an increase in producti-
vity in all SWCs (Annex 12, monitoring indicators), i.e., a decrease in the
ratio of employees per 1000 connections (especially in Goias).
1.12      Power usage is expected to increase in line with volume pro-
duced, but at unit rates slightly higher than inflation. Nevertheless, in
Para the starting of the Tucurui Power plant is assumed to reduce power
costs by 1982. Materials, services and administrative costs are increased
in accordance with inflation and in varying proportion with the number of
water and sewerage connections. The proportion is different for each SWC

ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 24
and depends on the estimated economies of scale, improvement introduced in
the present water distribution system and the growing proportion of new
assets (which should require less maintenance). High inflation and lack of
interest charges on delayed payments make meaningless the legal provision
for bad debts (3% of accounts receivable); a provision of 1% of total
billing is being added to the operating expenses.
Investments-Financing
1.13      Project and other investments include technical and price con-
tingencies and about 10% for general administrative and engineering ex-
penses. This percentage, which is financed by BNH, should be reviewed from
time to time to see if its reduction is justified.
1.14      In practice all investments are financed by loans or grants and
internal contribution to investment have been very small. In the projec-
tions, each investment is assumed to be financed half by BNH and half by
FAE, including their respective interest and other charges during con-
struction.   For the SWCs which execute simultaneously annual subprojects
in 50 or more cities, this method would require the projection on hundreds
of different loans during the projection period.  A simplified approach,
consolidating all these loans in a few per year have been used in the
financial projections. BNH management is studying the implementation of
such system to simplify their lending procedures. Interest and other debt
charges have been estimated at present rates of BNH and FAE; the grace
period is up to four and a half years and the principal repayment is 18
years for water and 30 years for sewerage.
Tariff
1.15      Water and sewerage average tariffs have been projected to meet
the proposed revenue covenant (para 7.15).   It is assumed that at least
twice a year, tariff will be reviewed and tariff adjustments made to
maintain such levels throughout each year. The level of revenues that the
tariff law would enable the SWCs to achieve satisfactory financial per-
formance. Existing Bank revenue covenants vary widely among the different
projects 1/ and are difficult to monitor. For consistency within the sec-
tor, it is recommended that the same revenue covenant be used for all SWCs
under Bank projects.
1.16      Other operational revenues include connections and installation
fees, and in Brasilia the "pollution tax" which is equivalent to 10% of the
1/  Loan 1525-BR:   Revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses, debt
service and 1.5% of net assets in 1981, 2.5% in 1982 and 3.5% thereafter,
(SABESP); Loan 1656-BR:   rate of return of 6% in 1981 and 1982, and 7%
thereafter (COMPESA); Loans 1823-BR and 1850-BR:   tariff adjustments in
gradual increases in real terms to assure that tariffs will reach in 1983
the level required by the Brazilian law (CORSAN, CASAN, SANEPAR and
COPASA).

water and sewerage billing. A fine, representing 10% of billing, is charged
only once to consumers in arrears for more than one month.   This charge,
which is considered to only partially compensate for inflation losses, is
normally excluded from the operating revenues.
Balance statements
1.17      Cash:  the minimum level of cash is about one month of personnel
costs.   Accounts receivable are net of the provision for bad debt and
should be reduced in several SWCs (Annex 12) to about two months of billing
by 1984.
1.18      Inventories have been evaluated and reduced in some SWCs or
increased to a safe level in others. Inventories of materials being used
for project construction have been included with works in progress.  In
general the level of inventories have been projected in relation to the re-
quirements of materials and other supplies.
1.19      Fixed assets and depreciation are maintained by law in ORTN.
However, when the SWCs were created the historical value of fixed assets
transferred to the SWCs by the municipalities was recorded in books. In-
complete fixed-asset inventories and valuation, lack of correct accumu-
lated depreciation and absence of reliable data on fixed assets contri-
buted by users made theJ/ixed assets records and the estimated rates of
return very inaccurate.- Fixed assets will be reassessed during project
execution.
1.20      The rate of return allowed by the Tariff Law should not exceed
12%. This level is unlikely to be reached under the present BNH and FAE
interest rates and repayment periods.   The rate of return is calculated
dividing net income after depreciation by the average recognized invest-
ment ("investimento reconhecido"), which is different from the asset base
used normally in the Bank. The recognized investment exclude fixed assets
financed by government or users grants, and include a certain percentage of
current assets. In practice the difference is not significative, although
the computation of the "recognized investment" is time consuming.
1.21      Accounts payable corresponding to operating purchases are pro-
jected in relation to operating expenses. Accounts payable to contractors
and suppliers are assumed to represent half to one month of investments.
Accounts payable are excessive in some SWC (especially CAGEPA) and should
achieve reasonable levels by 1982.
1/  In some of the SWCs, gross fixed assets per person served are about
half (US$40/person) of their estimated replacement values, while accumu-
lated depreciation represents only about 5% of the gross assets.   The
magnitude of the new investments, however, maintain a reasonable revalued
value.   In the project SWCs, the total 1980 fixed assets represent only
about 30% of the total 1984 fixed assets.

BNH appraisal reports
1.22      During this project, BNH participated in the appraisal for the
first time,and prepared basic analysis and projections (Avaliacao pre-
liminar do projecto)  for the SWCs of SANEAGO,  SANESUL and CAESB.   The
results have been satisfactory. BNH analysis was complemented with pre-
appraisal mission data to make the financial and economic analysis com-
patible with the other SWCs and Bank standards. Recommendations to improve
future BNH appraisal are included in the Project File.
Additional Information
1.23      Full financial projections, including detailed tables on demand,
project cost, debt service, financial assumption, financial statements,
monitoring indicators and economic analysis are available in Project File
for each SWC.

BRAZIL
MULTISTATE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Subproject Selection Criteria
1.        All subprojects acceptable for Bank financing should comply with
the following conditions:
(a) they must "oe approved by BNH or included in the last EVG approved
by BNH and accepted by the Bank;
(b) total subproject cost should not be substantially higher than
that included in the EVG.   If subproject  scope or costs are
substantially different (more than 30%) from those contemplated
in the EVG, satisfactory evidence must be presented to BNH and
the Bank that their inclusion and financing will not deteriorate
the SWC's financial position;
(d) subprojects must be the least-cost solution.
2.        Calculations of long-run incremental costs for subproject ac-
ceptability, and of present value and long-run incremental cost for least-
cost analysis, should use an annual discount rate equal to the opportunity
cost of capital (11%) or another value agreed upon between BNH and the
Bank. These calculations will be based on the subprojects' capital costs,
operating costs, and complementary investments.
3.        Water supply subprojects to be carried out in cities with popu-
lations greater than 50,000, must have water tariffs 1/ equal to or higher
than 75% of the long-run average incremental cost. This criteria will be
considered equivalent to an IFR of 5% or higher (i.e. average tariff equal
or higher than the marginal cost discounted at a 5% interest rate).
4.        Sewerage subprojects, or water supply subprojects to be carried
out in cities with populations between 5,000-50,000 must have sewerage (or
water) tariffs equal to or higher than 60% of the long-run average incre-
mental cost. This criteria will be considered equivalent to an IFR of 1% or
higher (i.e. average tariff equal or higher than the marginal cost dis-
counted at a 1% interest rate).
1/ The average tariff used is obtained by dividing the revenues from water
(or sewerage) services by the respective volume billed in each city. When
the present tariff does not satisfy the selection criteria the average
tariff (in constant prices) to be implemented within the following 12
months would be used for a second analysis.

ANNEX 10

5.         Subprojects to be carried out in communities with populations of
less than 5,000, must have a per capita construction cost 1/ of less than
US$180 in 1980 prices.
6.         Subprojects not meeting the respective criteria must be rede-
signed to lower acceptable standards or carried out in stages.   If the
subproject does not fulfill the criterion after it has been redesigned, it
would be eligible for Bank financing only if a satisfactory social and
economic justification is furnished to the Bank. The social and economic
justification will be made on a case-by-case basis, and will consider among
other things, the closeness to the acceptance limits, the percentage of
urban poor served, the impossibility of providing water by other means or
having additional revenues, the health conditions of the population, and
the evaluation of benefits on other sectors of the economy.
1/   Construction cost divided by the population to be served after the
project construction is completed.

BRAZIL
MULTISATE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFR) and Marginal Cost
Calculations
1.01      Internal Financial rates of return (IFR) have been calculated
for the water component and for the water supply and sewerage component on
the capital cities in each state (Tables 1 to 6), since sewerage charges
are related to the volume of water used and it is not possible for con-
sumers to indicate their willingness to pay for each service independ-
ently. A separate calculation for water supply is provided in view of the
fact that a large majority of consumers is not sewered. All investments
have been stated in January 1981 prices in ORTN and include engineering and
physical contingencies. Foreign exchange has been shadow priced at 1.15
times the official rate of exchange. The labor shadow price was set at 0.9
times the average wage.   Project investments, as well as complementary
investments to be made by the SWCs during and after project execution have
been included in the analysis; small investments not related to the incre-
mental benefits have been excluded (such as studies for future projects,
pipe or equipment replacement).   Water being provided without treatment
will be replaced by treated water in the cities of Manaus (0.4 m3/second),
Belem (0.6 m3/per second) and Brasilia (1.2 m3/second by 1984). The cost
and benefit of providing safe water has been estimated on the basis of 50%
of such volumes, starting in 1984. The project benefits have been extended
until the production capacity is used by 90% (to consider daily maximum
demand). Complementary investments are mainly house connections (about 4
ORTN each) which would be largely financed by urban developers, contribu-
tions to construction (BNH urban poverty housing programs) and some con-
nection fees.
1.02      The SWCs, with the exception of CAESB are responsible for sev-
eral dozens of cities or towns. Cost accounting is still incipient and the
direct cost values accounted for each city are only a fraction of total
cost. A large proportion of the personnel and service costs is considered
administration.   The use of the direct costs would have underestimated
operating expenses.   The operating expenses for the capital cities were
therefore estimated on the basis of total costs prorated by the number of
connections.l/  Expenses for personnel, chemicals, power, materials and
services for water and sewerage, as well as general administrative costs
were projected on the basis of house connections or volume produced. De-
tails are available in project file.
1/ Unit costs may be larger due to higher volumes per connection in the
capitals, but this is compensated by economies of scale.

1.03      Revenues generated by the project have been used as a proxy for
economic benefits.  The average tariffs for August 1980, as well as the
covenanted tariffs (level of tariffs required by the financial covenant)
during project execution were expressed in prices of January 1981.  Al-
though the same tariff structure is used for all cities within a SWC, the
average tariff is always higher in the capital cities due to the effect of
industrial and commercial users, and a higher proportion of large residen-
tial users which purchase water at excess consumption charges 2 to 2.5
higher than for minimum consumption. The tariffs in ORTN/thousand m3 used
in the analysis,  (in January 1981 prices)  are showed below.   Sewerage
benefits have been estimated at present (80-100%) levels of charges.

and Brazilian Tariff Law between 1981-84.
1.04      The IFR was also estimated for the consolidated water and sewer-
age investments at present and covenanted tariff (details in pages 4 to 9
of this annex). The results and weighted averages are shown in table 8.2.
1.05      The marginal cost for the investments on the capital cities have
been estimated as the average long term incremental cost for project and
complementary investments. The incremental values are calculated on pages
4 to 9 of this Annex and are summarized in Table 8.1.
1.06      The analysis of the marginal cost and IFR have been estimated
separately for the total water and water and sewerage investments of the
SWCs (pages 12 to 16 of this annex). The results should only be considered
a rough estimate since the total investment includes many subprojects in
different degrees of preparation, for which the precise analysis of costs
and benefits is not feasible. Furthermore, for the consolidated results is
difficult to eliminate costs unrelated to the incremental benefits (fixed
assets replacement) or establish the year for which subprojects capacity
would be reached.
1.07      The justification of each individual subproject will be made
using the average long-run incremental cost (marginal cost) calculated on
the basis of the investment program of the project and its complementary
works. Projects in which the present tariff or that to be implemented in
the near future exceed 75% 1/ of the marginal cost (equivalent to an IFR of
1/   60% for sewerage or water supply in cities with less than 50,000
inhabitants (equivalent to about 1% IFR).

5% or more) would be approved. More expensive projects will be reviewed to
standards affordable to the population. The use of marginal cost simpli-
fies the project selection (specially under large tariff variations), pro-
vide an useful insights of costs structures, and is easier to understand by
policy makers. The marginal cost will give very useful statistics on per
capita investment costs, operating expenses and the cities were tariff
surcharges and intensive metering should be applied.
Economic Rate of Return and IFR
1.08      The IFR at present tariff measures only a part of the project
benefits. The results of the IFR can get closer to the economic return of
the project if the consumer surplus is included. The consumer surplus can
be estimated if the price-elasticity is known.  Two points on the demand
curve are known:  the average charges (YI) and consumption (X ), and the
price paid by urban poor to water vendors (Y ) for very bmall amounts of
water (X ).  An exponential function of the form Y = C e  x can be fitted
between these points.   The ratio  (k) between  the social and economic
benefits perceived by the users and the IFR will be the area below this
function divided by the benefits estimated by the traditional IFR (X1
multiplied by Y1).  The integration of Y = cebx between X  and X1 (details
in project file) provides the area A = (X  - X IXY  - YI)/ln (Y /Y0).  The
project benefits, including consumer surplus, are then k times higher than
those measured by the IFR.
k = (Y- Y 0)/(Y1 ln (Y1/Y0))  (l  Y0/Y1)/In(Y 1/Y0
1.09      Urban poor purchase small amounts of water (20 liters per capita
per day or about 2-3 m3 per family per month) at prices between 4 and 6
times the average price for piped water. For a ratio of Y to Y of 4, k =
2.20, and the consumer surplus can be estimated as the 9FR at a tariff
equal to 2.2 times the average tariff. The rates of return, including the
estimated consumer surplus are included in Table 8.2.
Urban poverty
1.10      The levels of urban poverty, defined as families with an income
lower than three minimum salaries were estimated by the appraisal team
(Table 8.3) using the scarce information available and by visits to the
capital cities. Census data for 1970 are considered obsolete; a new census
was started in September 1980 but its detailed results (by cities) will not
be available for this appraisal report. The number of urban poor presently
served is generally low because the overall levels of services are low (for
water supply 67% on the capitals and 60% on the SWCs) and persons with
higher income usually receive piped water first.  The analysis of incre-
mental population is detailed in pages 4 to 9 of this annex, and the impact
on poverty in the capital cities is summarized in Table 8.3.
