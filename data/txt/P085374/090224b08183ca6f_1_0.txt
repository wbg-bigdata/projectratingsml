                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The agreed target for Component 1, promulgation of a new higher education law, has been achieved, although with delay, much remains to be done to consolidate the proposed
                         changes and this will now occur after the project close. Further, alignment with current Directorate General of Higher Education DGHE strategic priorities is less clear. The current
                         DGHE leadership has expressed reservations about the merits of competitive funding and has largely dismantled the competitive grants programs that had flourished under the “New
                         Paradigm era? – (1996-2009). Under Component 2 all grantees are expected to complete implementation of the grant by project close and while approximately $7 million of project
                         funds are expected to remain at project close this was foreseen and the rationale agreed at Mid Term Review MTR, the surplus arises from across the board lower grant amounts
                         awarded under sub-components 2.2a and 2.2b. In general achievements as measured by the agreed indicators of quality, relevance and efficiency; portray a project that has met or

                         exceeded the goals set, however the Bank team notes data collection efforts and especially data analysis were consistently “the minimum necessary?. There has been repeated
                         reference in Aide Memoires from the MTR onwards suggesting that by not undertaking more analysis of the reasons behind the reported data observations the grant recipients and
                         DGHE-IU have missed an opportunity to more effectively draw lessons from implementation experience. The Bank continues to work closely with DGHE (although outside the terms
                         of this project) to develop the 31 Ministerial Decrees and 11 Government Regulations which are required to provide the operational framework for the new law.
