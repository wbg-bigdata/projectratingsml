BIHAR RURAL ROADS PROJECT
(CREDIT 1072-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Bihar
Rural Roads Project in India, for which Credit 1072-IN in the amount
of SDR 35.0 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) was approved in
November, 1980.   The last disbursement from the credit account was
made on April 18, 1989 at which time the Credit was closed, three
years behind schedule.
This PCR was prepared by the Transport and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department IV, of the Asia Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).   The Bank sent the Borrower
Parts I and III with the request to prepare Part II, but none was
received.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in October 1988, and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the President's Report, all
legal documents on the project including the Loan, Guarantee and
Project Agreements, Bank supervision reports, Bank records and files,
and interviews with Bank staff familiar with the project.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The main objective of the project was to provide all-weather
access to farms and villages and thus complement other investments financed by
IDA ( addressing chiefly institutional and agricultural needs) (paras. 2 and
3). The project was expected to allow the full unfolding of all possible
benefits resulting from those investments (SAR, para. 4.02) in addition to
producing an improvement in rural road construction and maintenance tech-
niques.
Implementation Experience
Of a total of 742 km sanctioned to be constructed or improved
under the project, a total of 733 km of earthworks were completed. 712 km of
consolidation works were done and 688 km of roads vere black-topped.   This
compares with appraisal expectations of a total of 725 km of completed road-
works (paras. 12 and 13).
Proiect Results
It was an achievement in itself that the physical results of the
project were as expected, as in terms of quality of the final output the
project has turned out to be quite different from appraisal expectations. As
verified by the completion mission, many roads have failed prematurely or are
in an advanced state of deterioration and will therefore, unless imediate
remedial measures are taken, fail very soon.   This means that the roads as
constructed are not likely to last sufficiently to accumulate enough benefits
to justify the investments in them (para. 14).           These results are  the
consequence of both design and workmanship shortcomings (para. 15) and a lax
and permissive supervision and quality controls (para. 25).
Sustainability
The short life of the roads coupled with the lack of an effective
maintenance system do not bode well for the sustainability of project benefits
(para. 26).
Findings and Lessons Learned
Project tesults highlight the need for improved quality control
and supervision, and to improve construction techniques and methods. All are
heavily dependent on the training of road engineers and work-site foremen.
However, persistent efforts by the Bank to arrange overseas training courses
have failed in the past because the Government has felt it unnecessary for
road engineers to travel abroad. Trivial as it may appear, overseas training
is essential to obtaining better results (para. 28).   Rural roads project
should not be viewed lightly but as technically complex civil works, which
should be done by the best available professionals.

Background
1.          The state of Bihar is the ninth largest, the second most populous
and the poorest of India. In the Late 1970s, when the project was identified,
it had about 65 million people. 85? of whom depended on agriculture for their
subsistence. Of the 17.4 million hectares of the state, 10.6 million were es-
tiuiated to be suitable for cultivation and 8.7 million were actually used. The
area under cultivation had remained practically the same for over a decade.
and with population pressures and a skewed distribution of holdings, the
median size of farms had become less than one hectars while the minimum neces-
sary to feed an average family in the state was estimated to be between 2.0
and 2.5 hectares. Considering the presence of over 7 million landless rural
workers, it was estimated that some 752 of the state's population existed be-
low the poverty line.
2.          The lack, and inadequacy of village and intermediate level roads
was identified, along with other shortcomings, as a serious impediment to
increasing agricultural production and bringing farmers from subsistence
farming into a market economy.   Institutional and agricultural needs were
being addressed under other IDA credits (Bihar Agricultural Credit, Bihar
A&ricultural Markets, Bihar Agricultural Research and Extension projects,
Second National Seeds and the National Diary projects). A project to improve
access by building and improving rural roads was therefore considered a
logical, complementary step.
Pro1ect Obiectives and DescriPtion
3.          The main objective of the project was to provide all-weather ac-
cess to farms and villages so that the full benefit of complementary invest-
ments (para. 2 above) could be realized (Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), para.
4.02).   To this end the project included the construction, improvement and
strengthening of about 700 km of rural roads (SAR, paras. 4.03 (i), 4.04 and
4.05).
4.          The project was also intended to produce an improvement in rural
road construction and maintenance techniques (SAR, paras. 2.12 to 2.14). To
this end the project included the procurement of road construction and main-



tenance equipment (SAR, paras. 4.03 (iii) and 4.08), and a phased program of
road mainter.arce (SAR, paras. 4.03 (ii), 4.06 and 4.07).  In addition, it was
agreed to uue a strict approach to quality control and technical auditing of
the works, the latter to be done by the Technical Examiner's Cell (TEC) in the
Audit Department of Bihar's Chief Minister Office.
5.          Techniques to build rural roads in Bihar were typically labor
intensive. They were found acceptable by the Bank, but in order to reduce the
risk of premature failure it recommended to: (i) apply intensive checks and
quality controls,  (ii) adhere strictly to the published Indian standards,
(iii) use mechanical equipment rather than time and weathering to compact
earthworks, and (iv) use simple cost saving equipment to apply the expensive
stone chips and asphalt  (SAR, para. 2.12).   A major impediment to proper
quality  control  and  improved  supervision was  the  shortage  of  laboratory
equipment and of light vehicles to reach the construction sites.  Therefore,
under the project, equipmtnt for surveying, for materials testing, and to set
up four mobile laboratories was to be procured. and 4 four-wheel drive
vehicles (one per laboratory) and 48 light vehicles were to be purchased (SAR,
para. 4.08).   Similarly, considerable quantities of rollers, asphalt mixers,
bitumen kettles, power bitumen distributors and manual pumps were to be
procured.
6.          The project was initially also intended to improve the efficiency
of farm-to-market transport by assisting farmers to replace their steel rimmed
wooden wheel bullock carts with rubber tired carts.  Considerable effort was
invested in researching the issue, it was determined that rubber tired carts
were two to three times more efficient than the wooden wheel variety, and that
their use would allow farmers, in addition to higher farmgate prices, obtain a
considerable proportion of the reduction in transport costs.  A project com-
ponent to assist the technological change and ensure a fuller materialization,
and more equitable distribution of project benefits was, thus, originally in-
cluded.  However, it was later dropped at negotiations for lack of internal
Bank agreement on how to manage the component.
Project Design and Organization
7.          The project was meticulously prepared and considerable effort was
spent in ensuring that a fair and reasonable choice was made of the roads to
be included, based on economic priorities.  The original proposal compiled by
District and Block development committees included 3,000 different roads ag-
gregating 1,900 km; using a simple methodology and broad assumptions the
length was reduced to 1,570 km and 252 routes, and by using more refined tech-
niques, developed specifically for this project by Bank staff and which used
mostly readily available information, the sample of best candidates was
reduced to the list in the SAR (Table 6) which had 165 road sections and a
total of 725 km.
8.          Given the emphasis that the Government of India placed at the time
on the development of village and rural roads, the techniques used to assess
priorities (among the large number of competing road sections) were expected
to becoue a model for subsequent rural road projects, whether financed by the
Bank or not. Indeed, monitoring closely the effects of road construction and



3
betterment (on agricultural output, prices, marketing methods, and other
socio-economic developments, particularly education, health and overall
mobility) was expected to alLow improving the methods used to appraise future
projects.   However, monitoring, although pa t of the project, was minimally
funded under it and mostly left to the Goverament of Bihar to handle.  Bank
interest ins the monitoring of project developments, although strong in the
beginning (1981-1984), eventually waned.
9.          Twelve road sections studied earlier during project praparation
were included in a baseline survey of socio-economic conditions and mobility
patterns, part of what the Bihar authorities undertook to monitor and evaluate
under the project.   The Sinha Institute of Social Studies in Patna was con-
tracted to do the survey and Bank staff actively assisted in designing the
questionnaires  and later assessing the results.   A similar survey to be
carried out some years after road construction to assess the impact of the
project, had not been done when the project was completed (1988). Thus, des-
pite the acceptance of the need to continue the quantum jump that project pre-
paration had meant for project evaluation and assessment techniques, there is
little evidence that subsequent projects have significantly benefited from
these developments.
10.         Some interesting findings came out of the baseline survey.   For
instance, it was determined that traffic increased considerably after the
roads were improved, but the increase was mostly non-motorized (bullock carts
and bicycles,  652) and pedestrian movements  (302).   Motorized traffic in-
creased only 5Z.  Moreover, the increase was predominantly people (85X) as
opposed to goods (15Z).   Thus, it could be inferred that project benefits
would derive more from increased personal mobility, and perhaps better employ-
ment opportunities away from the farms, than from increases in the value or
volume of agricultural production. Further substantiation of this hypothesis
and a detailed evaluation of the appraisal techniques has not been possible
for lack of follow up monitoring.
11.         Execution of the project was the responsibility  of the Rural
Engineering Organization (REO), which set up a specially staffed Project Cell
to manage it. Procedures to carry out the project were well defined. so were
the standards to prequalify contractors, to bid, and to award contracts. The
standards to design, execute, control and supervise the works were the normal
Bihar Public Works standrrds as contained in their codes since 1948.  At the
time of negotiations about 50t of the final engineering designs had been com-
pleted, they had been reviewed and found acceptable. This was enough for over
a year of work and the rest of the designs were to be prepared as the project
progressed.  The project broke no new ground, was not innovative in any way,
and no particular risks other than poor maintenance and unforeseeable floods
were identified as likely to jeopardize its outcome.  The limited ability of
the REO to supervise the execution of the works according to standards was
also foreseen as a possible cause of nonsuccess but this risk was expected to
be overcome.

Pro1ect Imolementation
12.         On July 31, 1988, of a total 742 km sanctioned to be constructed
or improved under the project, a total of 733 km of earthworks had been comp-
leted, 712 km of consolidation had been done and 688 km had been black-topped;
of 1600 pipe culverts and 132 box culverts, 1517 and 114 respectively had been
built; of 82 bridges 64 had been completed. Total expenditures on roadworks
were Rs. 450.1 million; in addition, other expenditures including plant and
equipment purchases (Rs. 47.0 m), and planning, supervision. and monitoring
expenditures (Rs. 23.5 m) raised total estimated expenditures to Rs. 520.6
million (equivalent to USS 45.7 m)(see Part III page 11, Expected and Actual
Cost and Expenditure Tables). Costs of completing yet unfinished works would
have to be added to this total.
13.         This compares with appraisal expectations of 725 km worth a total
of Rs. 382.3 million; plant and equipment, and surveying and testing equipment
purchases worth Rs. 39.9 million; and planning, supervision and monitoring
costs of Rs. 22.2 million; for a total project cost of Rs. 444.3 million. To
be strictly comparable, however, these figures would have to be adjusted to
reflect comparable physical targets and Rupee values to the works as carried
out and the expenditures as incurred. Still. roughly, roadworks turned out to
be about 15Z costlier than expected at appraisal in Rupees and slightly cheap-
er than expected in US dollars (including all taxes and contingencies).
14.         It is an achievement in itself that the physical results of the
project were close to appraisal expectations. as the project was carried out
under trying conditions. The State of Bihar was affected frequently by severe
floods. one of the conditions foreseen to possibly affect project results.
Yet, in terms of quality of the final output the project has turned out to be
considerably different from appraisal expectations. Although it was not ex-
pected that the project would bring about radical changes in the road cons-
truction and maintenance techniques used in Bihar, it was expected to build
roads of a quality that would last about ten years under normal traffic and
weathering  conditions.    Instead,  as verified by  the  completion mission
(technical audits as required contractually to be done by the Technical
ExAminer's Cell, see para. 4. were not done), many roads have failed prema-
turely or are in an advanced state of deterioration and will therefore, unless
immediate remedial measures are taken, fail very soon.  This means that the
roads as constructed are not likely to last sufficiently to accumulate enough
benefits to ensure that the rates of return of the investment in them will be
similar to appraisal expectations.
15.         These results are the consequence of both design and workmanship
shortcomings. For example, the embankments of several road sections in areas
subject to flooding have been built too low, and no protection works such as
encasing in clay or turfing were provided for, nor was there sufficient cross-
drainage.  Roads were built without the appropriate camber and shoulders of
1.75 m were not built on all the roads. In addition, there was a general lack
of adequate compaction of subgrades and embankments which resulted in early
failures particularly when the roads were subject to the effect of annual
floods or heavy vehicles.   Potholes and early cracking of the rather thin



5
bituminous carpet was largely the result of overheating the bitumen and the
lack of control over the mixing and laying of the carpets.
16.         The results are also consistent with the generalized use of static
rollers in Bihar, which are particularly ineffective in the terrain and soil
conditions prevalent in Bihar.  Although the project made provision for the
purchase of rollers, only static rollers were bought and instead of limiting
their number to the 67 originally included in the project a total of 122 were
bought.   In contrast, considerably fewer pieces ef equipment were procured,
which would have enhanced the quality of the end result.   For instance, 2
instead of 13 asphalt mixera, 57 instead of 87 bitumen kettles, none instead
of 2 bitumen preheaters and distributors, 14 instead of 54 concrete mixers and
9 instead of 25 concrete vibrators were bought.   More widespread use of
asphalt mixers to replace the current practice of heating the bitumen drums
over open wood fires and mixing the stone chips and bitumen by hand, would
have substantially improved the quality of the roads.
17.         The results raise questions on the continued use of exclusively
labor based construction techniques in cases where, as in Bihar, very expen-
sive materials are handled such as bitumen and stone (which, in addition to
their high value were, not unusually, transported for hundreds of kilometers).
In these cases some degree of mechanization (for example the use of vibrating
rollers and bitumen preheaters and mixers), as was expected to be used in the
project, is needed to make the best possible use of the expensive components
of the road structure.
18.         Problems were compounded by the limited technical capacity of
contractors and the lack of skilled foremen on the jobs. In such cases con-
tractors rely heavily on the Government (PWD) for supervision and quality
control, two elements on which considerable emphasis was placed during project
preparation. Yet, these were not satisfactory. This was partly the result of
a shortfall in the number of vehicles procured for the supervision crews,
which was compounded by the limited number and use made of laboratory and
other monitoring equipment acquired with the assistance of the credit. Also,
despite provision in the project, none of the 75 REO officers that were to be
trained either at, or by CRRI on the use of modern construction equipment, on
improved standards of road construction and on quality control, got the neces-
sary training.
19.         In addition, when the volume of work picked up in late 1982 and a
Bank mission identified a number of serious technical construction deficien-
cies which were reported as requiring urgent action and possibly jeopardizing
the project, the Bank took an extremely soft stand and just gently reminded
the Borrower of its contractual obligations. A stronger stand was necessary
at that critical moment. Moreover, during the next construction season (1982-
1983) when close to 50 of the total length built under the project was com-
pleted, no supervision mission visited Bihar.  In fact, there were no super-
vision missions during the key construction period from November 1982 until
March 1984.
P



6
20.         The high costs (for Indian standards) of the roads (over US$50,000
per km) also give cause for concern.  This result is consistent with the use
of expensive materials, in particular stone as opposed to other locally avail-
able materials, and of disproportionately expensive qtructures (for instance,
on the 16 km road from Bhabhua Jahanabad to the junction with National Highway
2 near Kudra, where there is hardly any traffic, a half a million dollar
bridge was built. rhe result clearly reflects also an insufficient effort to
locate alternative sources of paving materials. and a lack of flexibility to
use alternative construction techniques to make better use of those materials.
Efforts in this direction should have been made under the project. as this
shortcoming had been identified during project preparation.
21.         Under the project the Government of Bihar agreed to have imple-
mented through REQ a program of road maintenance that by June 30, 1986 would
have ensured that REO's network was receiving proper maintenance (Project
Agreement Section 3.02).  There is no evidence that this plan and the conse-
quent maintenance were put in place. While this was also foreseen to possibly
jeopardize the materialization of the benefits of the project, it is now
certain that this was the case.  There is little hope that the roads may be
made to last longer through appropriate maintenance actions. simply because
the mechanisms to do it are not in place.  In addition, the funding that was
expected to be allocated for maintenance every year was considerably less than
agreed at appraisal.   The expected use of contractors for most maintena3ce,
including a range of routine maintenance operations (SAR, para. 4.07), does
not seem to have materialized and therefore maintenance prospects for the
roads are not suspicious.
Project Results
22.         In retrospect, the overly confident assessment of REO's capability
to manage the project, properly supervise the execution of the works according
to standards, and its ability and will tc put in place the maintenance program
essential to uphold the integrity of the roads, were the immediate cause of
the significant variance observed between appraisal expectations and actual
results.   However, REO's lack of capacity to satisfactorily carry out the
project, was paralleled by an insufficient dedication to supervision on the
part of the Bank.   The amount of time the Bank allocated to project super-
vision contrasts starkly with the amount of time devoted to preparing and
appraising the project: 54 staffweeks over 8 years, against 114.5 staffweeks
concentrated in little over two years.   In other words, less than half the
effort that was dedicated to preparing the project was spent in ensuring that
it was carried out properly.
23.         Project results are reason for concern because if they occur under
the rather favorable circumstances of a specially staffed World Bank Project
Cell, what then can be expected of REO's considerable number of rural roads
built outside Bark assisted projects, which had no specially staffed super-
visory Cell ?  Between 1983 and 1988, concurrent with the execution of the
project, REO built 4,200 km of rural roads under the Minimum Needs Program and
about 6,700 km under the Rural Landless Employment Generation Program, both
funded by the Central Government. Altogether, about Rs. 1,820 million (about



7
USS 150 million) were spent under the first program, and Rs. 1,040 million
(about USS 85 million) under the second.
24.           Similarly, what was the result of Bank assisted rural road cons-
truction under  irrigation and other agriculture  projects  (see  Part  III,
Related Bank Loans and Projects) which received much less specialized.
professional supervisory attention than this one ?  Rural roads built under
irrigation  projects,  for  instance,  are  normally  entrusted  to  irrigation
engineers who often give the roads little importance and in many cases are not
knowledgeable about roads. It is estimated that no less than 11,500 km were
built throughout India under irrigation projects assisted by the Bank, an
investment of about USS 585 million if costs were comparable to those incurred
under this project.   Information from supervision reports for those projects
point to results as poor as those obtained under this project.
25.         It is unfortunate that standards of quality control have failed to
reach acceptable levels.   Bank efforts to improve them go back many years.
For instance, as the project was being prepared, Bank engineers and a special
engineering consultant observed that "without implying incompetence on their
part, Indian road engineers appear to have come to accept as normal a totally
inefficient system of working. Most of the younger engineers have never ex-
perienced the proper planning and execution of works. They have been encour-
aged in the false belief that rural roads require little technology and no
quality control, and that earthworks consist of nothing more than spreading
mhatever earth is readily available along the alignment and leaving nature to
consolidate the embankment over a period of time.  The standards for struc-
tural concrete can, similarly be described as poor". Harsh comments these may
be, but unfortunately there are thousands of kilometers of rural roads and
thousands of structures to confirm them.   The project was supposed to have
improved the situation but results show otherwise.
Project Sustainability
26.         The short life of the roads coupled with the lack of an effective
maintenance system to prolong the efficient use of the assets, do not bode
well for the sustainability of project benefits. In some villages the availa-
bility of a better access road may have created permanent beneficial changes,
higher mobility and with it access to better health and education facilities
in the larger towns.   Also, markets for village farmers may have expanded.
However, to satisfy those now more permanent expectations the shortlived
better road may impose on villagers a considerably higher costs, for a much
longer time, than was the case before the roads were built.
Conclusion
27.         In retrospect, although the project's physical results were close
to expectations, it seems to have yielded a very low, perhaps negative rate of
return because (i) the quality of the construction was poor, (ii) the short
life of the roads did not allow the accumulation of sufficient benefits to
offset the high construction costs, and (iii) improved maintenance practices
and programs designed to preserve the integrity of the physical investments
have not been put in place.   That the project made no direct provision for



8
maintenance and relied on the Government to put the system in place. seems to
have been a significant shortcoming.  So were the rather limited supervisory
effort provided by the Bank, and the minimal effort and inadequate implement-
ation capacity displayed by the REO. Closer, more pointed, and better quality
control by the REO would, no doubt. have avoided the poor workmanship, while
closer supervision and a firmer stand by the Bank on technical deficiencies
observed during construction would have improved construction techniques.
Both would have resulted in longer road life and higher rates of return.
28.         The solutioui to the quality control lies in the training of road
engineers and work-site foremen.   Persistent efforts by the Bank to arrange
overseas training courses for road engineers have failed in the past because
the Government has considered it unnecessary for road engineers to travel
abroad. Trivial as it may appear, overseas training is essential to obtaining
better results, particularly because few Indian road engineers have been ex-
posed to well designed, well controlled and well executed road projects.  In
addition. exposure to overseas practices could lead to a more flexible ap-
proach to rural road design specifications, away from relying almost exclu-
sively on crushed stone and more adapted to using locally available materials.
Future rural road projects should place heavy emphasis on assisting with the
effort necessary to improve construction techniques and methods, and on the
need to train engiueers overseas.
29.         These needs are highlighted by the experience of this project
which epitomizes the inconsistency of doing projects on a shoestring with less
than the most competent staff. Since most rural road projects are carried out
on minimal budgets, the use of nothing but the most highly qualified engineers
is a necessity if adequate results are sought, only their talent and abilities
will compensate, through the adaptation of techniques and methods, for the
lack of money. In the future, rural road projects should not be viewed light-
ly but as what they are, technically complex civil works, which should be done
by the best available professionals.

however, since the roads as constructed did not last sufficiently to
accumulate enough benefits to justify the investment in them, the rate
of return of the project is estimated to be very low, perhaps negative.

Dear Mr. Donaldson,
Many thanks for sending me a copy of the
Project Completion Report "Bihar Rural Roads Project".
It is indeed distressing that the physical
component of the project will not yield the desired
results and the traffic projections have also gone
awry. Let us hope we learn some lessons for the
future.
With regards,
Yours sincerely,
' K.L. Thapar )
