MEMORANDUM AND RECO(MENDATION OF THE FRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO FERROVIA PAULISTA, S.A.
FOR A FEPASA RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Ferrovia Paulista, S.A.
(FEPASA), the Sao Paulo State Railway, for US$100 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan, which would be repaid over 14
years, including three and one half years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and charges, and guaranteed by the Federative Republic
of Brazil, would help finance a FEPASA Railway Rehabilitation Project.
2.        Background.  FEPASA was formed in 1971 by the merger of five
separate railroads; it is owned almost entirely by the State of Sao Paulo.
The network, which consists of about 5,200 km of track, is organized into
three main corridors which converge in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region and
in the Santos port and industrial area. FEPASA Is predominantly a freight,
heavy-haul railway. Freight traffic increased at an average annual rate of
14% during the second nart of the 1970s, and it stabilized at about 20
million tons (7.0 million ton-km) p.a. during the early 1980s. It started to
increase again in 1985, although a number of bottlenecks in the system,
including the poor condition of important line sections and of a large
portion of the locomotive fleet, are preventing FEPASA from fully meeting the
demand. Freight traffic is forecast to increase at an average of 5% to
6% p.a. in the medium term, provided the bottlsnecks are removed, and then to
gradually stabilize. FEPASA's long-distance passenger traffic, which is now
about six million passengers p.a., is expected to continue to decrease, and
its passenger commuter traffic (about 87 million passengers p.a.) is expected
to increase at a reduced pace of about 5% p.a. in the medium term. FEPASA's
freight business has generally been lucrative, with freight revenues covering
operating costs (including depreciation) and generating a cash surplus more
than sufficient to compensate for the cash deficits of the metropolitan and
long-distance passenger services. The railway, however, has constantly
incurred losses because of large interest payments on its debts and other
financial expenses. The Federal Government's control over railway tariffs
and the State Government's control over FEPASA's investments and operations,
together with FEPASAMs own inefficiencies in various areas, particularly
planning, cost-control and management, led the railway to rely excessively
upon borrowings and have driven its debt to the level of about US$1.6 billion
equivalent.
3.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are: (a) the
financial rehabilitation of FEPASA and the establishment of the necessary
conditions for operating the railway on a commercial basis; and (b) increased
transport efficiency in the main corridors leading to Sao Paulo and to the
port of Santos. The project was designed to provide support to FEPASA and
the Sao Paulo State Government in implementing the policy and institutional
adjustments, and the rehabilitation of essential railway and intermodal
facilities, required to achieve these objectives. By achieving these
objectives, the project would contribute to more efficient recource use in
the transport sector, particularly through further specializing the railway
in the services for which it has a comparative advantage over road



transport. It would also facilitate agricultural development and external
trade through more efficient transport services between the agricultural
frontier in the Center-West region, the industrial metropolitan region and
the country's major port.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the
project would help to implement the appropriate mix of policy and institu-
tional adjustments and of physical investments necessary to gradually turn
FEPASA into a commercially viable railway. In particular, it would help to
ensure an adequate separation of the socially oriented metropolitan train
operation from FEPASA's freight and long-distance passenger bu3inesses and
the resolution of the debt problem, better define the railway's and the
Government's respective responsibilities, focus expenditures on necessary
rehabilitation and maintenance rather than on new construction or purchases,
and adhere to appropriate operational and financial policies and targets to
achieve the stated objectives. By helping to establish the conditions for an
effective management of the railway, the project would also contribute to the
Bank's public sector management objectives for Brazil.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project includes both a policy
and institutional development action program and an investment component.
The action program would consist of the implementation of policies and
actions for: (a) an organizational and financial restructuring of FEPASA;
(b) the rationalization and improved operation and financing of FEPASA's
commercially non-viable services, and effective corporate and business
planning; (c) appropriate tariffs, marketing and cost control; (d) the
development of the operations and maintenance management systems; and
(e) effective personnel management and training. The investment component
would consist of FEPASA's Rehabilitation Program, and of technical assistance
and training programs which would support the implementation of the action
program. FEPASA's Rehabilitation Program includes: (a) the rehabilitation of
infra- and/or superstructure on critical line sections; (b) the rehabilita-
tion or expansion of yard and intermodal terminal facilities; (c) the
improvement of the railway's telecommunications system; (d) the purchase of
track maintenance equipment, spare parts and materials; (e) the rehabilita-
tion of locomotives and components and purchase of spare parts; (f) the
purchase of specialized wagor.s; and (g) equipment for workshops.
6.        The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$285.0
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of about US$152.0
million (53%). The project would be implemented over seven years. A
breakdown of costs and the financial plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as a disbursement
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the location of the
investment component is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6531-BR dated May 7, 1987, is being distributed separately.
7.        Agreed Actions.  The following actions were agreed: (a) the State
would assume and capitalize FEPASA's State-guaranteed, pre-1987 debt; the
Federal and the State Governments would study and define the treatment of
FEPASA's Federally guaranteed debt by November 30, 1987; FEPASA would limit
its future borrowings, as a percentage of internally generated funds, to the



- 3 -
agreed targets, decreasing from 340% in 1987-1988 to 40% in 1991-1993;
(b) FEPASA would maintain separate accounts and operating and capital budgets
for the metropolitan train operation, complete the separation of the balance
sheet items by the end of 1987, and refrain from transferring funds to this
operation from its other revenues unless it is required by normal business
compensation practices; and, each year, forward to the Bank, for review and
comment, the normalization arrangements with the State regarding commercially
non-viable services for the forthcoming year; (c) FEPASA would upgrade its
cost-accounting system and develop a cost-related, market-based tariff
structure by December 31, 1988; the Federal Government's policy of gradually
freeing RFFSA's tariffs would also apply to FEPASA, which would enable FEPASA
to set freight tariffs on a commercial basis upon completion of the above;
FEPASA would adjust its freight tariffs and rates and its passenger fares,
and reduce and/or rationalize its commercially non-viable passenger and
freight services so as to: (i) achieve the agreed annual targets for working
ratios (including normalization payments), which would decrease, between 1987
and 1993, from .93 to .61 for the freight business, from 1.6 to 1.0 for the
long-distance passenger business, from 1.4 to 1.0 for the metropolitan train
and from .93 to .69 for the entire company; (ii) contain Government
normalization payments for the long-distance passenger and freight services,
as a percentage of corresponding operating revenues, below the agreed limits,
decreasing from 12% in 1987 to 3% in 1993; and (iii) by the end of 1993,
recover all costs, including depreciation and interest, from operating
revenues; (d) the State Government and FEPASA would prepare a pluriannual
plan for the metropolitan train and a pluriannual plan for the railway's
long-distance passenger services by December 31, 1987; FEPASA would prepare
a corporate plan by June 30, 1988; FEPASA would analyze the feasibility of
its new investments in accordance with technical and economic criteria
satisfactory to the Bank, and, each year, discuss its pluriannual investment
program and financing plan with the Bank; (e) FEPASA would develop a sales
planning and control system and finalize joint-venture arrangements for the
construction and operation of grain terminals by July 31, 1988; undertake by
December 1, 1987, and complete by December 31, 1989, the consolidation of the
organization of operations and maintenance, and the development and
implementation of inrormation and control systems for operations, locomotive
and wagon maintenance, and for track maintenance; and undertake by December
1, 1987, and complete by December 31, 1990, the development and implementa-
tion of a personnel management and training program; (f) FEPASA would
maintain organizational arrangements and a project monitoring system
satisfactory to the Bank, and a Project Account in Cruzados with a guaranteed
credit line of not less than US$1.0 million equivalent; retroactive financing
for not more than US$1.0 million would be available for technical assistance
and training expenditures incurred after May 1, 1987. As conditions for loan
effectiveness, FEPASA would: (a) p:t into effect the project organization and
monitoring system; and (b) establish the Project Account in form and
substance satisfactory to the Bank.
8.        Justifi.cation.  Economic benefits under the project are expected
from (a) train operating cost savings; and (b) total transport cost savings
related to traffic that would transfer to road transport if the project were
not implemented. The economic rate of return of the overall investment
component of the project is estimated to be 21x. The rates of return of the
major individual investments, which were evaluated separately, are estimated
to be between 16% and 30%.



- 4 -
9.        Risks.  Project benefits could be affected by lower-than-expected
economic performance, particularly in the agriculture and export sectors in
the regions served by the project corridors, and by unexpected delays in
project implementation. However, assuming that the transport demand is 20%
below the forecast and project costs are 20% higher than the estimates, the
project would still have a 14% rate of return. An appropriate project
monitoring system would be established to minimize the risks.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
