BRAZIL
FEPASA RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2857-BR)
Evaluation Summary
The project was the sixth in a series of railway loans supported by the Bank in
Brazil. The cost of the FEPASA Railway Rehabilitation Railway Project for the Sao
Paulo Railway was estimated to be US$285 million, with a Bank loan of US$100 million
equivalent. Final project costs were US$227.2 million, with US$99,983,932 disbursed
from the Bank loan.
Project Objectives
According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and the Loan Agreement (LA), the
project objectives were:  (a) the financial rehabilitation and improved commercial
performance of FEPASA; and (b) increased transport efficiency in the main railway
corridors leading to Sao Paulo and to the Port of Santos.
By achieving these objectives, the project was to contribute to more efficient
resource use in the transport sector, particularly through further specialization of the
railway in the services for which it has a comparative advantage over road transport. The
project would also facilitate agricultural development and external trade through the
provision of more efficient transport services between the agricultural hinterland, the
industrial metropolitan region of Sao Paulo and the country's major port at Santos. The
Bank's involvement in the project would help provide an appropriate mix of policy and
institutional adjustments and investments necessary to gradually transform FEPASA into a
commercially viable railway. Separation of the metropolitan services from FEPASA
operations was a related objective to help achieve viability.
To support the project's objectives, loan proceeds were to finance: (a) a policy
development and institutional component, which through the use of action plans, would
address company-wide and sectional issues, and gradually turn FEPASA into a
commercially viable railway, and (b) an investment component covering FEPASA's
rehabilitation program and a technical assistance and training program to support the
implementation action plans.



iii
Implementation Experience and Results
The project aimed at an extensive coverage of FEPASA, reaching through its
institutional component the entire gamut of FEPASA operations, and through the
investment component the most important corridors of the railway network. The internal
economic rate of return on the investments (IERR) was 19.8% for the project (overall),
compared to the estimate of 21% at appraisal.
Project implementation was delayed by two years and took eight years to
implement instead of six, mainly due to: (i) a marked deterioration in the macro-economic
situation leading to counterpart funding problems during the project period; and (ii)
political factors leading to frequent changes in the administration resulting in counterpart
funding and management problems. An additional reason for the delay was the important
decision in the last year of the project to conduct the FEPASA Restructuring study which
laid the groundwork for the privatization of FEPASA. The first two of these elements
combined to slow down investments, restrain traffic increases and restrict freedom in
increasing tariffs.  The result was that the financial improvement forecast did not
materialize, although several cost reductions were made as a result of the implementation
of the action plans and the investments and system improvements. Final project costs
were US$227.2 million, compared with US$285 million at appraisal. The reduced size of
the project resulted from agreement at mid-term (1990-1991) to modify the project scope
by reducing the level and pace of investments, due to the reduced availability of
counterpart funds.
The deterioration of the Brazilian economy and the political and management
changes significantly affected the achievement of the objectives of the project. Moreover,
financial improvements were quite limited. On the other hand, important cost reductions
were made. The staff of FEPASA was reduced from 18,700 in 1987 to 11,500 in 1995.
However most of this reduction occurred in the last year of the project.  Intercity
passenger services were reduced. Separation of the metropolitan trains' accounts was
achieved during this project, and urban/metropolitan train services managed by the CBTU
and FEPASA were transferred to the state-owned CPTM (Companhia Paulista de
Transporte Metropolitana) which was formed to manage all urban transport in the Sao
Paulo metropolitan area. FEPASA gained authorization to set tariffs (although its
implementation was hindered by the macroeconomic stabilization programs). Traffic in
the corridors did not increase due to the downturn in the economy (paras 13 & 14).
Although the investments in the corridors brought about substantial improvements in the
system (paras. 11 and 12), the institutional component brought only limited improvements
(para. 12-14) but nevertheless influenced the Government and FEPASA to initiate a
serious effort to restructure and privatize the entity. A consultant's study to review the
question of restructuring FEPASA (including privatisation and concessioning) was the last
action taken in the project (para. 6).
Bank performance on the whole was satisfactory, especially during project
preparation and supervision during the second half of the project period (paras. 17-20).



iv
Borrower performance started well with good project preparation in close collaboration
with the Bank, but was unsatisfactory during project implementation largely due to the
adverse macro-economic situation and the frequent changes in the management of the
railways (paras. 21-23), which resulted in non-compliance with the loan covenants and the
curtailment of project performance.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
Clearly the political risks were underestimated at appraisal, as was also the deterioration of
the macro-economic situation.  This led to overoptimistic forecasts. Despite the real
achievements of the project, described more fully below, the delays and difficulties
experienced during implementation lead to a rating of the outcome as a whole as
(marginally) unsatisfactory.   Of the two principal objectives of the project, the
achievement in one, the improvement of the corridors, was significantly attained. For the
other, the financial rehabilitation and improvement of the commercial performance of the
railway as a whole, this objective was not achieved. This was not only because of the
macro-economic and political situation (BNDES withdrew its participation in the
counterpart funding at a critical time in the project), but also because the state
administrators were reluctant to fundamentally restructure the railway entity. In
retrospect, and with the benefit of hindsight, it would appear that the project was
overoptimistic in its forecast of expected improvements since it expected almost the
complete financial rehabilitation of a railway system (with a long history of poor financial
performance) within the context of a single investment operation. However, one of the
results of the project under review was that it contributed to a serious effort at the
reorganization, restructuring and privatization of FEPASA which was initiated with the
study on the restructuring of FEPASA. Continued strengthening and restructuring of the
railway system through the pursuit of the objectives of the project under review, and
through the restructuring and privatization proposed by the study (para 6), would improve
the sustainability of this project. Overall, therefore, the project experience has been
worthwhile, since it provided useful lessons to help guide the design and implementation
of railway reform of an important part of the rail system in Brazil.
Any Bank support for future operations of this kind should be based on a realistic
assessment of the macro-economic and political risks.  The main lessons for future
projects are that:
(i)   although there were major shortfalls in the implementation of the project,
the experience was not altogether negative, and helped steer the railway
and the Government towards the current restructuring effort and the
proposed concessioning of railway operations;
(ii)   The FEPASA Rehabilitation Project enabled useful investments to be made
which arrested the deterioration of the railway's infrastructure and rolling
stock. Although the project was over-ambitious in its expectation of



v
institutional and financial improvements under state-controlled operations,
the system improvements, the staff reductions achieved and the new
partnership with the private sector (para. 12) set the basis for the broader
reform.
(iii) a major restructuring of the railway, including substantial participation of
the private sector, now appears possible and essential to bring about the
creation of a commercially viable entity and to reduce government
subsidies;
(iv)   the unreserved support and continued commitment of the Government is a
prerequisite for the success of the restructuring effort;
(v)   railway restructuring is a time-consuming and contentious process in
which: (a) critical decisions in regard to the policy and its implementation
are productive only if they emanate from a consensus within the country;
and (b) real benefits are obtained by the utilization of the services of
authoritative and impartial bodies (including consultants) and by entrusting
the planning and definition of policy choices to such entities; and
(vi)  future Bank railway lending, if any, should be confined to the support of
deregulation, restructuring and privatization of the railway system.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
FEPASA RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2857-BR)
PART I: IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Project Objectives
1.    The objectives of the project were: (a) to assist the Borrower in the carrying out
of a program aimed at its financial rehabilitation and the improvement of its commercial
performance; and (b) to increase transport efficiency in the main railway corridors leading
to the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region and to the Port of Santos.
2.    The SAR reflected an expectation that by achieving these objectives, the project
would contribute to a more efficient resource use of the transport sector through the
continued and enhanced specialization of the railway in services for which it had a
comparative advantage over road transport, and through a reduction in the public sector
deficit. In particular, it would help to ensure an adequate separation of the metropolitan
train operation and the resolution of the debt problem, streamline the railway's and
government's respective responsibilities, focus expenditures on urgent rehabilitation rather
than on new construction and purchases, and adhere to appropriate operational and
financial policies and targets to achieve the objectives.
3.    The design of the FEPASA rehabilitation project was simple. It had a policy and
institutional development action program, and an investment component to improve the
corridors.
4.    The policy  and  institutional development component consisted  of the
implementation of policies and actions for:  (a) an organizational and financial
restructuring of FEPASA; (b) the rationalization and improved operation and financing of
FEPASA's non-viable services; (c) appropriate tariffs marketing and cost control; and (d)
the development of operations and management systems and training of staff. The
investment component consisted of FEPASA's rehabilitation program, and of technical
assistance and training programs to support the implementation of the action programs.
5.    A review of the objectives of the project after the completion of the project leads
to three principal observations. First, the investment objectives aimed to carry out specific
investments to rehabilitate the railway facilities and equipment and as such were quite
enthusiastically owned, pursued and implemented by FEPASA (to the extent funds
permitted). Secondly, the policy and institutional improvements together with the action
plans were, as even a quick perusal of these plans reveals, rather voluminous and over-



- 2-
ambitious. These action plans were enthusiastically accepted, but reluctantly implemented,
in great part due to the adverse macro-economic conditions. Thirdly, although the pattern
of institutional organizational and managerial improvement covered by the project
followed the pattern of most railway projects so far, no drastic restructuring or
privatization of essential railway functions was considered. This project was prepared
between 1985 and 1987. By this time, the Bank had the accumulated experience of a
fairly large number of railway projects around the world and although a consensus was
appearing that something drastic needed to be done to restructure railways, the
privatization option had not quite emerged as the clearest solution. Privatization was
really not considered as an option as part of this project. As such, nothing spectacular
happened in this area during the project, although the dialogue generated during the
implementation of the project, led, during its final stages, to the start of a study for the
restructuring and privatization of FEPASA.
B. Achievement of Objectives
6.    The investments were concentrated in the infrastructure, rollingstock and
equipment related to the corridors leading to the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region and to
the port of Santos. To the extent that these investments were executed, the corridors
were improved and the track, motive power and rolling stock was rehabilitated, and saved
from further deterioration and decline. However, traffic failed to increase, and in fact,
declined, largely due to the downturn in the Brazilian economy. An additional reason for
the fall in traffic was the lack of coordination between the port authority, RFFSA (which
owns the track in the vicinity of Santos) and FEPASA, a problem which was frequently
the subject of attempts to improve the relationship, but was, somehow not effectively
resolved. FEPASA's financial performance was poor during the project implementation
period. Financial objectives set at the time of appraisal had to be revised to take into
account the reality of the slow progress. On the other hand, staff reductions at FEPASA
from 18,700 in 1987 to 11,500 at the close of the project, aided by an effective staff
incentive program, were far in excess of the modest figure of 1,000 forecast at appraisal.
The separation of the metropolitan train operation and its merger with the CPTM was also
a significant institutional achievement, and helped to clean up the operations of FEPASA.
More than anything else, the implementation of this project marked the turning point in the
commitment of FEPASA and the Government to a process of restructuring and
privatization, and the very last act of the project was the start of the FEPASA
Restructuring Study which was financed from the Bank loan. The recommendations of
this study have formed the basis for reorganizing the railway and for concessioning its
operations.
7.    Physical Components. The investments in the corridor comprised mainly: (a)
infrastructure rehabilitation works including earthworks, and drainage systems for the
track, (b) superstructure rehabilitation works including acquisition of rails, sleepers,
fastenings, ballast in the Araguari-Santos corridor, the broad-gauge corridor and the
meter-gauge corridor; (c) rehabilitation and improvement of yard facilities, construction



- 3-
and expansion of intermodal terminals and silos; (d) acquisition and utilization of track
maintenance machinery, equipment and spare parts for the network; (e) workshop
improvements including overhaul of locomotives, acquisition of machinery and spare
parts; and (f) Replacement of existing telephone lines by radio (VHF & UHF) and the
installation of optic fibre on important lines.
8.    The cost of the project at appraisal was estimated to be US$285 million including
the investments and technical assistance. Of this amount, US$100 million was to be
financed from the Bank loan (35.1%), US$107.8 million from BNDES (37.8%), US$13.5
million from cofinancier's (4.7%), and US$63.7 million from FEPASA's own resources
(22.4%).
9.    During project implementation, changes were made in the project scope which
were caused by the worsening economic situation in the country which in turn resulted in
reduced traffic as well as in the diminished availability of counterpart funds and lending
policy changes in BNDES which led to their withdrawal from funding the project. The
changes, while maintaining the development objectives of the project, reduced the level
and pace of investments by redefining the project, and increased Bank participation from
35.1% to 42.2% of the project cost. The total cost of the project was reduced from
US$285 million to US$237.2 million. The expenditure on the telecommunications project
was substantially reduced with the cooperation of the telecommunications company
(EMBRATEL) in the installation of fibre-optic equipment.
10.   The project which was started in late 1987 should have been completed in
December 1993, but was actually finished in December 1995. The loan closing date was
extended twice, once in 1994 (to June 1995) due to delays in project execution and again
in 1995 (from June 1995 to December 1995) to provide for the completion of the
FEPASA restructuring study for the reorganization of the railway. When the project was
finally closed in December 1995, it cost US$227.2 million compared with the Appraisal
forecast of US$285 million, and the revised forecast (para 9) of 237.2 million.
11.   The implementation of the project investments brought about the following
improvements:
(a)   improved condition of the track infrastructure in the corridors, resulting in
increased speeds and reduced accidents;
(b)   more efficient yards, intermodal terminals and silo facilities (with private
sector participation), resulting in improved wagon handling and better grain
storage facilities;
(c)   better communication facilities from  the improved infrastructure and
superstructure and installation of fibre-optic facilities on important
sections; and



- 4-
(d)   improved stock of spare parts and machinery for the rehabilitation and
maintenance of the track, rolling stock, motive power and workshops.
The overall effect of the above system improvements was that FEPASA could reduce its
staff effectively (para. 6), thus setting the stage for the restructuring of the railway.
12.   Institutional Component.  Coupled with the investment component, the
institutional component aimed to implement a mix of policy and institutional adjustments
to reorganize FEPASA, to rehabilitate the railway financially, and to gradually turn
FEPASA into a commercially viable railway. Towards the achievement of this end, the
following notable changes occurred:
(a)   assumption by the Government and capitalization of the pre-1987 debt as
per the agreement dated March 28, 1987 between FEPASA and the State;
(b)   study and definition of the treatment of FEPASA's federally guaranteed
debt as per the protocol dated February 28, 1987;
(c)   FEPASA limited its future borrowings as a percentage of internally
generated funds in accordance with Sec. 5.06 (a) of the Loan Agreement;
(d)   FEPASA separated the accounts and operating and capital budgets for the
metropolitan train operation from the accounts and budgets maintained for
its freight and long distance passenger transportation businesses, enabling
its transfer into CPTM;
(e)   efforts were made to contain government normalization payments for the
long distance passenger and freight services as a percentage of operating
revenues;
(f)   introduction  of modern  computer based  cost- accounting, office
information systems (OIS) and maintenance information systems(MIS) in
preparation for the restructuring of the railway; and
(g)   introduction of a new client-oriented marketing and sales system, and the
involvement of the private sector in a number of railway functions.
13.   However, FEPASA's efforts at increasing its traffic were annulled by the adverse
economic developments. The cost-accounting system was upgraded, and although a cost-
related, market-based tariff structure was developed, it was implemented only towards the
end of the project and inadequately due to the various economic stabilization plans. A
review of the financial performance of FEPASA during the project period (para. 14)
reveals that financial progress remained consistently poor due to: (i) the deterioration of
the macro-economic situation which reduced the availability of counter part funds,
restrained traffic growth and inhibited tariff adjustments; (ii) political instability and

government intervention in the affairs of the railway; and (iii) frequent changes in
FEPASA's management. As a result, FEPASA continued to generate substantial annual
operating losses, which were exacerbated by the unstable macro-economic situation. The
Government decided in 1995 to precipitate action to initiate the privatization and
restructuring of FEPASA operations and towards this end, conducted the Study for the
restructuring of FEPASA to concession FEPASA operations together with a gradual
integration with the adjoining RFFSA network. Thus, although the project achieved little
financial success, the restructuring of its operations spearheaded by the separation of the
metropolitan operations, the very substantial staff reductions, and the various system
improvements helped FEPASA become a more attractive candidate for the
privatization/concession option.
14.   Financial Performance. The financial performance targets set during appraisal
were not met by FEPASA (see Tables 7 and 9B). In spite of the implementation of the
costing system and liberalization of the tariff structure, increases in tariffs dictated by the
costing system could not be implemented as the Government saw the tariff increases as
inflationary. However, the main factor contributing to FEPASA's poor results was the
general downturn in the economy of the country, which reduced traffic volumes below the
appraisal estimates. Delays in the implementation of the investment program, caused
mainly by BNDES cancellation and shortage of counterpart funds also contributed to the
general deterioration of the system and reduced the availability of the motive power and
rolling stock (see Table 6). FEPASA responded to these challenges by cutting down costs
(mainly personnel) and by postponing the maintenance and refurbishing of equipment.
FEPASA also formed creative partnerships with the private sector in the
telecommunications field and in the development of intermodal facilities and grain-
handling silos. The financial targets set at the time of appraisal were too optimistic and
did not foresee the economic downturn, or the problems relating to the availability of
counterpart resources or for that matter the frequent changes in the management of
FEPASA. Recognizing the important changes in the business environment, the Bank
revised the financial targets, but by then a market deterioration had set in. It is clear
however, that without the project, financial performance would have been far worse, as
the system changes (paras 11 &12) and the important cost reductions would not have
taken place. It is also this failure to turn the railway around within the scope of public
sector management that finally influenced the government to restructure FEPASA and to
move it steadily towards an increasing association with the private sector.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
15.   Several factors affected the execution of the project. These were primarily: (i) a
marked deterioration in the macro-economic situation during the project period resulting
in the implementation of the governments' economic stabilization plans; (ii) political
factors leading to frequent changes in the administration and management of FEPASA (six
presidents in eight years), and (iii) lack of proper coordination between FEPASA and
RFFSA in the Sao Paulo region and the Port of Santos. These factors are, in many



- 6-
respects, interrelated. The worsening of the economic situation directly and adversely
affected traffic volumes and prevented the attainment of the traffic targets forecast at
appraisal. In addition, the financial stringency imposed by the economic down-turn
slowed the rhythm of investments, led to the withdrawal of BNDES from project funding
and resulted in the renegotiation of several ongoing contracts. Tariff increases forecast at
appraisal and supported by the costing studies were not implemented because the
government considered them  inflationary.   Politically motivated  changes in the
administration and management of FEPASA occurred six times during the 7-8 year period
of execution of the project, adversely affecting decision-making processes at the highest
levels in railway administration. Finally, the succession of strikes in the Port of Santos and
the poor coordination between FEPASA and RFFSA in the area of access to the Sao
Paulo region and Port of Santos led to detentions to trains and increases in the turn-
around time of wagons, reducing wagon availability to carry freight. The combined effect
of slower investments restraining capacity development, lower traffic, inadequate increases
in tariffs, and frequent changes in management leading to indecision and delays, resulted in
deterioration of the financial situation of FEPASA despite the system improvements and
cost reductions brought about by the project.
D. Project Sustainability
16.   Continued substantial strengthening of the FEPASA administration through the
pursuit of objectives initiated during this project and concessioning of operations to the
private sector, as well as the government's current commitment to the restructuring of the
railway sub-sector, augur well for the sustainability of this project. The sustainability is
further enhanced by the increasing awareness of the need for allocation of adequate
financing for railway investments to ensure proper maintenance of the infrastructure.
However, although sustainability will be clearly enhanced by the privatization actions
following the closing of the project, the overall sustainability is uncertain.
E.    Bank Performance
17.   Project Identification and Preparation.  Satisfactory.  This project was
identified in 1985, appraised in 1986, approved by the Board in June 1987, and became
effective in December 1987 (Table 3). From identification to appraisal, the project and
project issues were progressively defined through a set of three project briefs in the
relatively short period from the first identification mission in February 1985 to appraisal in
September 1986.
18.   Project Appraisal. Generally satisfactory. Project implementation fell short of
expectations because the political risks and the macro-economic deterioration were under-
estimated (although to what extent these could have been anticipated at appraisal is
debatable). The project design was simple although the expectations from the project
were fairly high. Clearly there was a degree of mismatch between the investments and the



- 7-
financial and operational improvements anticipated, which was aggravated by the adverse
economic and political developments.
19.   Supervision. Satisfactory. A substantial degree of continuity in the essential
Bank staff involved in the project preparation, appraisal and supervision made for good
cooperation, and a constructive dialogue between the Borrower and the Bank. This
brought about some changes in the Project in 1990 when only about 33% of the project
had been implemented (against the appraisal target of 65%) and when it became apparent
that the project needed to be redefined and curtailed to take into account the reduced
availability of funds. In August 1991, a Bank mission took stock of the delays in the
project execution and carried out a detailed review to seek agreement with FEPASA on a
corrective investment program, reducing some of the infrastructure works of lower
priority as also the locomotive and telecommunications program and some of the yard
rehabilitation works. An important feature of this review was the introduction of private
sector partnerships in areas such as telecommunications and rolling stock. The project
was eventually completed in December 1995 at a cost of US$227.2 million against the
appraisal estimate of US$285 million.
20.   In the final stages of the project, the introduction of the Study for the
Restructuring of FEPASA (see para. 13) laid the groundwork for the reorganization and
gradual privatization of FEPASA.
F. Borrower Performance
21.   Preparation and Appraisal.  Satisfactory.  Preparation for this project was
started during a Bank mission on June 1985 when FEPASA's Investment Plans, its
financial situation (including the debt services problem) and related issues such as the tariff
strategy, normalization payments, and separation of the Metropolitan services were
discussed in detail. A succession of project briefs leading to appraisal that followed were
a result of a collaborative effort that reflected the concerns of FEPASA as well as the
Bank, and presented a mix of investments and actions directed to gradually achieving
financial viability for FEPASA.
22.   Implementation.  Unsatisfactory. Marred by the economic downturn in the
country and severely restricted by the Government's economic stabilization program,
project implementation was grossly impaired. In addition, frequent political changes in the
management and administration of FEPASA (six times during the project period)
seriously affected decision-making.  The slow  speed of investments delayed the
rehabilitation of the infrastructure, motive power and rolling stock, making recovery
slower than forecast at appraisal. The lack of counterpart funds, the inadequacy of the
normalization payments, and the inability of the Borrower to raise tariffs were the direct
results of the Government's economic stabilization program, and together prevented the



- 8-
financial recovery of FEPASA. The plans of action had been accepted by the Borrower
but could not be fully implemented.
23.   Compliance with Loan Covenants. Deficient. The status of implementation of
the major legal covenants is given in Table 10. Non-compliance or partial compliance was
a problem throughout most of the implementation of the project. As a result, the financial
condition of FEPASA hardly improved even though important cost reductions were made
by staff reductions, and the restructuring study financed by the Bank Loan laid the
groundwork for the future plans to reorganize FEPASA.
G. Assessment of Outcome
24.   Overall rating.  Marginally satisfactory.  Although a review of the project
indicates that the implementation was, for various reasons, unsatisfactory for much of the
project's duration, the final outcome of the project was satisfactory. There were two
basic objectives. The first pertained to the investments and improvements to the export
corridors.  This was clearly achieved, for despite the delays, the investments were
completed and capacity improvements did take place although on a diminished scale. The
increase in traffic was inhibited by the economic situation. As for the second major
objective (institutional improvements), the Action Plans resulted in reductions in staff,
closures of uneconomic lines, closure of passenger services, systems improvements and
rationalization of workshops and rail yards. Separation of the metropolitan suburban
services was achieved once and for all. However several of the important loan covenants
were not implemented (Table 10). In its final stages the project led to the realization that
a major restructuring of the railway was needed to bring about improvement in the
railway's finances, and the first definite step towards this end was taken by the start and
completion of the study financed by the Bank loan. The re-evaluated internal economic
rate of return on the investments (JERR) is estimated to be 19.8% for the project (table
9A), as compared to 21% at appraisal.
25.   Linkages between the restructuring operations on RFFSA and FEPASA are
inevitable and desirable as they depend upon each other for freight as well as movement of
traffic. With the Brazilian government committed to the restructuring of the Brazilian
Railway System, covering both RFFSA and FEPASA, the key to the future sustainability
of this project is in the hands of the government of Brazil and the management of RFFSA
and FEPASA. To the extent the railway organization can be effectively restructured to
improve its operation and finances, the sustainability of the project would be enhanced.
The Bank has supported the restructuring of RFFSA through the Federal Railways
Restructuring and Privatization Project (Loan 4046-BR) and financed the FEPASA.
Restructuring study from Loan 2857-BR. FEPASA has come a long way since it was
formed in 1971 by the merger of five separate railroads owned by the State of Sao Paulo,
but its financial and operational performance has been poor.  For this reason, the
Government's decision to restructure and privatize FEPASA operations is timely. The
FEPASA Restructuring Study has concluded, in confirmation of the Bank's findings that:



- 9-
a.    the operational performance of the railway can be dramatically improved
(reducing unit costs in the freight business to as much as one-third) without
a requirement for much capital investment, through rationalization of assets
and facilities, improved management processes and improved productivity;
b.    with the separation of the Metropolitan Suburban Services, FEPASA is left
with its long distance passenger service which is not financially viable.
Continuation of this activity should depend only on the Govermment
providing support to cover losses;
c.    there is a good market for the freight railway. The railway is currently
carrying only 50% of its assessed potential;
d.    to realize its potential, FEPASA  must be liberated from  regulatory
restrictions to pursue commercial practices (basically done through the
March 1996 regulation).
e.    extensive involvement of the private sector through concessions provides
the greatest opportunity for success; and
f.    RFFSA is being concessioned at the present time.  Integration of the
FEPASA corridors with the adjacent RFFSA network provides the most
effective and efficient solution for the Brazilian economy and the highest
commercial value for the private sector.
26.   It is important that the concession agreements with private sector firms, while
defining output-based service requirements for the operators (concessionaires), should be
determined for the process of transition with the full realization that commercial risks to
the operator are high and that retums on investments may not be generated for some
considerable time into the future.
27.   Preliminary experience around the world with the concessioning of railway
services shows that most of the problems can be effectively addressed through rigorous
cost-cutting and through concession of operation and maintenance functions to the private
sector within an appropriate regulatory framework. These are the essentials of the future
railway operation proposed for and currently being implemented in Brazil.
H. Key Lessons Learned
28.   The lessons learned from this project discussed below underscore the linkages
between project success and project design, ownership, the railways' and the
Governments' role, local funding, capability constraints and the macro-economic climate.



- 10-
29.   Project Design. The project design envisaged an institutional component together
with a set of action plans to implement and weave the two together. However, although
the investment part of the project was clear-cut and specific, the institutional and policy
part, by its very nature, was less specific and had the defect that although it contained
detailed instructions for the various plans (tariffs, marketing, sales planning, control
systems, training, etc.), it lacked a significant restructuring component for the railway. By
the time this project was underway, Bank experience with railway projects was beginning
to show that mere exhortations to cut costs, raise tariffs and improve efficiency do not
bring about the required improvements unless deep-seated transformations are brought
about in the organizational structure involving basic changes in the attitudes of managers.
Also, it has been evident that, whereas changing the institution is a sine qua non of
progress in the railways, this cannot be brought about without increasing significantly the
role of the private sector in the management, as it is the private sector that brings about
the required change in the attitudes of the management. This project had the required
investments and the Action Plans to operate the railways on a commercial basis, including
normalization payments for public service obligations, but the lesson learned was that
government intervention could not be contained due to public ownership. As a result, the
institutional component of the project was not particularly effective. It was, in effect, the
continued unsatisfactory financial performance of FEPASA which impelled the
government, towards the end of the project, to launch a study to devise plans for the
restructuring the railway.
30.    Project Ownership.  The importance of project ownership by both the
implementing agency (FEPASA) and the Government cannot be over-emphasized. For
important projects involving significant cost-cutting operations, efficiency improvements
and important revenue increases, the success of the project is highly dependent upon the
presence and support of a champion.  During project preparation, ownership was
strengthened by having FEPASA and the government jointly prepare the project. During
appraisal and negotiations the Government and FEPASA signed on all the Action Plans,
but subsequent changes in the Government, followed by repeated reshuffies in the
FEPASA management, prevented the managers from effectively 'bwning" and pursuing
the changes planned with regard to the institutional and policy improvements. The
investments, on the other hand, although delayed and somewhat curtailed due to shortage
of counterpart funds, were effectively implemented, thus resulting in some improvements
in rail operations, achieved principally through staff reductions, and system improvements
(paras 11 and 12).
31.   As in most other railway projects financed by the Bank, the lessons learned are as
significant as the successes and failures in the implementation of the project. The main
lessons learned from this project are that:
(i)   although there were major shortfalls in the implementation of the project
under review, the experience was not altogether negative. The cost and
system improvements that took place, together with the continuous
dialogue with the Bank, steered FEPASA and the Government towards a



- 11-
serious study to restructure the railway. This study was financed from the
Bank loan and provides basic analyses and recommendations for
restructuring of the entity;
(ii)  the FEPASA Rehabilitation Project enabled useful investments to be made
to arrest the deterioration of the railway infrastructure, rolling stock and
equipment, but this project was over-ambitious in its expectations of
improvements without the inclusion of any significant restructuring element
in the project;
(iii) a major restructuring and redesign of the railway, with the participation of
the private sector, is a must to bring about the creation of a commercially
viable entity and to reduce the public sector deficits that have plagued
railway systems around the world;
(iv)  the unreserved support and continued commitment of the governments is a
prerequisite for the success of the restructuring effort;
(v)   the critical decisions in regard to the policy and its implementation can be
productive only if they emanate from a consensus within the country;
(vi)  railway restructuring, is a time-consuming and contentions process. An
important element in many of the restructuring programs for railways has
been the use of the services of authoritative and impartial bodies (including
consultants). Experience around the world clearly indicates that real
benefits have been gained by entrusting the planning and definition of
policy choices to such entities. In this respect, FEPASA is moving in the
right direction; and
(vii)  future Bank railway lending, if any, should be confined to the support of
deregulation, restructuring and privatization of the railway system.

Notes on the Economic Analysis
The ground for the present economic evaluation was laid out by the interim appraisal performed by the
Bank in 1990 which suggested that the 'without' case assumed in the appraisal of the project needed
to be substantially revised because of the deteriorating economic situation and capital constraints faced
by FEPASA. For the purposes of calculating economic rate of return on the completion of the project,
it is deemed impractical to compare the "without" case in the SAR with that at the termination of the
project. Had this been done, the EIRR would have been about 6.5 percent.
Instead, a different 'without' case was projected starting form the conditions that existed during the
appraisal and modified taking into account the deterioration in the general economic condition. The new
.without' case assumed:
a) The production levels in the without case would be appreciably below (23 percent) those assumed
during appraisal;
b) In the first four years of the project, the transport volume without the project would be similar to those
identified in the SAR followed by a drop in the next two years which will be accompanied by rising
transport costs on the same scale as the actual increase
c) The costs of transfer to road transport were kept same in relation to the transport costs identified in
the SAR for the alternative without the project up to 1990. Starting in 1991, road freight rate is applied
to the transport estimated and not effected by rail.
These criteria provide reasonable basis for comparing the effects of the project in relation to what would
be expected without it. The resulting EIRR is 19.78 percent and NPV of US$58.28 million at 10 percent.

Summary Evaluation
FEPASA Rehabilitation and Modernization Plan (PRMF)
Loan Agreement No. 2857-BR
Brazil
INTRODUCTION
The World Bank's association with FEPASA goes back to 1975, the year in
which the Bank's Third Railway Project in Brazil (Loan No. 1171-BR, of October
1975, of US$75 million equivalent) was launched, the main objectives of which
were to: (a) rehabilitate and, where necessary, expand the system; (b) improve
FEPASA's operating and financial performance; (c) upgrade the suburban
passenger services in the S3o Paulo area; and (d) strengthen the coordination of
urban transport in the Sao Paulo area. This project was completed in October
1983, after being redefined in 1977.
PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In 1987 FEPASA, in pursuance of the Sao Paulo State Government's
transport policy, signed Loan Agreement No. 6531-BR, subsequently No. 2857-BR,
in an amount of US$100 million, with the World Bank, with the guarantee of the
Federal and State Governments concerning counterpart funding of US$107.8
million from the BNDES, US$63.7 million from FEPASA itself, through the Sao
Paulo State Treasury, plus US$13.5 million in supplier credit, making a total of
US$285 million equivalent, for the provision of services and execution of
rehabilitation works for the following corridors: (a) Araguari-Santos; (b) Broad-
Gauge Corridor; and (c) Metric-Gauge Corridor, including implementation of
business programs.
The priority objectives of the project investments were:  (a) financial
rehabilitation and improvement of the commercial performance of FEPASA, and (b)
greater transport efficiency in the mail rail corridors serving Sao Paulo and the port
of Santos.  Upon achievement of these objectives, rail transport would be
performing its function more efficiently by reducing transport costs for producers
through better participation in model distribution. As a result, it would both induce
and facilitate agricultural development and foreign trade.
Among the key factors that made it possible to achieve the project's
objectives, special mention must be made of the vital part played by the S3o Paulo



- 31 -
State Government in making the counterpart funds available, especially after the
BNDES dropped out of the project.
The PRMF's performance can be evaluated as being fundamental for
FEPASA. The permanent way infra and superstructure was rehabilitated in line
sections commercially essential for the railway; practically 50% of the fleet of
most heavily used locomotives have undergone general rehabilitation and the fleet
of hopper and bulk cars has been modernized and its capacity increased, and the
yards with heaviest traffic have been expanded and the institutional programs
have proven beneficial, particularly the market/tariff and cost-control programs.
EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
The project was designed and carried out within the context of state
management, i.e. without any study of policies aimed at privatization of FEPASA.
In this context, the institutional development action programs would be the
bases for enabling and sustaining accomplishment of the objectives and goals set
in the project.
Basically, these programs were carried out toward the end of the project
and, combined with external factors that will be discussed further on, they did not
make it possible to fully achieve the goals set, especially the "commercial" and
operating targets.  However, with the execution of the various component
programs of the project and the present government's firm resolve to press ahead
with privatization, the financial goals should be not only achieved but also
sustained, in addition to preparing the way for better results in the future.
Implementation of the project, scheduled for 1987/93, was started in May
1987 with closing initially scheduled for December 31, 1993; this latter date was
subsequently twice extended, to 1994 and 1995 respectively, the first time due to
delay in execution of the project and the second time in order to include the study
of privatization of FEPASA in the institutional programs.
The following external factors complicated execution of the project:
(a)  the withdrawal of the BNDES from the project in 1 988 when it had only put
in 25% of the financing to which it was committed, so that current
contracts and also the counterpart funding had to be renegotiated;
(b)  implementation in Brazil of anti-inflation policies at the end of the Cruzado
Plan (1986/88) and in the Verao Plan (1989), the Collor Plan (1990) and the
Real Plan (1994), which caused revision and even complete halting of
contracts because the contract amounts had to be renegotiated;



- 32 -
(c)  in order to cope with the problem referred to in (a), the Sao Paulo State
Government needed to review the flow of counterpart disbursements
scheduled at the start of the project, which entailed extending the periods
set for programs already underway or deferring the signing of new
contracts;
(d)  the elimination of the project telecommunications masterplan, as a result of
(a) and (c) above, which brought the PRMF down from the US$285 million
set at appraisal to US$237.4 million;
(e)  successive administrative and organizational changes in FEPASA, for
governmental (policy) reasons.
Regarding achievement of the "operational performance targets" it is also
important to note that problems external to the project arose which prevented full
accomplishment of those targets:
(a)  the stoppage of the electrification contract in 1990, which beside affecting
operations in that the planned additional eighty 2,500-hp locomotives did
not become available also prevented the decommissioning of some 46
electric locomotives that had been in use for over half a century and had
therefore reached a stage of very low reliability and productivity;
(b)  successive strikes in the port of Santos connected with operating difficulties
in RFFSA (SR4) and CODESP, chiefly on account of the bad condition of the
RFFSA infrastructure on the lowlying land on the way into Santos
(permanent way and signalling).
As regards the "commercial targets", in addition to the operational
difficulties it must also be borne in mind that the lack of a transport policy in
Brazil, and especially in the State of Sao Paulo (where competition from trucking is
fiercer because of the excellent quality of the roads), puts the railway at a total
disadvantage vis-a-vis road transport, thus making achievement of the project
objectives all the harder.
BANK PERFORMANCE
The World Bank's partnership with FEPASA goes back many years and has
produced good results in the development of rail transport policy. As far as the
loan agreement under-review is concerned the outcome has been highly positive
since as a result of this agreement FEPASA has been able to handle freight traffic
on its export corridors better and, notwithstanding its financial problems, has also
been able to maintain its source of resources.



- 33 -
In general, our assessment of the World Bank's performance over the
duration of the project is that is has been highly satisfactory. On the majority of
occasions the Bank responded favorably to FEPASA's requests, which related
mainly to modifications or adjustments to the scale of the project necessary for
meeting the goals set at appraisal, while also promoting whenever needful
approaches to the governmental authorities with a view to ensuring the continuity
of the project.
BORROWER PERFORMANCE
The main problem that occurred with the PRMF was the BNDES' withdrawal
from the project. Thanks to the effective support provided by the Sao Paulo State
Government the counterpart commitments were covered, though admittedly within
the context of a disbursement schedule feasible for the Finance Secretariat, which
entailed a two-year delay and also deletion from the project of the
telecommunications masterplan.
Also with respect to the Sao Paulo State Government it is important to note
that throughout the entire project the payments specified in the appraisal for
accounting normalization for the long-distance passenger and metropolitan
services were effected as required.
Finally, regarding the telecommunications plan, FEPASA sought an
alternative  and  signed   a  contract  with  EMBRATEL,  the  Brazilian
telecommunications corporation, during the project period for a transmission
system using optical cables. In addition, to take care of the tractive power needs
FEPASA procured seven 3,000-hp locomotives from the Quintella company for use
in its commercial service.
We accordingly consider the performance of FEPASA and of the Sao Paulo
State Government in the execution of the project to have been satisfactory.
EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT OUTCOME
The project for the rehabilitation and modernization of FEPASA was of vital
importance for the following reasons:
(a)  it improved the railway's operating performance, concerning which we
would emphasize the increased locomotive utilization efficiency, the marked
reduction in the number of traffic accidents, and the prospect of higher
operating productivity through movement centralization;



- 34 -
(b)  it enabled development of a tariff policy based on market and costs, thus
making it possible to maintain a reasonable level of economic and financial
results at a time when the prevailing economic conditions were extremely
adverse for rail transport;
(c)  it made it possible to computerize FEPASA, which besides enabling faster
decisionmaking, also made it possible to reduce the number of personnel
required, thereby lowering the cost of FEPASA's main expenditure center
and improving productivity;
(d)  it enabled FEPASA to prepare for privatization;
(e)  by means of the remodeling of the permanent way superstructure it made it
possible for train speed to be increased;
(f)  it made it possible to maintain the traction equipment level necessary for
meeting the revised operational targets, which without the projects would
have resulted in significant reductions in volumes hauled, which could also
have brought FEPASA's continued existence as an economically viable
enterprise into question.
In general, we can state that the PRMF project was of vital importance for
FEPASA not only because of the results achieved but chiefly because of the
difficulties FEPASA and the Sao Paulo State Government would have encountered
if the project had not been implemented.
Although the transfer of the metropolitan passenger services to CPTM
(Companhia Paulista de Transportes Metropolitanos, a company controlled by the
SAo Paulo State Government) was effected in February 1996, i.e. after completion
of the project, we should nevertheless note that the planning and the actions for
separation of this activity from FEPASA were done within the scope of the project.
SUMMARY OF BENEFITS, FUTURE OPERATIONS AND MAIN LESSONS LEARNED
WITH THE PROJECT
1.   We understand that the main difficulty with a project of this scale, which
can generally be expected to extend over eight years, is the unpredictability
of government policy actions. This renders the feasibility studies uncertain,
to the extent that the various programs making up the project are affected
by those actions. However, the skill and motivation of the technical staff of
both the enterprises concerned and the government departments involved
are such that the projects are usually satisfactorily completed.



- 35 -
2.   The continuing economic instability of the country throughout the execution
of the project was also a major factor in the failure to fully meet the targets
set at appraisal.
3.   The interface with the Bank technical staff was very important, due to the
project supervisors' wide-ranging knowledge of developments throughout
the world, and this interaction contributed greatly not only to the execution
of the project but also to the management, i.e. nonpolitico-administrative,
actions taken. We would rate these contributions as having been of great
value for the case of the PRMF.
For future projects we would point to the following lessons learned:
1.   From  the technical standpoint, the various subprojects making up the
project should be presented with minimum basic project details and clearly
defined physical and economic quantities.
2.   Each program forming the project should have no more than one source of
counterpart funding, besides the IBRD resources.
3.   The participants in projects should be jointly committed. We would suggest
to the Bank that it set up an "insurance" designed to cover the counterpart
funds due from sources-that withdraw from the project before it is
completed.
4.   At the organizational level, for projects of this size the borrower should have
a unit that is independent of its formal structure with a view to ensuring a
swifter response on actions to be carried out, so as to keep within the time
and cost limits set in the appraisal.
5.   There should be a centralizing agency in the government for the various
IBRD-funded projects, so that these projects can be kept unaffected, to the
extent possible, by the administrative changes that occur with such
frequency in the state enterprises.
6.   Finally, in the post-privatization phase lending should be continued to the
private concession-holder, in order to meet new investments needs.

FINAL ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE SAO PAULO
RAILWAY REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PLAN (PRMF)
Introduction
For the purposes-of the PRMF project completion report an economic
evaluation has to be made of the project based on the results obtained during its
implementation.
The criterion for determining the benefit was the transport cost saving on
the traffic volume in the situation with and without the project taking into account
a loss of traffic to road transport, as described in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
of 1987.
Points concerning the context in which the project was carried out
1.   As already noted in the Reappraisal of the project prepared by Robin
Carruthers for the World Bank in 1990, a number of adverse factors
impacted the project in its initial phase, including:
(a)  pronounced economic instability during the period 1986-90, which
greatly increased project costs (point 2 of report);
(b)  rapid deterioration of the permanent way, owing to the time which
elapsed between the determining of the emergency needs and action
to take care of them (point 3 of report);
(c)  the need to change the scope of the project as a result of the
resource constraints imposed by the higher costs and action in critical
situations which could not wait for the scheduled measures in the
project (points 2, 3 and 5);
(d)  the appreciable reduction in traffic demand due to the prevailing
economic situation in the country (point 5).
2.   Of the factors listed above, those referred to in (a), (b) and (d) persisted up
to 1995, while in addition the BNDES (National Bank for Economic and
Social Development) only actually provided US$31.2 million of the
US$107.8 million it was originally committed to contribute, which meant
that the Sao Paulo State Government had to make up the difference to
complete the project after its reappraisal in 1 991.



- 39 -
These circumstances, together with the reduction in scope already referred
to, had the effect of extending the time needed for implementation of the project.
3.   The funding allocated for permanent way and rolling stock maintenance was
not sufficient to keep up the maintenance of the other premises and
equipment not covered by project funds, as of 1 987.
Given these circumstances the economic evaluation of the project becomes
a rather complex undertaking owing to the significant changes in the assumptions
underlying its implementation; as a result, the direct evaluation, i.e. comparison of
the actual transport cost data with those estimated with or without the project in
order to determine the benefit from it, produces an inconclusive rate of return with
a net present value 6.5% above the investment made.
Alternative evaluation approach
An alternative for obtaining a conclusive evaluation of the project using the
appraisal parameters is to adopt the approach that the evaluation of the conditions
without the project can be revised, bearing in mind that:
*    FEPASA would not maintain the production levels without the project
described in the SAR, but would post an appreciable drop to a level about
23% lower than that achieved in 1995;
*    the transport volumes without the project would be similar to those of the
first four years, as would the transport costs;
*    as of the fourth year without the project, there would be a drop in the next
two years equivalent to that which actually occurred in 1 989 and 1990,
followed by a rise in transport costs on the same scale as the actual
increase, given the economic conditions prevailing in 1990, the impact of
which was felt as of 1991;
*    the costs of transfer to road transport would remain the same in relation to
the transport costs identified in the SAR for the alternative without the
project.
For the situation with the project, the transfer cost was considered to be
identical with that without the project up to 1990, then as of 1991 the road
freight rate is applied to the transport estimated and not effected by rail.
These criteria provide reasonable basis for comparing the effects of the
project in relation to what could be expected without it, as in the annexed table,
which indicated an IRR of 19.78% and a NPV of US$58.28 million.



- 40 -
Other exercises to provide a numerical demonstration of the positive
impacts of the project in terms of rate of return are inconclusive.
