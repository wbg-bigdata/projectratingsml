         SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORTCREDIT AND GRANT

                     CREDIT AND GRANT PROGRAM SUMMARY

Recipient:                Burkina Faso

ImplementingAgencies:     The Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB) will be responsible for overall
                          implementationof the proposed PRSC 7, in close association with several line
                          Ministries.

Amount:                   SDR59.1million (US$90million equivalent).

Terms:                    SDR 44.35 million on mant terms and SDR 14.75million on IDA terms with
                          a fortv year maturitv including a graceperiod of ten years.

Schedule of disbursement: Single tranche of SDR59.1million (US$90 million equivalent) to be available
                          upon effectiveness.

Description:              The proposed PRSC-7 is the first of a third series of PRSCs in support of
                          Burkina Faso's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), adopted in 2000 and
                          updated in 2004. The PRS and its latest Annual Progress Report cover the
                          period 2006 to 2008. This new series of PRSCs (7, 8 and 9) will support the
                          acceleration of real growth and the reduction of poverty incidence in Burkina
                          Faso by: (i) improving the investment climate and promoting exports; (ii)
                          improving access to basic social services through deepened decentralization
                          and strengthened institutional capacity; and (iii) promoting efficiency,
                          transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through
                          enhancedpublic financialmanagement.

Benefits:                 The measures supported by the proposed PRSC-7 are expected to have a
                          significant positive impact on poverty reduction.           Specifically, the
                          improvement in the investment climate and the promotion of exports
                          supportedby the proposed operation would accelerate economic growth. The
                          reforms in public service provision through decentralization and institutional
                          strengthening would improve access of the poor to health, education, water
                          and sanitation services, support their greater participation in the growth
                          process and sustain progress towards the MDGs. The strengthening of public
                          financial management would enhance efficiency, transparency and
                          accountability in public resource use. Such measures would also increase the
                          country's absorption capacity for externalresources.

Risks:                    Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this
                          operation, but the authorities are implementing reforms to mitigate them.
                          First, Burluna Faso is vulnerable to commodityprice (cotton and oil) and real
                          exchange rate fluctuations. High oil prices drain international reserves and
                          increase petrochemical, electricity and transportation costs with adverse
                          impact on the overall economy. Lower cotton prices on international markets
                          hurt the country's economic and fiscal performance, and negatively affect
                          about two and a half million persons in rural areas, where most of the poor

                        CREDIT AND PROGRAMSUMMARY

Recipient:               Burluna Faso

ImplementingAgencies:    The Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB) will be responsible for overall
                         implementationo fthe proposed PRSC 7, inclose association with several line
                         Ministries.

Amount:                  SDR59.1 million (US$90 million equivalent).

Terms:                   IDA terms with a forty-year maturity, including a grace periodo ften years.

Scheduleof disbursement: Single tranche o f SDR59.1 million (US$90 million equivalent) to be available
                         upon effectiveness.

Description:             The proposed PRSC-7 i s the first o f a third series o f PRSCs in support o f
                         Burkina Faso's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), adopted in 2000 and
                         updated in 2004. The PRS and its latest Annual Progress Report cover the
                         period 2006 to 2008. This new series o f PRSCs (7, 8 and 9) will support the
                         acceleration o f real growth and the reduction o f poverty incidence in Burkina
                         Faso by: (i)  improving the investment climate and promoting exports; (ii)
                         improving access to basic social services through deepened decentralization
                         and strengthened institutional capacity; and (iii)promoting efficiency,
                         transparency and accountability in the use o f public resources through
                         enhanced public financial management.

Benefits:                The measures supported by the proposed PRSC-7 are expected to have a
                         significant positive impact on poverty reduction.              Specifically, the
                         improvement in the investment climate and the promotion o f exports
                         supported by the proposed operation would accelerate economic growth. The
                         reforms in public service provision through decentralization and institutional
                         strengthening would improve access o f the poor to health, education, water
                         and sanitation services, support their greater participation in the growth
                         process and sustainprogress towards the MDGs. The strengthening o f public
                         financial  management would         enhance   efficiency,    transparency   and
                         accountability inpublic resource use. Such measures would also increase the
                         country's absorption capacity for external resources.

Risks:                   Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits o f this
                         operation, but the authorities are implementing reforms to mitigate them.
                         First,Burluna Faso is vulnerable to commodity price (cotton and oil) and real
                         exchange rate fluctuations. High oil prices drain international reserves and
                         increase petrochemical, electricity and transportation costs with adverse
                         impact on the overall economy. Lower cotton prices on international markets
                         hurt the country's economic and fiscal performance, and negatively affect
                         about two and a half million persons in rural areas, where most o f the poor
                         live. The Government i s implementing a three-pronged approach to address
                         its vulnerability to external shocks, including: (i) lowering energy costs by



                                              vi

                     connecting with lower-cost regionalproducers and opening the electricity and
                    petroleum sectors to private management and investment; (ii)revising the
                     cotton producer price-setting mechanism to ensure adequate pass-through o f
                     world prices and better risk sharing between producers and ginning
                     companies, as well as enhancing productivity and competitiveness o f the
                     cotton sector; and (iii)supporting economic diversification through reform of
                     the investment climate and promotion o f mining and irrigated agriculture.
                     The Government is accompanied in these reform efforts by the series o f
                     PRSCs, other IDA operations, the recently approved IMF PRGF and support
                     from a range o f other development partners.

                     Second, lack o f private sector interest could undermine ongoing reforms to
                     restore the financial viability and improve the competitiveness o f the cotton
                     sector. The Government considers its current increased involvement in the
                     sector as transitory and necessary in the face o f the current crisis, and is
                     committed to maintain a majority private participation in the sector to
                     enhance its growth potential and competitiveness. The measures currently
                     under implementation (the recapitalization o f the cotton companies and the
                     revision o f the cotton price mechanism) as well as the planned independent
                     financial and operational audit o f SOFITEX for 2004-07, the reduction in
                     SOFITEX's operating costs and other ongoing and planned measures to
                     enhance the productivity and competitiveness o f cotton producers and
                     companies (see Annex 5), would improve the sector's growth potential and its
                     attractiveness for private investment.

                     Third, the implementation o f the decentralization strategy poses significant
                     challenges. Officials working at the center may resist the transfer o f
                    responsibilities to local Governments, while local Governments may not have
                     sufficient resources and capacity to carry out their new responsibilities. To
                     address these challenges, the Government has adopted a participatory and
                     gradual decentralization approach that should ensure stakeholder consensus
                     on major issues and fiscal sustainability over time. Several donors support
                     decentralization in Burkina, including IDA through several operations, most
                    notably the Public Administration Capacity BuildingProject, the Community-
                    based Rural Development Project, and the planned Decentralized Urban
                     Capacity BuildingProject.

                    Fourth, risks stemming fiom regional political instabilityremain. Since 1999,
                    the political and security context inneighboring C8te d'Ivoire has negatively
                    affected trade and transport routes, worker remittances, and Government
                    revenues in Burkina Faso. However, the economy has adjusted to this shock
                    by opening new trade routes to Benin, Togo and Ghana. Also, Burkma
                    Faso's mediating role in the conflict contributed to the recent peace
                    agreement among opposing parties inC8te d'Ivoire.

                                       I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes a new series o f three Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs 7, 8 and 9) in support o f policy reforms aimed at accelerating real growth and
reducing the incidence o f poverty in Burkina Faso. The first series o f PRSCs for Burkina Faso
focused on improving public financial management (notably fiduciary aspects) and access to
social services (health and basic education). The second series focused on reforms to further
liberalize the economy (cotton sector) and privatize the management o f key utilities
(telecommunication, electricity and petroleum) to increase growth. The proposed third series
will continue focusing on reducing factor costs (electricity and transport), help improve the
competitiveness o fthe cotton sector, and support the Government's efforts to enhance the overall
business climate and diversify exports. This series will also continue to support Government's
measures to further improve access to social services through greater decentralization and
institutional strengthening and enhance the efficiency and accountability o f public financial
management (PFM).

2.      The reform policies supported by this new series are embedded in and aligned with
Burkina's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The underlying PRSP covering the period 2004-
2006 and the accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) were considered by the Executive
Board on M a y 3, 2005. The most recent (sixth) Annual Progress Report (APR) and related
JSAN, which was circulated to the Board for information on May 24, 2007, reconfirms the
Government's successful implementationof the PRS and, incombination with the Government's
new medium term economic framework (MTEF), extends the Government's strategy from 2006
to 2008.    An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the PRSC 4-6 series will be
completed during the second half o f 2007, but preliminary lessons learned from PRSCs 4-6 are
taken into account inthe design o fthe PRSCs 7-9 series, andmore particularly o f PRSC-7.

3.      The design o f the series and especially the design o f PRSC-7 benefited from extensive
consultations with various stakeholders under the Government's leadership, and included close
coordination with a group o f donors which provides budget support to Burkina inthe context o f
PRSP implementation.         This consultative and harmonized approach minimizes the burden on
scarce Government capacity and ensures Government ownership o fthe supported reforms.

4.      The proposed size o f PRSC-7 - US$90 million equivalent - is larger than initially
envisaged for this operation in the CAS (US$70 million). This increase responds to Burkina's
exceptional budgetary financing needs in 2007 resulting from the cotton sector crisis. The 2005
CAS identifies the need for a permanent adjustment to lower cotton prices (due to the evolution
o f world market prices for cotton and o f the dollar exchange rate) as the single most intractable
risk to future growth prospects. It explicitly foresees that PRSCs be used to provide predictable
but flexible support to Burkina's cotton sector, when faster and deeper reform than foreseen
under Burkina's cotton strategy prove necessary'. The size of the proposed PRSC-7 is justified
by the Government's excellent policy track record and ambitious reform program to restore the
medium-term financial viability o f the cotton sector as well as other reforms, including a far
reachingdecentralization program andreforms to improve the investment climate.

                               11.    COUNTRYCONTEXT

5.      Burkina Faso i s a small, landlocked Sahelian country o f about 13.4 million inhabitants.
President Blaise CompaorC won a third term o f five years on November 13, 2005 with over 80
percent o f the vote. The elections were deemed fair and transparent by international observers.
For the first time, municipal elections took place on April 23, 2006, in 302 newly established
rural municipalities. While the political situation in neighboring CGte d'Ivoire has negatively
impacted Burkina's economic environment, in terms o f security and transport costs for imports
and exports, the country has adjusted to this shock and the President's mediating role in the
conflict contributed to the recent peace agreement among the opposingparties inCGte d'Ivoire.

6.      Roughly 80 percent of the population lives from agriculture which contributes around 22
percent to GDP. Cotton exports provide about 60 percent o f export revenues. Dependence on
cotton exports and widely varying rainfalls from the south to the north leave the country's
economy vulnerable to external shocks such as commodity price fluctuations and rainfall
deficits. Burkinai s knownto have gold resources, but no other mineralor natural resources.

7.      BurkinaFaso was among the first inSub Saharan Africa to present a full PRSPin2000,
and one o fthe few to have submitteda filly revised second generation PRSP in2004. Progress
inPRSP implementation has been steady as laid out inthe six APRs to date. Indeed, against a
background o f unfavorable natural conditions, Burkina Faso has demonstrated great resilience
through sound policy implementation. The country has achieved macroeconomic stability, aided
by fiscal discipline and significant inflows o f external support (about 8 to 9 percent o f GDP for
the last 10 years). Four successive programs under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) were implemented, with the last one completed in September 2006. A fifth

8.      Burkina has also been able to achieve relatively robust growth andpoverty reductionover
the last decade. Real GDP growth rates have averaged 6.0 percent annually since 1995, among
the highest growth rates in sub-Saharan Afiica. Real per capita income has increased by 20
percent since 1994 and stood at US$430 in 2005. Poverty has been substantially reduced, from
an estimated 54 percent in 1998 to 46 percent in 2003 and an expected 41 percent in 2006.
Growth was mainly driven by the agricultural sector, which explains its impact on poverty
reduction given that most o fthe population depends on agriculture.

9.      Despite its good macroeconomic track record, Burkina Faso remains one o f the poorest
countries inthe world. At US$430, per capita income remains significantly lower than the low
income countries average o f US$590. The country's social indicators also rank below Sub-
Saharan averages: in 2005, literacy rates were 30 percent and life expectancy at birth was 43
years, compared to 35 percent and 46 years for Sub-Saharan Africa. Burkina Faso ranked 174th
out of 177 countries in the 2006 Human Development Index (HDI), published by the United
Nations DevelopmentProgram (UNDP).

10.     The country faces important challenges. Future growth in agriculture will need to rely
more on productivity gains than on the extension o f cultivated areas, as was the case inthe past.
Also, after high levels o f public investment, sustaining growth will require increased private
investment. For this to happen, the investment climate would need to improve. Enhanced factor

productivity will also require a broadening and acceleration o f human development and
improvement in public service delivery through enhanced governance.              If current trends
continue, Burkina is positioned to reach the overall povertyheadcount MDGby 2015, with good
chances of also meetingthe water and sanitation target.


                    111. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

11.      Burkina Faso has had a good macroeconomic track record over the recent years.
However, it remains vulnerable to commodity prices (cotton and oil) and real exchange rate
fluctuations. Burkina's weak fiscal revenue performance also poses a potential risk to
macroeconomic stability.

GROWTH PRICES
            AND

12.      Economic growth continues to be robust. Real GDP is estimated to have grown in 2006
by 6.4 percent (see Table l), lower than in2005 (7.1 percent). Lower growth rates in
                                   somewhat
2006 are mainly due to slowed agricultural production following a significant expansion in2005.
Incontrast, the industry and transport sectors benefited from continuous robust demand spurred
by record income received by food and cotton producers. Average inflation slowed to 2.4
percent in2006 (down fiom 6.4 percent in2005), mainly because o f the decline infood and, to a
lesser extend, petroleum prices. Cumulative appreciation o f the real effective exchange rate o f
about 15 percent since 2001 undermined the competitiveness o f Burkina's exports. The terms o f
trade, guided by cotton and oil prices, have improved in2006 by about 3 percent, following a 22
percent deterioration in2005.

FISCALDEVELOPMENTS

13.     In2006, Burkina Faso continued its prudent fiscal policypath, consistent with fiscal and
debt sustainability and low inflation. Despite sound execution o f the 2006 budget, expenditure
pressures emergeddue to: (i)    highenergyprices, whichraisedfuel subsidies for SONABEL, the
electricity utility, by 0.07 percent o f GDP; (ii) salary raise for the civil service, a widening o f
                                                   a
the public sector work force inhealth and education, and the regularization o f past promotions
increased expenditures by 0.3 percent o f GDP; and (iii)      increases in other expenditure items,
such as the Government's utility bill and the reimbursement o f VAT arrears, claiming another
0.5 percent o f GDP. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants and MDRI debt
forgiveness, widened by 0.9 percent of GDP, to reach nearly 10.1 percent in 2006 (Table 2).
This deficit was more than fully fundedby external assistanceand byresources freed-up through
MDRI.

14.     Burkina remains at the lower end o f the WAEMU countries in terms of tax revenue
mobilization. Revenues in 2006 have reached 12.4 percent o f GDP, a gain o f 0.1 percentage
point from 2005, but a disappointment when compared to the Government's initial objectives.
Lukewarmperformance in resource mobilization came in part from lower than expected VAT
revenues, a direct result o f the financial crisis in the cotton companies (see Box l), also o f
                                                                                         but
continued inefficiencies in the tax administration. Domestic revenue would have to increase to
ensure medium and long-term fiscal and debt sustainability and create the fiscal space required
for poverty reduction. Domestic revenue mobilization is also a structural challenge in a country
like Burkina Faso where growth i s driven first by the agricultural sector, traditionally less easily
taxable. In the medium term, part o f the solution to this problem would come from efficient
taxation o f mining exports (particularly from gold), expected to become a significant source o f
external revenuefor the country as o f 2009-2010.

15.     Poverty reducing expenditures have increased by 21 percent, from CFAF 162 billion in
2005 to about CFAF 173 billion in2006, o f which education represented roughly 42 percent. In
some sectors, a slow pace o f project execution and weak absorption o f external aid more than
offset the increase in spending. The rising subsidy to SONABEL continued to undermine the
equity o f public spending. However, in September 2006, the Government increased electricity
tariffs by 12.5 percent, following an increase o f 10 percent in November 2004. Beginning in
2009, electricity costs will be cut in Ouagadougou as the power transmission line from Bobo-
Dioulasso i s completed, bringing to the capital city electricity imported from C8te d'Ivoire at a
lower cost. This will establish the conditions for a progressive elimination o f the subsidies to
SONABEL and enable subsidies to be more targeted at the poor and isolated regions o f the
country.

      EXTERNAL       DEVELOPMENTS

      16.      Cotton represents about 60 percent o f total exports, exposing the country to cotton price
     volatility risk. Important cotton sector reforms implemented during 1999-2005 contributed to a
      significant increase in cotton production and exports in the last decade (see Box 1 and Annex 5
      for a detailed discussion).             However, these reforms took place against increasingly difficult
     international market conditions for cotton from Burkina, triggered by a sharp decline o f
     international cotton prices in 2002 and a cumulative appreciation o f the Franc CFA vis          vis the
     US dollar of about 15 percent since 2001. This resulted in a decline of the export price for 1

kilogram o f ginned cotton from Franc CFA 847 in 2001 to Franc CFA 637 in 2006 (see Table 1
and Figure 1). At the same time, the price setting mechanism was not flexible enough to more
closely align the producer price with the international cotton price. All these factors together
caused substantial financial difficulties for the cotton companies in Burkina and put the sector
under financial stress. As a result, Burkina's three cotton companies assumed most o f the
adjustment costs and accumulated deficits over the years 2004 to 2006 amounting to about
U S 9 3 million.

17.       Inlate 2006, the bankingsector, which typically pre-finances the cotton season, refused
to finance the 2006-2007 campaign unless the sector was put back on a better financial footing.
Three sets o f actions are currently beingimplementedby sector operators to restore the financial
viability o f the sector and improve its competitiveness: (1) all three cotton companies have
announced their recapitalization plans; (2) the domestic producer price setting mechanism i s
being reformed to more closely align the producer price with the international cotton price, and
to broker a better commercial risk sharing between producers and cotton companies; and (3)
efforts continue to improve the productivity o f cotton production. The Government currently
maintains a 35 percent stake in SOFITEX's equity, but the company's foreseen recapitalization
(required to cover losses accumulated in 2004-06) would result in a carrying over by the
Government o f a majority stake (58 percent), until private investors are identified.                               The
Government considers this increased involvement in the sector as transitory and necessary to
stabilize it in the face o f the current crisis. Government is committed to maintain a minority
involvement in the sector and to transfer shares back to the private sector as soon as private
investors can be found. The revision of the producer price setting mechanism is particularly
critical to ensure better risk sharingbetween producers and ginning companies in the future and
minimize the financial liabilities on the Government budget o f further international cotton price
changes. Over the medium-term,ongoing and plannedmeasures to enhance the productivity and
competitiveness o f cotton producers and cotton companies are critical to improve the sector's
sustainability and its attractiveness for private investment.                    A detailed discussion o f these
measures i s contained inBox 1andh e x 5.

                        Box 1: Cotton Sector - Current Situation andProspects

Over the past decade, cotton production has increased by an average o f 17 percent p.a. making Burluna the largest
producer o f cotton insub-SaharanAfrica with a total production o f 730,000 tons o f seed cotton in2005l2006. There
are about 250,000 households and 2.5 millionpeople who depend, either directly or indirectly, on cotton production
for their livelihood. This performance was the result o f important sector reforms aimed at improving
competitiveness, notably: (i)  the privatization in 1999 o f the state owned cotton monopoly SOFITEX which reduced
the state holding in the company to 35 percent; (ii) abolition in 2004 o f the exclusive rights (monopoly) for
                                                        the
SOFITEX to service the sector, thus allowing the entry o f 2 new cotton companies (SOCOMA and FASO COTON
hold 15 percent o f the market); and (iii) creation in2005 o f an institutional set-up for self-governance o f the sector
by its stakeholders (producers andginning companies) without participationofthe state.

At the end o fthis reformprocess, the role ofthe state inthe cotton sector was reduced to a minority shareholding in
SOFITEX, compared to the period prior to 1999 when SOFITEX was a state owned monopoly. However, these
reforms took place against increasingly difficult international market conditions for cotton, triggered by a sharp
decline o f international cotton prices in2002 and compounded by a cumulative appreciation o f the Franc CFA vis-a-
vis the U S dollar of about 15 percent since 2001. This resultedina decline of the export price for 1 k g of ginned
cotton from Franc FCFA847 in 2001 to Franc FCFA637 in 2006. These factors together with the absence o f an
adequate price setting mechanism to more closely align the producer price with the international cotton price caused


                                                          - 6 -

substantial financial difficulties for the cotton companies and put the sector under financial stress. As a result, the
three ginning companies assumed most o f the adjustment costs and accumulated deficits over 2004 to 2006,
amounting to about US$93 million. In a privatized and liberalized sector, the state took a principled stance against
Government price supports, expecting private stakeholders to make necessary adjustments in the sector. The
Government's stance on k s question underscores its commitment to the sector's privatization strategy and its
overall objective to minimize state intervention inthe sector.

Inlate 2006, the banlung sector, which typically pre-fmances the cotton season, refused to finance the 2007-2008
campaign unless the sector was put back on a better financial footing. Three sets o f actions are currently being
implementedby sector operators to restore the financial viability o f the sector: (1) all three cotton companies have
announced their recapitalizationplans; (2) the domestic producer price setting mechanism is being reformed to more
closely align the producer price with the international cotton price, and to broker a better commercial risk sharing
between producers and cotton companies; and (3) efforts continue to improve the productivity o f cottonproduction.

To avoid a collapse o f the sector over the short-term, the Government decided to provide a guarantee o f US$lOO
million to the commercial banks to facilitate adequate financing o f the 2007 season and allow for time to settle the
recapitalization negotiations. Moral hazard from the contingent liability thus incurred by the state is limited since
SOFITEX's production stocks and sales contracts are collaterized at the request o f the banking pool and hlly
dedicated to reimburse the campaign's credit within a year o f its disbursement. Moreover, the banlung pool i s
granted preferential creditor status, with SOFITEX's legal obligation to repay its loan before any other financial
obligation; and by contractual obligation, SOFITEX's budget is provisioned each year for the principal and interests
due to the bankingpool.

Also, the largest cotton company, the ex-parastatal SOFITEX, launched its recapitalization effort in late 2006. In
early 2007, its largest private investor DAGRIS decided not to participate in the recapitalization, the main reason
being that DAGRIS, a company held by the French State, inthe process o f being privatized and could therefore not
commit at this stage to avoid prejudicing its potential buyer. The Government agreed to refinance SOFITEX by
covering its shares (35 percent) and an additional 26 percent to make up for the non-subscription o f DAGRIS, in
order to meet the 75 percent o f minimumcapital subscription mandatedby the OHADA law.' The direct costs to the
Government amount to a maximum o f US$46 million (or 0.7 percent o f GDP), o f which US$ 24 million have
already been advanced by the Government in early 2007. After the recapitalization, the Government share in
SOFITEX would amount to 58 percent.

The evolving status o f DAGRIS, has not allowed for an adequate entrepreneurial response to the sector's fmancial
problems, forcing the Government to step in on a transitory basis. Increased Government ownership o f SOFITEX,
following its recapitalization, does not affect the vision the Government has for the sector, nor does it imply a
reversal o f the sectoral reforms implemented since 1999. The take-over became necessary to stabilize the sector in
the face o f the current financial crisis, while the sector's long term financial viability i s restored through a revision
o f the cotton price setting mechanism to align the producer price more closely with the international cottonprice and
productivity gains incotton companies. Such a mechanism should allow better risk sharing between producers and
ginning companies and reduce the fmancial liabilities on the Government budget o f further international cotton price
changes. The Government o f Burkina Faso continues to be convinced that private sector participation inthe sector i s
best to enhance the sector's growth potential and competitiveness. Thus, the Government has confirmed his
commitment to maintain a minority involvement in the sector and to transfer shares back to the private sector as
soon as private investors can be found.

The price mechanism is envisaged to be complemented by a stabilization fund, whose prime objective is to balance
out volatility ininternational cotton prices for the benefit o f cotton growing farmers. The Government expects the
national stabilization fimd will be a farmer-ginner operated instrument without recourse to Government finance
(including through concessional borrowing), so as not to increase Government's contingent liabilities.




  Onepercent ofthe shares is owned by aprivate domestic investor and will be maintained.

18.    Burkina Faso i s boundto remain dependent on raw cotton exports for years to come, even
though the Government strives to promote export diversification through reforms in the
investment climate and the startup o f production for several important gold mines. Burkina
Faso's balance o f payments deficit i s financed by external financial assistance and, for a growing
part, by private flows and transfers. Gross international reserves have stabilized at roughly 4
months of imports, after a decline in2005.

19.    Prudent monetary policy from the regional Central Bank (BCEAO), consistent with a
fixed exchange rate to the Euro, has resulted in low inflation. Money supply increased by 7
percent in 2006. The expansion o f credit to the private sector, whose rise caused inflationary
pressures in2005, was contained in 2006. Credit to the Government has been sharplyreduced in
2007 due to the successful privatization o f ONATEL, the telecom company.

   IV. MACROECONOMICOUTLOOKAND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

GROWTH FISCALAND          STRATEGY FOR2007-2009

20.       The Government's macroeconomic framework for FY2007-09 seeks to keep medium-
term GDP growth at 6 percent, maintain inflation at around 2 percent and stabilize the external
current account deficit (excluding grants) at close to 13 percent o f GDP (see Table 1). Monetary
policies will support credit to the economy at around 9 to 10 percent annually. The authorities'
macroeconomic program has been defined in the context o f a three-year IMF supported low
access PRGF arrangement for SDR 6 million, approved by the IMF Board on April 23, 2007.
The agreed uponmacroeconomic framework supports the keyPRSP objectives.

21.       The projected 6 percent growth rate is deemed sufficient to reach the medium (PRSP) and
long-term (MDG) poverty reduction objectives (down to 30 percent by 2015). Achieving this
growth will require an improvement in total factor productivity, including through structural
measuresto improve the operating conditions and competitiveness o fthe private sector.

22.       At the sectoral level, growth is projectedto come from a moderate expansion (4-6 percent
p.a.) of cotton and agriculture and through an above average growth o f the industry and service
sectors (above 8 percent p.a.).          Such a performance is predicated on improvements in the
financial viability o f Burkina's three cotton marketing companies (see Box 1) and normal
rainfall. Growth will be further driven by a significant expansion o f extractive industries (with
new mines in Youga, Taparka and Kalsaka expected to reach exploitation phase by 2009-lo),
construction for transport infrastructure and energy (with the new Samandeni Dam and the
expected link to the C8te d'Ivoire grid). Growth inthe service sector i s expected to come from
telecommunications, trade and transport.

23.       The authorities target a gradual reduction inthe deficit including grants over the medium-
term and compatible with a low inflation policy3. Revenues are expected to increase by 2.1
percentage points by 2009 as a result o f reforms to improve revenue administration and tax
policies, including through a revision of tax exemptions and a wider application o f the VAT.
Expenditures will be allowed to increase in2007 to an overall 24.4 percent o f GDP (a scaling-up
by 1.2 percentage point o f GDP) and will be equally divided between current expenditure and
investmentspending. This split hasbeenroughly constant since 2000.

24.       The expenditure program covers the costs o f SOFITEX recapitalization (US$46 million
in 2007, or 0.7 percent of GDP), US$24 million of which was incurred in early 2007 and the
remainder expected to be incurred in June 2007. The recapitalization would be partly financed
from the proceeds o f the successful sale o f 51 percent o f ONATEL, the telecommunication
company. The remainderwill be covered by a higher than expected inflow o f foreign aid.

25.       The Governments' investment program (Programme d'Investissement Public - PIP) is
fully embedded in the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy and supports the four strategic
pillars: (i)accelerating equitable growth; (ii)ensuring that the poor have access to basic social


 The recent Debt Sustainabilty Analysis suggests that a higher share o f grants should be aimed at to finance this

services; (iii)expanding opportunities for employment and income-generating activities for the poor;
and (iv) promoting good governance. The program's cost is estimated at 1,350 billion FCFA for
the years 2007 to 2009, o f which about 42 percent i s projected to be funded by external
resources. Roughly 50 to 55 percent o f annual ODA requirements are planned to be provided
throughbudget support.

26.     In 2007, the overall investment program is projected to amount to FCFA 414 billion.
Foreign budget support i s estimated to provide a total o f FCFA 120.5 billion in 2007, o f which
the proposed PRSC 7 represents 38 percent. The remainder is covered by the other members o f
the budget support donor group (Cadre Gknkral d 'Organisation des Appuis Budgktaires -
CGAB), including the African Development Bank, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands,
Sweden and the European Commission. The monitoring matrix o f the CGAB for 2007-2009 i s
presented in annex 3 o f this document. Another FCFA 121 billion is expected to be financed
throughproject aid.

27.     Monetary policies will support a low inflation environment, projected at 2 percent
annually. Growth of credit to the economy i s in line with economic growth, with annual
increases of 9-10 percent. By buildingreserves from the proceeds derived from the privatization
o f ONATEL, the Government aims to reduce its net credit position significantly (21 percent in
2007), providing space for credit demand from the private sector.

28.     Based on a gradual recovery o f international cotton prices (Figure 2), the projected
expansion o f cotton export volumes and a continuous stabilization of international oil prices, the
trade deficit i s projected to narrow from 9.5 percent of GDP in 2006 to about 8 percent in2009.
The balance o f services and income i s estimated to remain broadly steady at its 2006 level. The
current account deficit in 2007 is projected to be financed by a mix of official external aid (60
percent) and private capital inflows (40 percent). Gross international reserves are projected to
progressivelyincrease in2007 andremain at about 5 months o f imports.

DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

29.     Burkina Faso has a good track record o f servicing its debt on time without incumng
arrears. Combined with Burkina's long lasting commitment to macroeconomic stability and
satisfactory implementation o f reforms, the country i s expected to discharge its fiture obligations
in a timely manner.      InApril 2002, Burkina Faso reached the Completion Point under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative.         On March 28, 2006, the country was made eligible for the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which provided debt reliefin 2006 inthe rangeo f 17
percent o f GDP (calculated as a stock o f debt relief).       The authorities established in 1997 a
national public debt committee (CNDP), chaired by the Minister o f Finance and Budget, to
monitor the external debt situation. The technical and managerial capacity o f the committee i s
beingstrengthened through technical assistance.

30.     Burkina Faso's risk o f debt distress remains at a moderate rating (Annex 10). The recent
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) prepared by Fund and IDA staffs concludes that Burkina
Faso's debt is sustainable, with debt ratios comfortably below their policy-dependent thresholds
under abaseline scenario. However, the latter depends critically on the assumption that domestic
revenues continue to increase and lead to declining deficits after grants, thus reducing new
borrowing requirements. The risk embodied in domestic revenue performance i s compounded
by Burkina's vulnerable export performance, which is essentially based on one product, cotton.
MDRIrelief has reduced the risk of debt distress, but risks pertaining to revenue and export
performance remain.        The DSA underscores the need for the authorities to continue
implementing sound macroeconomic policies, revenue-raising measures, and accelerating
reforms aimed at export growth and diversification. Given the rapid projected rise o f Burkina's
debt stock over the next years, consideration should also be givenby donors to provide more aid
inthe formofgrants.


     V.      ASSESSMENT INPRSIMPLEMENTATIONAND PROGRESS
                                   MADEUNDERPRSC4-6

31.     The assessment o f the implementation o f the PRS can be found in the Annual Progress
Reports produced by the authorities, together with the joint IMF/BankJSANs. The most recent
one (dated April 2007) provides a summary o f recent achievements and recommendations.
Major achievements include rising primary school enrollment (60.2 percent), especially for girls
(55 percent), improved primary school completion (up 4 percent since 2003), and progress in
health and water and sanitation, although a ruravurban divide remains.               If current trends
continue, Burkina i s positionedto reach the overall poverty headcount MDGby 2015, with good
chances o f also meeting the water and sanitation target.           It was noted, however, that the
authorities needto accelerate the reforms inthe investment climate and in strategic sectors such
as electricity and cotton.

32.     A comprehensive assessment o fachievements underthe first series o fPRSCs (PRSC-1 to

will be analyzed indetail through an ICR dedicatedto the series duringthe second half of 2007.
Lessons learned will feed into the preparation and design o f PRSC 8 and 9.              This section
provides a preliminary assessment of progress made by the Government with the support of the
second series of PRSCs (PRSC-4 to PRSC-6). Annex 8 includes the Government's monitoring
and performance indicators o f the Priority Action Plans (PAP) for 2004-06, which is an integral
partofthe assessment detailed below.

               IMPROVINGTHE INVESTMENT CLIMATEAND PROMOTINGEXPORTS

33.     Burkina's macroeconomic situation has improvedover the years and i s considered stable.
Ownership o f policy implementation has been strong and, as indicated above, the authorities
have pursued prudent fiscal policies with the fiscal deficit largely covered by foreign assistance.
However, the level of fiscal revenues has not improved significantly over the years and requires
strengthening. Real GDP growth averaged 6.3 percent per year during 2001-2006, and was
driven by the agriculture sector, where most o f the poor are employed. The broad-based growth
strategy has contributed to the estimated decline in the incidence o f poverty as described in
section 11. However, because o f the country's unfavorable investment climate, the vulnerability
o f agriculture to rainfall fluctuations, the weak infrastructure and high factor costs, enhancing
productivity and sustaining growth present a challenge.

34.     Growth in Burkina was supported by a massive expansion in cotton production, from
252,000 tons in 2001 to about 730,000 tons in2006. Burkina i s now the largest cotton producer
insub-SaharanAfrica. The impressive increase incottonproduction was the result ofimportant
sector reforms implemented by the Government during 1999-2005 aimed at improving sector
competitiveness (see Box 1 and Annex 5). However, as discussed above and in Annex 5 the
cotton sector has recently been under stress as a result o f a decline o f the export price for ginned
cotton and the absence o f an adequate producer price setting mechanism to more closely align
the producer price with the international cottonprice.

35.     With respect to other agricultural products, the production o f cereals, sorghum, mil, corn
andmaize has increased by between 30 and 36 percent since 2001. To promote shared growth,
the Government has enhanced land tenure security and access to land, thereby improving
production conditions for small holders. Measures carried out included the enactment o f a Law
on seeds and the building o f 95 rural roads (335 km in length) to facilitate the raising o f and
trade incattle.

36.     The telecommunication sector was liberalized and cell phone companies were allowed to
enter the market in 2000. Subscribers increased to about 1.1million in2006 and unit costs were
reduced. The telecommunication sector i s regulated by an independent regulatory agency
ensuring interconnection with the state-owned fixed lines under fair conditions. The rural
telephone service was liberalized at end-2005 and the Government has requested expression o f
interests for private participation in this segment. Furthermore, ONATEL, the state owned
monopoly intelecommunications, was privatized at the endo f 2006.

37.     Despite the robust growth and poverty reduction achieved over the last decade, the
principal challenge for Burkina in the agriculture sector remains the improvement o f
productivity. Indeed, the vast majority o f the rural poor continue to depend on agricultural



                                               - 12-

production characterized by low mechanization and sensitivity to rainfall variation. Government
efforts have had little impact so far in changing yield levels o f cereal and cotton production and
most o fthe growth has taken place due to extension of the cultivation area.

38.     Burkina's industrial development potential is still constrained by high factor costs, in
particular for energy and transport. The ongoing project to link Burkina's electricity grid to the
gridinCote d'Ivoire would allow for lower generation costs after 2008. While the privatization
o f state assets has made progress recently (ONATEL privatization), private participation in the
electricity sector and privatization o f Burkina's oil import monopoly (SONABHY) have been
delayed.

39.     The Government has limited leverage on exchange rate and monetary policy. Apart from
fiscal measures, most o f its growth-inducing policies thus have to rely on microeconomic/sector
policies to enhance efficiency and productivity.      Although the authorities have taken some
significant positive steps over the past two years to improve the investment climate (notably the
creation o f the CEFORE, Centre de FormuZitks des Enterprises to accelerate business
registration), the country still compares poorly with most countries in the region. The 2007
Doing Business Report indicates that, on average, entrepreneurs inBurkina Faso face highcosts
and a significant number o f procedures, and incur excessive delays for creating a company,
obtaining a building license and transferring property. The labor market is rigid and human
resources are not qualified enough. Lastly, in spite o f the progress recorded recently on human
development, Burkina Faso's social indicators continue to lagbehindthe sub-Saharan average.

                         IMPROVINGACCESS BASICSOCIAL SERVICES
                                              TO

40.     An array o f measures laid the ground to achieve a significant increase in the supply o f
education services through the national budget. The Government expanded teacher training by
ending the automatic hiringo f graduates o f teacher training colleges into the civil service. It also
continued the subsidization of school supplies in the 20 provinces with the lowest schooling
levels. It expanded the number o f schools equippedwith runningwater and sanitation facilities.
Gross primary enrollment rates increased from 41.7 percent in 1999-2000 to 60.2 percent in
2005-2006. Access to secondary and higher education has also increased. At the same time,
gender and regional disparities have started to decrease. Inparticular, public education benefited
from a faster increase in services in under-supplied provinces. But more needs to be done to
school girls, whose Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) inprimary education reached only 55 percent.

41.     While increasing student enrollment has been successful, the quality o f education lags
behind. The completion rate improved in primary education (from 19 percent in 2001 to 40
percent in 2006) as well as the ratios impacting the quality o f education (books/pupil and
pupils/teacher ratios). The transition rate from primary to secondary education increased from
27 in 1994 to 40 percent in2002, surpassing the Government's initial objectives. The number o f
students at the secondary level increased by 60 percent; and inparticular, the proportion o f girls
enrolled at secondary level reached the target o f 40 percent. But in 2006, education quality
dropped as measuredby the rate o f success inobtaining the Certificate o fPrimary Study (CEP).

42.     Despite its low ranking in human development indexes, Burkina has seen some o f its
health indicators improve inthe past five years, including wider vaccination coverage, improved



                                               - 1 3 -

prenatal care, and lower child mortality (from 219 to 184 per 1,000 between 1999 and 2003).
With support from debt relief and poverty reduction credits, child vaccination became free in
2002, as did prenatal care in2003. Between 1999 and2005, vaccination rates increased from 60
to 111.7 percent for BCG, from 42 to 96 percent for DTCP1, from 53 to 84 percent for measles,
and from 50 to 84 percent for yellow fever. Prices of essential generic drugs were reduced
through a cut inthe profit margins o f the National DrugProcurement and Distribution Company
(CAMEG) in 2002. Tracking surveys conducted as part of the PRSP process indicate that the
measure resulted ina 15-30 percent decline inthe costs o f standard medical interventions.

43.      To increase the level o f financial resources available at the health district level, the
Government introduced the delegation o f budget credits to district managers, and 66 petty cash
accounts (re'gies d hvance) were created in 2003. Also, the significantly increased health budget
since 2001 made it possible to extend the coverage o f infrastructure Health Centers (Centre de
sante' et depromotion sociale), Dispensaries, Maternity Hospitals, MEG(Me'dicaments essentiels
ge'ne'riques) stores, and Medical Centers with facilities for surgery (Centres Me'dicaux avec
antennes chirurgicales). The distribution system i s well coordinated under the MEG hnctions
thanks to a better demand forecast by the CAMEG (Centrale d'achat des me'dicaments essentiels
ge'nkriques) and an improved inventory management by the medical centers. The Government
also took measures to enhance the financial coverage for accessing health services (support for
the risks-sharingmechanisms, subsidy for urgent obstetrical care, exemption from payment o f
preventive care for pregnant women and children o f less than 5 inpublic medical centers). As a
result, the infantmortality rate reached 83 deaths per 1,000 live births in2003, down from 105 in
1999.

44.      Efforts to reduce the spread o f HIV/AIDS resulted in a relatively low prevalence rate o f
2.3 percent in2005, against 4.2 percent in2002. HIV rates inurbanareas have begunto decline,
from a peak o f over 6 percent in 1999 to about 4 percent today. Other trends are also
encouraging: the percentage o f men using condoms during their most recent high-risk sexual
contact increased from 59 to 69 percent from 1999 to 2003, and the HIV prevalence rate among
young women (aged 15-24) attending urbanantenatal clinics has declined.

45.      Inthe health sector, nutrition issues andcombating malaria remain a major concern and
need to be tackled within a multi-sectoral framework. There also remains the issue o f human
resources as evidenced by the difficulty to post education and health workers inrural andremote
areas. Financial incentives introduced in 2005 to address this challenge have not had an impact
yet. The reform requiredproviding for a more adequatehumanresource management system and
incentive structure i s part o f this new PRSC series 7 to 9, to be implementedinthe context o f the
ongoing decentralization reform.

46.     In water and sanitation, the Government prepared in 2006 a strategy to reform the
management and the maintenance of facilities and infrastructures in 13 provinces, with the
objective to improve the hnctionality and sustainability o f 48,000 water points and 472 water
piped systems (AEPS). At about the same time, the Government completed its sanitation plans
for Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso and 4 secondary cities (Fada N'Gourma, Ouahigouya,
Banfora and Koudougou), while strategic planning was continuing inthe remaining 6 cities, with
some delays due to capacity constraints and inadequate finding. Since then, the Government has
adopted standards, criteria and indicators for drinking water supply and sanitation (AEPA) to


                                                - 14-

improve the technical design and sustainability o f its equipment plans, and has developed
monitoringand evaluation systems, including through regular audits. Inparticular, M&E o f the
sector builds on the inventory o f the water infrastructure and sanitation system conducted in
2005, and on the baseline established then for reaching the Water and Sanitation National
Program MDGs.

47.     Against this backdrop, enhanced decentralization can be an appropriate approach to
improve basic service delivery insofar as there i s empowerment o f local actors who are
accountable to local populations, and better alignment o f expenditures with local priorities.
While deconcentration o f service delivery i s making progress, the transfer o f humanresources
andthe managerial framework for it is lagging behind. The adoption o f the decentralization law
and the selection of governors at end-2004 was an important achievement directly supported by
the PRSCs and the project portfolio. The law is fulfilling its role by requiring the central
Government to begin to decentralize financial and physical resources to regions and local levels.
To complement the decentralization strategy at the political level, local elections took place on
April 23, 2006 that have established 302 rural municipalities and have set up their respective
assemblies.

48.     Despite this progress, efforts at decentralization remain constrained by: (i)the
centralization o f strategic decisions on resource allocations and lack o f budget autonomy for
local governments; (ii)insufficient budgets, with delays in budget transfers; (iii)a marked
imbalance and inequality in personnel allocation by region and weak and over-centralized
personnel management; (iv) the lack o f clear definition o f roles and responsibilitieswhich means
that the relationship between units within the centre, and among the centre, the regions and the
front-line service delivery units remains unclear; and (v) the lack o f clearly defined public
oversight responsibility or general involvement inlocal service delivery.

49.     With the 2006 municipal elections, Burkina Faso has entered a new phase in the
implementation o f its decentralization strategy. The challenge for the Government i s to succeed
in the transfer of responsibilities and resources to the local Governments. After more than a
decade o f intense debate on which form decentralization shouldtake, the "Code des CollectivitCs
Territoriales" adopted in 2004 represents a turning point in this process, engaging Burkina Faso
infar-reaching reforms. The Code foresees the establishment of two tiers of local Governments
(regions, communities) and three tiers o f territorial administration (regions, provinces,
departments). The Code also brings about the full "communalization" o f the territory, including
for rural areas, each o f which i s run by a local commune council. The Code highlights six
priority responsibilities to be transferred to urban communities: pre-school, primary education,
primary health care, culture, youth, sports and leisure. It also includes the principle that
responsibilities must be transferred commensurately with resources. Yet, the Code gives little
guidance on the actual implementationo fthese transfers, and implementationdecrees that should
provide clarification on these issues have not yet been issued. What is clearer is that the
effective transfer o f resources to rural communes will only be considered once transfers to urban
local collectivities are actually implemented.

50.     Despite its importance, fiscal decentralization represents the weakest link in the
decentralization framework so far. The fiscal basis o f the communities i s generally low because
their revenues depend on a limited number o f taxes and user fees. Existing transfers to local


                                               - 1 5 -

authorities are discretionary and currently based on a simple measure o f population. Thus, the
transfer base tends to give a disproportionate advantage to the bigger andrichest cities (the four-
five main taxes represent 75 percent o f budgets in the big cities versus 50 percent in smaller
urbancommunities). Capacityto mobilize revenues at the local level depends on two factors: the
size o f the city and the presence o f local agents o f the tax administration. The result is that the
larger local agglomerations have considerably more resources irrespective o f their needs. An
inter-ministerial working group i s studying various modalities for establishing an adequate inter-
governmental transfer system, possibly through a two-tiered block grants system (dedicated to
recurrent andinvestment expenditures).

                          IMPROVINGMANAGEMENT
                                       PUBLICFINANCIAL

51.     Burkina Faso has been implementing an ambitious reform-agenda since its adoption in
2002 o f a consolidated action plan to improve the budget management system (Plan d'Action
pour le Renforcement de la Gestion Budge'taire, PRGB). Achievements to date include: (i)
stronger budget legislationwhich reflects most o fthe WAEMU legislationon public finance; (ii)
improved alignment o f budget allocation with PRSP priorities with the introduction o f a global
MTEF; (iii)enhanced budget execution with the operation o f a computerized expenditure
management system that captures all domestically financed expenditures; and (iv) improved
budgetreportingand auditingwith the introduction o f an independent Audit Court.

52.     The draft report o f the ongoing Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Assessment presents the following conclusions: (i)   the credibility o fthe budget is good except for
domestic revenues; (ii)the budget coverage and transparency is good but access to budget
information is limited; (iii)the budget reflects adopted policies; (iv) domestic revenue collection
andbudgetcontrols are weak; and (v) predictability andthe use o fcountry systems bydonors are
weak.

53.     While the budget i s exhaustive and transparent, there are weaknesses inbudget statistics,
notably: (i)foreign-financed investments are not fully integrated in the Government budget
information system; and (ii)   monitoring o f poverty-spending remains difficult and the functional
classificationneeds to be operationalized. Also, the link between the budget and the PRSP needs
to be further strengthened with the generalization o f the MTEF and program budgets across all
ministries. In fact, while Burkina Faso has made significant progress in the preparation o f a
global MTEF, the elaboration o f sectoral MTEFs needs further development: as o f end 2005,
only the Ministry o f Basic Education and the Ministry o f Health had sectoral MTEF, and
additional efforts are needed to make them more operational.

54.     Budget reporting and the application of good governance standards have been strengthened,
allowing for an improved efficiency in spending and in fighting corruption. The Government has
developed a statistical directory for public finance, and customized a functional and social
classification in the CID (public expenditure management Software) to track poverty reducing
expenditures. The Budget execution reports are now prepared within twelve months after the
closing o fthe fiscal year but they are not always supported by accounting statements.

55.     An Independent Supreme Audit Court was created and the Government met its legal
obligation to submit budget execution reports and accounting statements. The Government also



                                               - 1 6 -

established and staffed a High Authority for the Coordination o f the Fight against Cormption. The
PRGB, adopted in July 2002, integrating the recommendations o f the CFAA, i s being implemented
with donor support. The Audit Court has also elaborated an Action Plan for the reinforcement o f its
capacity with assistance from the European Commission and support from the Government. A good
governance plan was preparedand disseminatedto all provincial authorities.

56.     With respect to public procurement, after the 2000 Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR), the Government launched a vast reform and capacity buildingprogram. It started to prepare
annual public procurement plans. It also adopted a new decree on public procurement in line with
international best practice. The new decree establishes clear and comprehensive rules promoting
transparency in competition, describes explicitly the responsibilities o f the bodies involved,
particularly those o f the Central Directorate for Public Procurement (DCMP), and outlines a conflict
resolution system. The adoption o f a manual o f procedures and new standard bidding documents,
and the creation o f a procurement reform committee comprising stakeholders from the public sector
as well as civil society, have strengthened transparency and scrutiny in the administration o f public
procurement. Internal and external public-procurement audits have been conducted with a view to
greater transparency. External audits were also carried out for the years 2001, 2002 and 2004, with
financing from the EuropeanCommission.

57.     With respect to fiscal decentralization, the elections in 302 municipalities in April 2006
brought about many new actors to the decentralization process in the country, who are not very
familiar with budget management tools. An efficient, effective and transparent management o f
decentralizedresources constitutes a challenge for Burkina Faso because o f the weak capacity o f the
newly electedlocal Governments.

58.     Civil service reform has advanced with the development o f the computerized civil service
payroll and personnel management system (SIGASPE). The Government instituted a new personnel
management system based on mission letters and performance reviews. However, there are still
missing modules in the SIGASPE (notably in career management and statistical module) and
dissemination has been limited. Also, the implementation o f a merit-based promotion system i s not
yet effective.

(FY00-FY05) include the recognition that sustained Government commitment to sound policies
creates the basis for accelerated growth. These lessons are taken into account in the 2005 CAS.
They are also reflected inthe choice o f the PRSC instrument as a key financing instrument o f the
CAS, and inthe scope and content of this third PRSC series. The use of the PRSC instrument to
support implementation o f the poverty reduction strategy has been a major benefit for the client,
includingby strengthening country ownership.

61.     Primacy of the cotton question. Recent developments in the cotton sector show the
importance o f continued IDA involvement in this sector. The focus o f this proposed operation



                                                 - 17-

and future PRSCs on reforms in the cotton sector acknowledge that PRSCs are excellent
instrumentsto promote structural reforms required for macroeconomic stabilityandgrowth.

62.     Harmonize budget support among donors and increase focus on evidence-based
policymaking. As indicated inbox 2, the PRSC M&Emechanismhas been further harmonized
with the adoption o f the Unified Framework for Budget Support (CGAB) and the use of ajoint
performance matrix as the basis for joint assessments (Annex 3). The CGAB matrix i s based on
the annually revised three-year Priority Action Program (PAP), which provides a link between
policy objectives andmonitoring indicators. Donors that provide budget support have organized
joint missions around the CGAB annual meetings (February, April and September) to monitor
the implementation o f CGAB Agreements and assess performance. The frequency o f review
mechanisms and the overall transaction cost for the Government has been considerably reduced.
To further improve donor harmonization, the Government and IDA plan to further align the
calendar o f PRSCs preparation with the budget cycle and CGAB annual reviews. This would
result in PRSC 8 being presented to the Board in less than 12 months from PRSC-7 approval.
With respect to strengthening the M&E o f PRSCs, the formulation o f some of the prior actions
for PRSC-7 (Table 3) was adjusted at pre-appraisal to improve their measurability. Also, the
proposed triggers for PRSC-8 were formulated so as to avoid any ambiguity in monitoring and
evaluation.

        VI.    BURKINA FASO'S POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

63.     The Government prepared a second full PRSP (PRSP-2) in 2004 which covers, through
the latest Annual Progress Report, the period 2006-2008.       It improves on the first PRSP by
introducing a regional dimension, elaborating a results-based framework and establishing a
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system. The PRSP-2 retains the main thrust o f the original
PRSP and supports four main pillars: (i) improving the competitiveness o f the economy (private
sector development), (ii)improving public service delivery and access, (iii)enhancing
employment and income opportunities, especially for the poor, and (iv) accelerating
decentralization and strengthening the efficiency o f the public financial management system
(Annex 7). It also expands the number o fpriority sectors from three (health, education, and rural
development) to twelve. Additions are food security, access to potable water, HIV/AIDS, social
inclusion, gender, environment, employment and informal sector, development o f SMEs and
SMIs (including small-scale mining), security, rural electrification and Information and
Communication Technology (ICT).        The expanded list of priority sectors was the result o f
broadened consultations. The Priority Action Plan for PRSP-2 is a description o f policies and
programs to be implemented during 2007-2009.            The Government annually updates the
framework inlight o f actual outcomes.

64. -   The prime objectives o f the poverty reduction strategy are to: (i) per capita gross
                                                                           increase
domestic product by at least 4 percent per year, which requires an annual growth rate o f above 6
percent; (ii)reduce the incidence o f poverty from 46.4 percent in 2003 to under 35 percent by
2015; and (iii)increase life expectancy to at least 60 years by 2015, in line with the MDGs. The
draft budget for 2007 was adopted in line with the MTEF 2007-2009 and the PRSP priorities.
The MTEF was prepared and discussed in April 2006 at the launch o f the budget cycle
preparation.   Within the overall ceiling set under the MTEF, the authorities significantly



                                               - 18-

increasedthe allocation for non-wagerecurrent expenditures inpriority sectors, including health,
social action and national solidarity, basic education, secondary and higher education and rural
development.     Given the low level o f social indicators in Burkina, this sustained effort to
increase budget for social sectors withinthe overall ceiling i s appropriate.

65.      The next paragraphs present an overview o f the Government's reform agenda inthe three
areas supported by the proposed PRSC series, namely to (i)      improve the investment climate and
promote exports; (ii)  improve access to basic social services through deepened decentralization
and strengthened institutional capacity; and (iii)promote efficiency, transparency and
accountability inthe use o fpublic resources through enhancedpublic financial management.

66.      Improving the investment climate and promoting exports.                 The Government
envisions to adopt and start implementation o f an export promotion strategy in 2007, and to
adopt a law on norms and standards. The Government has managed to address the short-term
needs o f the cotton sector, including the financing o f the current production campaign. But
medium and long-term solutions to the crisis are beingimplemented and comprise inparticular a
mechanism to align the producer price more closely with world cotton prices (see Box 1). The
Government is considering how to ensure the long-term financial viability of the sector,
including the adoption o f Bt cotton.      The sector's viability will depend on the successful
implementation o fthese reforms.

67.      Mining is poised to become Burkina's second biggest export sector after cotton,
increasing total export earnings by around 25 percent. The expansion o f the mining sector is
expected to have a positive impact on growth and equity, increasing poor people's access to
basic services and employment and expanding the Government's tax revenue. A revised legal
and regulatory framework encouraged private mining exploration and investment in gold,
manganese, phosphates, and zinc. With the adoption o f a revised mining code in 2003 and
higher gold prices, Burkina stands well poised to benefit from the dynamism of the mining
sector. Today, the construction o f three gold mines is proceeding with foreign direct investors
and four other firms have completedencouraging feasibility studies.

68.      Since the Government embraced market-oriented policies in 1991, it has implemented
significant reforms in the areas o f macroeconomic management; trade, markets and price
liberalization; tax reform; privatization; banking sector restructuring; regulatory reform;
implementation o f the WAEMU-wide competition policy; and adoption of new business laws
under the OHADA treaty. Inthe early 2000s, the Government launched a second generation o f
reforms including large-scale legal reforms and the privatization o f public utility companies
(electricity  and hydrocarbons,       telecommunications),     supported by the       IDA-financed
Competitiveness and Private Sector Development project (PACDE). The Government reform
program in the coming years includes further liberalization o f the economy, including: (i)    the
leasing o f SONABEL, the state owned electricity company; (ii)     the opening-up o f SONABHY's
equity to private sector, the state owned oil importing company; (iii) furtherreductionofthe state
share in ONATEL, the former state-owned telephone company; (iv) the privatization o f the
Socie`te`d'Exploitation HoteliBre (or Silmande Hotel). Inthe energy sector, the Government will
continue to implement its electrical grid interconnexion projects with C6te d'Ivoire and Ghana,
revise the regulatory law on electricity generation, transmission and distribution and conduct a
tariff study to improve electricity provision in the long-term at a lower cost.             In the


                                               - 19-

telecommunication sector, the Government intends to continue to improve the regulatory
framework by adopting implementationtexts.

69.     The Government is committed to implement far reaching reforms to improve governance
and accountability in the transport sector.         A new law (Zoi dbrientation du secteur des
transports) will be adopted by June 2007 to: (i)     improve traffic and transit; and (ii)
                                                                                        implement a
national road fund. Rather than being directly financed from a fuel levy as i s the case in several
other countries, the proposedBurkinabC road fund will have a dedicated account provisioned by
the Treasury, in compliance with a credit agreement determined annually inthe finance law, and
set to insure satisfactory road maintenance and provide for the clearance over time o f arrears
accumulated by the government toward contractors. The road hnd will be managed by an
executive board, representative o f the sector, and a light secretariat.

70.     The Government will improve the business environment through the institutionalization
of an ombudsman to arbitrate business disputes (Chambre d'Arbitrage et de Me'diation de
Ouagadougou,CAMCO); the implementationo f a Registre du Commerceet du Cre'ditMobiZier ,
RCCM; the establishment of accounting service providers (Centres de Gestion Agrkes, CGA);
the creation of an observatory for investment climate; the adoption o f a new tax code (Code
Ge'ne'raldes ImpGts),a new Investment Code anda new labor code.

71.     Decentralization and service delivery.          With the new Decentralization Code (Code
Ge'ne'raldes ColZectivite'sTerritoriales),the Government will transfer power to the communities.
This involves at least three steps: (i) evaluation o f resources to be transferred; (ii) actual
                                         an                                                the
transfers (humanand financial); and (iii) recruitment o fnew (communaVloca1)personnel.
                                          the

72.     With respect to the transfer o f assets, the Government has transferred responsibility to 49
communities since June 30, 2006 in six priority areas: (i)     pre-school; (ii)  primary school; (iii)
health; (iv) culture; (v) youth; and (vi) sports and leisure. The individuallist o f assets for which
responsibility will be transferred i s being finalized.        The decree which transfers these
responsibilities clarifies them across the six transferred areas. Ingeneral, the responsibilities o f
the State relate to the definition o f the national policy orientations, the norms and standard for
infrastructure and equipment, and the supervision and control o f the activities o f the transferred
educational, medical and cultural facilities. Responsibilities o f the municipalities relate to the
procurement, the construction and the management o f the transferred facilities. In 2007, the
Government will pursue the transfer o fresponsibilitiesby adopting the texts specifying the list of
individual assets to be transferred to the urbanmunicipalities and other texts, which will define
the allocation and amount o f the recurring budget. The Government will also pursue the
implementation o f the construction o f local Government offices and train the newly appointed
local Government members.

73.     With respect to the transfer o fhumanresources (staffing), the Government has decided to
create a local civil service. National civil servants working in the areas transferred to the
municipalities will remain national civil servants untilretirement and will simply be placed at the
disposal o f the local Governments. The municipalities will start recruiting their own staff as o f
2007 when the texts envisaged for this purpose are applicable. As o f now, only the law on the
local civil service has been approved. In 2007, the Government will adopt the texts to transfer



                                                  - 20 -

staff to the local Government. In addition, the software for personnel management (SIGASPE)
will be extended to the 13 regionsto improve management o f stafftransferred to regions.

74.      Withrespect to transfer o f financial resources, the Government will provide two types o f
subsidies to local Governments, one for their operating budget, called dotation globale de
fonctionnement-DGF (unconditional subsidy for operating budget), and another called dotation
globale d'bquipernent-DGE (unconditional subsidy for investment). The amounts o f DGF and
DGEinthe 2007 budget are respectively CFAF 1.2 billion and CFAF 5.1 billion. The financial
architecture comprises two other financing mechanisms. The first is municipality-raised taxes
and the second i s a new fund for local Government development.              The fund will finance
investments o f municipalities inthe form o f subsidies and contribute to capacity development o f
local Governments in the area o f design and implementation o f investment programs. The fund
will be financed mainly through the budget and external aid. Efficient, effective and transparent
management o f these resources constitutes a challenge for Burkina Faso because o f the current
weak capacities o f newly elected local Governments. The Ministryo f Finance and Budget will
continue its effort to establish branch offices in the regions in order to assist the municipalities
with budget, financial management and accounting functions, and have them report to the
independent audit institution (Cour des Comptes).

 75.     To support efforts to provide access to basic health services, the Government is working
inclose collaborationwith the development partners to improve harmonizationandcoordination
o f financing around the Plan National de Dbveloppement Sanitaire which focuses on achieving
the MDGs, particularly MDG numbers 4 and 5.                The decentralization process will further
facilitate access to health services at the district level.

76.      With respect to the development of water and sanitation inrural areas, the Government has
continued in2006 to make significant progress inthe reform o fthe legal and institutional framework.
First, a General Directorate in charge of rural water supply, sanitation as well as water resources
management was created. Second, a Water and Sanitation National Program based on the MDGs
was prepared. Third, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the ministry in charge o f
water and the main donors, including the World Bank, to strengthen coordination through a sector
wide approach, with harmonization and alignment of donors around country systems. Finally, a
basket funds approach, as well as a procedure manual, are being established to complete the move
from projects to programmatic approachesusingcountry capacity andprocedures.

77.      Enhancing Public Financial Management. The Government has recently adopted a
strategy to further strengthen public financial management. The strategy builds on lessons learnt
from the PRGB implementation. The overarching objective o f the strategy i s to help the country
meet international standards in the area o f public financial management. It has eight strategic
objectives: (i)  improve strategic budget allocation; (ii)   increase domestic revenue and foreign
aid; (iii) improve budget execution and budget transparency; (iv) enhance the quality, coverage
and availability o f budget data; (v) promote accountability inbudget management; (vi) improve
budget control; (vii) contribute to an enabling business environment; and (viii) improve capacity
o f institutions involved in budget management. The strategy will be implemented through an
Action Plan that will be updated every year and funded by the national budget. The monitoring
and evaluation system for the implementation o f the strategy i s composed o f a steering
committee supported by a secretariat and technical groups. The strategy will be a key element o f



                                                  - 21 -

the Performance Assessment Framework o f the MOU for the multi-donor budget support group.
For instance, with respect to tax revenue, the Government will benefit from the support o f the
IMFwhose new PRGFtogetherwith technical assistance from Afi-itac will focus onthis issue.

78.     As part ofthis strategy, the Government has recently developedguidelines and check lists
for budget execution staff and has implemented a training program to disseminate recently
adopted budget implementation texts. It has also successfully introduced inthe CID a functional
codification with markers to better track poverty spending.          It has made progress in the
development o f specific software for tracking foreign aid which will be completed and made
operational by the end o f 2007. Inaddition, the Government is preparing a methodological note
on global and sectoral MTEFs in view o f assisting six line Ministries to adopt a MTEF. InJuly
2005, the Government also organized a workshop on program budget experiences, and proposed
to re-launchthe program.

79.     Because the budget-program and MTEF initiatives are a long-term reform, the
Government has started to adapt administrative texts to establish a unit within the General
Directorate for Budgetwhich will beresponsible for program budget andMTEFimplementation.
The African Development Bank and the GTZ have been supporting this initiative.                 The
Government has also benefited from an IDA Institutional Development Fund, to improve the
capacity o f institutions incharge o fbudget control.

80.     According to the Decentralization Law the municipalities' financial accounts must be
audited by the Independent Audit Court. However, in practice, the assessment and approval o f
some accounts could be carried out by the public accountants (apurement administratifpar les
comptables principaux). The Action Plan for strengthening the independent audit institution
included this action as a priority to be carried out in2007 (adoption o f a decree to determine the
threshold for the category of statements to be approved bythe public accountants).

81.     The Government plans to: (i) the scope o f public procurement to administrative
                                        extend
contracts for the delegation and the concession o f public services; (ii)create an independent
appeal mechanism for contract awards by setting up o f the "Comite` Permanent de R2glement
Amiable des Litiges" (CRAL); and (iii)        establish a mechanism for effective application o f
sanctions applicable to civil servants and the private sector (bidders and suppliers/consultants
and contractors). InDecember 2004, a decree established the CNCS (a national committee for
the monitoring o f procurement reforms) that comprises stakeholders from the public sector as
well as from the civil society, including private sector representatives and an NGO active inanti-
corruption work.      The creation o f the CNCS provides a formal and effective institutional
framework to coordinate and follow-up the implementation o f the procurement reforms. The
person responsible o fthe technical secretariat incharge o f the preparationo f the CNCS meetings
was appointed inDecember 2006.

82.     In addition, the Government has recently adopted a national plan for improving
governance (2004), an anticorruption strategy (May 2006) and a sector strategy for the Ministry
o fFinances (2007), each with their respective actionplans. The institutional framework was also
strengthened with the creation o fthe anti-corruption highauthority.

VII. BANKGROUP'S SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                                       LINKTOTHECAS

83.     The June 2005 Country Assistance Strategy sets out the Bank Group's support to the
Government's PRS for the years FY06-FY09. It foresees the use o f three types o f instruments:
development policy lending (PRSCs), investment credits, and analytical and advisory activities
(AAA). The PRSCs would provide financing for the budget and support the implementationo f
policy reforms to: (i)improve the investment climate andpromote exports; (ii)improve access to
basic social services; and (iii)
                               promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use o f
public resources. Moreover, the CAS introduces an innovative approach to maximize synergies
between PRSCs and project implementation at the local level, by establishing a sustainable
mechanismfor the financing o f community level infrastructure.

                      COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANKACTIVITIES

84.     The CAS recognizes the PRSCs as the main instrument for providing program support.
Three other operations are direct complements to the PRSCs 7-9 series and provide financial and
technical assistance in these areas: (i) Administration Capacity Building project (US$ 7
                                         the
million, FY05) which aims to buildcapacity inpublic administration for policy formulation and
implementation, streamlining public administration, modernizing personnel management, and
enhancing the poverty focus o f expenditure; (ii) Statistical Capacity Buildingproject (US$ 10
                                                the
million, FY04) which addresses shortcomings in the M&E system by strengthening data
collection and reporting; and (iii)the Decentralized Urban Capacity Buildingproject (US$ 10
million, FY07) which aims to support decentralization inurbanareas.

85.     IDA is also supporting a far-reaching decentralization policy through its second
Community Based Rural Development (CBRD) Project (US$ 74 million, FY07) that builds rural
communities' governing and management capacities.        The first IDA-supported Community-
based Rural Development Project (US$67 million, FYO1) has reached thousands o f rural
communities, helping finance projects ranging from literacy centers to improved water
management.      The program has been instrumental in developing the legal and regulatory
framework for decentralization and local Government. Village bodies were entrusted with the
legal mandate o f local development. The CBRD covers nearly 40 percent o f the country's 8000
villages.

86.     To improve the effectiveness o f aid, IDA and other donors have helped establish sector
wide approaches in basic education, health, HIV/AIDS and water supply. In health, a pooled
funding mechanismchannels resources directly to health districts and hospitals on the basis o f
indicators that can be tracked over time. The HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project (FY02) and
the Health Sector Support and AIDS Project (FY06) have contributed a total o f US$ 75 million
to the sector. IDA, together with development partners, i s adopting a sectoral approach in
support o f decentralization to assist the Government in addressing the human resource
deployment issue as part o f a more comprehensive approach to providing access to basic health
services for the poor. In the education sector, IDA has contributed with its Basic Education
Sector Loan (US$ 33 million, FY02) and its Post Primary Education Loan (US$ 23 million,



                                              - 23 -

FY06) to expanding children's access to basic education. At the primary education level, IDA
support targeted girls and the poor inthe provinces with the least coverage.

87.     Responding to rising potable water demand in Ouagadougou, the country's fast-growing
capital, IDA was part o f a coordinated 13-donor effort to support the Government`s medium
term investment plan. Central to that plan was the construction o f the Ziga dam and the
treatment and transport facilities necessary for bringingenough water to the 1million Ouagalais.
IDA's contribution through its Ouaga Water Supply Project (US$70 million, FYO1) finances the
secondary and tertiary water network in the city, which will double the number o f household
water connections and more than triple the population served through neighborhood standpipes.
IDA has also invested in drainage and sanitation infrastructure in Ouagadougou and Bobo-
Dioulasso, with positive measurable effects on disease prevention and economic activity in
surrounding areas.

88.     Inagriculture, IDA'sAgricultural DiversificationandMarketDevelopmentProject(US$
66 million, FY06) i s supporting increased productivity in the critical cotton sector and has
financed expanded irrigation and measures to diversify farm outputs.         IDA has emphasized
private-sector led irrigation to allow dry-season production o f high-value export crops such as
tomatoes and onions. IDA supports the manufacture and maintenance o f small scale irrigation
equipment, as well as institutional and financial support. Beneficiaries, including women's
groups in the project zone, have been able to double the surface o f irrigated land and increase
their household income by an estimated 30 percent.        IDA's agricultural intensification and
marketing program is now scaling up earlier investments in export infrastructure, such as cold
storage rooms at airport.

89.     Through its Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (US$ 31 million,
FY03), IDA has provided technical and financial support over the past 10 years to eliminate the
state monopoly on mining, opening it to competition. A miningcapacity-building and technical
assistanceproject is improving the productivity and safety o f small-scale, artisanal mining.

90.     Inthe energy sector, IDAhas a two-pronged approach to support the provision oflow-
cost energy. First, IDA and other donors have financed urgently-needed power generation
capacity in Burkina, as well as investing in regional electricity interconnections with C8te
d'Ivoire and Ghana. The goal has been to halve the cost o f electricity. Second, IDA's Power
Sector Development (US$ 64 million, FY05) i s providing technical and financial support to
increase rural access to modem energy sources, through expansion o f the electrification gridand
investment inalternative technologies.

91.     Inthe transport sector, IDA is part of a consortium of donors that is assisting the
Government inrehabilitating and maintaining essential transport infrastructure. The support also
involves strengthening existing institutions and adopting sound policy and regulatory measures.
IDA financing through its Transport Sector Project (US$ 92 million, FY03) has rehabilitated
more than 800 kilometers o frural roads, connecting agricultural production zones to markets.

              COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT             PARTNER PROGRAMS

92.     The proposed PRSC series and PRSC 7 complements or leverages the support o f other
development partners.      The specific areas for IDA support have been identified in close
coordination with other development partners, in aiming for synergy with their respective
interventions, and buildingon IDA's comparative advantage in these areas. These donors will
continue to collaborate closely duringimplementation o f the program supported by the proposed
operation, especially through the General Budget Support Framework (CGAB) process.

93.      IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identification o f the respective
institutions' areas o f focus. On September 8, 2006, the IMF Board concluded the final and 6th
review o f Burkina's most recent arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF). A new low access PRGFfor 2007-09 is expected to be discussed bythe IMFBoard on
April 23,2007. IMFand IDA staffs have collaborated closely inthe past to assist the authorities
in the implementation of the country's PRS, coordinating their advice on sector economic
questions (e.g., on cotton and electricity), and in identifying solutions for the Government. The
IMF relies on IDA to get information on issues such as private sector development and sector
strategies.

94.      Twenty seven donors currently support the implementation o f
the Government's PRS through various modes of assistance: general          Donor         %ODA
                                                                           AfDB        II16.7
budgetary support, sector programs, investments projects, capacity
buildingprojects and technical assistance. Total aid commitments in
2007 for Burkina Faso are estimated at FCFA 331 billion (or U S
$630 million).                                                           I IDB           7.2

support. Provision o f budget support in a coordinated and cohesive        Belgium       1.2
way, in line with the Government's overall development strategy, is        Canada        0.7
evolving in an encouraging way (see box 2). Deeper coordination o f budget support was
initiated following the adoption o f the first Poverty Reduction Strategy which encourages
harmonization o f aid and the use o f country systems.         Currently, nine donors (European
Commission, IDA, the African Development Bank, France, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland,
Sweden, and Germany) use the joint CGAB on the basis o f a Memorandum o f Understanding
(MoU) signed in 2005. Donors are progressively moving to a joint monitoring and evaluation
matrix, evaluating whether disbursement criteria are met.           The synchronization o f each
institution's project cycle around the Government's budget cycle remains a challenge, however,
makingit difficult to completelyharmonizeprogram triggers andthejoint monitoringmatrix.

96.     IDA has aligned more o f its PRSC 7 missions with the calendar o f the CGAB. This
effort o f alignment was appreciated by the Government as well as by the other donors but needs
to be further strengthened. Several CGAB members have actively participated in the technical
negotiations o f the proposed program.      Further aligning IDA's calendar with the country's
budget cycle and CGAB's biannual reviews will be further pursued under PRSCs 8 and 9. IDA
also collaborates with several other partners in the context o f sectoral program, in particular
through pooled finding mechanisms such as in education, which are integrated in the national


                                               - 25 -

budget mechanism.            Lastly, with regard to investments projects and capacity reinforcement
projects, coordination remains weak among donors, but co-financing is expected to play a
positive coordination role inan increasing number o fprojects.

                                 Box 2: Donor Coordination/Harmonization

    Burkina Faso was a pilot country for the initiative on the Test o f N e w Forms o f Conditionality,
    implemented from 1997 to 2000, under the stewardship o f the European Commission. Incontrast with old
    practices where conditionality was driven by donors, the new initiative tried to strengthen recipient country
    ownership and responsibility for policies (design, implementation and monitoring-evaluation). A major
    lesson from this initiative was that budget support provided through this new form contributed more to
    improving ownership, accountability and the use o f country systems and result-based management
    principles.

    Owing to low administrative capacity and divergent and multiple practices on the side o f the donors,
    transaction costs related to the management o f budget support appeared excessive for the Government. The
    need for coordination and harmonization was quickly felt. Donors initially coordinated under the leadership
    o f the Delegation o f the European Commission. The first attempt to harmonize donor activities dates back
    to 2002 with the signature o f an agreement (SBC-CSLP) between the EuropeanUnion, Belgium, Denmark,
    France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland with Government approval. IDA and the AfDB became
    active members o f the initiative ina later phase. InFebruary 2004, the Government proposed a revised and
    more inclusive version, bringing all budget support partners into the Cadre Gine'ral d'Organisationdes
    Appuis Budgitaires (CGAB, an organizational framework for coordinated budget support). Focused on (i)
    ownership; (ii)   alignment; (iii) predictability; (iv) and result-based approach, the CGAB i s built around a
    joint performance matrix which is the principal tool for coordination and evaluation.

    The CGAB monitors and evaluates permanently but has three mandatory sessions per annum, with a formal
    performance session held at the time o f the annual review o f the PRSP progress report. All these sessions
    are chaired by the Minister o f Finance and Budget, supported by a secretariat made up o f a representative
    o f the administration and two representatives o f the donors. Joint missions are planned to reduce
    administrative transaction costs (identification, pre-evaluation and evaluation).

    On the basis o f two years experience, the preliminary conclusion i s that the CGAB functions well6 in
    improving the predictability o f budget support for Burkma and promoting dialogue between the
    Government and the donors, while minimizingtransaction costs. Future work will, among other, focus o n
    improving the PRSP monitoring and evaluation system and aligning the CGAB and PRS processes. In
    particular, the operation o f the sectoral and thematic Commissions (CST), which i s the anchor o f the
    monitoring-evaluation system o f the PRSP implementation, needs to be strengthened and reliable data
    made available to better inform the monitoring and performance indicators. A second area where further
    work needs to be done i s the rationalization o f the CGAB matrix, w h c h should become more focused on
    strategic milestones o f the government's policy. A s regards donor performance, the principal challenge is
    still related to the predictability o f budgetary support. The preliminary PEFA report, carried out inJanuary
    2007, offers a C+ mark for this category o fdonor performance.

    Inconclusion, Burkina Faso experience inbudget support coordination andharmonizationhas considerably
    improved with the introduction o f the CGAB, but some significant challenges that go beyond the
    framework o fbudget support remain to be solved to further strengthenthe system.

   ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

   97.    The current series o f PRSCs continue to benefit from several analytical reports recently
   completed. In FY04, these include a Public Expenditure Review, a Risk and Vulnerability
   Assessment, an Investment Climate study by FIAS and a Gender Assessment. InFY05, IDA
   completed a Poverty Assessment and a new Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR).
   Inaddition, the Bankworkedjointly with the IMFto update the Accountability Assessment and
   Action Plan (AAP) on the tracking o f poverty expenditure under the Heavily Indebted Poor
   Country (HPC) Initiative. These assessments have been used to inform the reform program o f
   PRSC-6 andthe new series (PRSC-7,8 and 9).

   98.    Another set o f studies were completed inFY06 to assist inidentifying priority reform for
.  spurring growth, diversification and employment. These studies included a labor market study
   and an investment climate assessment (ICA). The preliminary drafts o f a Diagnostic Trade
   Integration Study, a Financial Sector Review and an ESW on Decentralization have been made
   available recently for the Bank's CAS Mid-Term Review. These final assessments will be
   delivered inFY07 to inform the design o f next operations o f the current PRSC series inBurkina
 'Faso.

   99.     The design of the series also benefited from many other sources including a recent report
   on the diagnosis of the Independent Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes) and its Action Plan
   (European Commission, October 2006), and a report on the sources o f growth and the
   vulnerability o f Burkina Faso's Economy to exogenous shocks (Government - MEDEV,
   December 2005).

   100.    .Inadditiontothe analyticalwork describedabove, itisexpectedthat the designofPRSC
   8 and 9 will be underpinned by an upcoming Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY08)
   which will focus on growth, competitiveness and diversification issues. In particular, it will
   explore long-term prospects for Burkina Faso's cotton sector.          A Financial Accountability
   Assessment, usingthe PEFA framework, is to be completed inFY07. It is expected that some o f
   the PRSC-9 triggers will be defined to address remaining weaknesses identified in Burkina
   Faso's public financial management systems.

                               VIII. THE PROPOSEDPRSC7

   101.   The proposed operation i s the first in a series o f three annual PRSCs (PRSCs 7, 8 and 9)
   which will support the Government's PRS implementation along with other IDA instruments,
   including investment credits. This section outlines the overall framework o f the new series and
   describes the proposed PRSC'7.

                                              OF

   102.   The new PRSC series will support implementation o f Burkina Faso's Poverty Reduction
   Strategy adopted in 2000 and updated in 2004. The first series o f PRSCs for Burkina Faso
   focused on improving public financial management (notably fiduciary aspects) and access to
   social services (health and basic education). The second series added to these areas the issue o f
   growth, by focusing on reforms to fbrther liberalize the economy (cotton sector) andprivatize the


                                                  - 27 -

management o f key utilities (telecommunication, electricity and petroleum). The proposed third
series will not only continue focusing on reducing factor costs (electricity and transport) and
improving the competitiveness of the cotton sector, but also will support the Government's
efforts to enhance the overall business climate and exports diversification. This series will also
continue to support Government's measures to fbrther improve access to social services through
greater decentralization and institutional strengthening and enhance the efficiency and
accountability o f PFM. This will respond to requests from the BurkinabC public for improved
quality o f public services and more transparency in the use o f public resources, as well as from
donors inneed o f fiduciary standards to unblock untiedbudget support.

DevelopmentObjectives

103.    The development objectives o f the new PRSC series are to support the acceleration o f
real growth andthe reductiono f the incidence o fpoverty inBurkina Faso by:

     (9       improvingthe investment climate and promotingexports through measures to
              improve infrastructures provision at a lower costs (electricity and transports), to
              restore the financial viability and enhance the competitiveness o f the cotton sector,
              to improve the business climate (simplify and reduce the cost o f investment
              procedures and regulations, enhance the security o f land tenure, adopt and
              implementanexport promotion strategy).

     (ii)     improving access to basic social services by deepening decentralization and
              strengtheninginstitutional capacity; and

     (iii)    promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public
              resourcesby strengthening the link between resource allocation and the objectives
              o f growth and poverty reduction, pursuingprocurement reforms and strengthening
              the capacity o f audit institutions for public financial management.

Resultframework

104.    The Government development objectives to which the operation will contribute and the
outcome indicators that will be used to assess progress are presented in Annex 4. Outcome
indicators to the extent possible are directlytaken from the CGAB matrix (Annex 3) or from the
latest three-year Priority Action Program.        Discrepancies between the two matrices indicate
inconsistencies between the preparation calendar o f this operation and the multi-donor review
process (see lessons learned), a problem which i s expected to be increasingly addressed infbture
operations.

105.    The proposed PRSC-7 would provide the incentive to implement key economic, social
and institutionalreforms aimed at strengthening the overall performance o f the economy, address
key economic vulnerabilities, and contribute to poverty reduction. Over the period 2007-2009
and through this series o f three annual PRSCs, the reform program is expected to help the
Government achieve its objective o f a visible reduction in poverty incidence by improving the
investment climate and implementing an export-led growth strategy.           It would also support
progress towards the MDGs, namely, increase school enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child



                                                  - 28 -

and maternal mortality, increase access to safe water, and strengthen the sustainability o f
development efforts through greater decentralization.

                                           POLICYAREAS

106.     This section discusses the rationale for the selection o f prior actions for PRSC-7 and
programtriggers for the subsequent operationinthis third series (PRSC-8). Triggers for PRSC-9
will be defined duringthe preparationo fPRSC-8.

Improvingthe InvestmentClimateand PromotingExports

107.     The PRSP targets an average growth rate o f 6 percent in the medium term in order to
significantly reduce poverty. Achieving this growth level in the medium term will require
measures to strengthen the country's competitiveness, diversify its economic base and expand
market penetration. Efforts to improve the contribution o f total factor productivity to Burkina's
economic growth, including through measures to shift the country's growth pattern from
extensive agricultural production to intensive will be particularly critical to ensure a more
sustainable growth path. This new PRSC series will continue to support critical actions in this
area, notably to improve the investment climate andpromote exports.

108.     The finding o f the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA, 2006) and o f the World Bank
Doing Business ranking (Report, 2007) conclude that the business climate is generally not
favorable to private sector development in Burkina, whatever the sub-sector. The most
significant issues highlighted in the report are: (i) insufficient provision and high infiastructure
costs (electricity and transport) - given that Burkina Faso i s a land-locked country, the reduction
of transport costs and increased mobility o f people and goods through a well-maintained road
network and strengthened sector institutional capacity is o f critical importance for growth and
development; (ii)   regulatory barriers (tax rate, judicial system, regulatory burden which on
average consumes 10 percent o fthe time o f enterprise owners), (iii)   dysfunctional factor markets
(formal labor market, security o f land tenure); and (iv) corruption (formal firms must allocate 6
to 10percent o ftheir annual income to informal payments).

109.     With respect to infrastructure constraints, energy costs have been identified as a long
standingkeyproblem for economic diversification andcompetitiveness improvement inBurkina.
The problem was recently highlighted by the Investment Climate Assessment where
manufacturing firm reported losing almost 5 percent o f their annual income owing to electricity
supply problems. The country faces three main challenges in the energy sector: (i)        addressing
production capacity constraints to meet increasing demand for electricity; (ii)improving the
efficiency and equity o f electricity operations by reforming tariff and subsidy policy ina context
o f high supply costs; and (iii)expanding access to energy for rural and semi-urban populations.
Through the on-going Power Sector Development Project (PSDP) the Government is
demonstrating its commitment to least-cost options, mainly the interconnection with neighboring
countries with the scheduled construction o f the Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougoutransmission
lines. Also, the Government implemented through the PSDP two step tariff adjustments, with a
first step 10percent increase inthe average electricity tariff inNovember 2004 and a second step
with a 12.5 percent increase in September 2006. The current tariff and fuel subsidy policies are
still not equitable and sustainable as they benefit the wealthiest consumers and their costs



                                                - 29 -

increase in proportion to the growth in electricity consumption. The full interconnection of the
electricity grid with CBte d'Ivoire by 2008 will lead to considerable cost savings that are
expected to eliminate gradually subsidies.

110.    Beyond excessive factor costs, Burkina Faso ranks poorly in the Doing Business
indicators with regard to regulatory barriers (168 and 164 out o f 175 countries, respectively, in
dealing with licenses and registeringproperty). It takes almost a year and it i s very costly to get
a construction permit in Burkina (1,247% o f the per-capita income).          The high employment
index (153) also highlightsthe difficulty faced by private firms inhiringworkers, a finding also
confirmed by the ICA.       The I C A also identified as unfavorable factors uncertainty in the
regulatory environment, a weak judicial system, corruption, and relatively hightax rates coupled
withpoor accessto credit.

111. The Governmenthas been implementinga wide range o f reforms that will contribute to
address these issues, including the implementation o f a judicial sector reform program, the
preparation o f an anticorruption strategy and the adoption o f a new tax regulation code. Also,
since July 2006 the Government has started implementing a Switzerland-fundedprogram entitled
"Doing Business Better in Burkina".     This program covers 5 out o f the 10 Doing business core
indicators including: (i)business registration; (ii)labor market regulation; (iii)contracts
enforcement; (iv) dealing with licenses; and (v) closing a business. Recent progress in the
implementation o f this program includes an ongoing initiative aimed at establishing one-stop
shops for the issuance o f buildingpermits and for property transfers. In addition, following a
February 2005 workshop organized with the support o f IDA, the Government created the one-
stop shop for enterprise creation (CEFORE, Centre de Formalitk des Entreprises), which i s
contributing to improve business registration.       2,582 new enterprises were created in 2006
following the facilitation o fbusiness registration.

112.    At the annual consultation with the private sector held in July 2006 entrepreneurs
expressed concerns about landtitling and its impact on access to credit. Improvinglandtenure in
Burkina is also critical for reducing poverty since most of the poor live in rural areas and are
occupied with agricultural activities. Incertafn agricultural areas, access to landand control o f its
resources are often a source o f conflicts between users (in particular between stockbreeders and
farmers). In addition, the absence o f land tenure security in the agricultural sector prevents
agricultural investments. IDA has been supporting the preparation o f a national strategy for
securing land tenure in rural areas in Burkina. A first draft of the document was completed in
2004 with the assistance o f an international law firm. An extensive consultation process o f the
draft i s in progress. The revised document that will come out o f the consultative process i s
expected to be adopted by the Government by July 2007 and the related law shouldbe approved
by the end o f the year. Burkina has already initiated pilot rural land tenure reforms in the
framework o f a program financed by IDA (PNGT) and other programs.

113.    Another area o f focus for the proposed PRSC series andthe PRSC 7 is export promotion,
specifically the needto increase and diversify Burkina's exports revenues for andbeyond cotton.
The cotton share in total exports revenues increased from 48 percent to 60 percent over the last
decade. As a result, Burkina Faso's exports are little diversified and stagnated at 9 percent o f the
GDP over the last ten years. Factors that led to such a poor performance include: (i)          poor
infrastructure and high cost o f public services and utilities (transportation,             energy,


                                                - 30 -

telecommunication and water) which have been discussed above; (ii) inadequate policy and
                                                                          an
institutional framework for export promotion (trade policy, export promotion institutions); (iii)
poor services for supporting production and trade (market information, advisory services,
finance); and (iv) weak producer/professional associations. The prospects for improving exports
in Burkina Faso will also depend on: (i)sustaining ongoing reforms in the cotton sector to
improve the financial viability o f the cotton companies as well as improve on-farm productivity,
ginning efficiency and product quality; (ii)    encouraging diversification to other agricultural
crops; and(iii) increasing foreign direct investment inmining(gold production).

114.    Export promotion policies followed by the Government to date focused mainly on the
organization o f trade events inside and outside o f Burkina Faso (Salon International de
1'Artisanat de Ouagadougou (SIAO), National Week o f Culture and International Fairs, Days o f
Burkina, etc). The results o f these governmental policies have been modest so far. Recently,
attention was paid to infrastructure investments like the Bobo Fruits Terminal and initiatives
were launched for the development o f norms and standards for several products (French bean,
mango, dried mango, shea almonds, shea butter, cashew nut, cashew nut almonds, sesame, and
cowpea). But the standardization efforts are still at an early stage.

115.    Withrespect to the cotton sector, as indicated inBox 1andAnnex 5, three sets o f actions
are currently being implemented by sector operators: (1) all three cotton companies have
announced their recapitalization plans; (2) the domestic producer price setting mechanism is
being reformed to more closely align the producer price with the international cotton price; and
(3) efforts continue to improve the productivity o f cotton production. On the latter issue, yields
have remained stable at about 1 ton o f seed cotton per hectare. While technical analyses show
that Burkina Faso continues to benefit from a significant competitive advantage in the cotton
sub-sector, production costs, excluding the purchase price from farmers, remain high compared
to those in other countries inthe sub-region (for example, variable costs inBurkina Faso are 40
percent higher than in C8te d'lvoire, in part reflecting higher electricity costs). InMarch 2007,
the Government launched a study on the long term sustainability o f the cotton sector including
considerations on the adoption o f transgenic (Bt) cotton. The findings and recommendations o f
the study will help the Government and donors involved inthe sector design relevant policies to
address the long term sustainability o f cotton production in Burkina. It should be noted in this
respect that Burkina i s the only country in West and Central Africa that has been testing and
developing local varieties o f Bt cotton. Initial results point to a productivity gain o f 19 to 30
percent and a reduction inpesticide use, from an average o f six applications to two. Nationwide
introduction o f transgenic cotton is envisaged by 2011/2012. The Government is also playing a
leading role within the sub region in developing an appropriate biosecurity regulatory
framework.

116.    Mining is an important source o f export diversification for Burkina Faso. Indeed, with
the support of IDA'SMining Sector Capacity Buildingand Environmental Management Project
(1998-2004), Burkina Faso i s about to move from a one-commodity economy (cotton) to a two-
commodity economy inthe near future with gold exports becoming the second source o f export
earnings. However, three challenges are facing the Government with the proliferation o f mining
sites. First, the Ministry o f Mining does not have the capacity to monitor the industrial mining
companies. Second, there i s a need to equip local artisanal miningsites with modern production
equipment in order to improve the recuperationrate from 30-40 percent to 75-90 percent. More


                                               - 31 -

critically, the minerals extracted will have to be traced and taxed effectively to benefit the state
budgetwithout discouraging privateinvestors.

117.     More broadly, and in order to establish an adequate policy and institutional framework
for export promotion, the Government has started the elaboration o f an export promotion
strategy. A DTIS report i s currently beingprepared by IDA to identify critical elements o f such
strategy.    The Government plans to adopt an action plan for the implementation o f such
framework based on the recommendations o fthe DTIS (expected to be finalized by June 2007).

118.     Focus of the proposed PRSC and follow-on operations. The proposed PRSC-7
supports improvements in the investment climate through a prior action to simplify land
registrationprocedures and reduce the cost o f transferring land. PRSC-7 also includes as a prior
action continuation o f the pilot land tenure security program in targeted provinces as evidenced
by the registration o f at least 3500 land properties in 2006 and by promoting broad regional
consultations on the strategy for land tenure in rural areas. While the PRSC-7 was expected to
support the adoption and implementation o f an export promotion strategy, its adoption was
delayed because o f the late delivery of the DTIS (which isjust being finalized). The strategy i s
now expected to be adopted bythe Government at the endof 2007. PRSP 7 however includes as
a prior action one o f the key recommendations of the DTIS, namely the adoption o f a transitory
mechanism to reimburse VAT arrears to exporting enterprises. The accumulation o f such arrears
was identifiedby the DTIS as an important impedimentto the financial viability and growth o f
surveyed exporting companies. A more perennial mechanism i s expected to be adopted together
with the export promotion strategy. Macroeconomic stability is considered a pre-requisite for
growth and poverty reduction and the adequacy o f the macroeconomic framework is a pre-
requisite for PRSC 7 as well as the other PRSCsinthe new series.

119.     With respect to PRSC 8, it will continue to support improvements in the investment
climate and export diversification through measures to improve the financial viability and
competitiveness o fthe cotton sector, improve infrastructure provision (electricity) and streamline
business regulations.    On cotton, PRSC 8 includes two triggers: (i)the producer pricing
mechanism i s hrther revised to be better aligned with the international market price and
SOFITEX has started to reduce its operating costs in2007, has adopted and startedimplementing
a restructuring plan aimed at hrther reducing its operating costs by no less than 10 percent in
2008; and (ii)  independent financial and operational audits o f SOFITEX for 2004-2007 have
been launched and the Government has adopted a strategy and calendar for enhanced private
sector participation in SOFITEX's equity.

120.     The first measure will ensure better alignment o f the producer price mechanism with
world price changes and help all cotton companies break even, thus reducing Government's
contingent liabilities from the sector. With the implementation o f SOFITEX's plan to reduce
operating costs, the sector's competitiveness andlikelihood to break even, even duringperiods o f
low world prices, will be strengthened. The second trigger represents an important milestone in
the process o f enhancing SOFITEX's medium-term productivity and attracting private sector
participation in the sector. Thus, the independent financial and operational audit o f SOFITEX
will help build-up a more solid accounting base for 2007 (with fewer audit qualifications) and
inform the Government's strategy to bringinprivate investors. The preparation and adoption o f
a strategy to restore Government's minority involvement inthe sector and to transfer shares back


                                               - 32 -

to the private sector as soon as private investors can be found is expected to be undertaken before
the next PRSC. While cotton-related triggers for PRSC-9 would be defined during preparation
o f PRSC-8, it i s anticipated that they would support the completion o f audits with fewer audit
qualifications on the accounts covering more recent activities and would support the
implementation o f the Government strategy to reduce its stake in SOFITEX and enhance private
sector participation in the sector. Sound and arms-length management o f the cotton company
will help its corporate performanceover time.

121.     On mining, PRSC-8 and 9 will support progress inthe management o f natural resources
through the EITI process, including the completion o f the initiation phase before the next
operation is disbursed. The initiation phase o f EITI seeks to reach a broad-based consensus with
stakeholders (industrials and civil society) on the objectives, organization and planning o f the
process for implementation o f the Initiative. The Government will put inplace the coordinating
administrative structures, but key decisions and costs are not going to be engaged at this stage.
Over time, accrued transparency in the use o f miningproceeds and enhanced confidence on the
part o f foreign investors will contribute to more sustainable growth in the sector and provide
enhanced fiscal returns from miningactivities.

122.     On electricity, PRSC-8 and 9 will support the strengthening o f the legal and regulatory
framework to provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities o f sector institutions and set a
transparent electricity tariff setting mechanism. Specifically, PRSC-8 will support the first step
o f this process by including as trigger the submission to Parliament o f an electricity bill to revise
the regulatory law on electricity generation, transmission and distribution. PRSC9 could support
the establishment o f a Regulatory Authority for electricity. With respect to business regulations,
PRSC 8 will also include as triggers the adoption o f a perennial legislation for land titling
issuance and the establishment o f one-stop shop for land titling and a one-stop shop for
construction permits, as well as the adoption o f implementation texts for the labor code to
enhance the flexibility in the hours and schedules worked and to remove the limitation in the
renewal o f term contracts in some sectors, including mining. PRSC9 could support a revision o f
the labor code itself to hrther enhance labor market flexibility and encourage a shift o f
employment from the informal toward the formal sector.

123.     The above measures will be complemented by support provided by IDA under the
recently approved (May 2006) Agricultural Diversification and Market Development project to
support diversification inthe agriculture sector. The project will'focus on :(i) supportingprivate
sector organizations and commodity associations by strengthening their ability to plan and
implement a sound strategy for development o f market-driven agricultural supply chains; (ii)
developing productive and marketinginfrastructure to improve productivity, agricultural product
quality and linkages with markets; and (iii)     improving the provision and efficiency o f core
support services, including the promotion o f a more conducive institutional, regulatory and
financial environment for private investment. The project, together with an AFD (Agence
Franpise de Developpement) hnded project, will also support productivity improvements for
cotton production.

Improving access to basic social services through deepened decentralization and
strengthened institutional capacity

124.    Human development contributes to sustainable growth. Increasing popularparticipation
to the growth process, based on strengthening the development o f human resources, will in turn
enhance the said growth process. Literacy, health and environmental protection are key to
participation in civil life through economic and social activities. Similarly, a more intensive
growth process fueled by factor productivity and sector competitiveness requires building a
strong human resource base, which is gender-neutral. The emphasis in Burkina Faso is put on
service delivery to communities (through decentralization) in primary and secondary education
and on vocational training, through a more efficient use o f facilities and teachers. Concerning
health, Government policies that encourage broader geographical coverage and increased
financing for primary health care also contribute to growth.                           Efforts to prevent death from
diarrhea or to reduce the burden o f diseases such as ascaris, dracunculiasis, hookworm,
schistosomiasis and trachoma, will be unsuccessful unless people have access to safe drinking
water andbasic sanitation.

125.     The choice o f decentralization as a pillar of reforms to be supported in this new series
reflects recent developments. The first o f these is that the former decentralization strategy which
was based on decentralizing service delivery while retaining centralized management o f
budgetary choices (deconcentration), has clearly reached its limits'. Inaddition, Burkina Faso
recently took a significant step in the implementation of decentralization following the local
elections held in April 2006.             The challenge for the Government is to ensure a successful
transition inthe transfer o f responsibilities and resources to the newly created communities with
elected leadership. The new PRSC series addressesthis challenge by supporting the Government
inthe implementationofthe decentralization strategy.

126.       InBurkina Faso, although many ministries have decentralized services that contribute
to the implementation o f public policies, resource allocation remains strongly centralized. The
majority o f decentralized services lack effective self management. Untilnow, the budget as well
as personnel management functions were always elaborated and executed at the central level and
local Governments had little discretionary budgetary resources.

127.       Currently, branch offices of the line ministries have no budget autonomy, with the
exception of regional directorates of a few Ministries, such as health and education, both o f
which only control a very small number o f poorly-funded expenditure categories. The survey
carried out in 2002 on the share of budget expenditures received by regional services revealed
that they were not very aware o ftheir entitlement since they receivedonly resources inkind.

128.       Personnel management i s weak and over-centralized. Hiring, career development and
retirements are controlled by the Ministry o f Civil Service.                            Appointment to management
positions and posting are decided by the line ministry's central administration. Promotions are
still based on seniority; performance and advancement based on merit have not been
implementedyet. HumanResources Directorates inthe line ministriesconstitute little more than
a mail drop betweenthe central technical directorates andthe sub-national levels.

'The  ESW issued inDec. 2002, Improving service delivery at the local level, highlights the shortcomings and the poor
performance o f the centralized management system and proposes a decentralized approach.


                                                          - 34 -

129.       This system has failed to provide basic services to the vast majority o f the population.
Social indicators in all the sectors, while improving, are still among the lowest in the world as
evidenced by low level o f school attainments and poor quality o f the education system,
ineffective health system with high infant and maternal mortality rates, limited coverage o f safe
drinkingwater and sanitation, etc.

130.       Against this backdrop, achievements under the Community-Based Rural Development
project suggest that when empowered, the communities are able to manage successfblly their
own affairs. The living conditions have dramatically improved in the regions which benefited
from this project. Interestingly, the decentralizationstrategy builds on this experience.

131.    With the 2006 municipal elections, Burkina Faso has entered a new phase in the
implementation o f its decentralization strategy. Now, the challenge for the Government is to
succeed in the transfer o f responsibilities and resources to local Governments.                The
Decentralization Law (Code Gknkral des Collectivitks Territoriales au Burkina Faso) highlights
six priorityresponsibilitiesto be transferred to urbancommunes bythe end o f 2005 including: (i)
pre-school; (ii) education; (iii) health care; (iv) culture; (v) youth; and (vi) sport
                primary                  primary
and leisure.      It also includes the principle that responsibilities must be transferred
commensurately with resources.         Yet, the "Code"      gives little guidance on the actual
implementation o f these transfers, and 'implementation decrees" that should provide
clarifications on these issues have not all been issued yet.

132.    Progress made in2006 confirmed the commitment of the BurkinabC authorities to pursue
decentralization.   The adoption o f a strategy for accelerating decentralization includes four
strategic objectives: (i) improving ownership o f decentralization implementation by actors; (ii)
transferring responsibilities and resources to local Government; (iii)    developing capacities o f
local Governments; and (iv) improving coordination o f the process. It has been very helpful for
assisting the installation o f newly appointed local Governments and starting the transfer o f
responsibilities andresources. However, some acceleration o f the process seems now necessary
inorder to hlly empower the newly appointed local Governments. The most urgentmeasure to
take would be to transfer the assets corresponding to the six areas o f responsibilities transferred
at the local level, by adopting the remaining texts related to individual asset transfers to
municipalities. In the medium term, the ongoing ESW on decentralization will help update the
priority action planfor implementationo fthe decentralization law adopted inJune 2006.

133.    The institutional environment inwater and sanitation requires some reforms and capacity
development to enable a productive scale-up o f investment programs. The Direction Gknnkrale
des Ressources en Eau (DGRE), which i s responsible for rural water supply, would need to
improve its budget planning, execution and reporting, to leverage donors' coordination and
accelerate investments and rehabilitation program. The DGREmust also take action to prevent
current and fbture infrastructure to fall into disrepair, as a result o f poor management and
insufficient cost-recovery: currently 34 percent o f the 400 small water supply systems are broken
down due to poor management in the absence o f a cost recovery policy. As per sanitation, the
challenge i s even bigger than for water supply. The capacity o f the sector would have to be
multiplied by 6 to reach the relevant MDG, i.e. providing 61 percent o f the population with
improved sanitation facilities by 2015.

134.    Focus of the proposed PRSC and follow-on operations. PRSC-7 supports the effective
transfer o f responsibilities and resources to municipalities and regions. City Contracts will also
be preparedwith 6 maincities, including the two largest cities inthe country, Ouagadougou and
Bobo Dioulasso, and four other provincial cities that lack basic infrastructure. This operation
also supports the effective implementation o f the activities from the roadmap established by the
Government to reach the water and sanitation MDGs, including adequate funding for the General
Directorate o f Water and Sanitation (DGEAP) and for the expansion o f the urban water public
utility's (ONEA) hygiene and sanitation promotion program to four new towns. ONEA, the
national water supply and sanitation utility, i s considered as one o f the best performers in Sub-
Saharan Africa and benefits from strong programmatic donor support.

135.    Future PRSCs will continue to support the implementation o f the updated action plan for
decentralization.    Triggers for the proposed PRSC-8 support the continued transfer o f
responsibilities and resources to the 49 urban municipalities with a focus on schools, teachers,
health facilities and human resource planning, training and management functions. The PRSC
series will also support in coordination with other donors the implementation o f the Water and
Sanitation National Program and will strengthen the Sector Wide Approach designed by the
Government in 2005 to provide more equitable and sustainable access to potable water and
sanitation services, especially for the poor. More specifically, PRSC-8 will support reforms
aiming at: i)improving the sustainability o f water points, inparticular by managing small town
water supply systems through the development o f contracts between 25 rural communes and
professional operator; and ii)continuing support to the implementation o f ONEA's hygiene and
sanitation promotion campaign in four secondary cities (Fada N'Gourma, Ouahigouya, Banfora
andKoudougou) as developed inthe sanitation strategic plan.

136.    With respect to budget decentralization, PRSC-8 will support the deconcentration o f the
main directorates o f the Ministry o f Finance and Budget involved in the decentralization,
namely, the head office for budget (Direction Gknkrale du Budget-DGB), the head office for ex
ante control (Direction Centrale Du ContrGle Financier-DCCF), the head office o f public
accounting (Direction Gknkrale du Trksor et de la Comptabilitk Publique-DGTCP) and the tax
head office (Direction Gknkrale des ImpGts). All have started implementing an action plan for
their branch offices to help the municipalities prepare and execute their budgets. Altogether,
these services need about 1,200 additional staff and FCFA 16 billionininvestments to be able to
provide adequate assistance to the communities. The activities inthe action plans are planned to
be implemented till 2012, but the bulk o f the actions i s expected to be carried out by the end o f
2008. The budget required for these two years i s about FCFA13.5 billion out of the total
FCFAl6 billion. Finally, PRSC-8 will support the introduction in22 urban municipalities o f the
accounting module o f CICL (Comptabilitk Intkgrke des Collectivitks Locales) Software
specifically designed to facilitate the production o f financial accounts by municipalities, which
the Treasury (DGTCP) has been implementingsince 2003, with the support o f Switzerland. The
Government will also adopt a calendar for the development and the deployment o f CICL's
administrative management module.

Promotingefficiency,transparencyand accountabilityinthe use of publicresources
throughenhancedpublicfinancialmanagement

137.     The continued focus on public financial management will contribute to further improving
transparency, accountability and efficiency in budget processes by consolidating the ongoing
procurement reform, strengthening audit institutions, enabling decentralized structures to
generate resources commensurate with their mandate and enhance medium-tern planning
visibility for sectoral program budgets.

138.     Burkina Faso's Public Financial Management system has considerably improved over the
past ten years: (i)successful implementation o f budget management Software (CID, CIE,
SIGASPE,       SIGADE);     (ii)a solid budget legislation complying with the WAEMU
recommendations (Directives); (iii)     successful implementationo f budgetplanning anddiagnostic
tools (MTEF, PER); (iv) increasing decentralization o f budget execution; (v) improvement in
budget classificationwith the successful implementationo f functional classification with poverty
markers. However, despite these commendable efforts, recurrent and very sensitive issues
undermine the overall credibility o fthe system. Most important weaknesses or issues include: (i)
the low level o f tax revenue that has been a long standing concern and constitutes today a
challenge for a sustainable development o f Burkina; (ii)           insufficient transparency o f the public
financial management system andweaknesses inthe control o fpublic financial management (the
2005 CPAR concluded that the multiplicity o f public finance control institutions in Burkina led
to a lack o f clarity in their respective role and a fragmentation o f their budget, equipment and
staff); (iii) lack o f a national anticomption strategy; (iv) increased fiduciary risks as the
             the
decentralization reform amplifies the institutional weakness o fpublic finance control institutions.
The preliminaryfindings o f the PEFA8exercise confirmed this diagnosis.

139.       Decentralizedfinancial management inparticular i s plaguedby: (i)             limitedline ministry
responsibility for budget decision, since wages are controlled and paid by the Ministry o f
Finance andBudget, andmost sub-national expenditures are financed by external aid; (ii)                  limited
responsibility given to branch offices even for those items which the ministry does control; and
(iii) planningandmonitoring, inspite ofattemptsto create program-budgets. The
      limited
central financial control system (the only one in operation) is limited and not always efficient.
Burkina Faso has a tradition o f ex ante control, based on budget legislation. Internal auditing
bodies are used on an ad-hoc basis, usually when there i s suspicion o f malfeasance (sometimes
triggered by specific accusations), and the outcomes o f such audits are kept at the level o f their
reporting authority. Reports are not made public, making it difficult to ascertain what impact
they may have.

140.       The setting up o f the independent Audit Court (Cour des Comptes) established the
conditions for an independent evaluation o f budget execution, but the annual budget o f the Audit
Court remains low for its mandate.          In addition, the ability of the Audit Court to issue a
certificate o f conformity rests on the possibility to compare the accounts held by the budget
administrator (budget execution report or comptes administratif) with those held by the public
accountants (accounting statements or comptes de gestion). While there has been progress inthe

production o f the accounting statements o f the three principal public accountants, more remains
to be done, specifically for noncommercial public entities.      There are also weaknesses in the
filing system that do not facilitate the work o f oversight institutions. With the ongoing
decentralization, the Cour des Comptes needs to build its own capacity to assess local
governments' accounts.

141.     Inthe areaofpublic procurement, progress hasbeenmadethat shouldbepursued. The
2005 CPAR assessed the performance o f the national procurement system against the 12
benchmark indicators proposed by the working group composed o f OECD/DAC and the World
Bank at a score o f 31 percent in 2000, prior to the implementation o f the first series of PRSCs,
and again at 55 percent in 2005.           While encouraging, this score remains far below the
international standards and norms of at least 75 percent. Should all the recommendations o f the
2005 CPAR be implemented, it i s expected that the score o f the procurement system inBurkina
Faso would reach 76 percent by 2010.

142.     One o f the most important weaknesses highlighted by the 2005 CPAR was the lack o f a
high authority for procurement regulation and the lack of a training strategy for procurement
specialists. In2006, a draft decree was preparedto further strengthen the institutional framework
for procurement, proposing the creation o f an Authority o f Public Procurement Regulation
(ARMP) and o f a General Directorate of Public Procurement (DGMP), a process which was
supported byPRSC-6.

143.     Among the weaknessesidentified by the 2005 CPAR that remainto be addressedare:

  a. with respect to the legal and regulatory framework: (i)       lack o f specific regulations for
       subcontracting (Muitrise d 'ouvruge ddkguk); (ii)  non-conformity o f the national regulatory
       and institutional framework with the WAEMU directives; and (iii)        unsystematic use o f
       procurement standarddocuments by contract agencies.

  b. with respect to the institutional framework and capacity development: (i)non inclusion o f
       procurement as an integral part o f the budget preparation process; (ii)incompatible role o f
       DCMP as regulator o f the procurement system and execution agency; and (iii)        lack of a
       training strategy on procurement issues.

  C.   with respect to the integrity o f the procurement system: (i) o f a code o f ethics both for
                                                                   lack
       the public andthe private sectors; (ii) o f transparency assessmentand publications
                                                absence
       o f frauds and sanctions; and (iii)   absence of a specific and a clear judicial regime for
       sanctions.

144.     Focus of the proposed PRSC and follow-on operations.                PRSC-7 supports the
implementation o f a functional budget classification with a marker for poverty-spending to
facilitate tracking o f such spending. Since 2000, priority expenditures are identified by adding
the expenditure based on the administrative nomenclature o f the budget and the expenditure
carried out in the framework o f the special HIPC account (virtual fbnd for poverty reduction).
Data on this expenditure are readily available. In2006, the Government successfully customized
functional andsocial classifications inthe budget management software (CID) to track fbnctional
expenditures andpoverty spending.



                                                 - 38 -

145.    PRSC-7 also supports the adoption o f a decree which creates a regulatory agency for
public procurement (ARMP) and the revision of the attribution, composition and functioning o f
the General Directorate for Public Procurement (DGMP) to further improve the procurement
regulatory framework. ARMP would be operational by 2008 and would manage the monitoring
and evaluation systems. A list o f performance indicators will be prepared by the Government
and CNCS with the support o f the African DevelopmentBank and the World Bank during the
mid-termreview o f the implementation o f the CPAR Action Plan, currently scheduled for June
2008. The objective o f the procurement reform i s to improve governance, efficiency inspending
and growth.

146.    Strengthening the Cour des Comptes is a key PRSC-7 measure.               There are several
additional initiatives that support the capacity development o f audit institutions inBurkina Faso
including an AfDB project (Support to public expenditure programming and control institutions,
July 2006) and a World Bank IDF (Strengthening the professional accounting staff o f the public
sector control institutions).  The Government has adopted a national strategy for combating
corruption and a sector strategy for strengthening public finance.         Both strategies include
relevant measuresthat will help improve budget control inBurkina Faso.

147.    Key PFM reforms to be implemented in future series o f PRSCs would include: (i)
continuing to support the strategic allocation o f resources by settingup administrative structures
in charge of developing program- budgets in two pilot ministries (Infrastructure                 and
Environment) to improve predictability in budget allocation (including for road maintenance),
enhance effectiveness inpublic spending and strengthen the ministries' institutional capacity; (ii)
further strengthening external controls by securing the independence o f the Independent Audit
Court, allowing the review o f small communes' records and accounts by a Regional Accountant
(Trksorier) and the execution o f its budget through related arrangements similar to those o f the
FASO Ombudsman or the High Council for Communication; and (iii)            progressing further with
the procurement reform through improved monitoring and evaluation o f procurement systems,
andthe effective deployment o fprocurement units inat least 2 pilot ministries andin2 regions.

                           PRIORACTIONS FOR THE PROPOSEDPRSC-7

148.    PRSC-7 would support selected reforms in the Government's program described in
Section VI and inits Letter o fDevelopment Policy (LDP) (Annex 1) that are deemed essential to
its successful implementation.     The rationale for their selection has been discussed in the
previous section. This list is consistent with the triggers defined at the end o f the preparation o f
PRSC-6 and is aligned with the Government's overall Priority Actions Plan (PAP) and included
in the joint performance matrix o f the budget support group (Annex 3 - the so-called CGAB
performance matrix). Compliance with these prior actions as defined in the English version o f
the Financial Agreement forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the proposed operation.

149.    The prior actions for PRSC-7 are derived from triggers that were identified during the
preparation o f PRSC-6. There have been only a few limited adjustments to take into account
exogenous factors not under the control o f the Government. The implementation o f the action
plan drawn from DTIS was not feasible as this trade study just got released at the time the
proposed operation was being finalized. A couple o fprior actions were missing a baseline inthe
PRSC-6 document and needed to be better qualified to become monitorable. This is the case for

the implementationo fthe pilot landtenure (to which a component on consultations was added to
better reflect the reality o f the process). This is also the case for the transfer o f responsibilities
and resources to local Governments, or for the implementation o f the CPAR action plan, or for
the capacity development o f audit institutions. With the exception o f the trigger on the DTIS
action plan, none o fthe below triggers was substantially modified.

                          Box 3. Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership

This PRSC is embedded in the General Framework for Budget Support (Cadre General d'organisation des
Appuis Budgetaires CGAB), an organizational framework for coordinating andharmonizing budget support and
                      -
its process between the Government o f Burkina Faso and donors engaged in providing budget support. The
CGAB in its current form has been established in February 2005. It focuses on (i)           ownership of the reform
process; (ii)alignment with the country's PRSP; (iii)     predictability o f budget support; (iv) and a result-based
approach which i s coordinated and agreedupon with the Government andthe donors o f budgetsupport.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the Governmentand otherfinancialpartnerson a coordinatedaccountability
framework

The group o f donors organized in the CGAB support reforms as outlined in Burkina's PRSP and which are
updated and M e r specified in the annually revised Priority Action Plan (PAP). The PAP combines planned
policy objectives and actions with a medium resource planning framework (MTEF) and a monitoring framework.
Following the PAP'Sobjectives and monitoring framework, the CGAB donors develop ajoint performance matrix
which i s the principal tool for coordination and evaluation o f budget support. This procedure allows for
accountability along shared objectives and performance indicators. The close coordination and harmonization
among donors and with the Government's reform policy program permits also improved predictability o f budget
resources.

Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank supportto country circumstances

IDA'Ssupport through PRSCs is since 2005 part ofthe CGAB framework inresponseto Government demands to
align donor support inorder to lower transaction cost for the Government and to harmonize the policy dialogue
along with the other donors around the PRSP and its priorities, as well as the accountability framework for budget
support. Identification, pre-appraisal and appraisal i s completely aligned with the CGAB calendar whch offers 3
principal sessions with the Government to assess policy outcomes (endo f April, jointly with an assessmento f the
Annual Progress Report o f the Country's PRSP implementation), to identify policy measures and possible
conditions for budget support (September) and to conduct a midterm review (February).             Only reforms truly
owned by the Government, however sensitive, have been retained inthe program.

Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement

The Bank's policy matrix uses a limited set of conditions (10 intotal for PRSC 7), which function as triggers
(prior actions) for disbursement. The chosenpolicy measureswere identifiedjointly with the Government as well
as the other CGAB donors to ensure a critical contribution to the Government's reformprogramand to coordinate
with conditions emphasized by other CGAB donors. Conditionality is focused only on critical operational steps
which would move the Government's reform agenda further. 13 triggers have been identified for PRSC-8 in
partnership with the Government. The CGAB matrix (Annex 3) provides further program benchmarks, some o f
which can be used as conditionality by other donors. The conditionality i s also typically coordinated with the
programthe Government discusseswith the IMF.

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive topredictable andperformance-based financial
support

The CGAB monitors and evaluates permanently progress made with regard to policy implementation and
conducts the above described three mandatory annual review sessions. These three sessions are chaired by the
Minister o f Finance, supported by a secretariat made up o f a representative o f the administration and two
representatives o f the donors. The three sessions are open to interested parties, and the principal results as well as
a summary of the discussions are documented and publicly available. The Government incorporates feedback
from such CGAB meetings into its own reporting, including for the Annual PRSP Progress Report.

                           IX. PRSC-7IMPLEMENTATION

                                      PARTICIPATION PROCESS

150.    The design o f this new PRSC series and more particularly o f the first one o f this three
proposed operation (PRSC-7) benefited from a broad stakeholders consultations. The
Government led several meetings in which experts from central and line Ministries and top
officials, including Ministers,       consulted local Governments        officials, private sector
representatives, and civil society organizations. Among those meetings, one can note:

             the annual meeting on the PRSP Annual Progress Report, which represents the last
             stage o f a consultation process involving Government experts, private sector and
             civil society representatives, working together in the six established sector and
             thematic commissions (Commissions Sectorielles et The`matiques- CST);

             the annual World Bank Group's strategy week in Burkina, the more recent having
             concluded on March 2, 2007. This event allowed further dissemination o f the CAS
             and o f recently completed ESW, and candid discussions o f the challenges that
             Burkina Faso faces, including for the investment climate, the implementation o f
             decentralization andthe future o f cottonproduction;

             intensive dissemination o f ESW (whether IDA- or partner- led) to improve
             appropriation of analytic findings by all actors involved. Several workshops took
             place, including on IDA'Slabor market and investment climate studies, on an EC
             diagnosis o f the independent audit institution (Cour des comptes), and on the
             Canada-led assessment o f monitoring and evaluation systems for the PRSP
             (PARSEP program); and

             a field visit to the local Government o f Koudougou (Center-West) with a focus on
             decentralization (implementation aspects, local actors' perspectives, progress to
             date, andremainingchallenges).

151.    The design o f the PRSCs 7-9 series in Burkina also benefited from several annual
meetings in which the Government consulted private sector representatives (Rencontre annuelle
Etat-Secteur prive? or civil society (Forum national de la socikte' civile) and farmers
organizations (Journe`es nationales dupaysan).

                                  POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

152.    The proposed PRSC-7 is expected to have a significant positive impact on poverty
reduction.  First, the improvement in the investment climate and the promotion of exports
supported by the proposed operation would accelerate growth. This includes improving access
to and security o f land titles in rural areas where most o f the poor live and thus i s expected to
have a substantial positive impact on access to credit.       Second, the strengthening o f public
financial management i s expected to enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in
public resource use. Such measures would also increase the country's absorption capacity for
external resources. Third, the reforms in public service provision through decentralization and


                                                - 44 -

institutional strengthening would improve access o f the poor to health, education, water and
sanitation services, support their greater participation in the growth process and sustain progress
towards the MDGs. However, as discussed below there is a risk that ifnot accompanied by the
provision o f sufficient resources and strengthened capacity for local Governments to carry out
their new responsibilities, the devolution ofbasic service deliverymayresult inreduced quality and
access to these services. To mitigate this, several donors support decentralizationefforts inBurkina,
includingthe ongoing IDA-financed Administration Capacity Buildingproject and the Community
Driven Development project, and the planned Urban Capacity Building project.             In addition,
ongoing IDA analytical work on decentralization ESW will also help the Government fine tune
the decentralization program, particularly with regard to service delivery for the poor.

153.     On cotton, aligning producer prices more closely with fluctuations in world prices (in
CFA terms) will likely affect poor households relying on this cash crop as a dominant source o f
earnings. A preliminary estimate o f the impact o f different cotton producer prices on poverty
among cotton producers in Burkina Faso is detailed in Annex 6. This shows that a 20 CFA
franckg reduction inthe producer price from FCFA 160per kg to FCFA 140 per kg would lead
to an increase in poverty o f about 3.5 percentage points among cotton producers. To help
mitigate the potential impact of reforms on small producers, by reducing risks and increasing
revenue for rural households, IDA i s implementingan agricultural project (PAFASP) to promote
diversification beyond cotton. PRSCs-8 and 9 are also supporting productivity gains in the
sector. The hture adoption o f Bt (genetically modified) cotton should allow a reduction ininput
factors (reduced use o f fertilizers by farmers), which would be partly offset by royalties paid to
the biogenic companyproducing Bt seeds. While a more detailed analysis o f the overall poverty
impact o f cotton reforms will be done in the context o f the upcoming CEM, it should be noted
that not reforming the sector would likely hamper its medium-term growth potential as a
sustainable cash crop for many poor households.

                            SUPERVISION,   MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                          &

154.    The Ministry o f Finance and Budget (MFB) will be responsible for overall
implementation o f the proposed PRSC-7. The Secretary o f the Permanent Secretariat for the
Monitoring o f Financial Programs and Policies (SP-PPF) inthe MFBwill leadthe Government's
technical team with representatives o f the Ministries o f Finance and Budget; Economy and
Development; Health; Labor and Employment, Social Protection, Basic Education and Literacy;
Secondary Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research; Environment and Living
Conditions; Agriculture, Water and Fisheries; Commerce, Enterprise Development, and
Artisanship; Energy and Mines; Decentralization; Public Administration and representatives o f
public enterprises.

155.    IDA'S supervision effort will be aligned with the Government-led monitoring and
evaluation system underpinning the PRSP-2, the Priority Action Plan, and the General
Framework for Budget Support (CGAB).              The specific benchmarks and outcomes to be
monitored underPRSC-7 (see Annex 4) are extracted from the Government overall development
program (Annex 3), thus providing significant benefits in reducing transaction costs for the
Government.They are included inthejoint performancematrix under the CGAB. IDA staff has
been working with the authorities and the other donors under the CGAB to ensure that
coordination o f the supervision efforts will increase predictability and aid alignment with the


                                                - 45 -

budget cycle. Inassessing the implementation of the PRSP-2, the CGAB will take into account
factors outside Government's control that may alter the underlyingassumptions for a successful
PRSP implementation. Such factors include declining terms o f trade, weather-related shocks, and
shortfalls inexternal assistanceand regional instability.

                                        FIDUCIARYASPECTS

156.    The 2001 CFAA andCPAR, andthe 2004 HIPC AAP, were key inputsinthe preparation
o fthe Government's budget management reformprogram (Programme de Rkforme de la Gestion
Budgktuire, PRGB). The Government i s also using the findings o f the recently completed 2005
CPAR to update the PRGB. The PRGB is supported by most donors providing budgetary
support, and i s a core element o f the MOU for budget support. Under PRSC-1 to PRSC-6, most
recommendations o f the CFAA and CPAR have been successfully implemented, including the
implementationof annual audit procedures recommended by the CFAA. PRSC-7 builds on the
achievements under the first PRSCs by supporting the further strengthening of internal and
external controls, and by including additional measures to enhance policy-based budgeting
provision of sizeable and diverse financial information and supporting the creation of a regulatory
agency for public procurementand strengthening o f the General Directorate for Public Procurement
(DGMP). In the context o f PRSC-7 preparation, the Bank has reviewed fiduciary arrangements.
Overall, the Bank has judged implementationperformance o f the PFM reform program to date and
Government'scommitmentto PFMimprovementsas satisfactory.

157.    The Central Bank o f the West African States (BCEAO) i s the common central bank o f
the West African countries, including Burkina Faso. In2005, IMF staff carried out an on-site
safeguards assessment o f the BCEAO and found that progress had been made in strengthening
the BCEAO's safeguard framework since 2002 when the last safeguard assessment was
undertaken. The BCEAO now publishes a fill set of audited financial statements, and
improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO has improved the explanatory
notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduledfor the next fiscal year, with a
view toward a graduate alignment with International Accounting Standard (IAS), as adopted
internationally by other central banks. Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in
place, mechanisms have been established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and
follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened. The external
auditor has apprised the Board o f Directors o f the BCEAO of the quality o f internal controls in
June 2003. IMF staff identified a number o f areas where firther steps would help solidify the
progress made in recent years. The main recommendations relate to: (i)    improving the external
audit process by adopting a formal rotation policy and further enhancing the transparency o f the
financial statements by adopting IFRS in full; and (ii) enhancing the effectiveness of the internal
audit function by further strengthening the reportingto management o fthe BCEAO.

158.    Bank financial management specialists reviewed the flow o f funds arrangement between
the Central Bank (BCEAO) and the Treasury (DGTCP), taking into account the findings o f an
annual audit o f the flow o f budgetary finds between the Central Bank and the Treasury funded
by the multi-donor Budget Support Group. The team concluded that current arrangements are
adequate, with fiduciary risks within acceptable risk tolerance levels. However, the team
recommended that the information systems o f these two institutions be linked, so as to minimize


                                               - 46 -

delays and discrepancies in flows reporting, thus eliminating cumbersome
reconciliations. The last audit report on the flows of funds, which was produced in 2005
and assessed the Central Bank's foreign exchange environment, revealed no major
weakness in the system.

                              DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                                               AND


159.    The operation would consist of a single tranche of US$90 million equivalent to be
available upon effectiveness and disbursed on the basis of a withdrawal applicationdf
the US$90 milllion, US$67.54 million will be provided on a want basis and the
remainder, US$22.46 million, on a credit basis on standard IDA terms. The proposed
operation will follow IDA'S disbursement procedures for development policy credits.
Once the credit becomes effective, the proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a
Government account at the Central Bank which forms part of the country's foreign
exchange reserves; as a due diligence measure, IDA will obtain confirmation from the
Government that the amount of the credit has been accounted for in the country's budget
management system (within 30 days of disbursement). Disbursement would not be linked
to specific purchases.     The proceeds of the Grant would not be used to finance
expenditures excluded under the Agreement. If, after being deposited in this account, the
proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing
Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount
to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to IDA. No dedicated account is
required.

                 ENVIRONMENTALNATURALRESOURCESASPECTS
                                    AND


160.    IDA has determined that the specific actions supported under the proposed PRSC-
7 are not expected to have a significant effect on Burkina's environment and natural
resources. The potential environmental effects stem from measures to revitalize the
cotton sector, transfer of responsibilities to municipalities and regions, implementation of
pilot land tenurial arrangements, as well as the measures to improve the investment
climate. The analysis reveals that these should not be extensive, nor will they be
irreversible. However, a more careful monitoring of the effects may be necessary in
some areas prior to the preparation of PRSC-8.

161.    Cotton Sector: The expansion of cotton at the proposed 4-6 percent p.a. could
have serious implications for cotton production, unless it comes about from increases in
yields instead of from increases in land area. Cotton expansion has been an important
source of deforestation in the country and the loss of some non-timber forest products,
notable honey production. Because of the nature of the land, cotton production exhausts
the soil after some years and so the land has to be left fallow to recover. Thus, the area
needed for a given level of production is higher than the land actually under cultivation.
There are also a number of negative impacts from the application of pesticides. To put it
in perspective, the land area under cotton in 2005 was 570,000 ha. If it were increased
by, say 5 percent a year over the next 10 years, it would add another 360,000 ha. The
current area under forest in Burkina Faso is about 7.1 million ha. If the whole of the

development o f send varieties that are more resistant to pests and to drought conditions. The
TerrAfrica program on "Sustainable LandManagement" and the GEF Regional Biosafetyproject
for West Africa seek to contribute to these solutions through a participative approach.

163.    Land TenurialArrangements: Improving security o f tenure will generally have a positive
impact on the environment and natural resources.          Bestowing property rights will provide
incentives for rural land owners to invest in agricultural land and adopt more sustainable and
environment-friendly agricultural practices (andwean them away from forests). However, there
are still inherent conflicts in the country between traditional and modem rights. While under
new land policy a piece o f land may belong to the Government, at the local level chiefs still have
considerable say in how it i s used andby whom. The law on property rights is not favorable to
smallholders and this has implications for sustainable land use (and forest encroachment). A
gradual progress in this area is laudable, but consultations with a range o f stakeholders at this
stage could play a constructive role in averting future land use conflicts and for promoting
sustainable landmanagement.

164.    The PRSC environmental team assessed the readiness o f the recipient to deal with
environmental issues. The assessment found that Burkina Faso has the necessary regulations
pertaining to environmental assessment but that compliance with such regulations is weak. Like
many other IDA countries, Burkina Faso prepared a National Environment Action Plan (NEAP)
at the beginning o f the 1990s. Unlike the other countries, however, the NEAP o f Burkina Faso
was not reflected in a coherent investment program, which could have included capacity-
building components. The result was delays in creating the regulatory framework, a lack o f
experience and limited capacity in certain areas o f environmental management, particularly
environmental assessment. The current regulatory framework for the country's environmental
management i s the result o f a slow but steady development o f environmental law, land law,
forest law andmininglaw.

165.    The team also focused on the institutional and technical capacity o f the Government
agencies involved in supervising compliance with environmental regulations. The Ministryo f
Environment i s aware o f its increased responsibilities inthe context o f the country's wider goals
o f poverty reduction and there is a lot o f evidence that it i s doing its best to meet these
responsibilities.   However, the Ministry i s severely understaffed which constraints its
responsibility for evaluating EIAs and preparing mitigation plans where necessary. Further, the
Ministry inspectors who are responsible for checking for compliance with environmental
regulations are not adequately trained. This has implications for both the cotton and mining
sectors where the environmental implications are high.

166.    The effectiveness o fthe system o f environmental andnatural resource management inthe
country is further challenged by some new developments. The Ministry o f Environment has
difficulties inmeeting the targets for faster processing o f new projects and o f settingup o f new
businessesthat are a key part o fthe Government growth andpoverty reduction strategy under the
One Stop Shop. This i s especially so when the areas o f proposed activity involve significant
potential environmental impacts. This could be resolved by increasing the number o f staff
available for the evaluation, but it may also require the Government to change the target times
for clearance o f more complex projects with significant environmental impacts.          There are
similar concerns about the environmental implications o f the decentralization policy. There are


                                               - 4 8 -

significant problems o f limited capacity for environmental regulation and land use planning in
the communes which could compromise sustainable natural resource management. Rapid
exploitation o f natural resources can only be prevented through helping in parallel develop
environmental capacity at the local levels.

167.    On the basis o f this assessment' the PRSC team agreed that the Ministry o f Environment
prepare a program budget to reflect its capacity needs as a trigger for PRSC-8. Further, it would
be appropriate for the Bank to initiate Strategic Environment Institutional Assessment (SEA) of
the mining, energy and cotton sectors to support hture operations (PRSC 8 and 9) inthe country.

                                  RISKS RISKS
                                         AND         MITIGATION

168.    Several risks couldjeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this series, notably:
(i)weakcapacitytoimplementthedecentralizationstrategy;(ii)
   a                                                                 vulnerability to cotton and oil
prices and real exchange rate fluctuations; (iii)vested interests obstructing reforms in the cotton
sector; and(iv) regional political instability.

169.    Burkina Faso i s very vulnerable to commodity price (cotton and oil) and real exchange
rate fluctuations (notably o f the Euro, to which the CFAF i s pegged at a fixed rate, against the
US$). High oil prices drain international reserves, and increase petrochemical, electricity and
transportation costs with adverse impact on the overall economy. With cotton as its main export,
low internationalprices hurt Burkina Faso's economy and negatively affect about two and a half
million persons in rural areas, where most of the poor live. The potential fiscal impact o f
continuous low cotton prices i s also significant. The Government i s implementing a three-
pronged approach to address its vulnerability to external shocks, including: (i)   lowering energy
costs through connecting with lower-cost regional producers and opening the electricity and
petroleum sectors to private management and investment; (ii)     revising the cotton producer price
setting mechanism to ensure adequate pass-through o f world prices and better risk sharing
between producers and ginning companies,              as well as enhancing productivity and
competitiveness o f the cotton sector; and (iii)supporting economic diversification through
reforms o f the investment climate and promotion o f mining and irrigated agriculture.         The
Government i s accompanied in its reform efforts by IDA'S series of PRSCs, the recently
approved IMF supported PRGF arrangement and support from a range o f other development
partners.

170.    Ongoing reforms to restore the financial viability and improve the competitiveness o f the
cotton sector could be undermined by a lack o f private sector interest.         The Government
considers its current increased involvement inthe sector as transitory andnecessary inthe face o f
the current crisis, and i s committed to maintain a majority private participation in the sector to
enhance its growth potential and competitiveness. The measures currently under implementation
(the recapitalizationo f the cotton companies and the revision o f the cotton price mechanism) as
well as the planned independent financial and operational audit o f SOFITEX for 2004-07, the
reduction inSOFITEX's operating costs andother ongoing and planned measures to enhance the
productivity and competitiveness o f cotton producers and companies (see Annex 5)' would
improve the sector's growth potential and its attractiveness for private investment.




                                               - 49 -

171.    The implementation of decentralization poses three major challenges to the Government.
First, officials working at the center may resist the transfer of responsibilities to local
Governments and the commensurate reduction o f their control over staff and resources. Second,
capacity o f local Governmentsmay be insufficient to carry out their new responsibilities and the
financial resources transfer mechanismmay not function well. Third, the Government may have
difficulty in sustaining the cost o f decentralization. The financial needs o f new local
Governments (buildings, equipment and operating budgets) cannot be met under the
Government's current budget. To address these risks, the Government has adopted basic
principles for decentralization: a participatory and gradual approach and the fungible resource
principle. The participatory approach should ensure stakeholder consensus on major issues and
the gradual approach should ensurethe sustainability of financial transfers to municipalities. The
fungible resource principle promotes equity in the allocation of resources among the
municipalities. Several donors support decentralization in Burkina, including the IDA-financed
Administration Capacity Buildingproject, the Community Driven Development project, and the
plannedUrban Capacity Buildingproject.

172.    Lastly, risks stemming from regional political instability remain but are considered as
moderate.     Since 1999, the political and security context in neighboring CGte d'Ivoire has
negatively affected trade and transport routes, worker remittances, and Government revenues in
Burkina Faso. However, the economy has already adjusted to this shock by opening new trade
routes to Benin, Togo and Ghana. Also, Burkina Faso's mediating role in the conflict
contributed to the recent peace agreement among the opposing parties in CBte d'Ivoire. The
remaining risk i s that prospects for economic gains from renewed exchanges with CBte d'Ivoire
may take longer than hoped for.

Mr.President,

Re: LetterofDevelopmentPolicy




1.     The objective o f this Letter of Development Policy (LDP) is to present the current trend
o f Burkina Faso's socio-economic situation and its prospects over the next two years. It is based
mainly on the revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and on its 2006-2008 Priority
Actions Program (PAP). Program implementation details have been spelt out in the 2006
implementation report. The letter has mainly highlighted the implementation o f The
Government's core reforms backed up by the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC).

1.     DEGREE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POVERTY REDUCTION
STRATEGYPAPER

2.     Despite the persistence o f the difficult economic environment in which Burkina Faso
finds herself, the country's economy continued to register a sound growth with a real GDP
growth rate o f 6.4 % and an inflation rate of 2.4 % in 2006 as against 7.1% and 6.4 %
respectively in 2005. These results stem fkom the increase in cereal and cotton production


                                                -52 -

spurred by the good rainy conditions during the 2006-2007 crop year. Budget and foreign
account deficits were entirely funded by highly concessional grants or loans thanks to the
multilateral debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) from which Burkina Faso benefited in 2006. The
implementation mission o f the new IMF PRGF program which took place from the 10th to the
24th of January, 2007 and whose report was approved by the Fund's Executive Board in April
2007 noted the enormous efforts made in terms o f macroeconomic management in 2006. A
description o f the results o f the major reforms backed up by PRSC-7 has been outlined in the
four PRSP pillars.

 1.1STEPUPEQUITYORIENTEDECONOMICGROWTH

3.      The State budget remains the framework for implementing PRSP priorities. Accordingly,
the 2007-2009 Short-Term Expenditure Framework (CDMT) which served as basis for drawing
up the 2007 finance law laid down as objective the reduction o fpoverty, and thereby pavingthe
way for reaching the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). This led to the adoption by the
National Assembly o f the 2007 finance law inkeeping with the following CDMT thresholds and
priorities: (i)enhancement o f the fight against poverty; (ii)revamping o f the economy's
production sectors; (iii)development o f jobs; (iv) fight against fraud and corruption; (v)
reinforcement o f security and promotion o f human rights; (vi) pursuance o f State reform and
lastly (vii) implementationo f the total communalization o f the territory.

4.      As part o fthe drive to render the economy andthe business sector more competitive, the
ONATEL privatization process was finally completed inlate 2006 with the transfer o f 51percent
o f the government's shares to Telecom Morocco. A national export promotion strategy geared
towards boosting economic growth was initiated in late 2006 and is expected to be pursued
during2007.

5.      The Government continued its efforts to curb the administrative obstacles hampering
private investment. A short and medium term plan o f action for the 10 (ten) ways o f Doing
Business was thus drawn up and adopted during a meeting in April 2006 by the various
ministries involved inthe process. A special operation for issuing landtitles was also organized
from 15 December 2006 to 31January 2007 inthe cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso.

6.      The implementation o f structural reforms and the improvement o f the regulatory
framework for boosting economic growth spearheadedby the private sector made it possible to
reduce the employment rigidity index from 84% in 2005 to 64% in 2006. Concerning the
reimbursement o f VAT credit, efforts were made to reduce reimbursement deadline to less than
90 days at the maximum. Inthis wise, provision has beenmade inthe 2007 financial law for the
reimbursemento f70% o fthe credit amount uponreceipt o fthe claim file andthe payment o fthe
overhang once file verification has been completed.

7       The Centre de Formalitk des Entreprises (CEFORE) o f Bobo Dioulasso has been
operational since 19 February 2007, and the activities o f that o f Ouagadougou created inJanuary
2006 have been expanded to include not only the creation o f enterprises but also such other
aspects as how firms can change their status or terminate their activities. PRSC 8 will continue
to support improvements in the investment climate and export diversification through measures



                                               - 53 -

to improve the financial viability and competitiveness o f the cotton sector, improve infrastructure
provision (electricity androads) and streamline business regulations.

 1.2     ENSURE ACCESS              TO    BASIC       SOCIAL      SERVICES AND SOCIAL
    PROTECTION FOR THE POOR

8.       The development o f human resources geared towards sustaining economic growth and
creating jobs, has made this aspect the second pillar o f the PRSP by virtue of the fact that it
highlights basic social sectors, notably those of basic education, health, social protection,
drinking water and sanitation. The aim o f all the sectoral reforms is to cater for those o f the
lowest social strata.

9.       An examination o fthe Finance law appropriations shows that the resources earmarked for
basic social sectors (such as basic education, literacy education and health) remained substantial
during2006 with appropriationceilings representing 27% ofthe total budget excludingdebts, tax
exemptions and foreign finded projects, as against 25.3% in 2005. The amounts allocated to
health and basic education and for literacy education have increasedrespectively from 11% and
14.3 % in2005 to 12.3% and 15.03 % in2006.

 1.2.1 ACCESS TOBASICEDUCATION

10.      Inthe quest to attainthemillenniumdevelopmentobjectives as enunciated inthe tenyear
basic education development plan (PDDEB), a working committee was set up by Decree No
2006-0008/MEBA/CAB on 21 July 2006. The committee drew up a balance sheet report on
phase Iand a framework note for preparing phase I1that will permit the taking into account o f
the guidelines for the accelerated education for all initiatives. These documents were approved
during the Council o f Ministers' meeting o f 12 January 2007. On the basis o f the data obtained
following the rapid survey in December by the Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy
Education( MEBA) the gross school attendance rate increased in 2005-2006 from 60.2% to
60.72% for boys and from 54.50% to 66..11% for girls.

11.      As part o f the drive to attain PDDEB objectives, efforts are being made by the
Government for the taking over, within the framework of the design o f phase I1o f the PDDEB
project, o f the overhaul o f the education system in a bid to extend basic education to cycle 1 o f
secondary schools. The CDMLT sectoral education program for 2007-2009 involves the
Ministryo fBasic Education(MEBA), and those of Secondary andHigher Education, as well as
that o f Scientific Research, will make it possible for the Government to have an overall view o f
the education system. This will enable it to better chart things and at the same time be in a
position to provide more room to bridge the two levels o f education.

 1.2.2 ACCESS TOHEALTHSERVICES


12.      As regards the health sector, the Government is strongly committed to promoting the
access o f the poor to health services. This commitment can be seen through the Government's
endeavour to limit the impact on poor households o f the amount paid for treatment. This has



                                                - 54 -

been going on since 2006 notably through the implementation o f the national strategy to
subsidize emergency obstetrical care and assisted deliveries and the free o f charge treatment o f
the indigentwhile at the same time improving the quality o fthe treatment they receive.

13.     With this same goal in mind, a study to evaluate the fimctioning o f the delegation o f
credits and imprested finds was carried out. An action plan was, thus, designed following
evaluation and its implementation will make it possible for the performance rate o f credits
delegated to healthdistricts to increase.

14.     The government, with the assistance o f its partners, continued the vaccination program
and the distribution o f vitamin A to 0 to 5 year old children. Thus, provisionalreports show that
vaccination rates for the DCP3, yellow fever ( V U ) and chicken pox (VAR) stand respectively
at 95%, 103%, 88% and 88%.

 1.2.3 ACCESS TODRINKING WATERAND SANITATION

15.     Access to drinking water, which remains a major cause for concern within the poverty
reduction context, made the Government in 2006 to carry out actions in the water, health and
sanitation sectors aimed at achieving the millennium development objectives.

16.     Indeed, the efforts made to carry out the activities defined in the road map o f the
Government in a bid to achieve the MDGs for water and sanitation made it possible for the
National Water and Sanitation Authority (ONEA) to extend its health and sanitation promotion
program to four newtowns.

 1.3    EXPAND OPPORTUNITIESFOREQUITABLE EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME
      GENERATINGACTIVITIES FORTHE POOR

17.     This third component o f the PRSP and o f its core reforms program concerns the
enhancement o f the income generating capacity o f the poor through the promotion o f their
participationinthe production process.

18.     Inorder to have aclear view ofthe procedure for acquiring land, a important issue inthe
rural area, the Government has began drawing up a national landtenure policy for the rural areas.
The policy is expected to lead to the adoption of a law laying down the guidelines on land inthe
rural areas.

19.     With regard to the cotton sector, still markedby a decline of prices on the world market,
the 2006 highyield made producers to be able to earn approximately 130billion CFA francs.

20.     The Government has also has continued the implementation o f measures geared towards
the development o f income generating activities for the most vulnerable through the organization
o f a micro finance promotion week inOctober 2006.




                                                - 55 -

 1.4    PROMOTIONOF GOODGOVERNANCE

21.     Significant progress has been made in terms o f governance. The improvement of public
finance management facilities and o f the decentralization process continued to be the
Government's main preoccupation throughout 2006. The Government continued to consolidate
achievements inthese areas.

22.     The priority action plan o f the Plan o f Actions for the Enhancement o f Budget
Management (PAP-PRGB) remains the reference framework for carrying out reforms in this
field. After four years o f implementation o f the public management enhancement plan, we must
admit that the commitment o f the various actors of the public service at various echelons o f
responsibilityand o f the country's technical and financial partners has made it possible to make
praiseworthy strides despite the persistence o f some shortcomings inthe management system. In
order to consolidate achievements and in light o f the need to attain the millennium development
objectives (MDO), the Ministry o f Finance and o f the Budget decided to implement its reform
planswithin the framework of a short and long term sectoral approach through the finalization o f
the elaboration o f a Public Finance Enhancement Strategy. The strategy was adopted on 2
February2007 andhas thus become the new reference paper inthe field.

23.     The implementation o f the general organizational framework for budgetary support as
back-up by the PSRP (CGAB-PSRP), whose letter o f understanding was signed on 11 January
2005, was continued. The various echelons o f the framework thus continued to function in
accordance with the provisions o f the rules and regulations and the letter o f understanding. The
second quarter session for 2006 was held on 28 September 2006 coupled with a field trip on 29
September to Koudougou. The trip afforded an opportunity for discussions on poverty reduction
with officers in charge o f the decentralized services o f the Ministries o f Health and Education
and those o f the town council and o f the governor's office. Draft reports on activities carried out
in2006 and the program of activities for 2007 within the framework of the CGAB-PSW were
drawn up and adopted at the quarterly session o f 16 February2007.

24.     Ina bidto monitor social expenditure and ensure a follow-up ofthe activities carried out
as part o f the poverty reduction drive, a functional classification and a codification o f social
expenditures were also conducted inthe CID.
25.     As regards public contracts, the action plan that evolved from the second analytical
review o f the procurement system (CPAR) adopted in 2006 is in the process o f being
implemented following finalization o f the draft decree setting up the ARMP and the revision of
the duties, composition and functioning o f the DGMP. The draft decree will be adopted by the
Council o f Ministers during the first semester o f 2007. The implementation o f this plano f action
will be monitored by a national committee charged with the coordination and follow-up o f
reforms inthe public contracts sector (CNCS) set up to coordinate CPAR activities.

26.     Improvement o f the quality o f public finance management remained a permanent
preoccupation in 2006. A lot o f efforts were made in this regard to back up the various control
structures by providing them with adequate resources and by enhancing their capacities so as to
enable them to play their role efficiently. Indeed, the General State Inspectorate, the General




                                                - 56 -

Inspectorate o f Finance and the State Audit Office not only received some training within the
frameworko fPRGBactivities but also receivedequipmentin2006.

27.     As regards the decentralization process, a lot of progress has been made with the
adoption o f sundry instruments. These, among others, are the decrees laying down the standard
rules and regulations governing the country's council o f local administrative units and endowing
urban councils with duties and resources in the preschool, primary education, health, cultural,
youth and sports and leisure fields adopted by the Council o f Ministers at its meetingo f 15 May
2006.

2.       PROSPECTSFORTHE PERIOD2007-2008

28.      The Government will continue to focus its efforts to operationalize the poverty reduction
strategy framework, while strengthening dialogue with partners involved inthe process.

 2.1.    IMPROVETHE INVESTMENTCLIMATEAND PROMOTEEXPORTS

29.      The Government, at the macroeconomic level, plans to continue its reform program by
putting in place a new poverty reduction and growth facility program (PRGF) and thus
strengthen the basis for the country's economic growth.

30.      Emphasis will, thus, be laid on the promotion o f the private sector and the improvement
of the competiveness o f the economy through the design o f an export-oriented national strategy
and the implementation o f the trade diagnostic study's action plans. The reforms will also be
implemented within the framework o f improving the investment climate as well as facilitating
business.

31.      More specifically, in the cotton sector, PRSC-8 will support two major series o f
initiatives inthe future: (i)further adjusting the producer price setting mechanism to better link
producer prices to the international market and reduce the transaction costs o f SOFITEX by at
least 10 percent; and (ii)launching an independent financial and organizational audit for the
period 2004-2007, and the adoption by the Council o f Ministers a strategy and a planwith the
view to increasing the private sector participationinSOFITEX's equity. The first series o f action
will improve the capacity o f SOFITEX to restore its financial stability by adequately reducing
potential government intervention inthe sector. While supporting ongoing initiatives inorder to
lessen the impact o f the volatility o f international price o f cotton (revision o f the price-setting
mechanism, stabilization fund, etc.), the Government believes that the management o f such a
fund as well as the financial risks associated with it should be the sole responsibility o f the
private sector and the sector's professional, without incurring consequences on the state's
budget. The second series o f action presents an important step in the process o f increasing
private sector participation in the cotton sector, including through better understanding o f
productivity gains which SOFITEX could achieve in the medium term. The preparation and the
adoption o f a strategy to ensure greater private participation inthe sector are expected by the end
2007. For the next PRSC, actions in the cotton sector will support the finalization o f audits
conducted and the realization o f the government's strategy to reduce its holdings in SOFITEX
andthus increase the private sector holdings.



                                                - 5 7 -

32.       Inorder to support the development ofthe miningsector within two or three years inone
of the two major focus o f the country's exports, the Government will adhere to the Extraction
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process, which will promote confidence in foreign
private investment in the sector, and thus guarantee a better tax revenue mobilization from the
sector. The objective o f PRSC-8 i s to close the initiation phase of EITI. This will require the
adoption o f a precise plan o f activities with the consent o f all stakeholders (administration,
industrial, and the civil society) inthe miningsector.

33.       The special operation for the issuance o f landtitles will also be undertaken in the course
o f 2007. The legal framework for rural landwill be made permanent with the adoption o f its
orientation law i s this respect; and the government will put in place two offices, one for
acquisition formalities and property transfer andthe other for buildingpermits.

34.       The Government will also contribute to improving the business climate by pursuing
reforms to increase the flexibility o f the labor market. Inparticular the provisions of the labor
code will be usedto strengthen, on one hand the flexibility of duration and hours o f work, and
cancel on the other hand the limitation for renewal o f fixed contracts in some sectors such as
mining.

35.       Within the framework o f pursuingthe reforms under way inthe electricity sector, whose
unit cost is very high, the government will submit to Parliament a proposalto revise the general
regulatory law for electricity inBurkina Faso.


2.2.      IMPROVE ACCESS TO BASIC SOCIAL SERVICES BY STRENGTHENING
DECENTRALIZATIONAND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES.

36.       In order to achieve its poverty reduction objective, the Government will continue to
pursue actions in favor of the least privilegedby providing the social sectors with the necessary
resources.

37.       With respect to the education sector, the government, with the support o fits partners, will
begin the implementation o f Phase I1 o f the PDDEB. It will also finalize the 2007-2009
education sector CDMT in order to provide a coherent framework for programming basic
education interventions. The school subventionpolicy inthe 20 less educated provinces will also
be pursued. The Government will use the devolution laws and availability o f civil servants in
order to effectively transfer schools and their personnel to 49 urban communes. Moreover, the
school fund experience will be extended to 22 newprovinces andtheir urbancommunes.

38.       Inthe health sector, quality and utilization ofhealth service resources will be improved
by updating the 2007-2010 CDMT. The Government will also undertake its free vaccination
program for pregnant women and children under five years. It will also use the devolution law to
transfer basic health training to the 49 urban communes. Recruitment and personnel training plan
adopted by the Ministry o f Health and the implementation o f human resource management
s o h a r e will strengthen planning, training andmanagement fimctions o finthe sector.



                                                 - 58 -

39.     In the water and sanitation sector, the Directorate of water resources (DGRE) will
implement the maintenance strategy for water points in at least 25 rural communities, within the
framework o f contracts between the municipalities and the professional operators o f water
management systems. Inparallel, the ONEA hygiene program will continue inthe four selected
towns for this program.


40.     Actions aimed at strengtheningbudget management o f the communes will be undertaken
bydeployingthe local governments integrated compatible software to 22 urbancommunes. Also,
a development and deployment plan for administrative management module o f CICL will be
adopted. The Ministry o f Finance and Budget will pursue its de-concentration by extending its
de-concentrated services network of general directorates o f Budget, Treasury, Public Accounts,
andTax andFinancialControl.
 2.3.   IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY, TRANSPARENCY, AND ACCOUNTING FOR
 THE USEOFPUBLICFUNDS

41.     As regards local level governance, the Government is committed to effective
implementation o f decentralization. It intends to strengthen the process, notably by abiding by
the deadlines fixed for the transfer o fduties and estate to the communes.
42.     With respect to budgeting reforms, the work involved will be the Implementation o f the
activities o f the 2007 three-year sectoral plan o f actions for the public finance strengthening
strategy (SRFP) while capitalizing on the coordination o f budgetary assistance through a sound
management o fthe (CGAB-PRSP).

43.     Concerning the CGAB-PRSP,         a policy package for 2007 has already been adopted and
i s aimed at consolidating dialogue between the Government and member partners in the
implementation o f the poverty reduction strategy and the promotion of the best budget support
practices. Budget support estimates for 2007 have been fixed at 112.622 billion CFA francs as
against 100.952 billions in2006.

44.     The budget formulation process will also continue to be refined so as to ensure a closer
link between the PRSP procedure and the budget. Government actions inthis regard will focus
on the appropriation o f budget programming tools (for the overall and sectoral CDMT and
program budget) by sector ministries through the finalization and implementation o f a strategy
for sector CDMTs. Priority will be given to the establishment o f program budget and collection
o f database in the two Ministries, with those o f infrastructure and environment. Budgetary
allocation estimates will also need to be strengthened, notably for the maintenance o f the roads
network, increase efficiency o f public finance and strengthen institutional capacities o f these
ministries.

45.     As regards government contracts, the next major steps o fthe reform are the establishment
o f a regulatory authority and implementation of a general directorate o f public procurements,
recently established by regulation. Nominations for the organization o fDGMP will be composed
o f at least two ministries and two representatives to ensure better monitoring o f public
procurements. Moreover, a software for Public Procurement Information System (SIMP) is
beingdeveloped to facilitate the production o f a database in order to establish a reference point



                                                - 5 9 -

for the new monitoring and evaluation system. All these actions are expected to improve
markedly the public procurement system.

46.     Finally, to strengthen the independence and efficiency o f the Cours des comptes, the
government will adopt administrative auditing laws and facilitate budget execution o f Cours des
Comptes byputtinginplace an unlocking system like the Mediator o f Faso and Superior Council
o f Communication.

3.       CONCLUSION

47.      The implementation o f the relevant programs and measures described above and which
fall in line with the core program o f activities o f the PRSP i s aimed at achieving the country's
poverty reduction objectives. Consequently, the Government remains convinced that, with World
Bank assistance through the next poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs), their
implementation will contribute to the consolidation o f the macroeconomic framework and lend
support for a stronger, healthier and sustainable economic growth necessary for a significant
reduction o fpoverty.

                   Annex 5: PRSC-7- The Cotton Sector inBurkinaFaso


Background

1.      Cotton plays a crucial role in the economic development o f Burkina Faso.
Approximately 250,000 households and 2.5 million people depend, either directly or
indirectly, on cotton production for their livelihood, and nearly one person out o f six in
the country earns cash income from cotton cultivation. The sector represents 50-65
percent o f the country's export earnings. Over the past decade, cotton production has
increased by an average o f 17 percent per annum making Burkina the largest producer o f
cotton in sub-Saharan Africa with a total production o f 730,000 tons o f seed cotton in
2005/2006. The focus on cotton production has also allowed an increase in cereal
production - maize in particular - that is cultivated in rotation with cotton and benefits
from the residual effects o f fertilizers used for cotton. Since 1999 cereal production has
increased by 60 percent. As a result, the proportion o f cotton producing households under
the poverty threshold dropped from 62 to 47 percent between 1994 and 20049, and i s
estimated to have dropped by another 6 percent since 2004. The national poverty trend
reflects that o f cotton-producing households, underscoring the sector's economic
dominance.

EarlierReformEfforts

2.      From 1960 to 1999 the cotton sector was vertically integrated and managed by
CFDT (now DAGRIS), then SOFITEX, a parastatal, was established in 1979. Since
1999 Burkina began to reform its cotton sector to improve competitiveness.              These
reforms aimed at reducing the role o f the state and increase the role o f the private sector
and farmers' organizations in the sector management. Specifically, the Government
reform program had a three pronged approach: (i)        the privatization in 1999 o f the state
owned cotton monopoly SOFITEX; (ii)          liberalization in 2004 o f the cotton sector by
abolishing the exclusive rights for SOFITEX to service the sector; and (iii)      creation in
2005 o f an institutional set-up which allows for self-governance o f the sector by its
stakeholders (producers and ginning companies) without participation o f the state.

3.      In a first step, in 1999 the Government reduced its direct involvement in the
sector by selling a substantial part o f its 65 percent shareholdings in SOFITEX, then the
only cotton ginning company inthe country, to a foreign investor, DAGRIS (a long time
business partner o f SOFITEX), which now holds 34 percent o f SOFITEX and to the
cottonproducer association (UNPCB), which holds 30 percent. The Government reduced
its stake in SOFITEX thereby to 35 percent, with one percent o f the stocks retained by
national investors (two commercial banks). Given the dominant impact o f the sector on
macroeconomic stability and social welfare, Government decided that a privatization
strategy aimed at transferring ownership o f most commercial and manufacturing entities
inthe 1990swas too risky, opting insteadfor a more gradual andorderly transition inthe

cotton sector. This was meant to allow for a gradual increase o f private participation in
the provision o f services in the sector as well as for development o f a market for assets
formerly wholly-offered and internally-tradedby SOFITEX, until 1999.

4.        A price support fund was an integral part of this monopoly, with an implicit
Government floor price guarantee. The fund was financed from SOFITEX reserves built
from profits accumulated duringprevious years. Inaddition to ensuring a minimumprice
for cotton producers, the payment o f a premium to producers o f up to 50 percent o f the
profits was agreed. The 50 percent overall profit share for the producers was also meant
to refinance the support fund in prosperous years, however, no objective criteria were
established which determined the amount to be transferred to the h d . Furthermore,
while the minimumprice was paid inyear t, the premiumwas paid inyear t+l. This had
serious consequences in 2004/2005 when producers received the highest price just as
cotton export prices hit their lowest level ever, sendingthe wrong signal about the actual
state o fthe sector to producers.

5.        In a second reform step, in 2001-2004, the Government abolished the exclusive
rights o f SOFITEX to service the country's cotton sector (i.e., provision o f credit and
fertilizer to producers, purchase o f cotton grain, transformation and sale o f fiber) and
authorized the establishment o f two new cotton operators by dividingthe country into 3
zones. Rights in one zone, in the traditional cotton growing western area covering 20
provinces, were left with SOFITEX. Rights in the central zone, covering 11 provinces,
were sold to FASO COTON (a private company) and those inthe third zone, inthe east
andwhich covers 6 provinces, were sold to SOCOMA (also a private company). FASO
COTON and SOCOMA started to operate inSeptember 2004.'' With liberalization o fthe
sector in late 2004, the legal status o f the SOFITEX support fund was not resolved and
the bankrupt fund ceased to intervene in the market in the 2005/2006 and 2006/2007
seasons.

6.        To strengthen the operation o f the sector and share risks and opportunities among
stakeholders, an agreement was signed on September 3, 2004, between the state, the
producers and the three companies, which stated that: (i)                   the integrated chain fiZiBre)
approach would be maintained; (ii)minimumproducer price would be adopted (in line
                                               a
with earlier informal producer price arrangements) on the eve o f the new season (April);
(iii) company wouldhave exclusive rights andresponsibilities inits respective
      each
concession for eight years under the provision, that, among others, purchase o f cotton in
their respective zones would be at no lower than the agreed minimum price for the
producers; and (iv) the establishment o f a price stabilization fund. The Government's
expectation was that the fund will be self-financing. The agreement also fixed the


loThe ownership of FASO COTON is as follows: Rheinart (a Swiss company) holds 3 1 percent of the shares; the IPS
group (Aga KhanFoundation) 29 percent, Sociktk Burro et Frires (a local company) owns 20 percent; AMFERT (a
regional private company which specializes in agricultural input supply) owns 10 percent, and UNPCB (the cotton
producer association)has a stake of 10percent. SOCOMA, the second new company has as shareholdersDAGRIS (5 1
percent), UNPCB(20 percent), SOBA (20 percent), SYA PARTICIPATION (4 percent) and others(5 percent). Despite
the openingof the market, SOFITEX continues to play a majorrole inthe cotton sector with 85 percent of the market,
comparedto 10percentfor SOCOMA and5 percentfor FASOCOTON.

minimumprice for the first three years at Franc CFA 175 per kilogram o f seed cotton, on
the basis o f international projections that would ultimately prove overly-optimistic. This
arrangement left the ultimate commercial risk to a large degree on the three cotton
ginningcompanies.

7.      Ina thirdreform step inFebruary2006, to enhance self governance ofthe sector
and reduce the state's regulatory influence, the Government promoted the establishment
o f the Inter-Professional         Cotton Association o f Burkina Faso (1'Association
Interprofessionnelle du Coton du Burkina, AICB), formed by the three cotton companies
and UNCPB, the cotton producer organization. The AICB's mandate i s to: (i)           ensure the
management o f the above mentioned agreement, in particular determination o f the
minimumpurchase price for seed cotton; (ii)          manage common activities, including the
newly-established stabilization find; (iii)    arbitrate inthe event o f conflicts; and (iv) steer
andmonitor the sector.

Recent Sector Crisis and OngoingReforms

8.      Byend-2005, the role o fthe state inthe cotton sector was significantly reduced to
a minority shareholder in SOFITEX, compared to the period prior to 1999 when
SOFITEX was a state-owned monopoly. However, these reforms took place against
increasingly difficult international market conditions for cotton, triggered by a sharp
decline o f international cotton prices in 2002 and compounded by a cumulative
appreciation o f the Franc CFA vis A vis the U S dollar o f about 15 percent since 2001.
This resulted in a decline o f the export price for 1kilogram o f ginned cotton from Franc
CFA 847 in 2001 to Franc CFA 637 in 2006. The absence o f an adequate price setting
mechanism to align the producer price more closely with the international cotton price
caused substantial financial difficulties for the cotton companies in Burkina and put the
sector under financial stress. The adherence to the minimum price set in 2004 for the
years 2005 and 2006 resulted in farm gate prices over the last 3 years that were higher
than the international market price for cotton. The requirement to announce a producer
price prior to the season left the risk and the responsibility for adjustment on the cotton
companies. Measures to lower costs were too limited in their saving potential and the
companies did not use hedginginstrumentsto mitigate the impact o fprice shocks.

9.      As a result, the three cotton companies assumed most o fthe adjustment costs and
accumulated deficits over the years 2004 to 2006, amounting to USD 93 million". In a
privatized and liberalized sector, the state took a principled stance against Government
support, expecting private stakeholders to make necessary adjustments in the sector.
Ultimately, the ginning companies had no refinancing option for their accumulating
losses. The Government stance on this question in the last three years underscored its
commitment to the privatization strategy o f the sector and its overall policy objective to
minimize state interventioninthe sector.

10.    Inlate2006, the bankingsector, which typically pre-finances the cotton season,
refused to finance the 2007-2008 campaign unless the sector were put back on a better

financial footing. Three sets o f actions are currently being implemented by sector
operators to restore the financial viability of the sector and improve its competitiveness:
(1) SOFITEX and Faso Coton (altogether representing 90 percent o f the sector) have
already announced their recapitalization plans; (2) the domestic producer price setting
mechanism is being reformed to more closely align the producer price with the
international cotton price, and to broker a better commercial risk sharing between
producers and cotton companies; a Stabilization Fund has also been established to
balance out volatility in the international cotton prices for the benefit o f cotton growing
farmers; and (3) efforts continue to improve the productivity o f cotton production,
includingthrough experimenting with nationally developedpest-resistant seed varieties.

11.     To avoid a collapse o f the sector due to the refusal o fthe Banksto pre-financethe
2007/2008 season and mitigate the severe consequences o f the crisis for growth and
poverty reduction, the Government decided to provide a guarantee equivalent to around
USD 100million to the commercial banking pool to facilitate adequate financing of the
2007/2008 season and allow for time to settle recapitalization negotiations. The
Government also ordered a financial assessment o f the sector based on end 2005 data
(thenthe most recent data available) so that its financial situation can be better assessed
and appropriate measures can be taken in the short and medium-term to restore the
viability o f the sector and continue the policy o f enhancing private ownership in the
sector.

12.     Recapitalization o f the cotton ginning companies. On the basis o f the above
mentioned assessment and in compliance with the applicable commercial law and
regulations (OHADA rules), the recapitalizationneed for SOFITEX i s estimated at USD
76 million, for SOCOMA at USD 14 million, and for FASO COTON at USD 3 million.
All three companies are in the recapitalization process. Given its size and role in the
sector, SOFITEX took the lead in this process. The general assembly o f SOFITEX
approved in November 2006 an increase in capital o f USD 69 million, which with the
existing equity o f USD 9 million would have resulted in a total o f USD76 million
subscribed capital for the company.       Half o f the USD 69 million required for this
recapitalization would have been paid in before January 31, 2007, and the other half
before the end o f June 2007, according to OHADA rules. To that end, the Government
provided USD 24 million for the recapitalization scheme in early 2007, which would
have covered its initial share. However, SOFITEX's shareholder DAGRIS (34 percent)
retreated from its decision o f November 2006 and officially announced in January 2007
that it would not underwrite its shares. The mainreason is that DAGRIS, a company held
by the French state, is itself in the process o f beingprivatized and could not commit at
this stage in order to avoid prejudicing the potential buyer.          This new situation
compromised the recapitalization plan o f November 2006.              A final decision on
SOFITEX's recapitalization will be taken in June 2007, during the company's' Board
meeting, whichwill also deliberate over the 2006 audits.

13.     The new recapitalization decision that i s expected from SOFITEX's Board

estimated contribution o f about USD 10 million12(or 13 percent o f the recapitalization),
an amount that would reduce the producers' relative shares in SOFITEX from 30 percent
to about 15 percent (table A5, below). In the absence o f alternative investors beyond a
small participation by commercial banks, the Government would be called to subscribe
the remainder o f the producers' share. According to the OHADA rules, at least 75
percent o f the additional capital (equivalent to USD 57 million) needs to be ~ubscribed.'~
This would imply that, in the absence o f DAGRIS or another investor being able to
subscribe, the Government would have to cover its shares (35 percent) and an additional
26 percent o f the shares to make up inpart for the non-subscription o f DAGRIS and for
the reduced shareholdings o f UNPCB, in order to meet the required 75 percent o f
minimum capital sub~cription.'~ The direct costs to the Government for this
recapitalization amount to a maximum o fUSD46 million, o fwhich USD 24 million have
already been advanced by the Government in early 2007. As shown by Table A5.1, the
Government share inSOFITEX after the recapitalizationwould amount to 58 percent.

14.      The evolving status o f the main investor inthe sector that is not controlled by the
state, DAGRIS, has not allowed for an adequate entrepreneurial response to the sector's
financial problems, forcing the Government to step inon a transitory basis. The increased
Government ownership o f SOFITEX, following its recapitalization, does not affect
Government's long-term vision for the sector, nor implya reversal o f the sectoral reforms
implemented since 1999. Rather, the increased Government holdings became necessary
to stabilize the sector in light o f the current crisis and to safeguard the sector's assets,
while the sector's long term financial viability is restored through a revision o fthe cotton
price setting mechanism and other measures to enhance competitiveness. The
Government o f Burkina Faso continues to be convinced that private sector participation
inthe sector is best to enhance the sector's growthpotential and competitiveness. Thus,
Government has confirmed its commitment to a minority involvement inthe sector and to
transfer shares back to the private sector as soon as private investors can be found. Inthe
meanwhile, the Government intendsto reduce SOFITEX operative costs by 10percent in
2008.

15.     FASOCOTON, accordingto its management, intendsto take a definitive decision
concerning its recapitalization on the basis of certified 2006 accounts at the next Board
meetingof the company, to be held inMay 2007. The decision for SOCOMA is linked
to the finalization of DAGRIS' privatization and a decision will be taken no later than
June 2007, after the Board meeting of SOCOMA. The Governmenti s not a shareholder
ofthese companies, hence does not incur contingent fiscal liabilities inbothcases.

 16.    The Producer Pricing Mechanism and the accompanying stabilization fund. As
discussed above, the price setting mechanism plays an important role for the financial
viability o f the cotton sector.           With the privatization of SOFITEX in 1999, the
management o f the cotton producer minimum pricing was transferred to a tri-partite
committee that included representatives from producers, SOFITEX, and the Government.
The committee was replaced in 2006 by the AICB, a self-governing sectoral body which
allowed for the exit o f the Government. The minimum producer price was to be
announced prior to sowing and a producer price stabilization fund was established in
March 2006 to mitigate fluctuations in export prices not commensurable with paying the
minimum producer price. The AICB also began to discuss a new price mechanism.
However, while an automatic price calculation formula was still under discussion, a new
floor price o f Franc CFA 165 per kilogram of seed cotton was announced for the
2006/2007 seasonon April 8,2006.

 17.    Additional work was              subsequently undertaken,                supported by external
development partners, and a revised pricing mechanism was adopted inNovember 2006
by the AICB. The revised mechanism is characterized as follows: (i) producer price        the
will be derived from the calculated trend price and in accordance with a fixed profit
sharing formula between producers and ginners (60 percent for the producers and 40
percent for the cotton companie~);'~ the minimumproducer price (floor price) will be
                                            (ii)
announced in April at the beginning o f the season and the payment o f a premium
(ristourne) after the season, incase sufficient profits are made, is maintained; and (iii)                  the
floor price i s calculated using a centered seven-year moving average o f Index A and a
price tunnel [-5.1% + 1.3% 3 that will allow the payment o f 95 percent .of the average
market price as a floor price to farmers (with the remaining 5 percent paid only if the ex
post marketprice is inline with the ex ante price).

18.     This represents a significant step to restore the financial viability of the cotton
sector. Indeed, the revised pricing mechanism, had it been adopted before April 2006,
would have given a price for the last season of around FCFA 150 per kg (rather than
165). The new mechanism will be applied as o f April 2007, to determine the producer
price for the 2007/2008 campaign, likely to be 145 CFAFkg. Projections indicate that
such a price would lead to a modest operating surplus for SOFITEX next year. IDA has
advised the Government and the AICB to fine-tune the price mechanism in order to
strengthen its alignment with the international trend by shortening the seven-year
reference period andpaying out 90 percent o f the agreed floor price. This would provide


l5Cotton companies having voiced concerns that, in case of "excessively" low prices, they may want a change to a
more favorable breakdown (58-42%). It remains to be decided what level of prices would be deemed "excessively"
low.


                                                    - 95 -

a higher margin to ensure against price risks. If profits are made, the second payment
towards farmers, in line with the overall 60/40 percent profits sharing objective, could
thenbeaccordinglyhigher.

19.     The price mechanism is envisaged to be complemented by a stabilization fund
(SF), whose prime objective is to balance out volatility inthe international cotton prices
for the benefit o f cotton growing farmers. Based on the assumption that periods with
decreasing prices follow periods with increasing prices, a pay out o f the fund to farmers
would be triggeredinthe first case, ifthe export price fetched does not cover the payment
o f the producer minimumprice, and a pay into the fund in the latter case. The national
stabilization fund could be sustainable if the producer price mechanism established in
November 2006 i s further revisedas discussed inparagraph 18.

20.     ImprovingProductivity. While the sector's financial viability would be restored in
the short term with the recapitalization o f the cotton companies and the revision o f the
cotton price mechanism, the sector's export performance, attractiveness for private
investment and incomes for farm households would be enhanced through productivity
gains by cotton producers and ginning companies. The Government is already engaged
ininitiatives to improveproductivity inthecotton sector:


     0  Strengthening infrastructure. As cultivated areas have quadrupled in the last ten
        years, the Government i s expanding feeder roads and allocating budget resources
        to maintain existing ones, particularly inthe eastern zone. Better roads and easier
        access will lower the cost o f providing cotton inputs. Additional storage facilities
        for inputs are also being built.


     0  Improving farm equipment. In Burkina Faso, farms well-equipped with animal
        traction (two oxen, a plow and a cart) yield two tons o f seed cotton per hectare,
        about twice the national average. The Government i s working on scaling-up this
        practice.


     0  Improving seed cotton productivity: An efficient management o f soil fertility
        through the dissemination o f manure and cover crops should increase seed cotton
        yields. UNPCB has designed an action plan aimed at increasing cotton
        productivity by 15 percent inthe next five years.


     0  Introducing pest-resistant cotton varieties.      Biotechnology has opened new
        opportunities to the sector in Burkina Faso. The country i s the only one in
        Western and Central Africa that has been testing and developing local varieties of
        transgenic (Bt) cotton. Initial results point to a productivity gain o f 19 to 30
        percent and a reduction in pesticide use, from an average o f six applications to
        two.   The additional revenue resulting from the use o f transgenic cotton is
        estimated at Franc CFA 36,000 per hectare. Nationwide introduction is envisaged
        by 2011/2012.     The Government i s also playing a leading role within the
        subregion indeveloping an appropriate biosecurity regulatory framework.




                                            - 96 -

    0   Combining cotton cultivation with other ventures. Rotating the cultivation of
        cotton with that of cereals (hybrid maize in particular) has been very successful,
        and research on optimal rotation plans will be intensified.           Other plant
        combinations are also conceivable to further reduce the need for imported
        fertilizers. In the low lands, cotton cultivation would be associated with that o f
        h i t s (mangoes, citrus, and bananas), vegetables (tomatoes, onions, green beans)
        and leguminous (cowpeas).

21.     The Burkinabb Government has also played an important leadership role among
African cotton-producing countries within the Doha Round o f international trade
discussions, advocating for the elimination o f agricultural subsidies in the developed
world that undermineincentives for African producers.

IDAAssistance to the Sector

22.     IDAhas providedcontinuous support to the cotton sector through the PRSC series
1to 6, andproposes to continue its assistanceto the sector through the new set ofPRSCs
(7-9), as well as through investment projects.

23.     PRSC-1 and 2 supported studies and an action plan for the opening o f the cotton
sector to private investors. PRSC 3 and 4 supported the implementation o f the action plan
that ledto the setting up of two new private ginning companies in 2004- FASO COTON
inthe central region and SOCOMA inthe easternregion. PRSC 5 and 6 also supported
increased agricultural productivity and diversification, including through the land tenure
reform.

24.     This new PRSC series (7 to 9) will continue to address medium and long term
challenges for the cotton sector. During the preparation o f PRSC-7, the Government has
adopted a new price settingmechanism, which will be used to determine producer prices
for the 2007/2008 campaign.        PRSC 8 will include two cotton-related triggers as
indicatedinTable 4:

    0   The producer pricing mechanism is further revised to better align it with the
        international market price. SOFITEX has started to reduce its operating costs in
        2007, has adopted and started implementinga restructuringplan aimed at further
        reducing its operating costs byno less than 10percent in2008..
    0   Independent financial and operational audits o f SOFITEX for 2004-2007 have
        been launched and the Council of Ministers has adopted a strategy and calendar
        for enhancedprivate sector participationinSOFITEX's equity.

25.     The first measure will ensure better alignment o f the producer price mechanism
with world price changes and will thus reduce Government's contingent liabilities from
the sector.     The second trigger represents an important milestone in the process o f
enhancing private sector participation inthe sector. Infact, the independent financial and
operational audits o f SOFITEX will inform the Government's strategy to bringinprivate
investors. While cotton-related triggers for PRSC-9 would be defined duringpreparation


                                           - 97 -

o f PRSC-8, it i s anticipated that they would support the completion o f the audits,
providing a clean audit opinion for 2007, and the implementation o f the Government
strategy to reduce its stake in SOFITEX and enhance private sector participation in the
sector.

26.      IDA'Sinvestment projects in this sector include the Agricultural Diversification
and Market Development Project which is targeting an increase inthe competitiveness of
selected valuehpply chains for national and sub-regional markets, thereby contributing
to broad-based agricultural growth inBurkina Faso. The cotton component o fthe project
addresses the above objectives regarding investment in farm equipment and storage
facilities, improvement in seed cotton productivity through manure, cover crops and
cropping system, implementation o f a biosecurity program for cotton producers, and
promotion o f alternative supply chains. This project i s complemented by a recently-
negotiated Regional Biosafety Project inwhich Burkina's national biosecurity laboratory
will play a leading role. IDA is also financing the second National Transport Sector
Program which addresses in particular the improvement o f feeder roads to cotton
production areas.

       Annex 6: PRSC-7-The Impacton PovertyofAlternativeCotton ProducerPrices.
1.       This annex provides preliminary estimates o f the impact o f different cotton producer
prices on poverty among cotton producers in Burkina Faso. The focus i s on answering the
questions:

            0    how has poverty among cotton producers evolved over time; and .
                 what i s the impact onpoverty among cotton producers, ifprices decrease ?

2.       In addition, the synergies in production or positive externalities derived from cotton
production for a typical cotton producer are briefly discussed to shed light on the witnessed high
price elasticity for producing cotton.

3.       The estimates are based on two surveys collecting information on the household's
consumption in Burkina Faso: the 1998-99 Priority survey and the 2003 Core Welfare Questionnaire
Indicator survey (CWIQ).         The two surveys provide detailed and comparable data on the
consumption levels o f households as well as data on farming patterns and cotton production. Table
A6.1 provides estimates o f poverty in the population as a whole as well as in urban and rural areas,
including for cotton producers. Table A6.1 shows that between 1997/98and 2003, the share o f cotton
producers in poverty has decreased from 53.9 percent to 47.2 percent. The poverty level for cotton
producers and the poverty dynamics was similar to the overall poverty level and dynamics observed
in the country in both years. However, there was a slightly steeper reduction in poverty for the
overall population than for cotton producers. Poverty reduction among cotton farmers i s primarily
linked to an increase in production, and the positive synergies farmers derive for other cultivated
crops (cereal, etc.) from the fertilizer input package they receive from the cotton ginning companies.
The producer price varied only marginally duringthe same period, with 180 Franc CFA franckg in
1997-98 and 175 Franc CFA k g in2002-2003.

4.       The impact on poverty among cotton producers. The analysis measures the changes in
income obtained from cotton production at different producer prices by using the income data from
the before mentioned households surveys. It is assumed that this difference inincome translates into
an equivalent difference in consumption per capita, and that no further adjustment to the new price
signal i s made by the cotton producers, that is, neither does the farmer substitute cotton production
for another crop, nor does he increase cotton production. The new consumption aggregate i s then
used to measure poverty. The resultingestimation o f the income effect provides for a "first round
partial equilibrium" poverty effect from lower producer prices. The results from the estimations for
various cotton price scenarios are provided intable A6.2. The 1997/98survey data are used for these
simulations rather than the 2003 CWIQ survey, because the 2003 survey did not measure very well
the quantities of cotton sold by households. Although the level ofpoverty observed inthe 1997-98
survey i s significantly higher than in the 2003 survey, the order o f magnitude o f the change in
poverty due to changes in producer prices i s likely to remain similar today to what it was then. In


                                                   - 99 -

1997-1998, the price paid to top producers was Franc CFA 180kg. This i s also the modal price
observed inthe survey. Table A.6.2 suggests that a 20 CFA franckg reduction inthe producer price
o f Franc CFA 160 per kilogram to Franc CFA 140 per kilogram would lead to an increase inpoverty
o f about 3.5 percentage points among cotton producers. For poorer producers, who may be less
diversified, the negative impact could be larger. A more informed analysis o f the actual poverty
impact o f reduced cotton producer prices would need, however, to capture more precisely the
synergy effects achieved with cotton production, and the value the typical cotton farmer derives from
the fertilizer and credit package offered by the cotton companies (see below). Supporting the loss in
income with producer prices above market rates i s not sustainable for a longer period, neither for the
ginningcompanies, nor for the Government. However, the loss in income could be compensated by
an increase in production, which seems to have been the case, among others, for the typical cotton
farmer inBurkina, judgedby the increasing overall cotton production o f 17 percent annually over the
last decade, and i s similar to the experience made in other countries (Mali). The increase in
production has been realized in the past through extension o f cultivation. Another way to increase
production and support the farmers' income would be to improve productivity. This can be done
though additional fertilizers, or a more optimized production cycle, includingthrough training, using
cotton seeds better adjusted to the various applicable natural conditions, or simply through use o f
higher yieldingcotton seeds.

5.       Why do producers continue to produce cotton despite lower prices?                              The reasons
identified in Mali apply most likely to Burkina Faso and to other West African cotton producing
countries. First, cotton production gives producers the certitude they will receive a monetary income
at a predetermined moment. This monetary income helps to cover costs for a variety o f expected and
unexpected expenses (health, education, social events). Second, cotton production facilitates access
to credit. Producers need this credit not only to get access to inputs but also to improve their
productive material or for consumption purposes. The banking system and the micro-finance
institutions often do not deliver credits to farmers who do not produce cotton or a marketable fruit.
Third, cotton production offers farmers access to farm inputs (fertilizers). Producers often use those
inputsnot only for cotton productionbutalso for cereals production. Fourth, cotton production offers
producers access to some training and education concerning new varieties, and technical
improvements. Finally, cotton production in any given year has positive "afterwards effects" on
cereals yields inthe next year as the use o f chemical and/or natural inputsneeded by the cotton crop
improves ground fertility at crop rotation time. Overall, to pertain to the "cotton club" brings many
advantages to peasants, which may explain why most o f them continue to produce cotton when
prices go down, at least for some time.

This joint DSA was prepared using the Fund-World Bank debt sustainability
framework for low-incomecountries. The data were updatedjointly by the Fund and the
World Bank with information provided by the authorities. The medium-termframework was
discussed with the authorities in the context o f the new PRGF arrangement (Box I. which           l),
i s beingconsidered by the FundBoard at the same time as this DSA.

BurkinaFaso'srisk of debt distressis moderate.


                            EXTERNALDEBTSUSTAINABILITY                 ANALYSIS

All debt indicators are well below their policy-dependent thresholds in the baseline
scenarios (Text Table A1O.l). This is a substantial improvement over the results o f the
previous joint DSA completed in August 2005, when the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio was
projectedto breach its threshold for a numbero f years (Box 1.2).16After the MDRIdebt relief
in 2006, debt ratios increase again over the medium term and stabilize over the long term.
The driver o f these debt dynamics i s the fiscal stance; over the medium term, fiscal deficits
are relatively large and the borrowing requirements lead to increasing debt ratios, but in the
long run deficits fall enough to allow debt ratios to stabilize, mainly because o f projected
revenue increases.

          MDFUrelief-in           the first figure, MDRIrelief has been simulated for the 2005 joint DSA, yielding
          the dotted line, which tracks the current baseline.

          M o r e favorable macroeconomic performance and outlook-this                     i s the difference between the
          current baseline and the 2005 DSA with MDRI over the medium term: unexpectedly good export
          performance in recent years (second figure), particularly in 2006, creates the basis for a more
          favorable macroeconomic outlook.

          Larger new borrowing requirements in nominal terms-this                     tends to offset the more favorable
          export path inthe baseline, and the debt ratios o f the two DSAs converge (see third figure below).
          As apercent of GDP, projections for the fiscal stance-as                    measured by the overall balance
          excluding grants-have          changed relatively little since 2005, except for 2007-09, when the current
          baseline has larger deficits. InUS.dollar terms, borrowing requirements inthe current baseline are
          somewhat larger in most years, because nominal GDP is larger. While the differences inindividual
          years tend to be small, they accumulate over time, and the NPV o f new debt diverges (fourth
          figure).

The NPV of debt-to-exportsratiois the mostbindingindicatorfor BurkinaFaso.
Sensitivity tests show that the ratio breaches its threshold ina number of scenarios, but other

debt indicatorsremainbelow their thresholds for all standardized stress tests and alternative
scenarios (Text Table 1.2 and Figure 1.1):

      0    The stress test on export growth causes the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio to breach
           its threshold by a wide margin because exports are volatile: they are heavily
           dependent on cotton andthere are largefluctuations causedbyweather-related shocks
           and changes ininternationalcottonprices."

      0    Public borrowing on less favorable terms would probably be unsustainable. Inthe
           alternative scenario, the average grant element i s lowered to about 20percent from
           over 40 percent inthe baseline (which increases the interest rate on new borrowing by
           2 percent), resulting in a steadily increasing NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio, which
          breaches the threshold inabout 2015.
           Inthe alternative historicalscenario, theNPV ofdebt-to-exports ratio also breaches
           its threshold. Inthis scenario, the growth rates for key macroeconomic variables are
           set at their historical 10-year average. Debt dynamics in Burkina Faso are mostly
           driven by fiscal policies-the              country can draw on the regional reserves o f the
           WAEMUto meet external balance-of-payment needs-and past policies appear to be
           unsustainable. In contrast, the baseline assumes a significant reduction in the fiscal
           deficit over the mediumterm, which is critical for debt sustainability.

A country-specific scenario that retains the fiscal policy stance of the last year of the
PRGFindefinitelywould also be unsustainable. Inthis scenario, the revenue-to-GDP ratio
i s fixed at its projected level for 2009 (14.5 percent o f GDP), but baseline assumptions for
expenditures excluding interest are broadly unchanged (Figure 1.2).l8 The overall deficit
including grants would then average about 4xpercent o f GDP for 2010-25,                                                about
 1?4percentage points higher than the baseline. The additional new borrowing requirements
would lead to a continuous increase inthe NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio, eventually breaching
the threshold in about 2018. This underlines the importance o f reducing the deficit over the
long run for safeguarding debt sustainability. In the baseline, the increase in domestic
revenues reduces the deficit while keepingexpenditures high.




l7 The combination stress test also leads to a breach of the threshold for the NFV o f debt-to-exports ratio, again on account
o fthe largeexport volatility.
   Expenditures increase relative to the baselinebecause o fthe larger interest payments; real GDP growth is also higher in
the alternative scenario, because growth inthe baseline is dampenedby the stronger revenue effort.

A second country-specific scenario with a more pessimistic export outlook results in a
marginal breach of the threshold. Cotton exports have risen sharply inrecent years, mostly
because the area under cultivation i s larger. The baseline assumes a slowdown in cotton
export growth as the sector matures, with most output gains coming from productivity
improvements. The alternative scenario assumes no productivity gains and a constant area
under cultivation, so the volume o f cotton exports stays at the 2007 level. As a consequence,
the exports-to-GDP ratio would decline substantially relative to the baseline (Figure 1.3).
This would lead the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio to breach its threshold, but only marginally.
Of course, that scenario would likely require additional external adjustment, which has not
beenconsidered inthis analysis.

 A country-specificscaling-up of aid scenario makes it clear that additional aid should
  beinthe formof grants.Itis assumedthat aid is scaled upbetween 2010 and 2015 andthen
  scaled down to converge with the baseline by 2020. Three scenarios are considered: (i)a
  small scaling-up with aid inflows increasing by 2 percent o f GDP by 2015, equivalent to an
  aid increase o f about 20 percent relative to the average aid-to-GDP ratio in 2007-09; (ii)                                    a
 moderate scaling-up with aid inflows of 5 percent o f GDP, an increase o f about 50 percent;
  and (iii)    a large scaling-up with aid o f 10 percent of GDP, Le., a doubling o f aid (Figure 1.4).
  The impact on growth is modeled on cross-country empirical evidence, taking into account
 the declining marginal returns o f aid.lg As in the baseline, a 50:50 split between loans and
  grants i s assumed. In spite o f the high grant share and borrowing on highly concessional
 terms, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio increases noticeably in all three scenarios and
 breaches its threshold in the moderate and large scenario. This suggests that a scaling up o f
 aid should rely mostly on grants to safeguard debt sustainability.




    See Michael Clemens, Steven Radelet, and RikhilBhavani (2004), "Counting Chickens When They Hatch: The Short
 Term Effect o f Aid on Growth. Center for Global Development," Working Paper No. 44. The authors distinguish between
 different types o f aid and focus intheir growth regressions on "so-called short-impact" aid, which i s most likely to have a
 growth impact over the mediumterm. Simulations are based on the authors' preferred conservative specification, which is
 that short-impact aid equivalent to 1percent o f GDP has an impact on growth o f about 0.5 percent ifthe country receives no
 aid. Given the already large aid inflows underthe baseline, a 1percent o f GDP increase in aid would raise growth about
 0.2 percent, declining further to about 0.1 percent under the large scaling-up scenario.

    The domestic debt stock in Burkina Faso is low. As o f September 2006 domestic debt
    totaled less than 3 percent o f GDP. Following the large inflow o f privatization receipts in
    January 2007, the Government i s practically free o f domestic debt. The fiscal framework
    envisions zero domestic financing for most o f the projection period, keeping domestic debt
    very low. Thus, public debt dynamics are similar to those o f external debt.

    The public debt "no reform" alternativescenario confirmsthat presentdeficits are too
    highto stabilize debt ratios. The `no reform' scenario (Table 1.4 and Figure 1.5) freezes the
    primary deficit at its 2006 value-about                      4%percent o f GDP-and                 simulates the resulting
    debt dynamics. This yields continuously increasing debt ratios-this                              i s not surprisingbecause
    the 2006 primary deficit i s higher than that necessary to stabilize the nominal debt-to-GDP
    ratio at its post-MDRI level (Box 1.3).

                                      B. Conclusions

Burkina Faso's risk of debt distress has moderated. While all baseline scenarios are
comfortably below their policy-dependent thresholds, they depend critically on the
assumption that domestic revenues continue to increase and lead to declining deficits after
grants, thus reducing new borrowing requirements. The risk embodied in domestic revenue
performance i s compounded by Burkina's vulnerable export performance, which i s
essentially based on one product, cotton. MDRIrelief has reduced the risk o f debt distress,
but risks pertaining to revenue and export performance remain. Thus, it is essential to
implement the revenue reform program forcefully and to work on broadening the export
base.

                      Box A10.3: BurkinaFaso StandardDebt Dynamics-

The link between the fiscal stance and debt dynamics in Burkina Faso can be considered in a standard
model where the evolution o f the public debt-to-GDP ratio (d ( t )) i s a fhction o f the growth rate o f real
GDP (g ), the real interest rate on Govemment debt (r ), and the primary balance on the Govemment
budget (pb ):

(1)        d (t 1) = d (t)[(1+ r )/ (1 g)] -pb .
               +                              +
The primarysurplus needed to keep the debt ratio stable (pb' ) is:

(2)        Pb` = [ ( r - g ) / ( l + g ) ] d ( t ) .
Baseline projections for Burkina Faso assume an average real GDP growth rate o f about g = 6.1% ,and
the average real interest rate i s approximately r = -0.6%, reflecting a very high share o f external debt
with very low nominal interest rates, which implies a negative real interest rate overall.

The model allows for calculating the                                Box Table 1: Debt-stabilizingprimarybalance
primary balance that is consistent
with stabilizing either the pre- or                      Debt-to-GDP ratio                    Debt-stabilizingprimary balance
post-MDRI debt-to-GDP ratio (Box
Table 1). The        baseline        scenario
assumes an average primary deficit o f                   Pre-MDRI level: l /
about 1.8 percent o f GDP, which is                               43%                                        -2.8%
close to the debt-stabilizing primary
deficit for the post-MDRI level.                          Post-MDN level: 2/
Hence, debt dynamics are relatively                               20%                                        -1.3%
