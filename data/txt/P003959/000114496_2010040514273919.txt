                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower to:
(a) implement the Statement; (b) carry out a priority fertilizer
investment program; (c) identify the scope for improved efficiency
in fertilizer marketing and distribution; and (d) assess the ferti-
lizer industry's environmental impact and standards and develop an
environmental management program therefor.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:
1.    Construction of a new ammonia/urea plant at Gresik with a
capacity of about 1,350 tons per day of ammonia and about 1,400 tons
per day of urea, including provision of engineering services and
licenses; and provision of highly qualified fertilizer engineers to
assist in the overall carrying out of this Part of the Project.

2.    Modernization of Gresik's existing fertilizer plants, inter
alia, to improve plant output, performance and maintenance, and to
ameliorate environmental pollution, including provision of engineer-
ing services and licenses; and provision of highly qualified ferti-
lizer engineers to assist in the overall carrying out of this Part
of the Project.
Part B:
1.    Carrying out of optimization investments to, inter alia,
improve production, energy and raw material efficiency, plant main-
tenance, and pollution control in PIM's fertilizer plants, including
provision of engineering services and licenses; and provision of
highly qualified fertilizer engineers to assist in the carrying out
of this Part of the Project.
2.    Carrying out of optimization investments to, inter alia,
improve production, energy and raw material efficiency, plant
maintenance, and pollution control in Kaltim's fertilizer plants,
including provision of engineering services and licences; and
provision of highly qualified fertilizer engineers to assist in the
carrying out of this Part of the Project.
3.    Carrying out of optimization investments to, inter alia,
improve production, energy and raw material efficiency, plant
maintenance, and pollution control in Kujang's fertilizer plants,
including provision of engineering services and licenses; and
provision of highly qualified fertilizer engineers to assist in the
carrying out of this Part of the Project.
4.    Carrying out of optimization investments to, inter alia,
improve production, energy and raw material efficiency, plant
maintenance, and pollution control in Pusri's fertilizer plants,
