 SUPPORT TO THE SOCIAL PROTECTION SYSTEM IN HEALTH PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
This Restructuring Paper proposes a level-two restructuring of the Mexico Social
Protection System in Health Project (Loan 7860-MX, PE-P116226) to strengthen its
Results Framework and Monitoring. The proposed changes would allow for a more
accurate measurement of Project progress and would not modify the Project
Development Objective (PDO) or the associated outcome targets.


PROJECT STATUS
The Loan to finance the Social Protection System in Health Project, in the amount of
US$1,250 million, was approved by the Board on March 25, 2010 and became effective
on December 30, 2010. The objective of the Project is to (i) initially preserve and later
expand the Popular Health Insurance’s coverage of people without contributory social
security and (ii) strengthen the capacity of the National Commission for Social Protection
in Health (the Commission) and State Health Systems to effectively administer the
entitlements of the Popular Health Insurance.

Since the approval of the Project in March, 2010, implementation progress has been
satisfactorily. There has been major progress in expanding the coverage of the Popular
Health Insurance (PHI), including vulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples and
beneficiaries of Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program, Oportunidades. As of June
30, 2011, 48.4 million Mexicans have been enrolled in the PHI exceeding by far the end
of Project target of 41.1 million. In addition, there has been significant progress in
implementing activities to strengthen the capacity to administer the entitlements of the
PHI, in particular, in the coordination between the Commission and State Health
Systems, increasing the knowledge of affiliates about their entitlements and in the
rolling-out the health risk management program of the PHI.

Full disbursement of the Loan is expected before the closing date (December 31, 2013).
As of September 27, 2011, approximately US$908.6 million or 73% of the total loan
amount have been disbursed. The project’s first audit report is to be delivered no later
than October 31, 2011.


PROPOSED CHANGES
In a letter dated May 16, 2011, the Government of Mexico requested the Bank to modify
the project’s Results Framework and Monitoring to allow for a more accurate
measurement of Project progress and impact. The proposed modifications would fill gaps
                                            6
in the original results framework, take advantage of improvements in data availability,
correct for inadequate sources of information and simplify indicators to better capture
progress. The proposed changes would not imply changes to the Loan Agreement. They
have been discussed and in principle agreed upon during a supervision mission in
February 2011. The modifications are summarized below. The revised, complete results
framework and monitoring is presented in Annex 1.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY
The proposed changes would improve the results framework and monitoring. They
would not affect the PDO and the associated outcome targets. They would not imply
changes to the Loan Agreement. They would not alter the economic, financial, technical
and social aspects of the Project as appraised. They would not amend the appraised
components or require the reallocation of funds or changes to the implementation
arrangements.
