APPRAISAL OF
TECJCI FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUS'.:ONS
i.        This report appraises the proposed Tecuci Fertilizer Project for
which the Government of Romania has requested financing from the Bank. The
project consists of a urea/diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer plant with
a production capacity of about 420,000 tons per year (TPY) of urea and
208,000 TPY of DAP, equivalent to 225,000 TPY of nitrogen (N) and 100,000
TPY of phosphate (P205) in terms of nutrients. The plant is to be located
at Tecuci in the province of Galati, some 250 km north-east of Bucharest.
The project forms part of Romania's large scale program to expand its ferti-
lizer production and also allow a more economical use of its natural gas re-
sources; it will be the eighth fertilizer plant to be commissioned in Romania
between 1973 and 1978. Total financing required for the project, including
working capital and interest during construction, is estimated at Lei 4.0
billion or US$200.8 mil:iion equivalent, of which US$87.0 is foreign exchange;
capital costs are based on the price level prevailing in the first quarter
of 1974 and include realistic contingencies.
ii.       The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million equivalent would cover
about 30% of the total financing required and about 69% of the foreign ex-
change expenditures of the project: it would finance all direct foreign
exchange costs for engirneering fees, imported equipment, interest during
construction on the Bank loan and US$2.3 million of US$15 million imported
stainless steel required for tie project. The loan does not cover US$6.1
million in equipment already financed through suppliers credits, working
capital (US$8.2 million) and the remainder of imported stainless steel. The
residual financing will be provided by Romanian sources in the form of
interest free advances to the Tecuci Enterprise which is to carry out and
operate the project. The Bank loan would be made to the Investment Bank
with the guarantee of the Government of Romania for 15 years, including 4-1/2
years of grace at an assumed interest rate of 7-1/4%; the Enterprise would
receive the funds at 9% and on otherwise equal terms, with the guarantee
fee of 1-3/4% accruisg to the State.
iii.      In the recent past, fertilizer consumption in Romania has been
limited by domestic production and priority given to exports. The large ex-
pansion of fertilizer production facilities in Romania is planned to satisfy
domestic market needs as well as allow an increase in exports of nitrogenous
fertilizer from about 600,000 tons at present to 1.1 million tons in the late
1970s. As a result, Romania should become one of the world's largest exporters
of N fertilizers. Projected production and domestic consumption of respec-
tively about 2.4 million and 1.4 million tons of N in 1980 will be more than
twice present levels. Substantial efforts in the agricultural sector in
Romania will therefore be necessary to achieve the projected growth rates in



- ii -
agricultural output and fertilizer use, but in view of the substantially in-
creased domestic fertilizer production and the renewed emphasis being given
to agriculture in Romania it is expected that these goals will be reached.
Though all of the project's output is intended to be marketed in the region
surrounding Tecuci, in economic terms the project's nitrogen capacity will
add to Romania's export capacity. This is not so, however for the project's
phosphate capacity since Romania is unlikely to continue to have an exportable
surplus of phosphate fertilizer. No major problems are foreseen in selling
the project's production domestically or abroad given Romania's already well
established position as major and competitive fertilizer exporter in an
expanding international market.
iv.       The Fertilizer Central Craiova, which is the parent organization
for all fertilizer production units in Romania will be the sponsor and parent
organization of the Tecuci Enterprise. Fertilizer production at Tecuci will
be based on domestic natural gas to be supplied from the existing National
pipeline system, on imported ?hosphate rock to come mainly from Morocco and
sulfur from Poland under long-term contracts. Principal responsibility for
project execution will be witl. the Tecuci Enterprise and IPROCHIM, the
Ministry of Chemical Industry's engineering company. Process license agree-
ments will be concluded with well-known international fi m   from the Nether-
lands, the UK and US and IPROCHIM will use its own technology for some of the
plant sections. The project in a large part will be similar to other ferti-
lizer projects now under construction in Romania and will utilize a substan-
tial amount of Romanian equipment. Although it has not yet been proven that
these projects can be operated as planned, the technical risks for the proj-
ect are acceptable taking into account IPROCHIM's general experience in build-
ing fertilizer plants and the provision of assistance from the process
licensors.
v.        The project is expected to start production in January 1978 and
will have a sound financial structure. Based on the input and output prices
which are all set by the Government and using the Bank's normal measurements,
the project's financial indicators such as debt service coverage, debt/equity
ratio and current ratio are acceptable given the specific financing mechanism
for industrial enterprises in Romania. However, due to pecularities in the
Romanian pricing system, the financial return of the project is low at 4.5Z,
although it would increase to 11% aiter proper adjustments. In general,
Romanian prices of inputs in relation to outputs in the fertilizer industry,
were set in the late 1960.; they have not been changed since and are therefore
no longer in line with international costs and prices. As an example, the
price of the nitrogen nutrient in urea, Tecuci's major product is about 30%
lower than that in other nitrogenous fertilizers and the Romanian sulfur price
is about twice the international price.
vi.       The Government is considering a revision of prices over the forth-
coming years. It is not yet known to what extent prices of gas, oil, power
and imported fertilizer- raw materials as well as fertilizer prices themselves



- iii -
will change other than that the general trend will most likely be upward to
reflect more closely current or anticipated international prices. Whatever
adjustments in fertilizer inptts and outputs may be made, however, these are
not expected to adversely affect the financial viability of the industry, and
thus of the project, in view of the Government's policy to provide for reason-
able earnings after covering average production costs. The financial risks
of the project are therefore essentially limited to its physical success;
i.e., successful project construction and operations. Both these risks are
judged to be acceptable.
vii.      The economic return of the project is a satisfactory 13.2%.  It is
based on a conservative :evenue/cost structure, using estimated long-term
international prices for all tradeable inputs and outputs; specifically US$110
per ton of urea f.o.b. bulk as export and US$180 per ton of DAP c.i.f. bulk
as import substitution. Both assumptions are well below present international
market prices. As noted above, the project's main raw material is domestic
natural gas, which is the ideal feedstock for the production of nitrogen
fertilizer. In addition, Romania has substantial experience in equipment
manufacturing as well as in operations of chemical plants. These factors
give Romania a comparat-ve advantage for producing fertilizers. Indirect
economic benefits from She project will be derived from the creation of indus-
trial activity in Tecuci area, increased domestic fertilizer consumption and
additional foreign exchange earnings. Total net foreign exchange benefits
of the project are estimated at about US$36 million per year.
viii.     As mentioned previously the Government has a very direct and major
influence on the conception, preparation, financing and operation of industrial
projects. However, while investment decisions are seemingly made primarily
to meet production targets, economic considerations are also taken into account
when determining the scope, size and location of industrial enterprises, and
so are social factors. Romania has succeeded in developing its industry rea-
sonably efficiently with quite broad geographic dispersion; this achievement
also holds for the fertilizer industry in general. The project here considered
is of high priority both in helping the future development of Romanian agricul-
ture and in providing some additional and much needed fertilizer in the world
market.
ix.       Based on the agreements with the Government and the Investment Bank,
the project is suitable for a Bank loan equivalent to US$60.0 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Romania has requested a Bank loan of US$60.0
million eqtdvalent to cover about 69% of the foreign exchange expenditures
for a fertilizer plant in Tecuci, some 250 km north-east of Bucharest (Map
IBRD 10671). The proposed project, which is sponsored by the Ministry of
Chemical Industry is to produce 420,000 metric tons per year (TPY) of urea
and 208,000 TPY of DAP, equivalent to 225,000 TPY of N and 100,000 TPY of
p 20 in nutrient terms. 1/ Total financing required for the project is
estimated at about Lei 4.0 billion cr US$200.8 million. Except for the Bank
loan and US$6.1 million supplier's credits, the financing will be provided
by the Government. The project wouli be the eighth fertilizer plant in
Romania to be commissioned between 1973 and 1978, and in part would be a
duplicate of some of the plants now under construction. The ambitious ex-
pansion of fertilizer production is based on the Government's policy to use
its natural gas resources more economically and is intended to not only keep
Romania largely independent of fertilizer imports but even allow some increase
in exports.
1.02      The project was identified in April 1973 and a preliminary techno-
economic feasibility study was submitted to the Bank in July 1973. As a
result of the appraisal mission in September 1973, consisting of Messrs.
M. Ferber (Chief) and D.E. Brown of the Industrial Projects Department as well
as H. S. Kohli and E. Kipp of the EMENA Region Program Department, and a second
mission in November 1973, the project scope was modified to better meet domes-
tic agronomical and export market requirements. The appraisal was completed
in March 1974 following completion of a revised preliminary feasibility study
and another mission to Romania. The definite techno-economic feasibility
study which is necessary for the detailed incorporation of the project into
the Romanian Plan is new being finalized and is expected to be approved by
the Government by October 1974.
II. FERTILIZER INDUSTRY AND ORGANIZATION
A.   History of Fertilizer Central
2.01      The present organizational structure of the Romanian fertilizer
sector has evolved over the last few years and has followed similar trends
in other sectors of the economy. Creation of Centrals--comparable to holding
companies for enterprises in one or more related sectors of economic activity
--was one of the major institutional changes decided by the National Party
Conference of 1967.
2.02      In February 1971, the first fertilizer central was established to
coordinate, plan and supervise the various activities in the fertilizer
field. However, at that time the fertilizer industry was expanding rapidly
and in mid-1972 two new fertilizer centrals, Fagaras and Turnu Magurele,
1/   A glossary of technical terms is contained in Annex 1.



were created along geographical lines to replace the Central in Bucharest;
Fagaras controlling all activities ia the north of the country and Turnu
Magurele in the south (IBRD Map 10671). Following the latest reorganization
of the economy in early 1973, when tiae total number of centrals was reduced
in all sectors, a single central for the fertilizer industry was formed at
Craiova in April 1973. The Fertilizer Central Craiova, which is one of the
nine centrals under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Chemical Industry,
is the sponsor of the project and the parent organization of the Tecuci
Enterprise.
B.   Plant Facilities and Operations
2.03      The main existin3 fertilizer production facilities under the
Craiova Central are at Craiova, Turgu Mures, Turnu Magurele, Piatra Neamt
and Navodari. The historical production is shown in detail in Annex 2-1
and is summarized below:

Phosphate (P205)   52      111    182    244    313    435        16%       21%
2.04      Prior to 1960, the fertilizer industry consisted of a few very
small plants, producing primarily superphosphate and ammonium nitrate. The
first significant capacity expansion occurred during 1964-1973 and comprised
essentially several new, relatively large, ammonia-based plants to produce
urea and ammonium nitrate (AN) as well as sulfur-based triple superphosphate
plants. At present, there are nine fertilizer plants in Romania, six pro-
ducing only nitrogenous, two only phosphatic and one mixed NP fertilizers.
Total nutrient manufacture in Romania today is more than seven tines as
large as ten years ago and the industry is currently engaged in another round
of expansion in which toth new plants will be built and several existing
plants be enlarged (para. 2.09).
2.05      The operating and maintenance performance of the Romanian fertilizer
industry is good. Capacity utilization in recent years has reportedly been
*UXY' of "defined" capacity which is somewhat less than design capacity as
tAs.Aally defined. In general, operations are excellent and plants probably
operate at about 90% or above of true design capacity once the commissioning
period is completed. Plant staff appears well trained and knowledgeable in
respect to operations and technology. Each pldht has a large workshop and



- 3 -
most maintenance, including the rebuilding of spare parts, is performed by
the enterprises themselves. The Craiova Central reports no difficulties in
the supply of power and natural gas, both obtained from national networks
and also other materials appear to be readily available.
2.06      Most fertilizer for exports is sold in bags, usually plastic or
plastic-lined jute, but for domestic consumption a significant quantity is
shipped in bulk. Each p;Lant is served by rail and road with most products
using rail transport. All fertilizer for domestic consumption and exports
is contracted for in advance and allocated to individual plants and except
for dispatching from the factory, marketing or distribution activities are
not within the responsibility of the Central or the factories (paras. 3.13
and 3.15).
2.07      The individual plants are organized as separate entities (Combinates)
and their managements have as their main responsibility the achievement of
production targets. The Craiova Central has coordinating and supervising
functions particularly with respect to production and investment planning and
execution; it also has major responsibilities for centralized activities such
as spare parts, supplies, operations of workshops and training. The general
managers of each Combinatte report directly to the senior management of the
Central whose organizat-on chart is shown in Aanex 2-2.
2.08      The projected fertilizer production in Romania is shown in detail
in Annex 2-1 and is summarized below:

Prel.                                        Growth Rates
1973   1974   1975   1976   1978   1980        1973-80
Nitrogen (N)        1,110  1,397  1,610  1,970  2,370  2,475          12%

2.09      The substantial planned production increase, again more than doub.ing
fertilizer output between 1973 and 1980, is the result of a second large
expansion program, initiated in 1970 and to be achieved through eight new
fertilizer plants. At that time (1970), Romania decided to build six large
and modern, essentially duplicate plants, not only with the objective of
increasing fertilizer output more easily and efficiently, but also to further



-4-
s;tm-alate the domestic engineering and equipment manufacturing capabilities
in the petrochemical industry.  The eight new facilities include two ammonia/
urea plants taat were receatly commissioned (1973); six ammonia plants con-
tracted from Kellogg (UK/US); four NPK plants from Norsk-Hydro (Norway); 1/
an ammonia/urea expansion at Turgu Mures; and the Tecuci project. The indi-
vidual plants and their raspective capacities, in the order of commissioning
are:

W4ith the exception of the Tecuci project, all other plants are either on
stream or being implemented; construction is about on schedule and expected
to be completed in accordance with the above timetable.
C.   Financial Analysis and Romanian Financial System
2.10      The conventional financial analysis usually applied by the Bank to
evaluate the performance of commercial organizations is of limited significance
in the case of Romanian enterprises. Under the country's centrally planned
economy, investment decisions are tiaken by the State and not by individual
enterprises, in conformity with national economic and social priorities.
Annex 2-3 describes the system followed to arrive at investment and financing
decisions. The planning and financing of the fertilizer sector is integrated
with that of all other sectors of the economy to form the Five-Year Socio-
Economic Plan; the current Plan covers the 1971-75 period. Based on the
targets specified in the Five-Year Plan, an annual production plan is speci-
f ied for each sector by the Grand National Assembly. These broad production
targets are converted by the centrals into production goals for individual
en-erprises. The enterprises then draw up their annual production and finan-
c a1 plans to meet the specified targets; the annual financial plans are sub-
equently collated from different centrals in a sector and submitted by the
;cal Ministry concarned to the State Planning Committee and the Ministry
, 'inance for preparation of the annual National Financial Plan.
1/   Norsk-Hydro is an operating company that owns the NPK process technology.
Thle engineering fi:-m that supplied the design is Davy-Power-Gas (US/UK).



2.11      The State Budget makes the necessary provisions for funds requested
by various enterprises in order to meet their production targets. The Finan-
cial Plan and the State Budget are submitted by the Council of Ministers for
approval by the Grand National Assembly after which they become law. Since
all commercial entities are owned by the Government, most important investment
decisions are also taken by it. All projects estimated to cost over Lel 70
million (US$3.5 million eqnivalent) are approved by the Council of Ministers
after analysis by the Ministries concerned, the Investment Bank and the State
Planning Committee. Projects costing between Lei 30 to 70 million can be
approved by the Ministry, while projects costing between Lei 10-30 million
are generally approved by the Central. The enterprise can plan investments
in projects costing up to Lei 10 iiillion on its own authority. However,
irrespective of the level at which an investment is approved, expenditure
connected with it must be included in the Annual Financial Plan which is
ultimately approved by th3 Council of Ministers.
2.12      In addition to the above final decision powers over the physical
and financial planning o' individual enterprises, the State also determines
all prices. Consequently, the primary responsibility of Romanian enterprises
is to meet the physical iroduction targets set for them by higher authorities
and to make optimum use of resources provided to them. Since both the product
mix and prices of all inputs and outputs are pre-determined, the financial
profitability is neither a true measure of an enterprise's efficiency nor an
important factor in investment decisions. The following financial analysis
of the Craiova Central should be viewed in this context.
2.13      The Craiova Central and the individual enterprises under its
jurisdiction prepare annual financial statements. Although, as described in
Annex 2-4, these statements and their frequency differ from those prepared
by most Bank borrowers, they are well suited to the Romanian industrial and
financial system and with some minor modifications (para. 5.07) provide
sufficient information for purposes of the Eank's project evaluation.
2.14      Since the Creiova Central would be the sponsor of the project and
the parent organizatiorn of the Tecuci Enterprise, its past and near future
financial performance--and thus that of the consolidated position of all its
enterprises--is discussed below and financial statements are summarized in
the following table from Annexes 2-5 and 2-6:

/1   Year first Fertilizer Central was established.
/2   1973 figures preliminary; no balance sheet forecasts are prepared by
Romanian Enterprises and Centrals.
2.15      The profitability of the Fertilizer Central has been good and is
expected to improve further in the next few years after commissioning of
several large modern plants presently under construction. Between 1971 and
1973, benefits (profits before tax) nearly tripled while sales went up by
only 43%; during the same period benefits as % of sales just about doubled
(from 13.3% to 25.9%) and are expected to rise to 28.5Z by 1975. This rela-
tively high profitability reflects satisfactory operations but also Romanian
pricing policy.
2.16      In Romania, the Government sets prices on the basis of the average
costs of production of all units manufacturing the same product or groups of
products plus a margin of profit which also is determined by the State.
Details about pricing policies are given in Annex 2-7. As is practically
true for all prices in Romania, present fertilizer and raw material prices
were established years ago, based on production cost of the then existing
producers which on the whole were using higher cost processes than the more
rpcent generation of fertilizer plants. The possibility of future price
nanges, as well as Romanian fertilizer input and out prices in comparison
with international prices, are discussed in para. 6.01.
_17       The Craiova Central has a satisfactory financial structure consi-
dering the special characteristics of Romanian investment practices and the
cash flow system (Annex 2-3 and para. 6.06).  The current ratio of the
Fertilizer Central was 1.0 at the end of 1971 and 1972 and is expected to
remain at about the same level in the future despite the forecast sharp



-7-
increase in self-generated funds. This is so because under the Romanian
system any surpluses in cash flow are automatically transferred to the
State Budget and the liquidity of an enterprise is kept at a minimum level
since all essential financial needs, be they for investments or operations,
are provided and guaranteed by the State. As most Romanian enterprises,
the Craiova Central has incurred practically no long-term debt in recent
years except for some medium-term credits extended by the Investment Bank
for the financing of equipment for projects under construction. As described
in Annex 2-3, in practice these credits are paid off as soon as a plant is
commissioned. As a result, at the end of 1972 the Craiova Central had no
long-term debt outstanding and equity (state advances) accounted for about
86% of total assets.
D.   Investment Bank
2.18      The Investment Bank is the channel for all sources of major domestic
investment financing including (a) budget allocations; (b) depreciation funds;
and (c) share of planned benefLts of enterprises allocated for investment.
Recently, IB has also started to make credits on its own, though funds avail-
able for this purpose are still relatively small. However, IB administers and
controls all investment funds of the State Budget (except for agriculture and
food processing) and acts as the main fiscal agent of the Government. The
President of IB reports directly to the Ministry of Finance which has compre-
hensive authority in the planning and financing of all projects.
2.19      The Investment Bank is a competent organization and has wide-ranging
responsibilities in the implementation of projects. It plays a key role in
the preparation, evaluation, procurement, execution, disbursement of invest-
ment funds and supervision of all enterprises. For all projects, IB reviews
the technical and economic study before submission to the Council of Ministers
for formal approval. Thereafter, TB ensures that the project is executed
according to the approved plan. Tn the case of Tecuci, it will check, with
the assistance of IPROCHIM and ROMCHIM, all orders for equipment--domestic and
foreign-before they are placed, will comment on any change in contracts, and
can impose penalties on defaulting parties. Its inspectors check the appro-
priateness of equipment deliveries and whether the projects are progressing
according to schedule. All local project-cost financing is channeled through
and authorized by IB which also keeps complete accounting records for each
project until completion and which is therefore well suited for reporting to
the Bank on the progress in the implementation of the Tecuci Project.
2.20      During the operational phase of the project, IB's functions are
limited to checking whether the enterprise is meeting the targets set in
the Investment Plan.  I3 has no iegal authority to bring its views to bear
directly on the managem2nt ot an en.erprise.  In practice, however, IB can
recommend necessary operational action to the Ministry of Finance, which,
in turn, can act throughi the Xrinistry concerned with the project. It is
for the reason of the inportant and broad role that the Investment Bank is
playing in the industrial field, particularly in the project's implementa-
tion, that it has been chosen as the Borrower of the Bank loan.

I-I.  MARKET AND MARKETING
3.01       Past and future developments of fertilizer demand and supply in
Romania including background information on organization, crops and the
potential of the country's agriculture are discussed in detail in Annexes
3-1 to 3-4 and briefly described below.
A.    Agriculture in Romaaia
3.02       Romania's potential for increasing agricultural output is very
good. About two-thirds of its total area can be classified as agricultural
land (14.7 million ha) and almost half as arable. 1/ The average rainfall
per year varies from 400 mm to more than 1,400 mm in various parts of the
country and is also not too well distributed throughout the year (July-
September is normally the dry season) but supplemental irrigation from the
Danube and other rivers has been increasing substantially. Maize and wheat
are the most important field crops in Romania covering about 37% of agricul-
tural land; natural grasslands and pastures represent another one-third,
which at present is not too productive but should become increasingly so,
as more attention is being given to meat production; the remaining 30% of
agricultural land are taken up by rye, barley, oats, rice, oilcrops such as
sunflowers and soybeans and other important field crops such as sugar beets,
potatoes, fodder crops, fruits, vineyards and a wide assortment of vegetables.
3.03       Since World War II, Romanian agriculture has undergone a reorgani-
zation which was completed in the late 1960's. State farms now make up
about 17% of total arable land, cooperative farms 75%, and the remaining 8%
are private farms. Also, some 10% of the area within the cooperative farms
are individual plots of the workers. Within this system the state farms
are more productive, due to a preference in allocation of resources including
investments and fertilizer supply.
1/    Details of the agricultural situation in Romania are contained in
Annex 3-1.



-9-
3.04      With highly productive soils, good climate, potential for irrigation
and eaay access to major world markets, Romania has the capability of rapid
agricultural development. Almost half of Romania's labor force is employed
in agriculture. In view of this, the Government has given high priority to
the agricultural sector particularly through increases in agricultural invest-
ments, agricultural research and fertilizer application. The Tecuci project
forms part of this program to increase domestic fertilizer consumption and
provide flexibility in types of fertilizer as an important input for agricul-
tural growth, and at the same time maintain or even increase exports of
agricultural products and fertilizer (para. 3.10).
B.   Past Fertilizer Growth in Romania
3.05      Fertilizer production, consumption and exports from 1960 to 1973
are shown in detail in Annex 3-2 and are summarized in the following table:

/1   Consumption figures from the Ministry of Agriculture are based on agri-
cultural years ending March and production figures from the Ministry of
Chemical Industry are based on calendar year8; therefore the remainder
(apparent exports) on a year-by-year basis is not fully consistent with
the actual exports shown in Annex 3-2.
As pointed out in para. 2.04, fertilizer production has increased rapidly in
the past and, as a result, domestic consumption and exports have also risen.
Given Romania's foreign exchange constraints as well as recent high interna-
tional fertilizer prices, priority was given to exports, particlarly in
recent years, thereby decreasing tie relative allocation for domestic



- 10 -
consumption.  Thus, while consumption iicreased sharply during the 1960's,
it has levelled off since 1970; compounded growth rates between 1960-1965,
1965-1970, 1970-1973 for N amounted to 40%, 21%, and 6% and for P205 19%,
13% and 7% respectively. Potash is supplied from imported material and con-
sumption has been relatively low.
C.   Fertilizer Market Forecast for Romania

/1   The forecast consumption of potash, all from imports, is shown in
Annex 3-3.  By 1980, consumption should increase to 320,000 TPY K20
from a 1972 level of 45,000 TPY.
3.07      The fertilizer production projections are based on the Romanian
forecast with minor reductions in 1974-1977 and assume full capacity achieve-
r:ent as defined by the Romanian authorities after the second year of commis-
sioning. In view of the difference in the Romanian definition of capacity
(about 10% lower than design capacity) and the substantial operating experience
of the Craiova Central, the production targets set for the end of the decade
appear achievable. The total N production in 1980 of close to 2.5 million
tons is expected to include about 40% as urea, 32% as calcium-ammonium nitrate
(CAN) or AN, and the remaining 28% as complex NPK fertilizer. At present urea
accounts for 58%, AN or CAN for 38% and NPK for 4%.



- 11 -
3.08      The above consumption projections are Bank estimates and take into
account forecasts of the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture and those contained
in a fertilizer market study prepared by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
for the Bank. These separate foret:asts vary because of different assumptions
made in them; essentially, the Rominian projections predict a higher ferti-
lizer application relative to agricultural output. The Bank projections are
based on an annual growth rate of agricultural output of about 5.5% (as
against 3.5% per annum from 1960-1972). In the Romanian context, past ferti-
lizer consumption growth is not of much help in determining future growth
rates; the substantial projected increases of fertilizer consumption in Romania
appear achievable because of (1) insufficient fertilizer having been available
in recent years on account of export priority; (2) increasing emphasis being
given to agriculture as also reflected by the large increase in planned ferti-
lizer production over the next few years that will enable Romania not only to
step up domestic fertilizer application significantly but at the same time
satisfy its needs for exports; (3) fertilizer consumption in Romania not being
limited by decisions of individual farms or karmers; and (4) the presence of
a physical distribution system which can overcome constraints through the
central allocation of necessary resources. Finally and most importantly,
consumption is more a function of State planning and allocation than of market
and price considerations.
3.09      The above Bank forecast of future fertilizer consumption has
therefore not been determined by extrapolation of historical consumption
figures but by an end-use analysis (Annex 3-3) taking into account the
specific conditions of agriculture in Romania such as land availability,
cropping pattern, crop production goals, soil conditions and availability of
irrigation, investment 1and other agricultural inputs. The forecast indicates
an average annual growtlh for N consumption from 1973 to 1980 of about 18% and
for P205 of about 19%; it can be compared to the growth rates since the early
1960's as shown in para. 3.05.
3.10      A comparison of fertilizer use in Romania and a number of other
selected countries on a kg/ha and per capita basis is given below:

Comparison of fertilizer consumption among countries should be used with care
because of the differences in land type, climate and agricultural practices.
Nevertheless, the table shows that fertilizer consumption in Romania is low
in relation to its neighbor countries and does provide some additional indi-
cation of the potential of growth of fertilizer use in Romania. By 1980,
Romania should have reached a level of about 260 kg/ha and 130 kg/capita
based on the Bank's consumption forecast; evidently fertilizer use in the
other countries will by then also have increased further.
D.   Fertilizer Exports
3.11      Romanian exports of N fertilizer are expected to increase from
about 600,000 tons at present to some 1.1 million tons by 1976, stay at that
level through the remainder of the decade and decrease gradually thereafter
in line with rising domestic consumption. Given a total international trade
of N fertilizers of currently about 7 million tons per year, Romania would
temporarily become one of the world's largest exporters of N fertilizers in
the mid- to late 1970's. The international fertilizer market is in an unusual
situation at present. Low fertilizer prices several years ago have resulted
in shutdowns of small and obsolete plants and have kept new investments at a
low level. As a result production capacity has not increased in line with
demand which had risen unusually rapidly because of two major unprecedented
circumstances: (1) many major food producing and food exporting countries
have had poor crops which they tried to increase by higher fertilizer appli-
cation; and (2) the problem of food shortage in developing countries has
been getting increasing public attention with a push for increased fertilizer
use.
3.12      In addition, the recent shortages in petroleum supplies and price
increases have added substantial uncertainties. Though it can be expected
that rising feedstock prices will be recovered through rising fertilizer
prices, major traditional fertilizer exporting countries which are short of
own hydrocarbon feedstocks such as Japan and Western Europe may not continue
to cover additional fertilizer demand in developing countries through expan-
sion of their production thereby gradually diminishing their position as
exporters. At present, fertilizer prices are substantially higher than two
years ago and supply is extremely tight. The tight fertilizer market is
expected to continue at least for another several years until substantial
new capacities will have come on stream such as in Russia, Mainland China,
India, the U.S., the Middle East, Venezuela, North Africa as well as Romania.
Thereafter the world market should again become more balanced. Romania will
be in an advantageous selling position as compared to most of the other
exporters because it (1) is in a relatively favorable geographical situation
to supply Western Europe, Africa, Eastern and Mediterranean countries; (2) is
a member of Comecon; and (3) has trade agreements virtually all over the
world. On the other hand, significant portions of world trade will involve
markets in Asia and America where Romania is at a freight disadvantage to
production based in the Persian Gulf and Venezuela.



- 13 -
3.13      It is not expected that Romania will have major exporting problems
since it is not only a competitive fertilizer producer but it already has a
vell established export market position and projected additional sales abroad
are relatively small. At present Romania is exporting about 600,000 tons of
N per year which would gradually increase and peak in 1976 with some 1.15
million tons of N. Long-term contracts exist for most of Romania's exports
(70%); 20% are supplied to cotntries on an established basis and the rest
(10%) represents spot sales. At present, Romania's major markets are Mainland
China (23%), India (15%), Egypt (12%), Algeria (9%), France (5%) and the
Federal Republic of Germany (5%). Practically all exports are undertaken
within bilateral trade agreements and are reportedly based on world market
prices.
E.   Fertilizer Marketing in Romania
1.  Fertilizer Allocation
3.14      The mechanism of determining the needs of fertilizer and its allo-
cation to the consumers must be evaluated in the context of Romania's planned
economy. The fertilizer needs of the farms are collated at the district level
and reported to the Ministry of Agriculture for incorporation into a country-
wide ministerial plan. This annual plan is then coordinated with the ferti-
lizer production plan of the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the central
planning authorities, taking export targets into account. Once the final
supply/allocation plan is approved by the Council of Ministers, each farm
is notified how much and what type cf fertilizer it will receive in the
forthcoming year. The corresponding information is given to the fertilizer
plants which thus have the year's production contracted in advance and in
accordance with a detailed delivery program. Given the restraints of domestic
fertilizer consumption in the past, requests for fertilizer have by far been
exceeding actual allocations. Within the allocation system preference has
been given to the State farms and to a lesser extent to Cooperatives whereas
individual farmers have been supplied with virtually no fertilizer. However,
it is expected that with increasing fertilizer production all demand, including
that of private farms, can be met.
2.   Distribution System
3.15      The distribution system has been simple and has worked reasonably
well. Each fertilizer plant is given information on delivery details such
as customer, quantity and type of fertilizer to be shipped, and the fertilizer
is moved directly from the plant by rail or truck to the farm with no inter-
mediate storage. Whenever fertilizer is available at the factory, it is
delivered and farms are required to accept it at that time. Little provision
has been made for proper storage of fertilizer on the farms and losses through
spills and improper storage, although no exact data exist, are probably signi-
ficant. Shipping distances, on average, are not large, and up to now, the
volume of fertilizer has been relatively small and can easily be handled by
the existing rail and trucking systems.



- 14 -
3.16      The Government has already undertaken some studies on the intro-
duction of immediate fertilizer storage facilities recognizing that the
envisaged increase in fertilizer consumption will require changes in the
distribution system particularly in storage facilities, transportation and
possibly methods of packaging (bulk vs. bagged) as well as close coordination
on all levels between producing and consuming units. The Bank intends to keep
-he matter under close review and the Borrower will submit to the Bank by not
later than the end of 1975 a detailed plan of how fertilizer, particularly
from the Tecuci plant, will be distributed.
3.17      Credit availability should not pose any restraints to an increased
consutption of fertilizers. Under the Romanian system, the planning of
economic activities is undertaken in physical terms and the funds necessary
for the movement of goods are an adjunct of such planning. If a farm unit
has an allocation for fertilizer as part of its overall production program,
the necessary credit requirements are already taken into consideration, and
the Agricultural Bank will finance the purchase of the fertilizer and pay
directly to the National Bank account of the fertilizer enterprise upon
delivery.
3.  Fertilizer Prices
3.18      Fertilizer selling prices in Romania are usually quoted on a bulk,
ex-factory basis and are as follows:
Fertilizer Prices in Romania - May 1974
(Bulk, ex-plant and excluding ex,:ise duty)
Lei/ton                    US$/ton
Material    Nutrient       Material    Nutrient

Urea (46% N)                  1,170        2,543         58.50        127.20

p205                                       2,724                      136.20
K20                                        1,420                       71.00
DAP (18-46-0)                 1,885                      94.30
Crsts for bagging amount to Lei 100/ton (US$5/ton) and for transportation
to about Lei 25/ton (US$1.25/ton) for average hauls of up to 300 km; these costs
and the excise duty which amounts to 1Q to 20% of the sales price are charged
separately to the consumer. Domestic fertilizer prices, as practically all
other prices in Romania, were fixed in the 1960's and have hardly changed since.
However, in view of recent substantial increases in imported raw materials
and higher capital costs due to inflation elsewhere, they are likely to be
adjusted in the near future in line with actual cost increases (para. 6.01).



- 15 -
3.19       Domestic prices are difficult to comlare with international prices
because of uncertainties in establishing a realistic exchange rate; current
abnormally high internatio-aal prices; and the fact that prices in Romania in
general have not changed for more than ten years. However, using an exchange
rate of Lei 20 per US$ and fertilizer world market prices prevailing in
1972/1973, i.e., prior to the recent sharp increases, Romanian fertilizer
prices are low by international standards (para. 6.02). Furthermore, the
fertilizer-crop price relationship in Romania is reasonable and should encourage
fertilizer consumption.
4.   Market Area for Tecuci Project
3.20       The natural market area for the Tecuci project is the Moldavia
region, which represents about one-fifth of Romania's agricultural land and
whose agricultural pattern is similar to that of the country as a whole
(Annex 3-4). Assuming that crops in the Moldavia region will be fertilized
at the same rate as in the rest of the country, the estimated fertilizer
demand in that region by 1980 would reach about 290,000 tons of N and about
175,000 tons of P205.  Thus, the Moldavia market is larger than the capacity
output of the project, i.e., 225,000 tons of N and 100,000 tons of P 205
respectively.
3.21       Distances froma other Romanian fertilizer plants to the Moldavia
region are relatively small and since the country's transport system is well
developed, distribution of fertilizer from other plants to Tecuci's marketing
area would also be econcmical. However, given the policy of the Government
to locate fertilizer plants in the center of agricultural regions it can be
expected that Tecuci as well would supply its prime marketing area and that
exports of fertilizer will be effected from other plants which have capacities
in excess of the needs of their su-7rounding agricultural regions, such as
Craiova, Turnu Magurele and Turgu ilures. On the other hand, the Tecuci
project will produce urea and DAP which--due to their high analyses-do not
only have low transport costs but are also traded widely internationally.
It may therefore be economically advantageous to Romania to export a major
portion of the project's output. This subject will be reviewed further
and will form part of the fertilizer distribution study to be undertaken by
the Government (para. 3.16).

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope and Location
4.01      The Project will have a capacity of 420,000 TPY urea and of 208,000
TPY DAP fertilizer with a total nutrient equivalent of 225,000 N and 100,000
TYP P205 and will allow adding potash to produce a wide range of NPK fertilizer
grades. The urea unit will be based on the Stamicarbon (Netherlands) urea pro-
cess and the DAP unit on technology from C & I Girdler (USA) as well as the
Romanian Process Engineering Compary for Chemical Industry (IPROCHIM). The
intermediate units required are a 200,000 TPY ammonia plant based on the
Kellogg (USAJUK) design, a duplicate of five other plants in Romania now under
construction; a 400,000 TPY sulfuric acid plant based on IPROCHIM technology;
and a 110,000 TPY P205 phosphoric acid plant. The project also includes gyp-
sum drying (for agricultural use and as additive to cement); gypsum wallboard
and/or blocks manufacture (para. 4.08); an air separation plant (9.6 billion
m3/yr); and a 2,300 TPY aluminum fluoride recovery unit A detailed descrip-
tion and a schematic flowsheet of the project are shown in Annex 4-1 and 4-2.
Final decisions on the detailed technology to be incorporated in the urea,
phosphoric acid and gypsum processes have not yet been taken and the several
choices being considered are discussed in para. 4.08 and Annex 4-1.
4.02      The project will be at a new site, 'about 75 km north of Galati,
and will include all necessary ancillary facilities such as storage, utilities,
workshops, roads and office buildings. The site is acceptable. It is adjacent
to rails and roads and requires no special or unusual amount of site prepara-
tion work. The Tecuci site has been chosen in accordance with the Government
policy of decentralization of industry and locating fertilizer factories in
the regional market area.
B.  Raw Materials and Utilities
4.03      The principal raw materials are (1) natural gas; (2) phosphate rock;
and (3) sulfur. Natural gas, produced domestically, will be delivered from
the existing national pipeline network requiring only moderate additional
investments for meeting the requirements of Tecuci (para. 5.03). Romania
currently produces about 30 billion m3 per year of gas with about 10% consumed
by the fertilizer industry, a share that is expected to increase to about 20%
by 1978. The project will consume about 0.5 billion m3 of natural gas per
year. Already proven gas reserves are adequate and no supply problem is there-
fora anticipated. Phosphate rock (350,000 TPY) and sulfur (138,000 TPY) will
be imported in bulk; phosphate rock through the port of Galati and then railed
to the site and sulfur by rail from Poland. Romania's total projected ferti-
lizer raw material import requirements (1978-80) are about 4 million TPY and
sufficient handling and transport facilities are reportedly available. Phos-
phiate rock is purchased mainly from Morocco, as part of a long-term contract
but also from the USA and the USSR, and sulfur equally on long-term contracts



- 17 -
from Poland; but other sources such as France, USSR, Canada, USA or Mexico
could also be utilized. Each of the above countries is a major exporter of
the respective raw materials and still additional sources are available.
Therefore, Romania should have no difficulties in obtaining adequate raw
material supplies.
4.04      The project will generatet its own steam requirements, and obtain
water from an adjacent river. Some 75% of the plant's power needs will be
purchased from the national grid and the remainder self generated as part of
the energy conservation design incorporated into the project. The power net-
work is well established in Romania and no difficulty in having an adequate
and reliable supply is anticipated.
C.   Employment and Training
4.05      Tecuci will emp'oy a staff of about 2,400 including operations,
maintenance and administrative personnel. This level is somewhat high but
still considered reasonable. An organization chart of the Tecuci Enterprise
is shown in Annex 4-3. As any chemical fertilizer plant, the project itself
is not labor intensive with only 15 jobs per US$1 million of capital invested.
Additional indirect employment, however, will be created primarily by the con-
struction and equipment manufacturing activities in Romania; the additional
manpower needs in fertilizer distribution and application; and the general
economic development of the Tecuci area, caused by the project.
4.06      The Craiova Central has an excellent training program, based on its
operating plants and those under construction, and carried out in coordination
with its licensor engineering companies and equipment suppliers. The existing
factories have well-trained staff which together with the existing facilities
will be used to train Tecuci's personnel. About US$1 million equivalent is
provided for in the project budget for training expenses and no difficulty is
foreseen in supplying ard training the needed staff. Mr. H. Cocan has been
appointed as General Manager of the Tecuci Enterprise; he previously was in
the Management of the P.atra Neamt fertilizer plant and also has considerable
operating experience in the fertilizer industry. Also, the other principal
members of the project team for the Tecuci project have already been recruited
from the Craiova Central staff.
D.   Ecology
4.07      The project will be located in a relatively un-industrialized area
in line with Government policy to establish new industrial facilities away
from present centers of population. Nevertheless, caution must still be
exercised with respect to plant emissions. There are several potentially
harmful waste streams produced from the raw materials and technology employed
in the project; notably sulfur oxides; fluorides; and gypsum. Maximum emis-
sion levels of 80 kg/hour for sulfur oxides (corresponding to 99.8% sulfur
recovery), and 2 kg/hour for fluorides have been set by IPROCHIM. Water is
recirculated for re-use and is treated before discharging from the plant.



- 18 -
4.08      Gypsum (about 500,000 TPY), a solid waste from phosphoric acid
manufacture, will be converted into gypsum wallboard or blocks (about 120,000
TPY) and the remainder is to be dried and used about half in the cement
industry as a retardent and about half in agriculture for soil amelioration.
For wallboard, blocks and cement uses, the chemical purity of the gypsum is
critical and this affects the choice of phosphoric acid technology. IPRDCHIM
has been cautious in setting emission levels. The sulfuric acid plant design
is the most efficient (double absorption) which is commercially available
and actual sulfur emissions are expected to be considerably less than stated
by IPROCHIM. Similarly, with the planned fluoride recovery unit, the fluoride
emission level is also expected to be much lower. With these factors consid-
ered, the air, water and solid pollution levels of the project are judged to
be reasonable. Finally, the Romanian authorities are equally interested in
adequate pollution controls and the project will be carried out with due
regard to environmental requirements. The cost of pollution control equipment
(including gypsum) is estimated at about 7% of the project cost.
E.   Project Implementation
4.09      The main responsibility for project execution is divided between
IPROCHIM, IPUC and the Tecuci Enterprise-all acting within the Ministry of
Chemical Industry-with civil works, erection and procurement contracted to
other Romanian enterprises as is normal practice in that country. The Tecuci
Enterprise as part of the Craiova Central, having primary responsibility for
overall coordination of project implementation, project budget and progress,
is responsible for the successful project completion. IPROCHIM and IPUC will
act as engineering contractors. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has some
supervisory, controlling and coordinating functions such as determining
priorities for the different projects within its Ministry as well as respons-
ibility for coordination with other Ministries.
4.10      IPROCHIM will utilize existing license agreements with reputed inter-
national firms and its own technology (para. 4.01). Tecuci would be similar
to other projects under construction in Romania and would utilize substantial
local equipment. Although the basic technology to be employed is well estab-
lished, IPROCHIM and the Romanian equipment suppliers have not yet fully demon-
strated their ability to construct and operate some of the plant units since
they have not yet become operational. However, since most of these plant units
are nearing completion and/or involve experienced process licensors, the tech-
nical risks are considered acceptable.   IPROCHIM is also responsible for engi-
neering, licensing arrangements and the preparation of feasibility reports and
has a coordinating or technical advisor role in equipment supply, procurement
and erection and commissioning activities. IPROCHIM will receive a process
design package from the licensors and then complete detailed engineering. It
also gives equipment specifications to domestic suppliers for local equipment.



- 19 -
The local suppliers, in turn, go to their central design institutes for de-
tailed design and fabrication drawings. Prom these, materials are ordered,
including the necessary imported materials, and subsequently the equipment
is fabricated. IPUC is responsible for the engineering of the construction
activities and utility systems.
4.11      This divided responsibility and partly sequential approach to proj-
ect implementation and the fact that IPROCRIM, and the Tecuci Enterprise as
part of the Craiova Central have only limited control over other Ministries
and enterprises involved in project execution, may help to explain the rather
extended project schedule of about three and a half years preceeded by six
months of engineering which is already far advanced. Also project control
and scheduling techniques during project implementation appear to be relativ-
ely weak. Although some minor technical assistance in connection with project
engineering, scheduling and control is part of the project, it will be dif-
ficult to modify greatly the project execution method in Romania at this
time with the objective of reducing construction time and thus capital costs.
Furthermore, modification will have to be introduced gradually to avoid major
disruptions within the project execution system and thus run the risk of an
even longer construction period. IPROCRIM has agreed to develop (by June
1974) a detailed project implementation plan showing among others the specific
responsibilities of all entitios involved in the project and particularly the
role of the licensor firms dur:e.ng all phases of project implementation.
While there is therefore room for streamlining project execution and thus
accelerating it, the ample recent experience of IPROCHIM and the Craiova
Central in executing fertilizer projects is expected to assure that Tecuci
will be implemented within the time schedule envisaged. The project implemen-
tation schedule with an expected start of commercial operations of the project
in January, 1978 is shown in Annex 4-4.
V. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
5.01      Total capital costs are estimated at Lei 3.9 billion (US$193.8
million) and total financing required including interest during construction
at Lei 4.0 billion (US$200.8 million). Capital costs are shown in detail in
Annex 5-1 and are summarized below. 1/
1/ Lei 100 million (US$5 million) have been added in the summary capital
costs for the Phosphorgypsum Processing Facilities. The detailed scope
of these facilities has not yet been determined. The provided amount
is based on processing 120,000 TPY of phosphorgypsum into gypsum blocks.

/1   Excluding contingencies on stainless steel the scope of which is already
well defined and which will be ordered shortly for use in local equip-
ment manufacture.
5.02      Capital costs are based on estimates prepared by IPROCHIM in early
1974 in cooperation with the process licensors. Prices of local components
are fixed and risks are therefore limited to physical factors; as a result
no price escalation on local components but a contingency of 6% has been
provided for. These estimates correspond to what the final techno-
economic study will show. Also local equipment costs are not expected to



- 21 -
change until 1976/77 as a consequence of the overall price review and any
up-or downward adjustments are expected to be marginal. Estimates of foreign
components are based on the expected mid-1974 price level and were obtained
from the procurement of similar plants under construction during the years
1972 and 1973 and from recent discussions with the process licensors and
prospective equipment suppliers; a 10% physical contingency and an annual
price escalation of also 10% until the expected date of expenditures have
been added. Placement of orders is expected to start in August/September
1974. Compared with past Bank practice, this is an unusually high price
escalation provision but is considered justified in view of expected added
cost increases due to higher energy costs, and also practically full order
books of most of the prospective equipment manufacturers. For the urea and
phosphoric acid plants for which the exact processes have not yet been
determined, adequate price and contingency allowances have been made for
the selection of modern processes. With these provisions and particularly
the fact that the major part of the project represents a duplication of plants
already under construction or completed, the capital cost estimates are
considered realistic.
5.03      Details of the capital cost items, major equipment components,
stainless steel and civil works are given in Annex 5-2. Civil works costs
are relatively high with Lei 751 million (US$37.6 million); also some invest-
ments are contained in "Related Investments" (about US$6 million), such as
railroad and utility (including gas) network development which in other
countries are usually not taken care of by the project entity itself. Further-
more, import duties on equipment and materials are substantial, ranging from
10% to 48% with a total of Lei 307 million (US$15.4 million). On the whole,
therefore, project costs are relatively high, particularly on account of
high local costs which are influenced by the above factors but may partly
also be the result of the not fully representative conversion rate (Lei 20/
US$1) used in the above estimates (para. 7.02).
5.04      A provision for permanent working capital of Lei 252 million
(US$12.7 million) has been made of which about 65% is in foreign exchange
as shown in greater details in Annex 5-3. The provision was calculated by
IPROCHIM and is based on Romanian laws stipulating a stock of four months of
imported raw and auxiliary materials and one month of finished goods. In
comparison with the Bank's other fertilizer plants, the above provision of
working capital, is relatively high. Initial working capital requirements
are provided by State Budget funds through the National Bank (or through the
Investment Bank during first three months after commissioning). Subsequent
increases in working capital needs can be financed through allocations from
the yearly earnings of the Enterprise (Annex 2-3) or to the extent that these
allocations are not sufficient, they can be readily provided by the National
Bank which also handles the Enterprise's cash movements on a daily basis.
Sufficient working capital to the Enterprise will be provided by the State
(para. 6.06).

B.        Financing Plan
5.05      The financing plan and the phasing of expenditures on a quarterly
basis are presented in detail in Annex 5-4 and are summarized below:
Financing Plan
(in million Lei)            (in million US$)
Local    Foreign    Total   Local  Foreign  Total
Loan Funds
IBRD                      -        1,200     1,200      -      60.0    60.0
State Funds
Funds for Investments  2,187         376     2,563   109.3    18.8   128.1
Funds for Working
Capital                  89        163       252      4.5     8.2    12.7
2,276       539      2,815   113.8    27.0   140.8
2,276     1,739      4,015   113.8    87.0   200.8
5.06      The financing plan assumes that the Bank would finance all foreign
expenditures except for working capital (US$8.2 million), foreign equipment
already purchased and financed (US$6.1 million) and US$12.7 million of
imported stainless steel. The Bank loan would thus amount to US$60.0 million
(Lei 1,200 million) equivalent to about 30% of the total financing required
or some two-thirds of the project's foreign exchange expenditures. The
remaining funds would be provided in the form of equity contributions through
allocations from the State Budget and own funds of the Central. The purchases
of equipment already made were undertaken in early 1974 in connection with
purchases for other fertilizer plants; they were made at favorable prices
and financed by the US Export-Import Bank and the Chase Manhattan Bank on
a medium-term basis. The mechanism of local financing of projects in Romania
which also explains the high equity proportion in the project, is described
more fully in Annex 2-3. According to that mechanism equity funds are
channelled back to the Central and the State Budget through allocations
based on yearly earnings of an enterprise. The remaining foreign exchange
(US$27.0 million) and local financing (US$113.8 million) as well as any addi-
tional funds - in both local and foreign currency - to cover any unexpected
overruns in project costs will be provided by the State.
5.07      The Bank loan would be extended to the Investment Bank for 15 years
including 4-1/2 years of grace at an assumed interest rate of 7-1/4% per
annum; the Tecuci Enterprise would benefit from the loan proceeds for the
same length of time and at a cost of 9% (Annex 5-5). Local funds for fixed
investments will be channelled as usual through the Investment Bank and those
for working capital through the National Bank.



- 23 -
C.  Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursements
5.08      The Bank loan would be used for meeting 100% of the following
foreign exchange expenditures of the following goods and services:
Expected Allocation of Bank Loan
(In milli)n US$)
Engineering, Design and License Fees                 6.8
Equipment, Machinery, Material and Supplies /1    33.2
Stainless Steel                                      2.3
Interest During Construction                         6.0
Unallocated (Contingency and Escalation)            11.7
60.0
/1   Excludes US$6.1 million equivalent for equipment
already purchased.
5.09      It is expected that up to US$6 million of equipment could be
proprietary or standardization items depending on the final selection of
processes for the variou3 plant units. Retroactive financing for license
and engineering fees shall be required up to an estimated amount of US$0.5
million. A forecast of estimated quarterly disbursements is given in
Annex 5-4.
D.  Procurement
5.10      Procurement will be undertaken under the general coordination of
the Tecuci Enterprise. For technical aspects procurement responsibility
will rest with IPROCHIM and -- as far as imported goods are concerned -
ROMCHIM, a special Export-Import Agency under the Ministry of Chemical
Industry, will handle the commercial aspects. Equipment to be supplied inter-
nationally wil be subject to a prequalification procedure based on advertising
plus the process licensors' knowledge of potential equipment suppliers.
Three or more suppliers, where possible, will be prequalified for each of the
about sixty equipment packages and bid soliciting, evaluation and awards will
be conducted according to Bank guidelines. However, it may be advantageous
to the project from technical and price considerations for several equipment
packages to be supplied by the same vendors as in the other duplicate plants
in Romania. As noted previously about US$6 million of equipment has already
been purchased and will not be financed by the Bank. Procurement procedures
for up to US$6 million of additional duplicate but mainly proprietary equipment
required to ensure efficient plant operations, will be reviewed with the



- 24 -
`nterprise and IPROCHIM prior to soliciting )ids to determine the best
methods to be used to comply with Bank guidelines and assure the optimal
qualitv and price.
5.11      The list of equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank has
been arrived at after excluding all goods that can be obtained locally. There-
fore, it is not expected, in general, that Romanian equipment manufacturers
will participate in the bidding of the foreign equipment packages. However,
provision has been made that the Bank loan could be disbursed for Romanian
equipment if a Romanian supplier would prequalify and win the bid. Otherwise,
no local equipment will be financed by the Bank nor will civil works and
building construction which will be executed by Romanian enterprises. For
Romanian supplies there is no "competitive" bidding; once the quantities of
materials are established, fixed unit costs determine the price and there is
usually only one Romanian supplier for major equipment items or one contractor.
Detailed design is also affected by the desire to maximize the local content
of a project. However, the Bank is satisfied that the type of equipment to
be supplied locally for the project can be produced satisfactorily in Romanian
shops and within the time required, and that the quality of civil construction
is adequate.
5.12      In order to proceed with the procurement as soon as possible and
not to delay the project, the'Enterprise has requested obtaining disbursements
on the Bank loan before the miin techno-economic indicators of the project
will be approved (by October 1974); provision has been included that disbur-
sements up to US$4 million can be made prior to such approval if the Council
of Ministers has first given its approval for the procurement of at least
US$35 million for foreign contracts for the project.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenues and Operating Costs
6.01      As was discussed in para. 2.16 and Annex 2-7, prices for all inputs
and outputs are set and controlled by the Government and most input prices
have remained constant since their establishment in the 1960's on the basis
of the overall cost structure at that time. In general, raw material and
fertilizer prices in Romania have been in line with international prices pre-
vailing until early 1973, except for sulfur and for the price of urea in
comparison with other N fertilizers.
6.02      However, in view of recent developments on the international
fertilizer market and drastic price increases for oil and phosphate rock
the Romanian price structure does no longer adequately represent financial
or economic costs and benefits and Annex 6-1 contains a comparison between



- 25 -
financial and currently estimated economic values to demonstrate this point
further. But even disregarding the absolute level of fertilizer prices
which has to be seen in relation with the input prices, it is evident that
the structure of N fertilizer prices in Romania is neither justified from
the point of view of production costs nor from the market value. For example
N in the form of urea is priced at about 70% and 88% of the N content in NPK
and CAN fertilizers respectively. The low N price in the form of urea which
is contrary to the international fertilizer price structure is the main
reason for the low financial rate of return of the project (para. 6.09).
6.03      As discussed earlier, the major raw materials and utilities used
are natural gas, phosphate rock, sulfur, fuel oil and power. These inputs
account for about 57% of total operating costs and most of their prices are
substantially lower than the international prices that have been prevailing
since October 1973 (Annex 6-1). An exception is the sulfur price which is
about twice the current import price. Labor costs are relatively low prima-
rily due to low wage rates both for skilled and unskilled workers.
6.04      The Government is considering a price revision of all products in
the near future to reflect: (i) technological innovations and productivity
increases which have led to cost reductions since most prices were last fixed
in 1963; (ii) elimination of relative price distortions among commodities; and
(iii) higher costs of energy and investments. It is not yet known to what
extent prices of gas, oil, power and imported fertilizer inputs as well as
fertilizer prices themselves will change other than that their general trend
will most likely be upward to reflect more closely current or near future
international prices. Therefore, in the financial projections of the
project, present prices have been used. Whatever adjustments in fertilizer
inputs and outputs may be made, however, these are not expected to adversely
affect the financial viability of the industry in view of the Government's
policy to provide for a reasonable benefit after covering average production
costs.
B.   Financial Projections
6.05      Detailed projections of income statements, cash flow and balance
sheets for the project are contained in Annexes 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4 respectively
and are summarized below:

Debt/Equity Ratio              29:71    29:71    28:72    19:81
6.06      The projections are based on estimated 60% and 80% capacity utili-
zation during the first two years of operations (1978 and 1979) and 100%
utilization thereafter. This is considered conservative since the "defined"
capacity underestimates the actual production capability of the project, as
is usual in most Romanian plants (para. 2.05). Benefits as a percentage of
sales are expected to increase from a loss in 1978 to 8% in 1979 and 18% in
1980. Benefits can be considered equivalent to profits before taxes and
interest. There is no equivalent of corporate taxes in Romania, instead all
surplus funds are remitted to the State Budget on a predetermined basis
depending on the level of earnings.
C.   Cash Flow and Allocation of Benefits
6.07      The cash generation projected above should only be considered indi-
cative as to the actual funds that will be available to the Tecuci Enterprise
in future years. Instead, as described in Annex 2-3 and 2-4, the Enterprise
will prepare its detailed annual financial plan each year indicating expected
sources and usages of funds for the approval of the higher authorities.
Since the State is the owner of all enterprises, any shortfalls or surpluses



- 27 -
in the financial resources will be provided or absorbed by the State after
approval by the Grand National Assembly. The depreciation funds, charged as
expenses in the income statements, are repaid to the Investment Bank before
any al'locations of benefits are made. The mandatory depreciation remittances
and annual benefits will be sufficient to cover the payments of interest (9%) on
and principal of the Bank 'Loan; also the Government will provide any funds
necessary for the operatio:as of the Tecuci Enterprise.  The depreciation
funds alone are expected to exceed the debts service payments.
6.08      Allocation of beaefits between workers, State and enterprise are
made in the following order of priority and within the following main cate-
gories as explained in detail in Annex 6-5: (i) mandatory allocation to the
State Budget (10% of planned benefits); (ii) bonus payments to employees
(up to 2% of total wages and salaries); (iii) allocation to centralized
investment fund; (iv) allocation to the non-centralized investment fund; (v)
reserve funds; and (vi) the remainder, if any, is allocated to the State
Budget. The above order is applied for planning purposes. However, during
the actual distribution of benefits, first priority is given to meeting the
planned allocations to the State Budget (categories (i) and (vi)). If the
planned benefits are not achieved, the State Bitdget allocations are made in
full, workers' bonus is reduced proportionately and no allocations are
necessary for the discretionary funds (non-centralized and reserve funds)
controlled by the enterprises. In case the actual benefits exceed the planned
figure, the workers' borus is increased proportionately and, based on pre-
determined ratios, some additional funds are authorized for social investments
like schools and housing.
D.   Financial Return and Risks
6.09      The financial return of the project based on present Romanian
prices is only 4.5%. As discussed in para. 6.01, present input and output
prices for fertilizer production in Romania cannot be used for determining
the viability of a fertilizer project. The low return is the result of major
disparities between the input and output prices for urea/DAP fertilizer
plants, particularly the urea price and the sulfur price. Though the finan-
cial return is low, the financial ratios of the project entity are expected
to be satisfactory. If the sulfur price were to be reduced to an actual
international market price and if urea were to be priced according to the N
content price of NPK fertilizers in Romania, the project would yield a satis-
factory return of about 11%. The calculation of the financial return is shown
in Annex 6-6.
6.10      Since prices on the revenue and cost side are set by the Government
in line with overall economic objectives; to maintain the financial viability
of the Enterprise (para. 6.04); and all necessary funds are provided by
the State, the financial risks of the project are essentially limited to the
physical success of the project, i.e., successful project construction and



- 28 -
operations. Both risks are judged to be small since proven process designs
,nd equipment for the critica:. plant units will be used; an ample construc-
tion and start-up period has leen provided for; and technical assistance from
the process licensors during  roject implementation and commissioning will be
available.
E.   Auditing and Reporting
6.11      Romania has a fairly elaborate control and audit system, details
of which are contained in Annex 6-7. Each enterprise submits periodic reports
to the concerned ministry through its central. These reports not only give
details of the financial performance but also on 14 other techno-economic
indicators such as raw material usage and productivity levels. In addition,
regular re:orts are received by the Investment Bank on projects under con-
struction and by the National Bank on ongoing operations. These banks also
perform the audit function and present their reports to the ministry in charge
of the enterprise and the Ministry of Finance.
6.12      It should be noted that the audit and control system, due to the
particular economic conditions in Romania, focuses primarily on controlling
the physical production and optimum use of funds and materials and to a lesser
extent the financial performance. ihe Tecuci Enterprise will be audited and
controlled by its superior organization--the Craiova Central and the Ministry
of Chemical Industry--and also through the special auditing departments of
the Ministry of Finance. Additionally, there are extensive audits from the
Investment Bank and National Bank on the proper use of funds including post
evaluation of projects. Since the Ministry of Finance is responsible for
overseeing the financial performance of all other ministries, its audit
reports on the Tecuci Enterprise will serve the purpose of independent audits.
The Bank will receive the annual audit reports on the accounts of the Enter-
prise carried out by the Ministry of Finance.
6.13      Romanian enterprises have elaborate reporting obligations to the
Central and the banks concerned including weekly, monthly, quarterly and
annual reports. Though the presentation and contents of these reports is
somewhat different from those normally received by the Bank, it should not
be very difficult to adjust them to contain sufficient information for moni-
toring the progress of project construction and operations. The Bank's usual
reporting requirements were discussed and the Borrower will submit project
progress reports and quarterly and annual financial statements of the Enter-
prise in a format satisfactory to the Bank.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      For the economic arnalysis, costs and benefits have been evaluated
at estimated world prices in 1978 when the project is expected to start
operations. Tradable items are valued at border prices, and non-tradable
items have been transferred to world prices at an exchange rate of Lei 20 to
US$1.
A.   Foreign Exchange Rates
7.02      Romania follows a complex foreign exchange system.  The official
rate of Lei 4.97 per US$1 is used only for accounting purposes. Since 1970,
the rate used for invisible and capital transactions has been Lei 14.38 per
US$1.  Under a new system introduced in January, 1974, the prices of all
traded goods are converted at a unifirm rate of Lei 20 per US$1.00, a rate
which is considered by the Romanians as being representative of the cost of
convertible foreign exchange. For iuported goods, the domestic Lei price
is found by adding to the converted foreign price a tariff rate which varies
for different types of goods. The rate of Lei 20 per US$1.00 has also been
used to convert national income statistics from Lei to dollars. Consequently,
this rate has been used as the base rate for calculations in the appraisal.
Sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the conversion rate by also using
a rate of Lei 25 - US$1.00.
B.   Fertilizer Prices
7.03      The main project outputs are urea and DAP fertilizer.  As many
other commodities, international fertilizer prices have skyrocketed within
the past two years. For fertilizer, this is partly due to a rather unexpected
and substantial rise in demand, lagging additions to production capacity as
well as to increased raw7 material costs. Whereas typical urea prices two
years ago were in the US$45-60 f.o.b. range they have now climbed to about
US$150-200 and beyond. Even at these prices substantial quantities are dif-
ficult to obtain. The same market development has happened to DAP. It is
not expected that fertilizer prices will return to anywhere near the low
levels that prevailed two years ago, since feedstock prices and investment
costs have increased considerably; investment costs in the fertilizer industry
have increased by about 20% within the past 12 months. However, fertilizer
prices should return to somewhat more reasonable levels after the demand/supply
balance will have been re-established. This may be expected once the large
number of facilities now under construction or being planned will start
operations in the late 1970s.
7.04      Though it is expected that the bulk of the urea produced by the
project is actually consumed domestically, in incremental economic terms it
has been assumed that urea will be exported, since Romania is--and is likely
to remain--a net exporter of nitrogenous fertilizer (para. 3.11). The f.o.b.
price for urea in the economic analysis has been assumed at US$110/ton in bulk



- 30 -
which is well below present market prices; it is in line with the assumed
raw material costs (para. 7.07) and is based on the expected export prices
from large-sc;-le, and low-co3t energy, fertilizer production facilities such
as in the Persian Gulf countries. The estimated 1978 price for urea f.o.b.
Persian Gulf port is US$120/ton bagged which is equivalent to US$110/ton in
bulk, f.o.b. Romania.
7.05      The project's DAP output hias been assumed to be domestically con-
sumed as indicated by the consumption forecast; it is thus considered import
substitution and an estimated c.i.f. world price of US$180/ton of DAP has
been used in the economic analysis. Similar to urea production, which is
mainly based on petroleum derivates or gas, DAP production costs have been
substantially affected by a recent sharp price increase in its major raw
material, phosphate rock. The US$180/ton c.i.f. plant price corresponds to
US$150 f.o.b. from major export-oriented production facilities such as in
North Africa and the US.
7.06      The fertilizer prices used for determining the benefits of the
project are well below present market prices and are based on expected long-
term fertilizer prices and raw material costs. Furthermore, it is expected
that in the longer run higher raw material costs will result in at least
corresponding increases in product prices. Even considering some ease in
the fertilizer market, the prices used for calculating the economic return
are considered conservative.
C.   Raw Material Costs
7.07      The principal raw materials used are domestic natural gas and
imported rock phosphate and sulfur. At present, Romania is producing and
consuming about 30 billion m3 per year of natural gas, most of it being used
for power generation. Based on information from the Ministry of Mines and
Petroleum, it is expected that no major additional gas resources are domes-
tically available and that production in the foreseeable future will remain
stable. The project forms part of Romania's program to switch gas use from
power generation to more economic uses, such as the petrochemical industry.
However, since gas production in Romania is not expected to increase, the
gas used by the project has to be priced, in economic terms, at its import
costs. The alternative materials for energy generation, such as heavy fuel
oil, are not considered alternatives to natural gas in the case of feedstocks
for fertilizer production, because investment and operating costs for gas-
based fertilizer plants are considerably lower. Furthermore, Romania is
expected to become a net importer of petroleum in future years.
7.08      For determining the long-term price of urea, export prices of the
expected world's least cost producers have been assumed (para. 7.04).
Although low-cost energy is an important element of N-fertilizer production
costs, capital related costs such as sufficient capacity utilization are
even more important. However, Romania can combine both factors. It has
considerable experience in building and operating chemical plants and has



- 31 -
domestic gas resources which are the ideal feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer
production. Practically all surplus energy countries are non-industrialized
countries. Therefore, full capacity attainment in these countries in general
is more difficult to achieve than in industrialized countries. A 1978 urea
price assumption of US$120 f.o.b. Tecuci plant bulk which would be US$10
higher than assumed in this report corresponds to the production costs of a
large-scale fertilizer plart in the Persian Gulf with natural gas costs at
US$0.50 per 1,000 cubic feet and capacity achievement of 90%, which is
optimistic.  If the capacity utilization is reduced, substantially higher
urea prices would be necessary to cover the production costs. The gas price
assumed for the Persian Gulf plant plus liquefaiction and transport costs to
Romania would result in a c.i.f. Romania price of US$1.40 per thousand cubic
feet which has been used in the economic analysis of the project. If higher
f.o.b. gas costs are assumed, corresponding increases in the long-term product
price would be expected as a result. The assumed gas price in relation to
the price assumed for the finished product is conservative.
7.09      Phosphate rock as the other major raw material has been assumed at
US$40 per ton c.i.f. Romania.  This price is somewhat lower than present
world market prices (US$42 per ton f.o.b. Morocco) because it is expected
that the phosphate rock market will again become more balanced within a few
years and that as a result prices should return to more reasonable levels.
Sulfur has been assumed at the contract price (with Poland) of US$25/ton.
D.   Economic Rate of Return
7.10      With these assumptions the project yields a satisfactory economic
rate of return of 13.2% (base case). A detailed description of the calcu-
lation of the return and its sensitivities are presented in Annexes 7-1, 7-2
and 7-3. As usual, the return is sensitive to changes in revenues; a 10%
increase in revenues, which would about correspond to the prices expected
by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Department, would increase
the return to 17.6%. A 10% or 20% increase in the gas price decreases the
return to 12.1% and 10.8% respectively. If a conversion rate of Lei 25/US$1
were to be used in the economic return calculations, the base return of the
project would increase from 13.2% to 15%. As noted previously the probability
of significant delays and cost overruns for the project is considered low
because of the longer construction period already planned in and the contin-
gencies provided.
7.11      Indirect economic benefits from the project will be derived from
the creation of industrial activity in the Tecuci area, increased domestic
fertilizer consumption and additional foreign exchange for Romania. It is
estimated that the project's net foreign exchange benefits (partly import
substitution and partly additional exports) will amount to about US$36 million
per year (Annex 6-1).

VIII. AGREE 4ENTS
8.01      The Loan and Guarantee Agreements will record the following major
agreements and assurances:
(i) the main techno-economic indicators of the project should be
approved by the Government (para. 1.02) prior to disbursements
exceeding US$4 million. Disbursements of up to US$4 million
can be made if approval for at least US$35 million of foreign

TECUCI FERTILItER PROJECT
Glossary of Technical Terms
1.        Following is a description of the technical terms used in this report:
2.        Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 16 elements, 6
in large and the remainder in small or micro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six, and others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc, iron,
aluminum, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
are readily available from the atmosphere and water. Nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium -- three main nutrients -- and the other elements are drawn from
the soil. Unless supplemented by regular additions of materials containing the
three main nutrients, soil is soon depleted of fertility by cropping. Use of
organic materials such as animal and vegetable wastes can be utilized but the
scale and intensity of modern agriculture have far exceeded the availability
of natural "fertilizers." Consequently, the majority of the world's primary
plant nutrient needs are now supplied in the form of manufactured or "chemical"
fertilizers. To an increasing degree, secondary nutrients such as calcium,
magnesium, sulfur, and micro nutrients such as boron, zinc, copper and manganese
are also added to soils along with the primary nutrients in ratios prescribed
by agronomists according to specific crop and soil needs.
3.        Chemical Fertilizers:  Chemical compounds suitable as fertilizers
should be high enough in nutient content; stable to avoid hazards and handling
problems; and readily water soluble and available to plant root systems.
Commercially available materials meeting these requirements to a large degree
are:
Primary Fertilizer Materials
% of N                    % of P2O5                        % of K20
Nutrient                   Nutrient                         Nutrient
Urea                   46%    Triple Super-                Potassium Chloride       61 %
Ammonium Nitrate       34%       phosphate         46%     Potassium Sulfate        54%
Amonium Sulfate        21%    Single Super-
Diammonium                       phosphate         18%
Phosphate            48%
Because of the high nutr:.ent content of urea, diammonium phosphate and potassium
chloride (KCL), they are some of the most popular fertilizer materials in the
world today. It is the common practice to report the nutrient content of
materials in terms of percentages of N and P205 (phosphorus pentoxide) and
potassium K20 (potassium oxide).



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
4.,e. or _PK Fertilizers:  All three primary nutrients (N, P205,
K20) are frequjvntiy applietl to the soil at the same time ih ratios varying with
the nutrient requirements of different crops. To facilitate handling, the
several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uniform granules for
distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as a ratio to describe
the NPK product.  Thu.s ,5-15-15 complex fertilizer contains 15% each of N,
P205, and K20; and ,2-24-.2 complex fertilizer contains 12% N, 24% P205 and
12% K20.
5.        Phosphate Water Solubility:  The agronomic availability (or effi-
ciency) of phosphate materials vary substantially. A common practice is to
use water solubility as a criterion although in acidic soils it is a less
significant factor. Higher P205 water solubility permits the fertilizer to
be absorbed more rapidly. The minimum recommended in most cases is about 60%
solubility but in some cases up to 80-85% solubility is preferred.
6.        Ammonium Nitrate (AN) is produced by reacting ammonia with nitric
acid. Nitri-c acid (HNO3), in turn, is made from ammonia (NH3). AN contains
34.5% nitrogen, half in the ammonium form and half in the nitrate form, and
is very hydroscopic. It also is a commercial explosive. In many countries,
a diluent --- e.g., limestone -- is added to lower the analysis and negate the
explosive properties as well as to minimize the hydroscopic properties.
7.        Diammonium phosphate (DAP or chemically(NH4) 2HP04) is produced by
reacting NH3 with phosphoric acid (H3pO4) followed by granulation and drying.
8.        Partial Oxidation is a method of producing hydrogen from hydrocarbon
fuels of almost any type by a non--catalytic reaction with oxygen followed by
removal of the by-product, carbon monoxide.
9.        Feedstocks are the hydrocarbons used to produce hydrogen for the
ammonia synthesis; in the proposed Tecuci plant, the feedstock would be natural
gas which is usually the most economical choice when available. Other potential
feedstocks are naphtha, fuel oil, crude oil, coal or lignite.
10.       Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH2CONH2 - the normal amide
of carbonic acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in the ammonium form.
It is considerably less hydroscopic than ammonium nitrate and it is the most
widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
11.       Urea Svnthesis:  Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon
dioxide. Since both of the materials are produced during the ammonia syn-
thesis, urea production is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant.
Unfortunately, the corresponding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does
not form stable ammoniuni salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids.
The refore, simple neutralization as used in making ammonium nitrate and sulfate
fertilizers is not possible. Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide are combined



ANNEX 1-1

under heat and pressure to make ammonium carbonate which, although unstable,
can be dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable compound. Again,
unfortunately, the overall reaction is completely reversible and even at 300
atmospheres pressure and 200' C, the conversion to urea in a single pass
through the reactor is under 70%. This introduces several complications:
high pressure must be used to maximize conversion; uncor.verted reactants must
be separated and recycled- increased corrosion under tne high temperatures and
pressures used must be overcome, and urea decomposition into undesirable pro-
ducts must be minimized. In recent years, several engineering and producing
companies have developed trays of surmounting these problems, and large plants
capable of producing a thousand tons per day, or more, or urea to rigid che-
mical and physical specif-lcations are now operating successfully for long
periods throughout the world.
Petroleum Units and Measures
12.       The petroleum industry historically has used units of measure based
On the English measuring system. ConversioiL rates for some units are given
below:
1 barrel               42 US gallons;          3
1 US gallon          - 0.95 liters = 0.00095 M
1 ton crude oil      - 7.0 barrels (approximately, based on the crude
oil specific gravity); and
1 ton oil              1.25 M3 of natural gas (approximately, based
on oil and gas compositions).
The conversion rates between volumetric units, such as gallons, and weights
are approximate since the specific gravity of the oil varies slightly with
its composition.
13.       Materials that exist in the form of gases, such as methane (natural
gas), are measured in volumetric units. Since gases are compressible, standard
conditions of temperature and pressure (0 C and 1.0 atmosphere) are used to
define the quantity (in volume) of gas, and designated as "normal cubic meters"'
or "normal cubic feet."

TECUCI FERTILIZER PROJECT
Investment Decisions and Financing of New EProjects in the Industrial Sector
A.   Types of Investments
1.        There are two main categories under which investments are generally
undertaken in Romania. First and most important, covering over 95% of total
investments in recent years, are Centralized Investments, the investments
from the state funds which are authorized in the Plan and which include all
major investments. Second and relatively minor in total value are Non-Cen-
tralized Investments, the small investments made by enterprises from their
own funds without specific plan approval; such investments are primarily made
by the enterprises from their planned profit allocated for this purpose which
are held in the Central's account in the Investment Bank and are disbursed to
an enterprise in accordance with demonstrated needs. Productive investments
of urgency and investments of social benefit (such as urgent maintenance/
modernization jobs, technical improvements In plant, social and cultural in-
vestments like schools, housing, etc.) are some examples of non-centralized
investments. While the individual investments are decided by the Enterprise
itself and need not be specifically approved in the annual plan, the gross
allocation of funds for such decentralized investments must be approved by
higher authorities as a nart of the annual financial plan and within the
framework of the state annual plan. A graphic description of these two cate-
gories of investments ard their major sources of finance is given in Table
1. As practically all important investments fall under the centralized in-
vestment category, this note will concentrate on the approval and financing
of centralized investments. Table 2 gives a graphic view of the decision-making
and funds flow for cent:alized investments.
B.   Approval of Investments
2.        Investments in all sectors of the economy are designed to meet the
production targets set forth in the National Production Plan, both Five-Year
and Annual, approved by the Grand National Assembly. The Annual State Budget
(Annual Financial Plan), also approved by the Grand National Assembly, de-
tails the investments required by different sectors of the economy, including
a breakdown up to the enterprise level, to achieve the production targets es-
tablished for them. Once these Investment and Financial Plans are approved,
they acquire the status of a State Law and must be strictly adhered to by
all the concerned parties. The procedure outlined in the following paragraph
describes the steps followed to include an investment in these plans.
3.        Investment projects are prepared by the economic enterprises or by
the ministry concerned (in the case of large projects of national importance,
it is prepared by the ministry itself or by the enterprise with the assistance
of the ministry concerned) to achieve the production targets approved in the



ANNEX 2-3
Page 2
Five-Year and Annual Plans. Prior to its inclusion in the Plan, an investment
must be approved by the authorized organization unit. The authority for ap-
proval depends on the total co3t of the proposed investment; a higher than
required organization may, however, approve investments of special signifi-
cance. Generally, investment of:
(a) Lei 10,000,000 or less can be approved by the Enterprise; 1/
(b) Lei 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 are approved by the Central; 1/
(c) Lei 30,000,000 to 70,000,000 are approved by the Ministry; 1/
and
(d) Over Lei 70,000,000 are approved by the Council of Ministers.
In this case, the Minister concerned presents the proposal but
the Council of Ministers receives comments from the Ministry
of Finance, State Planning Committee, Ministry of Supply and
Investment Control, and Investment Bank.
4.        The investment decisions are made on the basis of the "Techno-
Economic Studies". These studies not only contain the economic justifica-
tion of the project but also include the project schedule, detailed cost
estimates of the project based on complete design and engineering, and
fully identify sources of equipment, raw materials, labor and financing.
For example, the approval for an investment is not given till sources of
financing are firmly identified. Consequently, immediately after the ap-
proval of a project, its financing is incorporated in the national plan in
order that the physical execution of the project can start soon thereafter.
C.   Financing of Investments
5.        There are three major sources of financing available to industrial
enterprises:
(i) Their "Own Funds": depreciation, share of own benefits
(profits) and to a much smaller extent receipts from sale
of obsolete equipment.
(ii) Allocations from the State/Local Budget.
(iii) Credits from the banks: this source is expected to become
more important in future.
Investments made through credit sources are called the Credit Investments
and all other investments are called the Financed Investments (Table 1).
1/   In the case of these investments, notification of the Investment Bank's
consent is necessary for final approval. The Investment Bank particularly
reviews the efficiency of investing the requested level of funds to meet
the production goals; it may recommend a reduction in or even a postpone~
ment of the proposed investment.



ANNEX 2-3
Page 3
6.        Non-Centralized Investments.  As already mentioned earlier, invest-
ments in non-centralized investments are made from the Non-Centralized Fund.
An allocation to this fund is made if the enterprise meets its planned-
benefit target for the year. Amount of allocation varies between 1% to 4%
of the planned profits depending upon the "rentability" (roughly profits on
sales revenues) of the enterprise as explained in para 3 (v) of the note on
"Distribution of Benefits".
7.        Centralized Investments.  The broad Financial Plan for the whole
project is prepared by the enterprise in consultation with the Investment
Bank during the preparation of the Techno-Economic Study. However, detailed
sources of funds for work to be completed in a budget year are identified in
the annual financial plan of the enterprise/central. This annual financial
plan (sources and usage of funds statement) considers the planned benefits
for the enterprise and the funds likely to be surplus after making other
mandatory allocations, the depreciation funds and other "own funds", surplus
depreciation funds from other enterprises in the central and the credit in-
vestments suggested by the Irnvestment Bank. If these sources are not suffi-
cient, the financing gap is met through a non-reimbursable, non-interest-
bearing grant from the budget. Republic Enterprises request allocation from
the Republican (National) Budget while the Local Enterprises get allocations
from the Local (District, Municipal) Budget. Allocations for such investments
are made through the Republican/Local Economic and Social Development Fund
part of the Budget.
8.        In this process of seeking budget funds, the enterprise, first,
makes a detailed statement of its sources (planned benefits minus mandatory
allocations) and needs for funds to achieve the production targets set for
it for the forthcoming year. It forwards this statement to the Central
without balancing the sources and usage of funds. The Central collates the
statements from all the enterprises associated with it and tries to meet ex-
cess needs of one enterprise with the surplus funds, if any, from other en-
terprises. For example, if during a year an enterprise has authorized cen-
tralized investment needs below its "own funds" (depreciation and its share
of benefits), then these excess funds are used for centralized investments
in other enterprises. The Central, then, finalizes its financial plan; if
the total investment needs of the enterprises are in excess of their com-
bined "own funds", the Central requests budget allocations. On the other
hand, if the enterprises, as a group, have surplus funds during a year,
they are returned to the State Budget. Each Ministry receives annual plans
from all its Centrals, consolidates them and forwards them to the Ministry
of Finance. The latter collates the financial plans of all the Ministries
and formulates the National Financial Plan which is approved by the Grand
National Assembly and the Council of State.
9.        This approval authorizes the enterprises to proceed further with
their planned activities. The Investment Bank, National Bank and other banks
receive copies of the approved financial plan for each enterprise and are
responsible for making payments from the budget categories/sources specified,
according to the approved schedule. The banks keep a separate account for
each category in the financial plan for every enterprise. The banks deal



ANNEX 2-3
Page 4
directly with the enterprises and the intermediate organization units, Min-
istry and the Central, do not get involved in the financial transactions once
the Annual Plan is finalized and sources of funds identified. The deprecia-
tion fund is handled in the Investment Bank; it receives bi-monthly payments
from the enterprise. The allocations from the Economic and Social Develop-
ment Fund are channeled through the National Bank; it makes bi-monthly trans-
fers to the enterprise account at the Investment Bank, according to the sched-
ule approved in the Plan. The latter makes all payments after ensuring that
they are in full conformity with the approved Plan.
D.   Cost of Financing
10.       The Investment Bank decides, in consultation with the borrower, if
any part of an investment should be designated Credit Investment and financed
by credits. The balance is, then, designated Financed Investments for finan-
cing through "own funds" and budget allocations. The main criteria for ap-
proving credit investments are:
(i) The investment should be able to pay for itself in maximum
10 years.
(ii) It should have sources of equipment firmly identified.
(iii) It should have firm sales contracts for the proposed pro-
duction.
(iv) Until the new law of 1973, such investments were limited
for projects under Lei 70 million.
The cost of these two and other types of financing is discussed below.
11.       Financed Investments.  At present the Financed Investments (see
para 5) have no specific fixed financial obligations though any surplus gen-
erated during the year is transferred to the budget on a preallocated basis.
However, a new law now under consideration is expected to impose a tax on in-
vested funds. This tax could be considered like a fixed dividend rate on
equity and is aimed to encourage an efficient use of State funds invested as
budget allocation. The tax rate, subject to a maximum of 6%, is expected to
be different for different sectors of the economy. This differential rate
will be used to encourage investments in specific sectors like agriculture.
12.       To provide an incentive to make investments productive as soon as
possible, the financing under the financed investments is not effective till
the investments start production. During the construction period, the Invest-
ment Bank pays for the investments from a special account for all expenditures,
except for buildings and construction which are directly paid from the financed
investment funds. The financing for investments, plant, equipment, spares etc.



ANNE X 2-3
Page 5
is provided at a 2% interest rate until the date of commissioning. However,
as soon as the plant is declared commissioned after the "technical tests",
these special account credits are replaced by funds from the financed-invest-
ments fund. If actual commissioning is delayed, then this interest rate is
increased from 2% to 6% for the delayec period.
13.       Credit Investments:  are expected to become mwre important in fu-
ture. These are medium/long-term loans, presently at 2%-4% interest rate,
extended by the Investment Bank from its own sources for the centralized
investments. Under a new law in force since January 1973, the Investment
Bank has been authorized to extend large credits for projects of national
interest, which was not possible earlier. At present the maximum term for
loans is 10 years. The lower interest rates are charged for short maturity
credits and the higher interest rates, i.e. 4%, are charged for longer ma-
turities.
14.       Working Capital A.  Temporary:  For the commissioning period, the
Investment Bank provides the enterprise with credit for its working capital
needs (spares, inventory, materials for commissioning period) at 2%o interest
rate. This credit must be paid back, within 90 days of the scheduled commis-
sioning date, from the sales of production during this period. If the com-
missioning is delayed, the interest rate is increased to 6% for the delayed
period.
15.       Working Capital B. Permanent:  Once an investment is declared ef-
fective (commissioned), the expected working capital needs for the forthcoming
year are met by the State Budget channelled through the National Bank. The
enterprise must negotiate, each year, its working capital needs for the coming
year with the bank. The working capital amount is composed of two parts.
First, the "normative" amount calculated on the basis of the planned produc-
tion and the previously approved "norms" like the turnover rate. Second, any
"additional" needs which must be specifically approved either by the National
Bank or the Ministry on grounds like special supply conditions which justify
higher than economical level of inventories, etc. Increases in the "normative"
amount of permanent working capital requirements are mostly met, through self
generated funds by retaining benefits though additional grants from the State
Budget are possible, if necessary. The "additional" working capital needs
are met through specially approved loans at 3%-5% interest rate; late payments
are charged 12% interest.

TECUCI FERTILIZER PROJECT
MAJOR ACCOUNTING PRACTICES
1.        There are some differences between the financial statements prepared
by industrial enterprises in Romania and the ones prepared under the generally
accepted accounting practices followed by most Bank borrowers; the type of
statements as well as their frequency and format are slightly different. While
the statements prepared by the Romanian enterprises may not be considered ade-
quate by financial analysts in a convential financial system, they seem well
suited to the Romanian industrial and financial system.
2.        Basic Objectives of Statea3ents:  The main differences arise from
the difference in the usage of financial statements iri the two systems, due
to various sources of financing available to commercial organizations. In
economies with a predominant private sector, the main source for financing
new investments is the capital market. In such a system, the investment
and financing decisions, though interconnected, are taken separat:ely and by
a different group of people. The management of a corporation decides on
new investments; the bankers and the leaders of the financial markets
evaluate the overall financing needs and the creditworthiness of the corpora-
tion before agreeing to provide additional financing. Generally, the fi-
nancing is flexible and is not tied to individual investments. Consequently,
the financial statements are designed to provide the lenders sufficient in-
formation to enable them to judge the creditworthiness of the company rela-
tive to other borrowers. The accounting and audit practices are designed to
ensure consistency and accuracy of the statements, to meet this basic objec-
tive. In Romania, the State is the only source of financing. It also takes
all investment decisions. As a result, both investment and financing deci-
sions are taken by the same supreme body. The responsibility for financing
is assumed by the State at the same time as it approves the investment.  The
financial statements in Romania do not perform the primary information func-
tion as in market economies. They are instead designed to ensure that com-
mercial entities dovetail their activities to the National Plan; thney ar-e
primarily a planning and control tool. Romanian accounting and audit systems
are tailored to meet thiis objective.  For example, instead of identifying
the investment funds by their sources, the balance sheet identifies them by
investment categories as the financing is approved for specific investments
and not for aggregate requirements of the encerprise.  Some of the major
differences between the financial statements prepared under the two systems
are described below. 1/
1/   Details of the funds flow and financial auidit methods are described in
Annex 6-5 and 6-7 respectively.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 2
Financial Statements:  Types and Timing of Preparation:  In Romania,
each Central and enterprise prepares four major sets of financial statements
annually, two for the planning of next year's operations -- the Investment
Plan and the Financial Plan, which detail sources and uses of funds; and two
to show ?ast year's performazce -- the Balance Sheet and an annex to the
Balance Sheet which closely resembles a normal income statement.  There are
a large number of other annexes to the Balance Sheet.  In addition, a variety
of statistical reports are prepared. A hypothetical balance sheet prepared
by the Steel Central in 1973 is attached as an example. It is understood
that even though individual enterprises have long-term production plans,
they do not prepare balance sheets for any future years.
4.        A new enterprise does not start making its balance sheet until the
plant is officially commissioned, i.e., it is certified that the "technical
tests" have been stuccessfully completed; until then, only the Investment
Statement and the Financial Plan are prepared.
5.        Difference in Format:  The Balance Sheet is prepared in a different
format reflecting Romanian practices on financing of new investments 1/. The
major different feature of the Romanian Balance Sheet is in the presentation
of the liabilities; they are listed primarily according to the type of invest-
ments they have financed rather than the source of funds. There are three
major sources of funds for investments available to an enterprise: its "own
funds" in form of depreciation and a share of benefits, allocations from State
Budget, and credits from banks. However, as shown in the attached Balance
Sheet a breakdown of liabilities according to these sources is not given.
Instead, the liabilities are shown according to the use of funds for different
types of assets, a practice which makes the liability side of the balance
sheet look very similar to the asset side.  This is perhaps due to the three
factors mentioned earlier: (i) the State is the only source of financing;
(ii) funds are provided for specific investments and not for the overall
needs of the enterprise; and (iii) until recently, credits -- long- and
short-term -- were a negligible source of financing.
6.        As a result, sorme of the comparable information readily available
from the Balance Sheets normally submitted to the Bank Group by other borrowers,
wouldi not be presented in the usual Romanian Balance Sheets. This includes:
(i)  breakdown of liabi'ities by major sources of funds:
own funids, State allocations ana bank credits;
(ii) debt/equity ratio:
(iii)  breakcowwn of deL  by current and long-term
liabilities; and
(iv) breakdown of own fi:nds between equity capital
and retained ear;`n s-
1/   See the hypothOtica1 '3.nce shc  c -; ivchsn Li  A?peL-ii  i



ANNEX 2-4
Page 3
However, such information which would be considered vital for an enterprise
seeking funds from a conventio.ial system is perhaps neither needed nor rele-
vant in the present Romanian financial system. Investments are decided dur-
ing the national planning exercises; once the investment is approved, funds
are automatically authorized, and the preformance of an enterprise is pri-
marily judged by its physcial achievements rather than its profitability.
In addition, until January 1973, a very minute part of investment funds
came in the form of long-tern loans. With much larger long-term credit in-
vestments now permitted and especially in the case of enterprises receiving
IBRD loans, this situation would change and the Bank Group will insist that
debt liabilities be shown separately in the Balance Sheets.
7.        Payments/Receipts Mechanism:  The enterprise itself does not make
any major payments to other organizations. For example, even though when the
annual investment plan is approved and funds are earmarked for the enterprise,
the actual payments are made semi-monthly by the National Bank to the Invest-
ment Bank and not to the enterprise. This seems to serve two objectives: (i)
it ensures that the surplus cash (cash lying idle) is reduced to the minimum
in the economy as a whole; (ii) it acts as a part of the overall control
system (see Annex 6-7). Perhaps for similar reasons, payments against all
major allocations to the State are made twice a week by large enterprises;
all small units do so once a month. These payments include (i) Regulariza-
tion Tax, (ii) Tax on Circulation of Goods or Turnover Tax, (iii) Taxes on
Salaries, and (iv) Allocation of Benefits.
8.        Balance Sheet:  Paragraphs 9 and 10 give definitions of major ac-
counting terms used in Romanian financial statements. While reviewing the
Balance Sheets, it should be noted that the current assets are kept at a
minimum possible level as a part of the national policy. Within the indus-
trial sector, it is against the law to sell or buy goods on credit; there
are not credit arrangements between enterprises and their customers.
9.        "Fixed Assets" show the book value of all fixed assets in enter-
prises that have already been commissioned and always equal "Own Funds and
Allocations for Fixed Assets." The productive life of each major category
of assets is specified by law and assets are depreciated under the straight-
line method. However, even after this legal life is over, the assets are
depreciated at full rate until they are scrapped and sold to a special State
enterprise formed for this specific purpose. Depreciation on assets that
have exceeded their expected lives is not included in accumulated deprecia-
tion. "Investment in Progress" indicates the total cost of projects that
have not yet been completed and is equivalent to "Financing of Investment
in Progress." Once the investment is certified "commissioned", it is taken
out of the "Investment in Progress" category and entered into the "Fixed
Assets" category. No depreciation is charged on any asset until it is
''commissioned" and production starts.
10.       Within the "Working Capital" section, semifinished and finished
products inventories include not only the goods ready to be shipped between



ANNEX 2-4
Page 4
sections or out of the factory, but also products already shipped for which
payments have not yet been received. The latter are equivalent to 3-5 days'
sales, the time taken by the National Bank to receive authorization for pay-
ments from the buyers; in the meantime, the National Bank provides credits
equal to the production cost of such materials. Packaging materials re-
present the stock of reusable containers. Pecuniary assets refer to the
amounts held in bank accounts plus a small amount of petty cash. Accounts
receivable from transactions that involve less than 500 lei and consequently
do not go through the National Bank are treated separately in accounts re-
ceivable involving small amounts. Accounts receivable from related organiza-
tions indicates transfers to be made. "Goods-in-Process" include only pro-
ducts that have not been completed within a shop. Section B on the liability
side of the Balance Sheet covers current liabilities and all the self-financ-
ing of inventory from own funds. Special funds include funds for prizes, non-
centralized investment, etc. and are allocated from profits.
?1.       Payments to the State consist of remittances still to be credited
to the State Budget. It is interesting to note that while most of the pay-
ments are made in advance and the adjustments are supposedly made at the end
of the year, these allocations appear both as assets (paid in advance) and
liabilities (owed to the State) instead of the two entries cancelling each
other when the books are closed at the end of the year. This is because
these accounts are settled about two weeks after the books are closed for the
year. This and some other minor entries which are double counted tend to
slightly inflate both the current assets and current liabilities. According
to the Romanian system, sections B plus D on the asset side must equal the
two similar sections on the liability side of the Balance Sheet.
12.       Income Statement:  The following entries in the Romanian income
statements are worth nothing:
(i)  Revenues are claculated on the basis of the product price
which is less than the price paid by buyers by the amount of
the Regularization Tax and the Tax on Product Circulation
(Turnover Tax) determined separately for each product and
paid directly to the State budget.
(ii)  A product is considered sold only when payment is received
for the shipment and not when the invoice is raised or the
product physically shipped. Thus even though a product is
shipped and an invoice raised, it will not be considered
sold but will be carried in selling enterprise's books
until the payment is received; to this extent, the sales
are on a "cash basis" and not on an "accrual basis".
(iii)  Interest charges, being very small, are not shown separately
in the income statement; it is normally included along with
other overhead costs which also contain administrative and



ANNEX 2-4
Page 5
overhead costs. However, it should be noted that the interest
charges on the IBRD loan would not be included here but treated
as a separate expense item, below the benefit (profit) entry.
This would prevent reduction of profits of an enterprise obtain-
ing TBRD loans relative to other enterprises in the same sector.
(iv)  Benefit is equivalent to profit before tax even though it is
the bottom line of the income statement. All allocations, like
the State Budget allocations, the Workers Bonus, etc. whether
mandatory or optional, are made in accordance with the approved
Financial Plan and are not shown in the income statement.  In
this context, it may be noted that the product price of a pro-
duct, which determines the revenue, is fixed at a level where
the profitability 1/ of the industry would be acceptable.  The
product price may be altered to bring the profitability and
hence benefits to acceptably levels.
13.       All financial statements prepared by the Bank are in accordance
with the conventional system taking into account the peculiarities of the
Romanian system.

Romanian Pricing System in the Industrial Sector
1.        Within the industrial sector, the primary function of prices is to
facilitate planning and control of expenditures.  They are kept more or less
constant over long periods of time. The existing prices are the published
catalogue prices of 1963 with minor modifications over time.
2.        The product price within the industrial sector is set in the State
catalogue to cover production costs in an average facility and also to yield
an acceptable profit, subject to certain modifications due to relative domestic
and/or foreign scarcities or priorities. A turnover tax is added to the
product price to arrive at the delivery price. This delivery price is charged
only when products are sold to final consumers. The turnover tax is not
applicable to sales of primary and intermediate products (e.g., for iron ore,
steel, etc.) The export price is identical to the product price, since an
enterprise receives the same payment from the foreign trade enterprise that
markets the goods abroad as it would from a domestic customer. Supplementary
expenditures required to prepare a product for export are reimbursed separately.
The lei prices of imported items are determined in one of three different ways:
(i) in correlation with the production price of similar items produced domes-
tically; (ii) by conversion of unit foreign exchange expenditures into domestic
currency at specially determined exchange rates (usually done for equipment);
and (iii) by conversion of the cost of the components imported at a specially
determined exchange rate and then pricing of the subsequently assembled pro-
ducts in correlation with the imported price of the components.
3.        According to the Romanian authorities, 1963 catalogue prices were
set more or less in line with 1963 world prices. Since then the world demand
and technology situatioa has changed, necessitating a number of price modifica-
tions. Usually, the more capital intensive an industry, the higher its approved
profit mark-up so that capital repairs and expansion do not have to be financed
by budgetary grants. However, in industries where technical progress has pro-
duced unnecessarily high profit rates, regularization taxes have been applied
since 1970 to absorb these excess profits. Certain prices have been changed
to prevent misuse of resources such as the use of natural gas as a fuel instead
of as a chemical feedstock. Oil products have been slightly modified and
sold at higher prices.
4.        In order to eliminate the existing price distortions and a;ign prices
with the social costs of production, a major price revision based on'Law Number
19/1971 is scheduled for adoption in 1974/75. Accordingly, new prices will
be introduced gradually, not all at once as in 1963. The role of Centrals and
enterprises in setting prices is expected to increase and price adjustments
would be done more frequently. Some catalogue prices would no longer be
invariable, but would indicate merely the upper limit.



ANNEX 2-7
Page 2
5.        As already mentioned, product prices will be set to equal average
production costs plus the appr,ved profit mark-up which would be a function
of total assets. In addition to the usual cost elements, such as materials,
utilities, wages including social taxes, depreciation, research and develop-
ment, etc. two new cost elements -- a tax on total assets and a land tax --
will be introduced. These taxes, whose rates for each industry are yet to
be determined, 1/ are designed to encourage more efficient use of capital and
land. The product price based on costs can be altered to encourage: (i)
introduction of new products of higher quality or with lower production
costs; (ii) profitable use of natural resources determined by reference to
world prices and long-range requirements; (iii) domestic production of pro-
ducers' goods; (iv) rational use of materials by reference to world prices;
(v) vertical integration of production; and (vi) increased production of spare
parts.
6.        The Bank has been given no indication of the new prices that will
result from the revision. The prices of natural gas, coal, iron ore and other
raw materials are expected to rise to the level of world prices. Prices may
be lower than previously fixed levels, for products in industries such as
chemicals, machine building and electrical equipment where technical progress
has been substantial. On the average, prices are expected to increase only
moderately. Although there would be some adjustments, the pricing system is
such that it would not affect the financial viability of the Enterprise. The
revenue forecasts which are based on the present catalogue prices are given
in Annex 6-2.

A. Agriculture in Romania
1.   Background
The agricultural potential for Romania is very good. Of some
23,750,000 hectares of land almost 1; million hectares are classified as
agricultural land; about 9.77 million hectares as arable, 4.42 million
hectares as natural hay and pasture and 773,000 hectares as vineyards and
orchards. Land utilization has been quite stable over the past 20 years
and no major changes in land use are anticipated in the remainder of the
1970's.
Agricultural soils are by their nature quite productive. Chernozems
and levigated chernozems make up almost 4.5 million hectares. Another 6
million hectares are made up of highly productive brown and brownish red
forest soils. The alluvial soils along the Danube and inland rivers are also
highly productive when properly drained and protected from flooding. In
general, much of the agricultural land of Romania is similar to the better
corn belt (Illinois and Iowa) soils of the United States.
Average annual rainfall varies from less than 400 mm in the South-
east to more than 1,400 mm in the mountainous areas. Rainfall is not too
well distributed, with the July-September period normally a dry season.
Supplemental irrigation is required to assure high crop yields. About
100,000 hectares have been brought under irrigation each year since 1965.
More than 900,000 hectares were irrigated by 1972 and the Romanian Government
has set as a goal to irrigate 2.5 million hectares of land by 1980.
Irrigation eventually may be feasible for as many as 5.36 million hectares--
over 2 million hectares from water of the Danube and 3.3 million hectares from
inland rivers and accumulation reservoirs. The availability of irrigation
together with the long growing season provide the opportunity for double-
cropping in the southern part of the country.
2.   Organization
Since World War II, Romanian agriculture has undergone a complete
reorganization. This reorganization was pretty well completed in the late
1960's. State farms now make up approximately 177 of the total arable land,
cooperative farms 75% and the remaining 8% is owned and operated by private



ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
individuals. Most of the privately owned land is located in the mountains
or in remote areas. Also, some 10% of the area in cooperative farms is
assigned and managed as individual plots of tha workers.
The state farms receive preference in all aspects of production.
This particularly includes investments, inputs and trained personnel. To
illustrate, during the period 1950-1970 state farms received about 40% of
the total investment in agriculture. In 1971 state farms had 33% of the
total irrigated land and received about 33% of the total fertilizer allocated
to Romanian agriculture.
State farms therefore are also more productive as illustrated below:
Table 1. Relative Yield on State Farms vs Cooperative Farms - 1971
(Cooperative Farm Yield - 100)
Wheat                  132
Maize                  137
Sunflower              125
Sugar beet             146
Potatoes               156
Milk per cow           211
Wool per sheep         155
Eggs per hen           164
It should also be noted, however, that state farms play a role in bridging
the gap between experiment station research and adoption of new practices.
State farms serve as a demonstration of new practices that are eventually
made available and adopted by cooperative farms.
As state farms approach more nearly optimum conditions, cooperative
farms will be receiving more in the way of investments and inputs. Some
cooperative farms are already producing quite respectably, and it is expected
that over the next decade cooperative farms will become nearly as productive
as state farms. Individual farms to date have had little in the way of govern-
ment assistance or encouragement. Most are located in remote or mountainous
regions and thus are heavily oriented toward intensive animal and truck crop
agriculture. As the other two sectors advance, there plans to also provide
assistance and encouragement to the individual farm sector.
3.   Potential for Agricultural Advancement
With a high proportion of potentially productive soils, good
climate, adequate water for greatly expanded irrigation, and easy access to
major world markets, Romania has the essentials to encourage rapid agricul-
tural development. It appears that the Romanian government recognizes this
potential and large production increases in the crop sector can be expected
in future years.  Also, the "shock" of the total reorganization of the farming
sector that took place during the 1960's has been largely overcome.



ONN'EX 3-1
Page 3
Investments in agriculture in the 1966-70 period have increased and
exceeded Lei 48 billion and are programmed to reach Lei 80 billion during
the period 1971-1975. Most investment to date has gone into state farms and
into the farm mechanization units that serve the cooperative farms. The
cooperative farms are also encouraged to reinvest some of their income in such
things as irrigation, drainage, improving l.vestock ard fa.rm buildings. In-
vestment by the cooperatives during the 1966-70 period is reported to have
amounted to an additional Lei 11 billion and is expected to exceec Lei 20
billion during the 1971-75 plan.  Through these direct investments and the
credit availability to the cooperatives, the State both controls the develop-
ment effort and directs the agriculture in reaching the planned targets of
the agricultural sector.
Agricultural research, especially that dealing with crops, has high
priority. The research network is under the direction of the Academy for
Agricultural and Forestry Sciences and is made up of 17 institutes and some
35 well dispersed experimental stations plus a centralized information and
documentation center. Discussions with research workers and observation of
research on selected research stations plus crops growing in the field indi-
cate that crop varieties, cuCtural practices, pesticide usage, harvesting
methods, adequate equipment plus overall know-how and management are available
to bring about rapid increases in crop yield and that heavier applications of
fertilizers will pay good returns.
Animal agriculture still is at a relatively low level. There is
activity in the way of improved breeds, better nutrition, adequate sanita-
tion, etc., indicating that the animal sector will also show marked improvement
between now and 1980. It appears that heavy emphasis is being placed on
intensive animal production, with confined feeding playing a major role.
Little or no mention was made of more extensive animal agriculture that would
make better use of land unsuited for cultivated crops.
Even though many factors point toward rapid increases in agricul-
tural production, there are some others that give concern as to whether the
agricultural goals can be reached. The fact that the cooperative farms, even
though they are quite large, do not have machinery directly under their con-
trol may in some cases hinder timely operations and thus reduce yield or
harvest. The theory of mechanization units may be good but farming depends
so much on timeliness of operations that a delay of only a day or two in
seeding, cultivating, fertilizing, harvesting, can cause marked reductions
in yield.
IL the availability of suffcient tcuantities and kinds of inpuzs
on a timely basis is not guaranteed, rapid advancement in agricultural  Gro-
duction may be restrained.  -:: _s mandatory that the right kinds ar.d ZGounts
of fertilizer, for exxnp.e. be apeS? ed at the correct time i E crop yd_>;s
are to be maximized.  Factors such as these have to be well coroll   ir
order that the estimated production levels cain be reached.



ANNEX 3-1

4.   Crops
Maize and wheat are the most important field crops in Romania.
About 3.4 million hectares of maize and 2.1 million hectares of wheat are
planted each year. They account for more than half of the 9.77 million
arable hectares. Other cereals include small areas of rye, barley, oats,
and rice.
Oil cProps, oL which sunflower has been _ae most important, are
also widely cultivated.  Soybeans have beer, introduced recently and it is
estimated that about 300,000 hectare3 were grown in 1973. Some estimates
are that as many as one million hectares of soybeans will be grown by 1980,
although the Government plan projects only 156,000 hectares (Table 18) of
soybeans by that date. Soybaans aregrown on the same type of land as maize
or sunflowers. Being a legume, however, much less applied nitrogen is re-
quired. Thus, to the extent that soybeans are introduced, nitrogen fertil-
izer use should be lower.
Other important field crops 4nclude sugar beets, potatoes, fodder
crops and a wide assortment of vegetables. Fruits and vineyards are also
important crops and are often grown on soils that are too steep for inten-
sive cultivation. These crops occupy some 750,000 hectares and are usually
not included in the arable land.
Natural grasslands and natural pastures occupy about 4.3 million
hectares of land. Under present conditions, these areas are not very pro-
ductive. They receive very little attention and practically no fertilizer.
The plan calls for heavy fertilization by 1980. It is suggested that this
will probably not be economic at :east until more productive species of
legumes and grasses are introduced. and even there, the levels of fertilizer
use in the Government forecast are considered too high.

During the 1960's, fertilizer use increased rapidly (Table 2). It
should be noted however, that the rate of increase fell during the past few
years with little increase in nitrogen and phosphate since 1970. Even though
this was due to the decision to export rather than meet the local demand,
disturbances such as these in normal growth do have their effect in later
years and must be taken into account when estimating future use. In view of
the shortage of supplies for the local demand, the actual domestic consumption
figures give little indication about the potential fertilizer consumption.
In order to determine more properly how much fertilizer the Romanian agriculture
could have used economically, the agronomical aspects of fertilizer application,
such as soil fertility, arable land area, crop yields and fertilizer prices
have to be analysed.
The soil fertility in Romania is quite good. For example, in
1966 which was a year of good rainfall, and before significant quantities
of chemical fertilizer were applied, maize yields averaged 1.65 tons per
hectare. Yields per hectare of crops have increased in recent years in
response to better cultural practices and fertilizer application, but are
not high when compared with neighboring countries (Table 3), because of
current low fertilizer use in Romania.

However, Romania has recognized the need for increased fertilizer applica-
tion, and with the planned increase in local production, consumption is to
increase at a high rate. In projecting its future fertilizer needs, Romania
puts great emphasis on comparing its fertilizer use on a per hectare basis
with that of other countries. Such comparisons are of interest but should be
used with care. Often the type of crop grown, the climate, the availability
of markets and even the population pressure can greatly affect the amount of
fertilizer used. This can be illustrated by comparing fertilizer use per
capita and per hectare again with neighboring countries but also including
the Netherlands, a country which has one of the highest fertilizer application
rates in the world.

Even though Romania ranks low on both compari sons, the differences are much
smaller when compared on a fertilizer use per capita basis rather than on a
par hectare basis. However, considering the envisaged increases in fertilizer
consumption Romania shall soon rank up with other countries on a fertilizer
use per capita basis.
Crop response to applied chemical fertilizer appears about as one
would expect. Based on 1969 conditions, the responses to applied nutrients
are shown below:
Table 6. Average Increase per Kilogram of Nutrient
Crop                   N                   P205                      K20

Thus, for example, it is estimated that under 1969 conditions the marginal
income from application of nitrogen fertilizer to wheat is ranging from
5 to 15 kg of additional wheat per kg of applied nitrogen. Likewise, the
added yield expected in maize is from 2 to 15 kg of maize per kg of nitrogen
applied; or 2 to 7 added kg of maize per kg of P205 plant nutrient; only 1 to
1.5 kg of maize per kg of K20 plant nutrient.
In all these estimates, it is indicated that additional fertilizer
applications will result in additional yield of crop. These estimates,
however, are for 1969 conditions and as progress is made in applying more
and more fertilizers the marginal yields for additional applications will
continually decrease until at some poirnt the value of the additional yield
will be equal to or less than the cost of the added fertilizer. This point
has not been reached for the major field crops, and will not be reached
during the time span of the current study, i.e. by 1980 to 1984.
The range of responses discussed above are quite usual. Under
some conditions, such as hay ieldf, towever the 'heavy use of fertilizers
probably will not pay.  By thne =xnt these _ncreases in hay yield were con-
verted to meat and milk, the         would probably not pay the fertilizer
cost.  Also low response pz    8< would be expected at the early
stage of fertilization.  As y  .:. nc:a 9, however, crop removal will no
doubt- be such that the app      v.-   .jc  sn :r  will soon pay.



ANNEX 3-2

Also, as practices improve, including steps such as better varieties,
more irrigation, better weed control, the responses per kilogram of applied
nutrient will also increase. This, too, should encourage heavier fertiliza-
tion. Fertilizer use is at present concentrated only on a few major crops.
The Ministry of Agriculture estimates that 1972 fertilizer use was as in
Table 7. This distribution of fertilizer would seem well in agreement with
response data shown in Table 6.

2.   Availability of Different Types of Fertilizers
All finished nitrogen and phosphatic fertilizers available to
Pomanian agriculture are produced locally. Only potassium fertilizer is
imported. In early years nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers were produced
mostly as single-element materials. Small quantities of byproduct ammonium
sulfate along with ammonium nitrate, calcium ammonium nitrate and urea make
up the nitrogen fertilizers. Single superphosphate and triple superphosphate
were the primary sources of phosphate fertilizers. More recently, in 1966,
a diammonium phosphate plant located at Turnu Magurele began production. Raw
materials for phosphate fertilizer, phosphate rock and sulfur, are imported
but also some locally produced pyrites are used.
Even though Romania has become a major exporter of fertilizers,
especially nitrogen but also to some extent phosphatic fertilizer, Romanian
agriculture has not had adequate fertilizer.
The decision to improve fertilizer availability for local consump-
tion led to the selection of manufacturing complex fertilizers based on the
nitrophosphate process. At present four nitrophosphate fertilizer plants
are under construction - each with a rated capacity of 225,000 tons N and
100,000 tons P205. This rapid shift in type of fertilizer raises the ques-
tion of how well these new materials will fit the needs of the agriculture
of Romania.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 6
The nitrophosphate process utilizes nitric acid to attack phosphate
rock to make the phosphate in the rock more readily available to plants. The
end product is N to P205 ratios such as 1:1, 2:1, etc. It is theoretically
possible to make 0.7:1 ratio, but such a low nitrogen nitrophosphate has not
been made to any extent in other countries and is not planned for Romania.
Low-nitrogen, high-phosphate ratios are not feasible. No straight phosphatic
materials are produced by this process. In practice there is produced 2.25
units of nitrogen for each unit of phosphate. The excess nitrogen is produced
either as ammonium nitrate or as calcium ammonium nitrate.
Nitrophosphate fertilizers are widely used in European agriculture.
They are less popular in other parts of the world. In general, they are con-
sidered adequate sources of both N and P205.
A large share of the P205 in nitrophosphates is not in water-soluble
form (but is citrate-soluble). This is of concern especially where these
fertilizers are to be used on alkaline soils (above pH 7.0), of which Romania
has an estimated 3 million hectares. This factor obviously was considered,
9i.ce the production plan provides that at least 80% of the phosphate will be
in the water soluble form. Thus, it would seem that the phosphate would
serve Romanian agriculture fairly well. One could argue that the 20% that is
not water-soluble will be less efficient than other types on the alkaline
soils, but demonstrating this convincingly under field conditions would be
difficult. On the acid soils, it is doubtful that the extra cost to produce
water-soluble phosphate content of 80% instead of 60% can be justified.
A disadvantage of nitrophosphates from a consumption point of view
is the high N:P ratio and the inflexibility of this ratio. Phosphates can
be applied to a crop either at planting time or, depending upon work schedules,
well ahead of planting. Crop responses are about the same for either time
of application. Also, regardless of the amount of P205 needed by a crop,
all can be applied at once.
For best and most efficient results from nitrogen, however, a
different application schedule must be used. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate
should not be applied and then subjected to long periods of rainy weather.
Thus, fall application of nitrophosphates on wheats, oats, rye, and barley
would be wasteful of the nitrogen. When large quantities of nitrogen are
needed for a winter grown crop, the best agronomic practice is to use a small
amount at planting time and to apply the remainder as a topdressing or side-
dressing.
To further compound the difficul:y of using nitrophosphates at
planting time, only small amounts of nitrogen should be applied near seeds,
whereas large amounts of phosphorus are best applied near seeds. This is
an impossibility with nitrophosphates; in fact, the high-N:P ratio is just
backwards for using this fertilizer at planting time.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 7
The Ministry of Agriculture provided information that it was launch-
ing a program for recommending nitrogen use on wheat depending on the soil
moisture content. The recommendation is said to be for no more than 30
kilograms per hectare of N applied in the fall. Then, depending on soil
moisture, the additional nitrogen should be applied as topdressing. If more
than 30 kilograms per hectare of P 205 is to be applied at seeding, nitrophosphates
would not meet this need.
Nitrophosphate fertilizers do not encourage rhe practice of plowing
down phosphates. It is understood that much of the land for corn and other
spring-seeded crops is plowed in the fall in Romania. This is practiced to
permit earlier seeding in the spring and to iaprove the water-holding capacity
of the soil in the lower rainfall areas. Since phosphates do not leach, many
countries using high rates of fertilizer encourage phosphate application before
plowing. Nitrophosphate fertilizers do not fit well into such a system because
of the problem of nitrogen leaching.
Leguminous crops -- such as lucerne, soybeans and field beans --
usually require little or no nitrogen fertilizers. But they ususally respond
to and require fairly heavy applications of P205. Thus, straight phosphate
fertilizers are almost a must and N:P ratios of higher than 1:3 should never
be used.
Rice is another crop where nitrophosphates are less than ideal.
Ammoniacal nitrogen is a superior form due to the fact that nitrat.e nitrogen
is subject to heavy losses under paddy conditions. Urea and ammonium sulfate
are preferred to ammonium nitrate forms. This would require either a
straight phosphate or an ammonium phosphate to provide the phosphate needs.
At present, band placement of fertilizer close to the seed is not
practiced in Romania.  There is, however, within the Ministry of Agriculture
concern with improving the efficiency of use of applied fertilizers. Band
placement close to the seed is one way to improve the efficiency of fertil-
izer use.  Agronomists from the United States Midwest generally agree that
banded phosphate is at least twice as effective as broadcast phosphate.
This advantage shows up especially well in early seedling growth and helps
to combat early weed growth in corn. Again, nitrophosphates do not fit this
need since the nitrogen can cause seedling injury and/or mortality.
Based on the application aspects for nitrophosphate fertilizers
discussed above, at least a portion of the P205 needed for Romanian agrtcul-
ture should not be in the nitro%nosphatc form. A rough estimate of this need
for 1980 is shown in Table 8.  S;ould R=mar:a adopt the practices of wide-
spread use of piowdown analor:   -izicerent. of fer4iiizers, even greaaer
percentages, possibly as much a-alf  of the P205 fertilizers should be in
other forms -- triple superpho&phare and/or ammoaiated phosphates, such as
DAP.

In summary, the building of the four nitrophosphate plants in
Romania can be justified but additional phosphate capacity should definitely
be provided in the form of DAP or TSP as has been provided for in the Tecuci
project.
It should be pointed out that it is possible to make low nitrogen
high phosphate grades within Romania from the existing and planned produc-
tion while still utilizing sizeable quantities of nitrophosphate. This can
be accomplished through the granulation of nitrophosphates of a 1:1 grade
with triple superphosphate to make at least a 1:2 grade.
Possibly, a better solution would be to blend the same ingredients.
To date no blending facilities are known to exist in Romania. Blending
plants are relatively inexpensive and simple to operate. The proposed serv-
ice centers, that are discussed in this report, would be a logical location
for such blending facilities. Blending fac4lities would be quite useful
in that they could make a wide range of grades that may be needed to serve
Romanian agriculture while permitting the granulation units to make a minimum

The use of a fertilizer - crop price relationship, however, gives
a fairly objective analysis for determining whether the agronomic-economic
benefits of fertilizers in Romania are as good as, better than, or worse than
in other countries. In Table 11, "price ratios, fertilizers to crops," it
seems clear that Romanian authorities have priced their fertilizers to their
farmers at a level which is as good as or better than that in the US, even
in 1970 and 1971, when fertilizer prices in the US were severely depressed.

In each case studied, the fertilizer to corn and wheat price ratios are
slightly better than the corresponding price ratio in the US for this period.
In short, then, the relative prices set on fertilizers and on crops in Romania
provide a better economic incentive for fertilizer use than existed in the
US when fertilizer prices were severely depressed. This relationship can
only greatly encourage increased demand for fertilizers in Romania.
4.   Exports of Fertilizer
Romania has become a major exporter of nitrogen fertilizers during
the recent years. The exports, which started only in the mid-sixties, have
reached a substantial level in 1973 with about 580 thousand tons of nitrogen.
Table 12.   Export of Nitrogen Fertilizers
-in 1000's of tons of N-
1965         1970            1971            1972            1973

The increase of exports over the past years should be seen in view of the
increased domestic production capacity and the high international fertilizer
prices. Long-term contracts exist for most of Romania's exports (70%); 20%
are supplied to countries on an established basis and the rest represents
spot sales. Prices of exports are reportedly on the basis of world market
prices. At present, Romania's main markets are China (23%), India (15%),
Egypt (12%), Algeria (9%), France (5%) and West Germany (5%). Practically
all exports are undertaken within bilateral trade agreements.
The major importers and the types of fertilizers exported are shown
in the following Table:

C. Market Forecast for Romania
1.   Official Forecast of Crop Production and Fertilizer Consumption
Actual crop production for 1960-1972 and production goals for
the 1975-1980 period for selected crops are shown in Tables 14-17. Tables
19 shows the magnitude of these increases on a percentage basis. In general,
crop production goals appear to be realistic with 1980 yields some 40 to 60%
above 1972 yields. This would require annual increases of about 5% per year
or slightly more. Increases of more than 5% per year, however, would probably
be difficult to maintain for any significant period of time.
Fertilizer use projections were also furnished. Table 18 shows
projections by the Ministry of Agriculture, by area and nutrient for the
period 1972-1980. It should be pointed out that these projections were made
before data on fertilizer use for 1972 and estimates for 1973 use were avail-
able. By comparing data in Table 18 and Table 2, it can be seen that sig-
nificant shortfalls were experienced in both 1972 and 1973. (Please note
that the projections, Table 18, are based on a calendar year while actual use,
Table 2, is based on an agricultural year.) The fertilizer estimates (Table
18) apparently were derived by estimating the fertilizer that could be used
on a given crop and then multiplying by the estimated area for 1980. This
derivation is shown in Table 20. As mentioned previously, crop production
goals seem to be in line with what can be attained, or it may even be sur-
passed. Fertilizer use estimates, however, seem to be overoptimistic.

2.   TVA Forecast of Fertilizer ConSumption
TVA reconstructed the official estimates in Table 21 based on the
quantities believed necessary to reach Romania's stated crop production goals
(Tables 16-17). This should not imply that quantities of fertilizer stated
in Table 21 will be used, but should be considered as a maximum consumption
of nutrients that could be efficiently used in 1980 to reach planned crop
production goals. It should again be pointed out that fertilizer use in both
1972 and 1973 showed little gain over previous years; this suggests that
reaching projected 1980 crop yields may be difficult.
Other constraints -- the largest of which may be the lack of infrast-
ructure, which will be discussed later -- may also contribute to a shortfall
of fertilizer use by 1980.
Due to these constraints and the shortfall in fertilizer consumption
in 1972 and 1973, TVA estimated that fertilizer use in 1980 in order to reach
forecasted crop production goals, should be not higher than the range shown
in Tables 21 and 22.

/a   Data modified by Bank staff to correct for higher irrigation area than
in data given to TVA.
TVA's estimates (Table 22) are significantly lower for each nutrient
than the Romanian estimates (Table 18). The largest reduction, both relatively
and absolutely, is in estimated nitrogen use. By crops, the largest difference
(440,000 tons N and 190,000 P205) is in the amounts estimated for use on
natural hay and natural pasture. This reduction was felt necessary due to the
low response (Table 6) and due to the fact that little or no fertilizer is
currently used on these crops. It is doubtful if high rates of fertilizer
will ever pay on natural pasture and hay. New, high-yielding species of legumes
and grasses will have to be introduced before significant amounts of fertilizer
can be justified.
Returning to crop production goals, it is felt that the per hectare
yieldi goals for 1980 as slhown in Table 17 can be attained if average fertilizer
use approaches tihat are shown in Table 22 (TVA's forecast).  As evidence of this,
average U.S. corn production ir. 1972 was approximately 6 tons per hectare with
aver?age nutrient applications of only 120-65-65 (N-P205-K20). The Romanian
Ih) is 4.51 tons per hectare witn a projected average fertilizer requirement
of 159-03-32.  This production goal was reached in the US by 1965 with an
average application of 72-45-40.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 11
A short study of U.S. corn production with increasing fertilization
es that with advanced hybrids and good management practices, as are
a;aJ.laaole in Romania, major changes in production rates per hectare are
possible with smaller increasee in fertilizer application rates than have been
projected for Romanian agriculture. Between 1964 and 1972 U.S. corn production
per hectare increased 65% (Table 24) as nutrient application increased from
about 125 to about 250 kilograms per hectare. These set of data are plotted
as a segment of a production curve as shown in figure 1. Theoretically, of
course, this production curve is a curved surface in an area of decreasing
returns to scale. Pragmatically, however, the short segment can be plotted
as a straight line--and TVA arrives at an equation: Production (Y) = 2315 +
13.08 (total NPK).

Thus, to produce 4,510 kilograms of maize per hectare (thie Romanian
goal for 1980) would require only 168.5 kilograms total plant nutrients per
hectare. This compares witlh the TVA estimate of 178 and the Romanian estimate
of 254.
As further evidence that Romanian agriculture should approach the
pattern of the United States in production of maize, a look at the 1972 record
is useful. It is estimated by Romanian officials that 15% of the total N and
P205 fertilizers used in 1972 was used on maize, i.e., about 89,000 tons plant
nutrient on about 3,196,000 nectares of corn. Thus, about 27.8 kilograms of
plant nutrient per hectare was applied. If the above formula were applied,
tne projected use of plant nutrient would ihave been 58 kilograms per hectare.
In short, Romanian agriculture actually did better than the formula would nave
projected.  Of course, much animal manure may have been applied.  Nevertheless,
Rorianian agriculture is capable of reaching its assigned goals in 1980 with
substantially smaller amounts of plant nutrient than have been projected by
the Romanian authorities.
Using the same general approach, TVA looked at alternative levels
of agricultural production. TVA estimated -- from the scarce data (and cer-
tainly not sufficient data to meet recognized standards of statistical sig-
nificance) - that a 10% increase in level of agricultural production over
the projected 1980 goals might well be obtained by use of approximately 20%
increase in fertilizers applied. Thus, to obtain an added 10% increase in
agricultural production over that projected for 1980 would require probably
an additional use of 240,300; 160,OGO; and 60,000 tons respectively of N,
P205, and K20 over that estimated in Table 22.
Conversely, if plant nutrient availability to Romanian farmers in
1980 is as low as 20% below the estimated requirements in Table 22, there
could well be expected a shortfall in the crop production goal of something
approaching 20%.
TVA, at the request of the Bank made a long range forecast of
cropping patterns and fertilizer consumption by 1984, which is shown in
Tables 25 and 26.  This forecast should only be used to provide some rough
guidance oni what may happen with tihe fertilizer use from 1980 onwards.
In future years, It is expected thlat .aising of animals, especially
beef cattle and hogs, will become rmore ir;portant.  This would cause several
changes in crops -- a shift toward more corn and soybeans, an improvement in
past,ires and hay fields (including some seeding to imporved species), an increase
in liu-erne, and a general itntensification of agriculture as practices ard Inputs
use lmprove.  Table 25 shows what this mIght do to fertilizer usage.  Com-
paring it witth Tabe 22, it will be noted that total agricultural land shows
an increase,  This does Tnot foresee more total land coming into production but
is, in effect, possible as (dou'.le-cropping becomes Enore widely practi70A,
cspecially or irri-ated land.

By 1984, the effective arable land under this projection would be
about 11.5 million hectares. Nutrient use per hectare would be about 300 kg.
This compares with the TVA estimates of about 232 kilograms per hectare of
erable land (based on 9.7 million hectares) in 1980. Fertilizer use during
the 1980-1984 period would have to increase at an overall rate of about 9%
per year to reach these goals. Table 26 illustrates the rates of growth that
would be required to meet the 1984 estimates. Growth rates for nitrogen and
P205 may appear to be low. However, it is anticipated that by 1984 the
efficiency of fertilizer recovery by plants will have increased due to better
management and adoption of new technology, such as row placement of phosphates
and more timely applications (topdressing) of nitrogen. It is felt that these
fertilizer rates would be adequate to meet a normal increase of crop production
of 4% to 5% per year.

3.   Bank Forecast of Consumption
With the wide divergence in forecasts by the Romanian Government
and TVA, Bank staff has prepared its own consumption estimates, taking into
consideration the constraints in the two forecasts. TVA was limited by lack
of data and, as instructed, based its forecast on the planned Romanian crop
yields and cropping patterns, which are considered conservative. On the
other hand, the Romanian forecast appears not to take into account sufficient
increase in crop productivity with increased fertilizer use and better farm
management practices and overstantes fertilizer consumption for pastures,
hayfields and soybeans. The Bank staff forecast, Table 27, is largely based
on unconstrained growth, derived from the optimum data of TVA. It, tfierefore,
should only be taken as an approximate indication of the domestic fertilizer
potential of Romania over the next decade. The 1980 fertilizer consumption
level of 1.46 million tons of N implies a growth rate of about 5.5% in the
agricultural sector, whereas the official forecast and the TVA forecast are
based on 5% annual crop output increase. In view of the top priority given
by the Government of Romania to the agricultural sector, this optimistic
growth rate appears achievable.

4.   Fertilizer Production
As to fertilizer supply the estimates given by the Romanian Govern-
ment were modified slightly to show anticipated delays in commissioning new
plants in the next few years.  Using the past actual production of the
Romanian fertilizer industry as compared to the defined capacity level as
an indication, it is expected that on an overall basis there should be no
problem in meeting 1980 production goals.
Tables 28 and 29 show the production of various types of nitrogen
and phosphatic fertilizers as modified by the Bank. The 1972 records indicate
production of 874,000 tons of nitrogen; by 1980 total N production should
reach approximately 2-1/2 million tons of nitrogen.

In 1972 the Romanian industry produced 313,000 tons P205 fertilizers;
is 1g0 this will exceed 900,000 tons -- again a threefold increase. In
_'-ospnates, too, the produce mix will be changed dramatically from the current
product mix - to products based on nitrophosphates rather than those based
on phosphoric acid, as is now the case in Romania.
5.   Fertilizer Supply and Demand Balance
Table 30 shiows N and P205 supply, consumption and apparent exports
by years, assuming production at 100% of defined capacity and based on the
Banik consumption forecast. According to this analysis, Romania must export
sizable quantities of nitrogen as well as small quantities of phosphate
fertilizers each year between now and 1980. Although the forecast shows
exports of up to about 1.2 million tons N per year during 1976-1978, produc-
tion shortfalls due to delayed commissioning could reduce supply by 100-200,000
tons N per year during this period and thus decrease exports.

Table 31 shows production, consumption, and export availability
by type of fertilizer in 1980. Comparing Bank and TVA forecasts, it indicates
that Romania is building a fertilizer industry which will be based in large
measure on export possibilities. By 1980, Romania should export about 1.0
million tons of nitrogen, with P205 supply and consumption approximately
balanced. However, it should be noted that using TVA's forecast of maximum
domestic consumption could yield exports of about 1.3 million TPY of N and
about 70,000 TPY P205 (Table 31).

Note:     For simplicity, several figures have been rounded to the nearest
five thousand.
In summary, at least through 1984, the Tecuci plant will add to an
export availability for nitrogen fertilizer. Although in physical terms
Tecuci's materials will undoubtedly be distributed to a large extent in the
Maldovia region, in economic terms, the net result will be to increase total
Romanian exports for nitrogen fertilizers; phosphate fertilizers will serve
domestic market needs.
6.   Export of Fertilizers
Romania has become a major exporter of nitrogen fertilizers within
the past few years and has begun to export some phosphatic fertilizers. With
the pressure generated by requirements for foreign exchange, high international
fertilizer prices, and with the rapidly increasing production capacity, Romania
will increase its relative position as a world exporter of fertilizer materials.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 22
By 1980, if all plants currently under construction and being planned --
including the Tecuci plant - are completed and on stream, Romania will have
available for export some 1.0 million tons of nitrogen (Table 31). This will
place Romania as one of the world's larger exporters of fertilizer materials.
Curre:itly, the total nitrogen exported on the world market is approximately
seven million tons. The major markets for export materials foreseen for 1980
are those of the Asian subcontinent, Latin America, and perhaps equatorial
Africa. The US has become a net importer of nitrogen but not for long. It
will continue as a major net exporter of P205. The Middle East, Venezuela,
North Africa, Indonesia and other locations with natural gas, will continue
or increasingly become net exporters of nitrogen fertilizers.   The product
mix of nitrogen fertilizers which will be available for export is somewhat
contradictory to the rapidly changing trends of world trade in nitrogen mate-
rials (Table 32), mainly due to the CAN production from the NPK plants with
the nitric acid process. During the past 5 years, world trade in nitrogen
materials has shifted rapidly from ammonium nitrate and CAN type materials
to urea as the major trade item. FAO statistics reveal that in 1960 more
ammonium nitrate and calcium ammonium nitrate type materials were exported
than urea. By 1972, world exports of urea had been multiplied by more than
five times while exports of the lower analysis materials had not increased
appreciably. This trend is expected to continue toward urea and has been
taken into consideration in the project scope of Tecuci.
This change toward the higher analysis type materials is easily
explained. Costs of bags and bagging, handling, and ocean freight average
US$30 to US$50 per ton of exported material under present conditions. Thus,
these costs per ton of nitrogen for the 26% N CAN approximates US$115 to US$192,
while they are only US$65 to US$109 per ton of nitrogen for the higher analy-
sis, urea with 46% N (Table 33).
We can well expect, with this economic incentive toward trade in the
ihigher analysis materials, that the trend toward the higher analysis materials
will be accentuated as additional supplies become available. Accordingly, in
a difficult market situation the market for the lower analysis materials will
rapidly be depressed.

With the current world shortage of nitrogen fertilizers, any type of
nitrogen can be sold at premium prices. But it cannot be expected that the
shortage will continue, through the 1980's and traders in the lower analysis
materials will be at a disadvantage in a balanced market situation. Thus,
for a plant with the N capacity of the proposed Tecuci plant - 225,000 tons
of nitrogen per year, the producer can well expect to obtain some US$14.5
million per year more for urea on an explant basis than for equivalent amounts
of CAN (Table 34). Even greater losses might be incurred since it is quite
possible that low analysis material could not be moved on the world market.

TECUCI FERTILIZER PROJECT
Market and Marketing
D.   Fertilizer Market and Distribution System in Romania
1.   Distribution System and Structure of Consumers
The Romanian fertilizer distribution system of today is simple.
So far, there has not been enough fertilizer to supply the active demand,
and the system is apparently getting fertilizer from the factory to the
selected segments of the agricultural sector satisfactorily. In any such
expansion of fertilizer consumption in Romania as is planned for the current
decade, there will however be requirements for major changes in this distri-
bution and marketing system. Officials in the Ministry of Agriculture are
aware that some changes will be needed although they may not yet recognize
fully the magnitude of the changes required nor how quickly the system could
be severely impaired unless these changes are made.
The existing system entails forward planning of fertilizer and
other agricultural inputs by the cooperative and state farms and submission
of these plans to the District Agricultural Director who collates and summarizes
the plans for all farms in his district and forwards the plan for his district
to the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry of Agriculture collates and
summarizes the district plans into a ministry plan and coordinates this plan,
including its fertilizer requirements, with the Ministry of Chemical Industry.
The national agricultural plan then is submitted to the central planning
authorities and coordinated with the sectorial plans. Once approved, it then
follows the reverse route and in time the farms are notified how much ferti-
lizer and what type they will receive for the coming year.
With respect to the planning system for fertilizer alone, the system
seemingly has worked in the past -- probably because of the fertilizer shortage
and relatively low consumption level. The Ministry of Agriculture has been
willing to take any amount of any type of fertilizer which could be made
available by the Ministry of Chemical Industry at any time of the year. How-
ever, when demand is once satisfied, problems of planning for fertilizer move-
ment and use may become apparent. There will be need for much closer
coordination between the two ministries involved and a greater awareness by
each ministry of the problems faced by the other.
Currently, the physical distribution channel is simple. Fertilizer
is produced at the factory, loaded into a truck or a railroad car, and shipped
directly to the farm with no intermediate storage between the factory and the
farmer. Whenever fertilizer is available, it is shipped, and the farmers are
required to accept it at that time. Little or no provision has been made for



ANNEX 3-4
Page 2
storage of the material on the farms. Shipping distances, on average, are
not very great, and to date, the volume of fertilizer is low and can easily
be handled by the existing rail and trucking systems.   Experience in other
countries suggests that intermediate storage capacity should equal about
one-third of the annual use of fertilizers. This storage should be as close
as possible to the use area, not the production area. It is expected that,
by 1980, Romania will be using up to 5 million tons of fertilizer material
per year. Thus, intermediate storage equivalent to over 1-1/2 million tons
should be provided -- an investment approaching 1 billion lei.
Officials of the Ministry of Agriculture explained that there are
provisions for supplyinig fertilizers to the private farmers and to the private
plots of the farmers working on cooperative farms. However, they contend that
no fertilizer has been made available through these channels. It is possible
to distribute fertilizers to the private farmers through the Romanian system
of state wholesale and retail stores. But none has been made available since
the central planning committee has decided that limited fertilizers should
go to State and cooperative farms and not to individual farmers. For the
individual plots of the cooperative farms, fertilizer could be made available
through the cooperative retail store.
With fertilizer supply increasing rapidly during the coming years,
it will be essential that individual plots and individual farms, which account
for 13% of the arable land, be supplied with fertilizers too. They include
15% of the cereals for grain, 20% of the pastures and meadows, 30% of the
orchards and vineyards, and 45% of the total potatoes, vegetables, and melons
grown in Romania (Table 25). Such an important segment of the total agri-
cultural sector must be provided ample quantities of fertilizers if the total
agricultural plan is to be accomplished.
Credit availability should not pose any restraints to an increased
consumption of fertilizers. Under the Romanian system, the planning of
economic a:tivities is undertaken in physical terms and the funds necessary
for the movement of the goods are simply an outflow of the planning. The
funds do not represent the potential or non-potential to acquire or not acquire
certain goods, unlike in a market economy. If the farm unit has an allocation
for a certain amount of fertilizer as part of its overall production program,
the necessary credit requirements have been taken into consideration, and
the Agricultural Bank will finance the purchase of the fertilizer and pay
directly to the fertilizer factory upon delivery.
Ministry of Agriculture officials agree that some additional facilities
for intermediate storage of the materials must be made available. They plan to
try the installation of a pilot-type agricultural service center in 1974 with
two more centers to be added in 1975 on a pilot approach. As visualized, these
service centers would serve an area of 60,000 to 80,000 hectares and would
provide intermediate storage for fertilizers and other agricultural inputs such
as seeds, insecticides, herbicides, etc. It is important that some system to
provide for intermediate storage of fertilizers be installed within the Romanian



ANNEX 3-4
Page 3
distribution and marketing system. Even today some portion of the total
fertilizers produced is lost as a result of the oversimplified distribution
system. Fertilizer is being stored in the field with no protective cover.
In such situations, bags are broken when fertilizer is unloaded at the field
and some portion of the fertilizer is wasted.
Provision for intermediate storage of dry fertilizers is a relatively
inexpensive operation. It has been estimated that the investment cost of
such storage would approach Lei 1,000 per square meter. To store 1,000 tons
of fertilizer would require approximately 500 square meters of space. Thus,
the investment cost per ton for storage would approximate Lei 500. The direct
benefits would result in a saving of most of the wasted fertilizer, thus
resulting in annual benefits approximating Lei 50 to 150 per ton of material
handled.

2.   Market for Tecuci Fertili:er Project
The stated market for the production of the Tecuci fertilizer plant
is the Moldavia region. This includes the districts of Botsani, Suceava,
Neamt, Iasi, Vaslui, Bacau, Vrancea and Galati. This area represents about
19.4% of the agricultural land of Romania. From Table 35 it can be seen that
the agriculture (crop hectarage and animal numbers) is quite similar to the
agriculture of the country as a whole.

By assuming that the crops in the Moldavia region will be fertilized at the
same rate as for the country as a whole it is possible to estimate fertilizer
demand for 1980 (Table 36). Moldavia could probably utilize more than the
equivalent in N and P 205 of that produced by the proposed Tecuci plant by
1980.

TECUCI FERTILIZER PROJECT
Project Scope and Description
The principal products of the Tecuci project are diammonium phosphate
(DAP) and urea plus several industrial products. The individual process plants
are shown in the flow sheet in Annex 4-2 and are listed below:

Urea is produced from ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) which
in turn are produced by steam reforming of natural gas (methane). DAP,
(NH4)2HP04, is produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid (H3po4) with ammonia,
followed by granulation and drying. Phosphoric acid, is produced from imported
phosphate rock (an impure mineral consisting largely of calcium phosphate,
CA3(P04)2; and sulfuric acid (H So4) which in turn is produced from sulfur.
A solid by-product, calcium sul ate or gypsum, is produced which must be
disposed of. In Tecuci, a portion of the gypsum, about 400,000 TPY, will be
dried and sold as cement retardent and for agricultural purposes; and the
balance, up to about 150,000 TPY, will be pzocessed into construction materials,
either wallboard or blocks. Phosphate rock also contains fluorides that are
emitted as hydrofluosilicic acid (H2SiF6) in the gaseous effluent from phos-
phoric acid manufacture.  In Tecuci, the H2SiF6 is recovered and converted
into aluminum fluoride.
The 300,000 TPY ammonia plant will be a single stream unit based
on a Kellogg (US/UK) design and a duplicate of five other units under con-
struction or in commissioning in Romania. The only raw material required for
ammonia production is natural gas which would be delivered to the Tecuci
plant from the national pipeline network. The processing steps consist of
gas compression, steam reforming, conversion to carbon dioxide and hydrogen
with air, removal of carbon dioxide, synthesis gas compression and ammonia
synthesis. The ammonia plant design is based on minimum energy requirements
and produces significant quantities of steam used in other parts of the plant
or converted to power.

The 420,000 TPY urea plant will be a Stamicarbon (Netherlands) unit,
either as a 3-line duplicate of existing units in Romania based on standard
total recycle urea technology or a single stream unit based on Stamicarbon's
newer process called "stripping". The advantage of the latter is reported
to be lower capital and operating costs but would require a non-Romanian
contractor and may have a higher foreign exchange cost as a result. The
processing steps consist of reacting NH3 and a)2 to form ammonium carbonate,
decomposition to urea and NH3, recycling NH3, concentration to remove all
water and then solidifying the urea by "prilling" i.e., spraying the urea
smelt through a tall vertical tower. The urea is stored in bulk and bagged
prior to shipment. IPROCHIM is currently obtaining tenders for the "stripping"
process from Stamicarbon to compare the investment and operating costs under
Romanian conditions. This review should be completed by the end of April and
the choice of technology would be known prior to negotiations. Since the
investment costs (Annex 5-1) are based on the 3-line conventional plant, the
investment costs are considered conservative.
The sulfuric acid plant would be in two streams based on IPROCHIM's
own design and a duplicate of a plant IPROCHIM has under construction in
Romania. The sulfur would be imported (from Poland) and received in a solid
form by rail. The sulfur is melted, burned in air to form sulfur dioxide
followed by catalytic conversion of the S02 to s03 which is then absorbed in
water to form H2S04. A two-stage absorption system is used designed to
minimize the amount of sulfur oxides discharged to the air.
IPROCHIM has very conservatively stated emission levels at 80 kg/day
S02 maximum. The catalyst used, which is critical to the successful and
efficient operation of the plant, would be imported from BASF (FRG), an
experienced firm in sulfuric acid technology and catalyst manufacture.
The phosphoric acid technology has not yet been selected. It will
be a single-train design either using IPROCHIM's conventional "dihydrate"
process or a "hemihydrate" process obtained from several licensors under
consideration i.e., Fisons (UK), Nissan (Japan), and Prayon (Belgium). The
evaluation, which is currently being made by IPROCHIM, will depend, in part,
on which gypsum processing technology is selected. Gypsum or calcium sulfate
is a by-product from phosphoric acid production from phosphate rock. Most
of the gypsum will be dried for use as cement retardent and for agricultural
purposes. The balance will be converted to blocks or wallboard for the
construction industry. This technology is now also being evaluated by IPROCHIM.
The processing steps required are phosphate rock grinding, reaction
of rock with sulfuric acid, filtering and removing the resulting gypsum, and
concentration of the phosphoric acid to about 52% P205.
The gypsum produced contains P205 and fluorine from phosphate rock,
which must be removed if the gypsum is to be used for industrial purposes.
The advantage of the "hemihydrate" process is that less P205 is lost into the
gypsum, improved P205 recovery and minimum clearing steps needed to process
the gypsum.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 3
Aluminum fluoride is produced from fluoride gases evolved during
phosphate acid manufacture and thereby reduces emission levels. Aluminum
fluoride is an industrial chemical used in producing aluminum. The fluoride
gas is absorbed in water to produce Hydrofluosilicic (H2SiF6) acid which
is then reacted with aluminum hydroxide to produce aluminum fluoride. The
emission level of fluoride from the plant would be up to 2 kg/day F. The
technology is from Chemi-Linz (Austria) and IPROCHIM has built several plants
in Romania, now in operation.
Diammonium phosphate (DAP) would be produced in a 4-line plant using
technology from IPROCHIM and C&I Girdler (US) from a duplicate of another
plant in Romania. The processing steps are a neutralization of phosphoric
acid with ammonia, granulation, drying, cooling, and transport of the solid
DAP to storage. The DAP is stored in bulk and bagged prior to shipping.
The air separation plant is only indirectly connected to the balance
of the fertilizer plant. The ammonia plant requires a small amount of nitrogen
for commissioning and start-up. The liquid oxygen produced would be used
for other industrial purposes in Romania. The unit would be imported based
on technology from one of several experienced engineering firms such as Linde
(US) and L'Air Liquide, (France).

I/ As in the financing plan, estimates include us$ 5 million for phosphogypsum processing facilities.
Since no definite decision on these fcilities has been taken by Romania, this amount has not been
included in the   rate of return calculations (Amex 7-2); also on operating costs and revenues for
this portion have been included in the financial statements.
1/ Import Duty ranges from 10% to 48% of value of imported equipment and materials.
2/ Related Investments consist of social buildings but to a larger extent of infrastructure investments
such as gas, power, rail and water connections which are related to the constructuion of the project.
3/  Contingency of 5% on local and 10% on foreign expenditures have been included in the capital cost
estimates (except for stainless steel the scope of which is well defined and which will be committed
shortly).
4/ In view of i-he system of fixed prices in Romania, no escalation on local expenditures has been provided
for. Price escalation on foreign expenditures has been assumed at lCV p.a. starting from the mid-1974
base estimates until the date of expected committment (excluding Lei 122 million equipment already
purchased and stainless steel).
5/  Working Capital Estimates are based on Romanian regulations and provide for ample working capital.
6/ Total Capital Costs and Financing Required at start-up at 1978 prices.

basis until the entity is in a position to retain own funds for the financing of permanent working capital. Therefore, the National Bank is repaid fron retained funds in 1979 and 1980.
2/ Mainly considting of retained funds from the Central (Centralized Investment Fund) and State Budget funds.
3/ Any funds needed by the enterprise in excess of its own generated funds to cover its financial obligations are provided by the Central.
4/ Related Investments for which financing is accounted for separately.

ROMANIA
TECUCI FERTILIZER PROJECT
Cash Flow and Distribution of Benefits (Profits) in the Industrial Sector
A.   Introduction
1.        Every enterprise must draw up a financial plan in support of its
annual material plan. This plan, which specifies sources and uses of funds,
is not initially required to balance at the level of the enterprise. The
Central, which has the primary role in financial planning, then allocates
surpluses and deficits among enterprises in an attempt to balance their
financial plans. If the total sources and needs of all enterprises under
the Central do not match, the Central identifies the difference to indicate
its needs/contributions to the State Budget; in case of a surplus, the fi-
nancial plan included a matching entry for allocation to the State Budget;
in case of an overall deficit, an equivalent amount is requested from the
State Budget. The same process is followed at the Ministry level and the
State Budget level. Since the overall investments authorized for the whole
economy for a fiscal period are always supposed to equal the expected overall
financial resources, the financial plan must balance at the State Budget
level. Because of this balancing, debt default at any of the organization
structure is not possible in theory.
2.        Financial flows provide a major means of controlling an enterprise's
activities. All funds flow in and out of a number of special accounts held
for the enterprise by the National Bank (for the operational activities) and
the Investmnent Bank (for the construction activities). Sales receipts are
all credited to a National Bank account labeled "Account B", but the amounts
needed to meet payments for wages, materials, utilities and short-term loans
are immediately transferred from this account to "Account A". The funds
remaining in "Accotunt B" are used for bi-monthly depreciation, profit, and
tax remittances and can cover temporary shortages in "Account A". A part of
these extra funds go into special enterprise funds (e.g. for prizes) and
modernization funds also held by the National Bank and are used only for
designated purposes. The enterprise holds only a small amount of petty cash
for entertainment, office expenses, etc.
B.   Distribution of depreciation charges and scrap value of obsolete equipment
3.        Internally-generated depreciation funds and revenue from the sale
of obsolete equipment are used as needed to finance State-approved expansion
(called centralized investment) within the enterprise or to repay loans for
previous expansion. Excess funds are transferred to the Central and then to
the Ministry, if necessary, to be used for centralized investment in other



ANNEX 6-5
Page 2
e.:ernrises.  If neither the Central nor the Ministry requires such funds,
--e.  are remitted to the State Budget.  Depreciation is charged on all
:-nstalled assets even though they may be fully depreciated. The enterprise
is permitted to request that up to 25% of the depreciation on assets which
have outlived their expected lives be allowed to be retained to finance
unplanned improvements or capital repairs. In addition, an amount up to
15% of the depreciation of these assets can be allocated to the non-centralized
investment fund held by the Central. This fund finances major capital repairs,
modernization, social investments (e.g. in housing).
C.   Distribution of excess working capital
4.        If the National Bank decides that an enterprise has more working
capital than necessary to proiuce a given output, this excess working capital
must be redistributed. The f:!rst claim on this surplus is to meet planned
working capital growth needed to cover increased output targets of the enter-
prise itself. Any remainder will be allocated among other enterprises within
the Central and lastly, among other enterprises within the Ministry concerned.
If not needed by them, it is remitted to the Budget. However, such redistri-
bution is possible only for usages already authorized by the National Bank.
D.   Distribution of Benefits (Profits)
5.        Prior to 1969, enterprises had little control over the utilization
of benefits earned by them; over 50% of profits were allocated by law to the
state budget and very little funds could be spent at the discretion of the
enterprises. However, various reforms since then have reduced the mandatory
allocation to the state budget; the enterprises now have the first right over
utilization of their depreciation funds; discretionary funds like the re-
serve fund and the fund for non-centralized investments, described later,
have been created; and the centrals can allocate unused funds from one
enterprise to another before returning the surplus funds to the state.
6.        Major allocations of the profits are based on the planned benefits.
The planned benefit is the profit an enterprise includes in its annual in-
vestment and financial plan which is approved finally by the Council of
Ministers; such an approval gives these plans the status of a law. The
planned profit is based on the approved production plan (a part of the
annual plan of the ministry and the country) and the agreed prices and
costs.
7.        The annual financial plan also indicates the planned distribution
of the benefits. The distribution is made in the following order of priority:
(i) At least 10% 1/ of the benefits must be allocated to the
National Budget or the Local Budget depending on the
designation of the enterprise - Republic enterprises pay
1/   10% is the mandatory minimum and is deducted first.  Any surplus benefits
after other allocations also go to the budget.



ANNEX 6-5
Page 3
this allocation to the National Budget and local enter-
prises to the local budget. This allocation could be re-
garded as a corporate profit tax.
(ii) Workers' first allocation or the prize fund has the next
priority.  This alocation is at most 2% of the total wages
of all enterprise employees called the "salary fund". The
salary fund includes only direct wages and does not incor-
porate indirect labor costs like the social security, etc.
This allocation is used to pay bonus to the employees.
(iii) Bank Credits (loans) due during the year have the next prior-
ity. They include both the long/medium-term credits from the
Investment Bank and the short-term credits extended by the
National Bank for approved working capital needs.
(iv) Allocation for the centralized investments approved by the
Council of Ministers in the investment plan of the enterprise.
Any surplus, if any, after this allocation would be further
distributed.
(v) Repayment of any funds borrowed from the National Bank over
the working capital norms. Such credits are approved in
special cases, e.g. when an enterprii;e exceeds its produc-
tion target, needs additional inventory due to special supply
conditions, etc. All National Bank credits must be repaid
every year and new credits negotiated for the next year.
(vi) Allocation to the Non-Centralized Investments Fund, which is
used for productive investments in the social field. This
allocation is based on the rentability 1/ (profitability) of
the enterprise:
Maximum Allocation of
Rentability                     Profits to Uncentralized Fund
Less than 2%                                   4%
2.01  -   5%                                   3%
5.01  -  10%                                   2.5%
10.01 -  15%                                   1.5%
Over     15%                                   1%
(vii)  Allocation to the Reserve Fund up to a maximum of 0.1% of
enterprise's working capital.  This fund is used for miscel-
laneous expenses, e.g. protocol, representation, and to repay
the excess working capital borrowings, National Bank and other
credits if benefits in a particular year are not adequate to
do so.

ANNEX 6-5
Page 4
(viii) Best Workers Fund deduction. It cannot exceed 0.05% of the
salary fund and is used to give special bonuses to outstand-
ing workers/teams.
(ix) If any funds are left after the above allocations, they can
be used by the Central to make centralized investments in
other enterprises under it.
(x) Any funds left over even after they are remitted to the state
budget cannot be claimed back the next year.
8.        Even if the actual benefits nade by an enterprise are less than
the planned benefits, the budgeted allocation to the budget (minimum 10%
plus any planned surplus allocations) must be made first. After meeting
this obligation, the workers bonus allocation must be made even if credit
repayment cannot be made. The bank credits are repaid next; if the benefits
after the budget allocations are inadequate, the reserve fund of the enter-
prise is used for repayment. Benefits and/or reserve funds from other allo-
cations are used for such repayments before other allocations are made. How-
ever, no allocations to the Uncentralized Investments Fund, Best Workers Fund
and Reserve Fund are made if planned benefit is not achieved. 1/
9.        If the actual benefits are more than the planned benefits, the
employees bonus allocation is increased proportionately, e.g. an extra 10%
benefits would also increase the workers allocation 10% above the planned.
The additional benefits are next used to repay any credits obtained for
modernization but the repayment is again proportional to the additional
benefits; for 10% extra benefits, 10% of such credits would be repaid from
these extra "unplanned" funds. The balance is distributed between the Re-
publican and the Local Budgets. The ratio of this distribution depends on
the development stage of and the investment possibilities in the district
in which the enterprise is located and is specified by law and can be varied
from year to year by the Ministry of Finance. For example, for enterprise
located in a poor district, 80% of surplus additional benefits may be allo-
cated to the Local Budget and only 20% to the Republican Budget. For Tecuci
enterprise, this ratio will be about 30% for the Republican and 70% for the
Local Budget.
E.   Creation of Special Funds
10.       Output prices are set high enough above basic unit input costs so
that a number of special funds can be created. Most of these funds, such as
the fund for invention, innovation and improvement and the fund for worker's
protection, are remitted to the Central and then redistributed in accordance
with demonstrated needs. Funds for research and development can often be
kept by the enterprise.
1/   Hlowever, it appears that in practice small allocations are made for
these categories even if planned profits are not achieved.



ANNEX 6-5
Page 5
P.   Sales Taxes
11.       Turnover and regularization taxes are invoiced by the enterprise
when certain consumer goods are sold. These taxes are remitted directly from
the enterprise's account in the National Bank to the Budget.
G.   Budget Allocations
12.       Budget allocations channelled through the National Bank are used to
finance annual loans for increased working capital when other sources are not
available. In the case of new enterprises, the initial working capital en-
dowment comes from the Budget through the National Bank in the form of a non-
reimbursable advance. In the case of large centrally-planned investment proj-
ects, most, if not all, of the financing comes from the Budget through the
Investment Bank. This is particularly true for new enterprises. The Budget
also finances losses which cannot be covered by other sources.

TECUCI FERTILIZER PROJECT
Control and Audit System in the Industrial Sector
1.        To support its highly centralized decision-making process, Romania
has, at least in its industrial sector, an elaborate control and audit system
designed to keep the managers at all levels of the economy advised of the
progress of, and deviations from, the planned activities. This control
system is backed by a fairly strong incentives system. The system, de-
scribed below, includes not only the audit system generally used by the
industry in other economic systems familiar to the Bank Group, but also
the work generally performed by Corporate Controllers, National Controller
Generals and Audit Groups (like the GAO in the USA), as well as some of the
duties entrusted to the National Courts dealing with judicial cases concern-
ing commercial activities. It has three major objectives: (i) to audit the
financial accounts to ensure that they accurately reflect the actual finan-
cial status of the unit; (ii) to report to higher authorities that the eco-
nomic assets are being used efficiently and effectively in accordance with
the national plan; and (iii) to recommend changes desirable to improve the
economic use of the assets in future.
2.        The control and audit system is organized like a pyramid as shown
in Table 1: at the top is the Court of Superior Control reporting directly
to the President of the country, while at the bottom are the accountants
checking and approving routine day-to-day financial transactions at the
enterprise level. The numerous organizations involved perform either the
"Internal Control" or the "External Control" duties. The Internal Control,
conducted by the accountants and internal controllers working either for the
Enterprise or its Ministry, can be divided in two broad categories: first,
the preliminary control which involves a day-to-day check of all financial
transactions; second, the posterior control which resembles annual audits.
The External Control, simultaneously carried out by three main organizations,
the Banks, Ministry of Finance and the Court of Superior Control, which are
independent of the Ministry concerned, also has the preliminary and posterior
control functions. As described below, all the bodies involved perform their
functions independently of each other and report to different authorities.
Thus an enterprise, during a period of one year, is controlled by (i) its
chief accountant who reports to the manager and also to the general manager
of the Central; (ii) the internal controller, who submits reports both to
the general manager of the Central and the Minister concerned; (iii) the
inspectors from the Investment Bank and/or National Bank, whose reports
are also available to the Ministry of Finance, (iv) the controllers from
the Ministry of Finance; and (v) the inspectors from the court of Superior
Control, whose reports can reach the Council of Ministers and the President
himself, if necessary.



ANNEX 6-7
Page 2
A.   Interna. Control System
3.        Preliminary Control:  The chief accountant at each commercial unit,
e.g. Enterprise, Central, performs the "preliminary control" functions which
combine activities of both the accountants and controllers as familiar to
us. lie is responsible for checking and approving all financial transactions,
e.g. payments, orders, etc. to ensure that the business is conducted in the
most economic way and according to the approved plans. He reports directly
to the General Manager of the unit and is supposed to report any disagree-
ments to the manager of the supervising unit. For example, if the chief ac-
countant of an Enterprise does not agree with a payment authorized by the
manager, he is expected to report it to the general manager of the Central.
To ensure the objectivity and independence of the chief accountant, he is
nominated by the supervising unit or the Ministry and cannot be changed by
the management of the unit he audits. This system may be further modified
under a new law on "Internal Control" which is now being drafted as a follow-
up of the recent policy decision to create the Court of Superior Control (see
para 13); under this new law the chief accountants may be subordinated to the
Ministry of Finance instead of the Ministry of the Central concerned as at
present.
4.        Posterior Control performed by the special "Internal Control Units",
is somewhat similar to the work performed by the certified accountants and/or
national audit organizations. These control units spotcheck financial trans-
actions conducted during the year and evaluate the financial state of the
company, including the actual value of its stated assets. The audit must be
conducted at least once a year for all enterprises, unless specially exempted
by the Ministry of Finance; such exemptions are given to very small units
like shops, schools, hospitals, etc., which are generally audited once every
2-3 years. The audit involves a check of 14 items listed in law No. 5 of
1970; some of the items are:
Inventory:  quantity, quality and value
Payments, receipts, etc:  their accuracy and validity
Documents, e.g. orders, checks
Entries in accounting books:  their conformity to the rules
of the Ministry of Finance
Status of assets and liabilities:  actual vs book entries
-    Techno-economic indicators, e.g. productivity, input/output
ratios, etc.: their accuracy.
Thus, an internal audit not only certifies the correctness of the financial
hooks but also presents an opinion about the efficiency of operations.



ANNEX 6-7
Page 3
5.        The accounts of a unit are examined by the Internal Controller lo-
cated in its supervising unit; accounts of a department are checked by the
control unit in the Enterprise, while the accounts of the Enterprise are
checked by the control unit in the Central. This internal audit is the basis
of all other higher audit/control activities designed to monitor the efficiency
of the economy. The Internal Controller is expected not only to give an opinion
on the financial status of the unit, as done by the certified accountants in
the USA, but also checks other items like the techno-economic indicators and
makesrecommendations on the improvements desired in the organization. The
internal audit also establishes the differences, with their reasons, between
the actual status and recorded entries. The chief accountant of the organiza-
tion takes into account these comments before issuing the final financial state-
ments. It is understood, however, that the Internal Controllers do not certify
the accuracy of the final statements, which is the responsibility of the chief
accountant.
6.        The Internal Controllers are nominated by the Ministry concerned
and approved by the Ministry of Finance. However, an Internal Controller
can neither be transferred nor removed without prior approval from the Min-
istry of Finance. Under the new draft lawr on Internal Control procedures
mentioned earlier, the power to approve the appointments and transfers of
the Internal Controllers may be shifted from the Ministry of Finance to the
Court of Superior Control. This measure, designed to make the controllers
even more independent from the operational managers, may be promulgated by
December 1973.
B.   External Control System
7.        This audit/control function is perforned by organizations outside
the operational units. The Banks perform the day-to-day "preliminary con-
trol" of purely financial natters, and seem to have the primary responsibil-
ity for conventional audit functions, the Ministry of Finance and the Superior
Control Court audit the techno-economic performance on "posterior" basis and
seem to concentrate on the financial control aspects.
8.        Preliminarv External Control by Banks:  Four banks (the National
Bank, Investment Bank, Food and Agriculture Bank, and Foreign Trade Bank)
are involved in this work. The law requires the Romanian banks to monitor,
and ensure the "economic" use of, their investments in the industrial unit>-
much more than, for example, a bank in the US would. The Banks not only com-
ment extensively on the desirability of an investment before it is approved
by the State, but also supervise and certify the appropriateness of invest-
ment work before releasing payments against supplies. In addition, the Na-
tional Bank not only approves the working capital included in the annual
financial plan, but also monitors actual requirements during the year.  No
transactions can be paid for without an approval from the bank concerned.



ANNEX 6-7
Page 4
9.        Each bank must monitor its own investments.  Investment Bank, which
provides financing for all new projects in every sector except agriculture and
food, supervises projects under construction while the National Bank, which
finances the working capital needs of on-going projects, supervises the units
in production. Thus, an enterprise may be "controlled" by more than one bank
at the same time. For example, the Craiova Central, which is executing ex-
pansion projects and also has production units already operational, has its
accounts concerning the production audited by the National Bank and accounts
concerning the expansion projects checked by the Investment Bank.
10.       The checks are fairly elaborate.  For example, in case of a large
investment, the Investment Bank will:
-    comment on the techno-economic study with particular reference
to the investment plan and forward its comments to the Council
of Ministers before it approves an investment;
-    receive a copy of the techno-economic study, which gives all
financial and technical data on the project, as approved by
the Council of Ministers. The Investment Bank is obliged to
ensure that the project is executed according to this plan;
-    approve all payments after checking that the supplies conform
to the purchase orders;
-    approve any variations from the approved contracts.  It may
impose penalties on the defaulting parties;
-    check that the project is proceeding according to the sched-
ule approved in the plan;
-    make all payments and is the conduit for all investment funds,
irrespective of source, allocated to the project.
11.       Similarly, the National Bank must approve the working capital needs
of the enterprise/central; it determines, in consultation with other parties
concerned, the norms to be applied in calculating the working capital needs
of an enterprise. At the beginning of the budget year, it approves the budget
allocation based on these norms; any additional needs must be justified by the
Enterprise to the National Bank. During the year, it periodically monitors
the actual needs; if the Enterprise needs funds above the budget allocation,
it must seek specific approval for them from the Bank.
12.       Ministry of Finance:  oversees the work of all the ministries.
Through its own controllers and by reviewing the reports of the Internal
Controllers (at the Ministries, Centrals and Enterprises), it ensures that
the actual performance is in conformity to the annual plan approved for



ANNEX 6-7
Page 5
each Ministry, and that the accounts of the Ministry and the Centrals/
Enterprises under it are maintained properly. The Finance Ministry reports
its findings to the Council of Ministers. Any expenditures exceeding the
allocation in the annual plans approved for a Ministry/Central must be
evaluated by the Finance Ministry and approved by the Council of Ministers.
13.       Court of Superior Control:  is a successor to the Account Court
established in 1864 and abolished in 1948; the Superior Court was created
under a new law promulgated on March 28, 1973. Most of the functions now
performed by this court were handled by the Ministry of Finance between 1948
and 1973. The court reports directly to the President of Romania; its prim-
ary function is to control the main state bodies in Romania, e.g. the Min-
istry of Finance, other Ministries and the Banks. It performs both the
"preliminary" and the "posterior" controls.
14.       The preliminary control is performed by the controllers (inspectors)
in each Ministry to ensure that the work is performed efficiently and the funds
are employed effectively. If the controller disagrees with any specific trans-
action, he discusses his findings with the Minister concerned. In case they
are unable to resolve the issue at this level, the controller presents his
report to the Superior Court. If thie Court concurs with the objections of
the controller, the matter is taken to the Council of Ministers for a deci-
sion, where both the Minister and the Court nresent their arguments. If the
Council overrules the objection raised by the Court, the President of the
country receives a report from the Court for his information.
15.       Similar procedure applies in case of the posterior control in which
inspectors from the Court audit the accounts of the State Bodies mentioned
earlier. The inspectors may also audit accounts of the Centrals, though at
present it is not done on an annual basis. The main objective of this con-
trol is to ensure that the main objectives of the National Plan are being
achieved, "economic efficiency" is being attained as planned, and the Cen-
tral Fund for Economic and Social Development, the main source of investments
in Romania, is being economically used.
16.       The Court, to perform its function, receives the following reports
regularly:
-    Quarterly reports from the banks on their financial status;
-    Finance Ministry's control reports;
-    Annual internal control reports from each Ministry, including
recommendations made by the internal Controllers.
The Court prepares its annual re-,ort -whi   :s submitted to the Presr.t an_
the State Council.  In this repo7t  tha Court also makes recornrendations on
the possibilities of improving the eczncoac use of national resources.  The
Court evaluates the reasons for th,, shortfalls in meeting the plan targets
and fixes the responsibility for them.



ANNEX 6-7
Page 6
The Court has three other major responsibilities:
(i)  It acts as the coordinating body for the overall control
system in the country; it ensures that there are no duplica-
tions and suggests means for improving the system.
(ii)  It acts as the counsellor of the State Council.  For example,
the President of the State Council may ask it to express its
opinion on state laws.
(iii)  It is a judicial court:  it analyses the 'damages' to the na-
tional economy due to economic mismanagement, fixes respon-
sibilities for such damages and determines what, if any,
penalties/punishment should be imposed on the individual(s)
concerned. However, only cases involving the senior officials
like the Ministers, Director Generals in the Ministries and
the General Managers of the Centrals are considered by the
Court of Superior Control.
