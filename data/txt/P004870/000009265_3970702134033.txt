DEMOCRA@TIC AIND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF AJLGERIA
EL ELLA NATIONAL PAJRK AND WETLANDS COMPLEX MAGEE-NT PROSJECT
1.    flsgkggja::  The El Kala National Park (EKNP) and surrounding region in
the northeast corner of Algeria contain one of the most important wetlands
areas in the Mediterranean, including a unique mixture of marine, coastal
dune, wetlands, lake, and forest habitats, that are each significant both in
quality and quantity. The EKNP has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere
Reserve; and two of the lakes in the EKNP, Lake Oubeira and Lake Tonga, have
been designated as Ramsar l/ Convention sites. This extensive wetlands
complex is a critical winter site for Palaearctic waterfowl, a breeding ground
for several endangered bird species including the white-headed duck OxQura
leucocenba1a, and the home range of a significant population of the threatened
barbary deer Cervus elanhus ssp barbarus. The area also has many outstanding
archaeological sites, including megaliths in the mountains and remains of
Carthagenian towns along the coasts.
2.    The El Kala wetlands region stretches in the northeast of the country
from the Tunisian border to the industrial city of Annaba. Presently about
100,000 people live in the EKNP and the wetlands, which are a major source of
water for the 500,000 inhabitants of Annaba, only 50 km away. In the El Kala
area, the pressure of population and development has led to severe degradation
of the environment due to expanding urban areas, pollution, and overuse of
water and land resources.
3.    Should this unique ensemble of natural resources, habitats, and
environment be further degraded or destroyed, the result would be an
irreversible loss of natural resources that are critical not only to Algeria,
but to the entire Mediterranean region. It is therefore imperative that
solutions resulting in ecologically sustainable development be found to
protect this area. In this respect, the GEF project is particularly timely
and appropriate. Moreover, Algeria, with a most recent per capita GDP of
about US$1,721 in 1993, fully qualifies for GEF financing.
4.    Currently, Algeria has no integrated management plan for natural
resource use or enforcement of pollution control measures to protect
ecologically sensitive areas. However, a whole host of laws aimed at
protecting such areas already exist the implementation of which is conditioned
by the elaboration of a National Environmental Action Plan. Meanwhile, the
country which is a party to the 1972 World Heritage Convention, has signed
most of the resolutions and protocols produced since the Barcelona Convention
in 1975 (which led to the adoption of the Mediterranean Action Plan),
including the 1982 protocol on Mediterranean Specially Protected Areas. The
Government is currently carrying out environmental activities with the support
of the Bank. In particular, an Environment Sector Study has been conducted
and will be discussed with the authorities shortly. The status of the
environment has become a top priority, particularly at the local level. In
recognizing the need for both preservation and ecologically sustainable
development of its natural resources, the Government of Algeria (GOA) has
requested funds from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to design and
implement a national park and wetlands complex management plan at El Kala.
5.    Algeria has a substantial body of environmental legislation and a number
of institutions inVolved in it.  Although, the country does not yet have a
comprehensive environmental policy it is committed, through its National
Commission, to elaborate such a policy. Also, some laws and regulations
pertaining to the protection of the environment will need to be revised.
Both the Agence Nationale pour la Conservation de la Nature (ANN) and the El
Ramsar sites are wetlands areas of international importance afforded
protection under the Ramsar Convention which Algeria signed in 1971, to
which Algeria became a party in 1984.

Kala National Park, which have the necessary authority to enforce
environmental laws and regulations, will need their staff reinforced to be
able to carry out public awareness and enforcement activities and to preserve,
within the region, the national heritage of natural and cultural assets in a
balanced and well-planned fashion. The Government is according high priority
to the project and has indicated its full support to the new vision as well as
to the project concept and objE'tives.
6.    prolect Obiectives:  'rhe proposed project would have three main
objectives. rhe first would be to mitigate the degradation of biodiversity
within EKNP and wetlands complex.  The seaond would be to establish at the
El Tarf Wilaya level a methodology and procedures for conducting environmental
impact assessment studies. The third would be for the Project to serve as a
model for the management and rational use of natural resources in populated,
albeit protected, areas.
7.    Prolect Description:  The project would develop and implement a
management plan for the EKNP and wetlands complex in the El Tarf Wilaya over a
3-year period. The project would: (it prepare and implement a national park
and wetlands complex management plan beginning in the first project year;
(ii) launch priority surveys and studies to improve the basic knowledge of the
area and potentials for better control and management; (iii) initiate
immediate actions to stop further degradation of the environment while the
management plan is being prepared; (iv) begin studies and adaptative research
programs in specific sectors likely to trigger sustainable development from
the use of natural resources; (v) develop environmental assessment capability
of the ANN and the Wilaya to evaluate, regulate, and monitor the impacts of
development on the area's natural resources; (vi) launch environmental
education and public awareness programs to muster the population's support;
(vii) introduce the participatory approach in the local communities and seek
the participation of national and local NGOs; and (viii) strengthen government
institutions, including ANN, the EKNP, and the Wilaya.
8.    Prolect-compomets: The grant would finance the preparation of a
management plan and commencement of its implementation no later than June 30,
1995. More specifically, the three-year project would include the following
components:
A.   NATIONAL PARK AND WETLANDS COMPLEX MANAGEMENT PLAN: The management
plan would update the zoning of the park based on preservation and
development criteria and would assign to each zone: (i) objectives;
(ii) human, financial and technical resources to meet said objectives;
and (iii) a supervising authority, taking into account applicable
international guidelines under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO
Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves. Three types of actions are
envisaged:
i)    Base-Line Studies.  Priority surveys and studies would be launched
the first project year to improve basic knowledge of the area and
its potentials, thus allowing for better control and management of
such concerns as lake hydrology, biological inventories, water
pollution, eco-tourism, and agricultural and forestry systems
(annex 3);
ii)   Protected Area Management.  First, priority investment actions
would be selected to stop further degradation of the environment
while the management plan is being prepared (annex 4). The
following areas would be considered for action: (i) the
uncontrolled clearing of the dune littoral, which constitutes a
natural impluvium; (ii) the deterioration of water quality due to
out-of-service treatment plants; (iii) the continuous expansion of
buildings on fertile soils as towns keep growing unchecked;
(iv) the loss of biodiversity, habitats, and species; (v) the



- 3 -
degradation of the landscape; and (vi) the state of abandonment of
archeological sites. Second, park infrastructures, vehicles and
equipment will be provided to support the implementation of the
Management Plan (annex 4);
iii)  Natural Resource Use Development.  Specific environmentally
supportive studies that may trigger development in a few initial
sectors would be launched, such as cork-oak, briar, wild olive
groves, and nature-based tourism. This aspect of the project is
highly supported by the local authorities, who are under constant
pressure to create more jobs and improve the living conditions of
the local population (annex 5).
B.    ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ADAPTIVE RESEARCH:  This component
would have three elements, including (annex 6):
i)    information management, using the geographical information system
(GIS) to allow for proper monitoring and optimal use of data;
ii)   establishment in the El Tarf Wilaya of an environmental impact
assessment unit to carry out environmental impact studies; and
iii)  implementation of an adaptive research program that would seek
alternatives to the farmers' agricultural problems (annex 7).
Environmental monitoring and evaluation would be given much
prominence (annex 11) and would have a particularly strong
interface wi.h the GIS subcomponent.
C.    ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION:  The objective of this component would be
to educate the local population about the environment and secure their
support fur the project. In addition to introduction of this
participative approach, environmental education and public awareness
programs would be aimed at the local authorities, senior staff and
agents of the Wilaya, teachers, and students (annex 8)- The Project
would also strongly encourage the participation of local NGOs,
associations, and volunteer groups in the above activities and programs.
D.    INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING:  Funds would be provided for
institutional strengthening of ANN, the environmental section of the El
Tarf Wilaya, and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) created in
October 1993 (annex 9). Finally, the Grant would finance the services
of a legal expert to review the present legal and regulatory framework
governing natural resources to identify areas which need to be revised
and updated and to propose reforms to strengthen the framework.
E.    CONSERVATION FUND:  The project would set aside a conservation
fund of about US$100,000 that would be awarded to NGOs, associations,
and universities (annex 10). Proposals from these groups in relation to
preservation of the environment, promotion of the park, and
communication would thus be evaluated by the National Park Steering
Committee- The proposals would be selected based on merit, and in
accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank.
9.    Project imulementation:  ANN would have overall responsibility for the
project. At the na-tional level, it would rely on an existing Interministerial
Committee for policy decisions. This should ensure a multi-sectoral approach
to environmental preservation. The Interministerial Committee, created by
Presidential decree on June 18, 1991, includes representatives from the
Ministries of the Economy, of the Interior, of Planning, of Equipment, and of
Research and Technology. The Committee has the flexibility to temporarily
include outside resource persons should the need arise. At the local level,
coordination would be ensured by the EKNP Steering Committee. It would rely
on close cooperation with the Wilaya's technical departments and would get



- 4 -
support from Technical Assistance. A speciai coordinator has been designated
in October 1993 by the Wilaya to ensure nfcessary coordination between sectors
and services. Day-to-day management would be the responsibility of a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU has been established within ANN, while
remaining separate from EKNP. Some activities would be subcontracted to
universities - e.g. Algiers, Annaba, Constantine - and to NGOs based on a
selection of their proposals. The latter would be involved in inventories,
public awareness programs, and the implementation of adaptive research.
10.    Methods would be devised to assure popular participation, including
through associations, youth and women's groups, and cooperatives. The project
would also strengthen government institutions, especially the environment
inspectorate at the Wilaya level. A Mid-Term Review would take place
18 months after project inception ane would include the Government, the Bank,
and NGOs. By then the Management Plan would have been finalized. The Bank
and GOA would agree on priority actions to be carried out under such plan.
Adoption and implementation of the Management Plan would be subject to prior
consultation with both local populations and NGOs.
11.   Prolect sustainabilitv:   The following features are built into the
project design to ensure institutional sustainability: (i) the ANN and EKNP
have be given the legal authority to embark on revenue generating activities
that would ensure 'he financing of at least part of the project's recurrent
costs. To this effect, a study will be carried out and recommendations on
different cost-recovery alternatives will be made; (ii) the local populations
and orgarnizations would be involved from the very beginning in the design and
implementation of the project management plan to ensure a sense of ownership
on their part; and (iii) appropriate personnel from ANN, EKNP, the Wilaya, and
NGOs would undergo training on a regular basis. The Government will
contribute to the financing of the project in addition to GEF financing. The
Government contribution would be in the form of salaries, taxes, and duties as
well as specific studies and interventions.  Another encouraging sign is that
the Interministerial Committee is working, making and enforcing decisions in
favor of the preservation of the environment. The Government's request that
future development projects involve routine environmental impact assessment
studies throughout the country is also highly indicative of the project's
institutional sustainability.
12.   Rationale for GUF Findinu:  Global Environment Benefit - The protection
and conservation of the El Kala wetlands complex is of high international
importance. The area is a key habitat not only for globally threatened
species, but also for migrant waterfowl which maintain vital linkages with
other parts of the Mediterranean and Africa as well as Northern Europe. This
area also features samples of intact coastal and forest habitats that are
quickly disappearing throughout the Mediterranean. These habitats are home to
a wide variety of flora and fauna and are also critical for ensuring the
maintenance of the hydrological system which currently supports over
'00,000 people. Without a strong program for effective and integrated water,
forestry, and agriculture management, entire ecosystems will be destroyed.
13. As current Government funding is insufficient for the operation and
maintenance of the ERNP, it is highly unlikely that sufficient funds would be
available from non-concessional funding to implement the management plan's
recommendations. The project has been discussed with the Government, leaving
no doubt that the availability of grant funds represents a major incentive to
the authorities to implement protection and conservation programs. The
project would also help in times when difficult choices have to be made
between promoting development and preserving the environment.  The Government
would most certainly want to continue to finance the main operations,
especially those related to environment assessment studies, once the project
is complete. Higher fees for park entrance and contributions from NGOs would
also be a source of funds. Finally, the project should be able to generate



additional revenues from tourism, environmental development, and various
outdoor activities.
14.   rorm of Innovation:  In the context of Algeria, this project includes
two primary innovations: (i) interministerial coordination of a regional
management plan aimed at preserving the environment while allowing controlled
development of the natural resources, and (ii) projects being evaluated
through Environmental Impact Assessment studies prior to adoption and
implementation. Both local and international NGOs have indicated great
interest in the former aspect of the project during a meeting in Paris in June
1993 and at a Ramsar convention in Tokyo that same month. As one
international NGO put it, the El Kala National Park project is among the first
cases in which preservation and development are tackled simultaneously.
15.   Aureed Actions:   During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the
following actions:
i)    Grant Effectiveness.  Effectiveness of the grant is subject to the
Bank receiving satisfactory evidence that: (a) the special account
has been opened at the Central Bank of Algeria for ANN; and
(b) EKNP has increased its staff by 20 forest rangers;
ii)   Accounts.  The project accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank;
iii)  National Park Steerihg Committee.  GOA would invite to the
deliberations of the National Park Steering Committee at the
El Tarf Wilaya representatives from the NGOs and local
universities, in accordance with the Executive decree No. 83-458
defining the attribution and composition of the Committee;
iv)   Project Management.  The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would
be under the supervision of a Project Manager. The PIU would be
responsible for project accounts, management, and for coordinating
project operations and expenditures;
v)    Management Plan.  A Management Plan would be submitted to the Bank
for its comments and recommendations no later than June 30, 1995.
Procurement of works for upgrading EKNP's infrastructure and
consultant services for training EKNP's staff is conditioned upon
submission to the Bank of a satisfactory management plan;
vil   Environmental Impact Assessment Unit.  The parties reached an
understanding that three (3) persons would be recruited or
redeployed from other government agencies to strengthen the
Environmental 'Inspectorate" of the El Tart Wilaya;
vii)  Mid-tenm Review.  A mid-term review would take place 18 months
after project inception;
viii) Forestry Guides.  Fifteen (15) forest guides would be recruited no
later than June 30, 1994;
ix)   Cost-Recovery Study. A study would be carried out and
recommendations of different cost-recovery alternatives would be
submitted no later than October 31, 1995;
x)    Progress Reports.  Such reports would be furnished to the Bank no
later than January 31 and July 31 of each fiscal year until
completion of the project.
16.   Environmental Asnect8s: The project has been reviewed by the Regional
Environment Division. Social issues that may be of importance revolve around



community participation in the development of the National Park and Wetlands
Complex Management Plan and actual commitment of the community which the plan
will affect. The participatory approach is important in drawing up the
management plan and for adaptive research. Two social scientists (one
Algerian, one foreign) have been contracted to address such issues as people's
participation, environmental education through the ground-up approach, and
consideration of the farming and hunting population. The social scientists'
work would mainly consist of initiating a process of consuiltation and
participation which would feed into the Management Plan. They would establish
the baseline situation and advise on how to integrate the local culture into
the project.
17.     With regard to environmental aspects, an Environmental Impact
Assessment Unit has been established in Algeria under the Mediterranean
Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP). The EIA activities within
the project will be carried out in consultation with the national EIA unit.
It should be noted that, as a sign of its commitment, the Government has
requested that any future development projects in the EKNP and the wetlands
complex undergo an environmental screening process and an EIA as necessary.
The Interministerial Committee will oversee the development of the management
plan for the EKNP and implementation of the proposals.
18. Project onenfits: The Project would generate a series of
multidisciplinary interventions that would ensure that the globally
significant and unique wetlands complex of the El Kala region is not destroyed
through unsustainable development. Additional benefits from the project would
include: (i) institutional building of ANN, EKNP, and the Wilaya's
environmental "inspectorate"; (ii) increased effectiveness of the ANN and EKNP
and of the environmental assessment capability of the Wilaya, ensuring better
resource use planning and implementation in both the short and the long terms;
(iii) better coordination of multisectoral departments in environmental
conservation and development; (iv) the participation of affected populations
and NGOs at an early stage of project conception and design; and (v) testing
of a model for achieving habitat and species protection through sustainable
development and nature conservation that would be of value to the
Mediterranean region and to the world. The Government is indeed setting high
expectations for its future ability to better evaluate projects through
systematic testing lising Environmental Impact Assessment studies.
19.   Risks:  The primary risk to timely project implementation resides in
the delays that could occur caused by difficulties in the recruiting of
technical assistance for defining the management plan. Other risks could
result from: (i) a possible lack of cooperation between the various entities
involved including various ministries and departments, and/or lack of support
from the local populations; (ii) delays in the transfer of the necessary
personnel to the project; and (iii) the present ANN team, which includes
mostly young cadres with little practical experience. To minimize the risks
the following steps have been taken. Proper coordination will be ensured at
the national level by the Interministerial Committee (IC) established for that
purpose, and by the operations committee at the local level. The IC has
already made some hard decisions which have resulted, for instance, in the
Ministry of Equipment reversing its decision to build a dike through Lake
Tonga (a Ramsar site). The project would pay particular attention to
involving local populations and NGOs at the very beginning of project
implementation. Technical assistance and regular training should markably
improve project personnel's competence. It is also felt that the ANN's
present weakness would be easily offset by the Wilaya's experienced high-level
staff. Finally, sufficient supervision time has been set aside for Bank
missions (Annex 13).

'A   International Competitive Bidding.
\i    Local Competitive Bidding for civi'l works for housing, culvert.
and spring protection.
\c    Contracts for goods and equipment with a value of above USS200,000
would be procured through International Competitive Biddina (ICE).
Qualifying domestic manufacturers would be granted a margin of
preference equal to 15% of CIF bid price of the imported good. or
the actual custom duties and import taxes, whichever 2s lower.

machinery, vehicles, office technology, audio-visual, printing and
demonstration equipment, with an estimated total value of
US$1.55 millLon. To the extent practical, equipment contracts



Annex 1
Page 3
would be grouped in bid packages each to cost the equivalent of
US$300,000 or more.
About five contracts for the construction and renovation of
offices, information centers, ecomuseums and housing would be awarded on
the basis of Local ComPetitive Bidding (LCB), with a total value of about
US$3.1 million, as the small size and scattered nature of these works
would not attract foreign contractors.
Scientific and office technology available from a limited number of
suppliers and estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$100,000
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$200,000, would
be procured through international shnpping from a list of at leant three
suppliers from at least two different -ountries. Although Algerian ICB
and LCB procedure. are generally acceptable to the Bank, some aspects
which were inconsistent with Bank policy have been improved to ensure
better competition.
Consultants. Consultants' services totalling about US$2.35 million
would be based on qualifications, terms, and conditions of employment
satisfactory to the Bank in line with the Bank's Guidelines for Use of
Consultant.
Contract Review. All bidding documents and awards of contracts for
vehicles and equipment estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or more,
representing about 70% of the total value of the contracts, would require
the Bank's prlor approval. Contracts not covered by prior review
procedureB would be subject to random post review by the Bank after
contract award.

PROJET DE GESTION DU PARC NATIONAL D'EL KALA ET DU COMPLEZE DE ZONES HUMIDES
PREPARATION ET MXSE EN PLACE D'UN PLAN DE GESTION
Le Parc cational d'El Kala.
1.   La preparation puis la mise en place d'un plan de gestion du parc
national d'El Kala et du complexe de zones humides constituent l'action
primordiale du projet. Sans plan de gestion les sites uniques de la region
risquent de disparaitre a tout jamais. La densite de population au sein du
Parc (environ 1 habitant/ha) lui confere un caractere exceptionnel. Il en
rdsulte que les responsables de la Wilaya sont confrontds A. un dilemme : (a)
prdserver le parc et en interdire l'utilisation des ressources par les
populations; ou (b) permettre tun certain d6veloppement qui soit A la fois
durable et qui permette de maintenir les populations en place, d'amdliorer
leurs revenus et d'eviter une destruction irrdversible des ressources
naturelles.
2.    Le Parc National d'El Kala, cr66 en 1983, couvre 80.000 ha. Encore
relativement peu marqut par l'impact des activitds humaines, le Parc est
compose d'une mosaique d'ecosystemes s'Atageant de la mer jusqu'au massif
montagneux de la Medjerda, et d'un complexe exceptionnel de zones humides. Sa
diversit6 ecologique autant que biologique lui confere une grande importance
dans 1'ensemble m6diterran6en.  L'un des traits majeurs du Parc est de
contenir d'importantes ressources en eau (parmi les plus importantes
d'Alg6rie), en particulier un syst&me aquifere dunaire et plusieurs lacs aux
caractdristiques varides. Le Parc est egalement couvert par l'un des plus
importants massif boise d'Algdrie, repr6sentant une richesse economique de
premier plan dans un contexte de deficit en bois, ainsi qu'une protection
efficace contre l'6rosion des sols.
Des ressources menacdes.
3.    Les abondantes richesses naturelles de la Wilaya d'El Tarf sont de plus
en plus convoit6es a l'dchelon national par suite de penuries d'eau, de bois
et de terres cultivables. C'est ainsi qu'une s6rie de facteurs et de
contraintes internes et externes A la Wilaya entralne une ddgradation
accel6r6e du milieu. Environ 87.000 habitants vivent dans le Pare tandis que
l'accroissement de la population connait une progression extr&mement rapide
(environ 4.4% par an entre 1977 et 1987). Par contre la sous-valorisation
4conomique de la montagne et l'insuffisance des services entrainent des
migrations humaines vers les plaines et les villes.  I1 en resulto une
expansion des constructions souvent au d6triment des terres cultivables.
4.    Les d6frichements sur dunes, classees foret domaniale, sont doublement
dommageables A la fois pour la couverture v4g4tale et sa faune, et pour les
aquifbres dunaires qui risquent d'etre pollues par des intrusions d'eau de

mer. La culture arachidihre sp6culative, principale responsable, trouve ses
causes dans le ch6mage, la libdralisation de l'acces au foncier, les revenus
dlevSs obtenus en peu de temps et le laxisme de l'administration foresti6re.
Le d6veloppement de l'agglomdration toute proche d'Annaba (500.000 hab.,
complexe industrial, p6rimttre irrigues) constitue une menace serieuse
susceptible de compromettre tout effort de gestion rationnelle des ressources
en eau de la Wilaya d'El Tarf.
5.    Les ravages caue6s A  la fornt par los incendies sont la cons6quence
d'une gestion insuffisante et inadaptee, sans recherche de* consensus entre les
principaux acteurs tals que les administrations, les eleveurs et les bergers.
Ces incendies entrainent une rapide transformation de la suberaic en maquis
improductif. En outre, si les ressources marines demeurent parmi les mieux
pr6serv6es, cela est dii principalement aux difficult6s du secteur de la peche
et au manque d'infrastructure portuaire A El Kala. Enfin, il y a lieu de
signaler que 1'exploitation du corail rouge s'intensifie alors que L'dtat
actuel et le potentiel des gisdments sont quasi inconnus des autorit6s.
La mdthodolofie.
6.    Le plan de gestion doit reposer sur une bonne connaissance du milieu de
mannire A pouvoir mieux le contrdler et partant mieux le gdrer. Le projet
pr6voit en consdquence de lancer certaines dtudes jugees prioritaires tandis
que des enqu6tes et dtudes compldmentaires seront d6finies en cours de projet
(annexe 3). Entre-temps, des actions immddiates sont envisagdes pour arrAter
les destructions, mettre en place des essais en vraie grandeur (annexe 4) et
graduellement gagner la confiance des populations concern4es.  Le projet
prAvoit par ailleurs la participation de ces memes populations dans
l'dlaboration du plan de gestion puis dans le suivi et l'evaluation des
diverses composantes (annexes 11 et 12).
7.    De ce qui precede et en rdsumn, le plan de gestion comprendra les
principales composantes ci-aprAs :
(a)  Des etudes Drioritaires pour une meilleure connaissance du milieu
et de ses votentialit6s. Ces etudes et enquetes sont detaillees en annexe 3,
et presentees de maniere synthdtique au tableau 3.1.
(b) Des actions urgentes destinies a arreter les dgra-.-tions en cours.
Ces actions, r6sumdes dans le tableau 4.1 de L'annexe 4, et dont la prioritd
sera determinee par la direction du projet et aprbs consultatior avec les
populations, ONGs et associations concern6es, comprendront :
- l'amdlioration de la gestion hydraulioue et ecologique du lac Tonga;
- la protection du site du lac des Oiseaux;
- la protection du lac Mellah;
- la protection des forets humides et ripisylves;
- le rdtablissement des passages d'eau et des echanges hydrologiques;
-  la protection des sources;
- la protection de la zone dunaire de Berihane;



Anaace 2

- l bornage des massifs forestiers;
- la d6limitation des r6serves de protection int6grale;
- la mise en place de parcelles biologiques en vue du
suivi/conservation de formations vegetales sensibles d'int4ret
biologique;
- la mise en d6fens provisoire et la valorisation des sites
culturels; et
- la protection du Cerf de Barbarie.
lc)  Des actiors a r6aliser en application du plan de gestion.
I1 s'agit d'actions de gestion et de valorisation des ressources
naturelles A realiser dds l'approbation du plan de gestion du Parc, et en
application de celui-ci. Les differents programmes gui devraient normalement
debute- au cours de la deuxiime annee du Projet sont present6s dans l'annexe 4
et synth4tis4s au tableau 4.1. Ces programmes comprennent les actions de
conservations suivantes :
- l'am6nagement des plages touristiques;
-  la rev6g6talisation des zones d6nud6es su-r massif dunaire; et
- la restauration paysagare de carrieres sous forme de trois operations
pilotes;
- la mise en defens du reboisement de protection de la dune de Melloul;
- la rehabilitation et le suivi des arboreta;
-  la regeneration de la suberaie de Gourrah; et
- la renovation des peuplements degrad6s et la mise en d6fens des
suberaies incendi4es.
8.    Non moins importante est la participation prevue avec les milieux
scientifigues et universitaires. Un fonds special, appele fonds de
conservation, sera institue pour financer des actions particulieres qui
pourraient Atre presentees par des ONGs, associations, universitaires dans le
cadre de la protection de I'environnement. Les propositions seront dtment
*electionn4es par le Conseil d'orientation du Parc et feront l'objet de
cahiers des charges. Ces actions seront particuliarement suivies par la
cellule suivi et 4valuation (S&E) du projet.
Le zonace du Parc
9.    L'element central de la preparation du plan de gestion est la
r4alisation d'un nouveau zonage.  En effet, il est important de rfactualiser
les vocations des differentes zones lesquelles vocations permettront la
d6termination de mnthodes de gestion specifiques, les moyens particuliers
requis et 1'attribution de responsabilites bien claires. Les zones devront
correspondre aux categories et objectifs internationaux de gestion des aires
protegees.  Ce gui pour le parc d'El Kala devrait aboutir aux cinq categories
ci-apr4s
- RAserve naturelle integrale;



Annexe a
Page 4
- Rdserve naturelle gdrde/Sanctuaire faune/Sanctuaire marin;
- Reserve de ressources naturelles/Reserve de peche;
- Aire gdree a usages multiples; et
- Monuments culturels.
10.   Le statut des parcs nationaux algdriens ddfinit cinq types de zones.
Les definitions Idgales sont toutefois vagues et difficiles A mettre en
oeuvre. Dans la pratique, il a ete constate ce qui suit :
- les zones ne sont pas materialisees'sur le terrain;
- les zones 1 constitudes en g4n4ral par les lacs et leurs limites, no
prennent en compte ni les fluctuations des niveaux d'eau, ni Les
liens fonctionnels existant entre les facies lacustres et les
activitds rurales traditionnelles riveraines;
- l'assiette des zones correspond mal & leurs vocations respectives;
- l'integritd des zones 1 nWest pas respectde;
- plusieurs decosystemes exceptionnels sur les plans biologique et
dcologique ne sont pas classds en zone 1; et .
- le zonage ne concerne pas le milieu marin.
11.   Un nouveau zonage devrait en principe permettre
- une gestion rationnelle des zones bumides;
- un ddveloppement des systemes de production en relation avec
l'accroissement ddmographique et ce, A partir des ressources
naturelles afin d'dviter l'accroissement de l'agriculture et de
l'dlevage au ddtriment des espaces forestiers et des zones humides;
-  une meilleure protection de la couverture vdgetale et le maintien
des formations forestieres;
- le developpement du tourisme et l'amorce d'un redeploiement de
l'industrie et de l'artisanat si possible vers l'intdrieur; et
-  une exploitation plrs scientifique du corail rouge et des autres
richesses de la mer.
Les_Unites de gestion.
12.   La definition puis la mise en place d'un-nouveau zonage du PNEK recevra
la plus grande priorite au cours de la premibre annee du Projet. Ce sera l'un
des rdsultats majeurs du plan de gestion. Le zonage sera base sur les
rdalitds deologiques et socio-dconomiques de la Wilaya d'El Tarf. Les zones
seront en particulier definies puis ddlimitdes en tenant compte d'unit6s da
gestion dans lesquelles il existe des liens fonctionnels dcologiques et/ou
socio-Iconomiques tels que par exemple les bassin-versants de chaque lac. Les
programmes d'action prevus dans le plain de gestion coXncideront gdn6ralemeut
avec ces unitds de gestion. Enfin, les zones devront correspondre aux
catdgories et objectifs internationaux de gestion des aires prot6gdes avec par
exemple I'introduction d'aires terrestres et marines.

Conclusion.
13.   Le plan de gestion sera elabore de manidre dvolutive en se basane sur
les resultats des dtudes prioritaires et les consultations avec les usagers.

[El] CONNAISSANCE DU FONCTIONNEKENT ECOLOGIQUE DES ZONES HUMIDES,
ET&BLISSEMENT DE REGIES DE GESTION SPECIPIQUES
(LAKE ECOLOGY)
ObJectif
L'objectif principal de cette 6tude, menee par la direction du Parc, est
d'dtablir un bilan des connaissances actuelles sur le complexe des zones
humides et, des rigles de gestion pour les 6cosyst&mes principaux. Cette Etude
prioritaire est le prdalable indispensable A l'elaboration du plan de gestion
des zones humides du Parc. La documentation scientifique existante et les
compdtences locales representent des bases solides permettant d'etayer un plan
de gestion. Des dtudes compl4mentaires permettront d'affiner progressivement
la gestion du complexe zones humides.
Activit4s
Elles seront rdparties sutr 5 mois et comprendront
- le bilan des connaissances relatives A la biodiversitd des zones
humides;
- la definition des exigences biologiques et 6cologiques des
principales (ou principaux groupes) d'especes;
- la d6finition des modalites optimales de gestion et des extrAmes
tol6rables (dans la mesure du possible), pour les especes
(groupes) selectionnees. Une analyse factorielle de
correspondance devrait permettre de discriminer les esp&ces par
type d'affinitds Ecologiques (e.g., profandeur d'eau, densitd de
vEgdtation); et
- l'dtablissement des r&gles de gestion spatio-temporelles pour
chaque zone humide dut Parc (principalement les niveaux d'eau).
R4alisation - Mavens
Le Projet GEF passera des Conventions avec les organismes comp6tents et
interessds A la realisation de cette etude. L'Universite d'Annaba, dont les
chercheurs connaissent bien la region du Parc, ainsi que des chercheurs
d'autres structures disposant de nombreuses donnees devront 6tre associEs &

[E2]  INVENTAIRE BIOLOGIQUE ET ECOLOGIQUE DE LA ZONE MARINE
(MARINE INVENTORY)
Oblectif
Les rdsultats de cette etude permettront de realiser le zonage de la
partie marine du Parc sur la base des vocations de chaque zone. Les enquates
rdalisees il y a quelques anndes par le Parc national de Port-Cros, ont etd
tr&s fragmentaires et localisdes. Elles laissalent cependant entrevoir
1'existence de ressources marines littorales diversifides chez de nombreux
groupes biologiques (e.g., poissons, crustacds, algues). I1 faut donc
completer ce travail par des prospections systematiques.
Activites
Les prospections seront rdalikses en plongde (scaphandre autonome,
apn4e), et consisteront en des observations dans les etages supra et medio-
littoral, et dans la strate superieure de Ilinfra-littoral. Ces observations
seront rdalisees le long de transects perpendiculaires A la cote, depuis
celle-ci en direction du large. Les observations comprendront, entre autre,
des descriptions de stations, des releves visuels de poissons et des releves
phytosociologiques. Des prhlbvements de flare et de faune auront lieu (pour
determination). Les stations particulierement importantes par rapport A des
crit&res a determiner (e.g., diversite, frayeres, herbiers de posidonies,
esp&ces rares) feront l'objet d'enquetes plus poussees.
Un zonage de la partie marine entre l'oued Mafragh et la fronti&re sera
rEalisE sur la base de cotte etude, tenant compte egalement de l'etude sur le
corail rouge, puis sera incorpore dans le plan de gestion.
Rdalisation - Moyen
Cet inventaire se fera, de preference, en association entre un
laboratoire de biologie marine etranger (disposant du materiel de plongde) et
des specialistes algeriens-
Personnel
- 20 personnes-semaines de biologistes marins nationaux; et
- 10 personnes-semaines de biologistes marins internationaux syant

[E3] COWNAISSANCE DES GISEXENTS DE CORAIL ROUGE
(CORAL INVENTORY)
Obiectif
L'objectif de cette dtude est l'dvaluation des gisements de corail rouge
afin de preparer un plan d'exploitation.  L'exploitation rationnelle de ceux-
ci ne peut Atre entreprise qu'A partir de connaissances relativement
detaillees sur leur btendue, leur localisation, volre leur productivitd.
L'Etude proposee peut paraltre d'un coAt prohitbtif mais son enjeu est
considerable. Le corail rouge peut reprdsenter une source durable de devises
pour l'Algerie dans la mesure ouL il est bien g6rd. Une bonne gestion
implique une cartographie sous-marine qui ne peut etre obtenue qu'A l'issue
d'une campagne oceanographique tr&s technique, mettant en oeuvre une
technologie sophistiquee (exemple : echosondeur, systeme ROXANN d'acquisition
des donneas, systeme H&STERCHART de traitement des donndes, visualisation des
fonds par plongde et au moyen d'une camdra viddo tdl6commandde, support
naval), et une dquipa d'ocedanologues sp4cialisda en decosystemes profonds et
corallif&res.
Activitds
Dans une phase prdliminaire, l'dtude rdalisera sur un site restreint :
- l'dtalonnage du matdriel, de maniere A tester la validit6 de
1Vdvaluation de la ressource A partir des observations; et
- la mise au point du protocole expdrimental applicable ensuite &
plus grande echelle (plan d'Lchantillonnage).
Las opdrations se derouleront entre Cap Rosa et Cap Segleb, dans des
zones bathymdtriques comprises entre 30m et 120m. Trois niveaux
d'investigations peuvent etre proposes : le sondeur latdral, la viddo, la
plongde en scaphandre autonome au mdlange. Cette derniere technique
(indispensable pour les Avaluations ponctuelles et les prdl&vements
d'kchantillons) necessite des mesures de sdcuritd importantes, compte tenu des
profondeurs. 
Les resultats attendus sont
- la rdalisation de la cartographie des fonds et des ressources
corallif&res de la rdgion d'EI Kala;
- I'acquisition de dorndes physiques sur la croissance et les
crittres de renouvellement du corail;
- l'obtention des r&gles de gestion des gisements de corail rouge;

B.  Protection des ressources en eau
[E8] FONCTIONNEMENT RYDRAULIQUE DES LACS
(LAKE HYDROLOGY)
Oblectif
Les lacs constituent une composante essentielle du PNEK. On ne possbde
qua tr&s peu d'6ldments sur leur fonctionnement hydraulique alors quo
plusieurs projets d'utilisation de leur plan d'eau, de leur potentiel
biologique ou de la ressource qu'ils constituent sont en cours d'6tude
- piscicult.ure dans les lac Oubeira et Mellah; et
- prdl&vement d'eau dans le lac Oubeira A des fins agricoles.
Dans ce qui suit, on suppose que les projets portant sur l'endiguement
du lac Oubeira et son remplissage A partir des eaux du barrage de Mexa, ainsi
que la transformation de la partie amont du lac Tonga en'retenue sont
abandonnds.
Activit6s
L'6tude se deroulera sur 12 mois et y seront realisds
- la reconnaissance bathymetrique des trois lacs;
- le suivi hydro-climatologique
une station climatique sera installde a proximite immddiate
de l'un des lacs;
installation d'echelles limnimetriques;
* installation d'une station limnimetrique sur l'Oued El Hout
(lac Tonga);
. amenagement d'une section de -jaugeage sur 1'&missaire du lac
Oubeira.
- le suivi de la qualite physico-chimique des eaux
- realisation de campagnes de pr6l&vements en vue d'analyses
physico-chimiques et. bact6riologiques;
suivi des fluctuations de la salinit4 du lac Mellah, avec
ex4cution de campagnes mensuelles de mesures de r6sistivit4
pendant une annee et releves quotidiens de la rdsistivitd
sur quelques points de contr6les.

- la rdhabilitation du franchissement busd de la piste longeant le
systbme des vannes du lac Oubeira.
Les r6sultats escomnptes sont les suivants
- une vision claire du fonctionnement hydraulique des lacs et une
evaluation quantitative des differents flux;
- une connaissance des fluctuations de la qualite des eaux au cours
d'un cycle saisonnier; ceci concerne l'ensemble des lacs et plus
particulierement les fluctuations de la salinit4 du lac Mellah;
- la rdhabilitation des ouvrages de regulation du lac Tonga et du
lac Oubeira.
- la presentation de recommendations concernant les niveaux maximum
d'exploitation des lacs (definition de seuils minimeux)
Rdalisation - Movens
L'essentiel des ressources pour cette dtude serc alloue la premi&re
annee avec la mise en place d'une station limnimetrique et climatologique, et
le travail d'experts et de techniciens. Les releves se poursuivront les
ann4es suivantes avec une fr6quence A dtfinir.
Les vannes sont actuellemernt manoeuvrdes selon les instructions de la
DHW.  La manoeuvre de celles du lac Tonga pourrait atre confiie au Parc
National qui regulerait ainsi le niveau du lac selon ses propres consignes.
Dans tous les cas, leOa manoeuvres doivent faire l'objet d'un enregistrement
syst6matique, ce qui nWest pas le cas aujourd'hui. Dans l'hypothese oil le
Parc ne pourrait pas assurer la gestion hydraulique du Iac Tonga, un systeme
de vannes demeure risqu4, car rien ne dit que sous la pression des usagers
riverains (agriculteurs, eleveurs), on ne les manoeuvrera pas de facon abusive
(ex. pour vider le lac prematur6ment). Dans ces conditions, un seuil betonne,
cal4 sur les 4vacuateurs de crue situes le long de la digue, les "emplacerait
avantageusement (Skinner, comm. pers.).

E9]  SUIVI DES NAPPES DES ZONES DUNAIRES
(GROUND WATER MONITORING)
Obiectif
La nappe du massif dunaire de Boutelja est actuellement fortement
exploitda par des forages et captages de sources.  Les niveaux d'eau n'ont
plus dtd suivis depuis les anndes 70 et le debit des sources n'est controlA
qua de nani&re trAs irrdguliere. I1 s'agit done :
de contrbler 1'etat actuel de la ressource. et mettre A jour les
connaissances acquises anterieurement sur le bilan des flux;
d'evaluer les risques lids A la surexploitation: invasion par
l'eau d'origine marine, diminution des dmergences diffuses; et
de caractAriser la situation actuelle en terme de surexploitation
ou identifier les possibilites d'exploitatioA compl4mentaires et
leurs consAquences.
Activites
L'4tude s'appuiera sur six activitds distinctes
(a) RAhabilitation du reseau uidzomAtrioue
Los ouvrages encore disponibles pour le suivi des niveaux d'eau-sont au
nombre de 3 :
-     1 forage inexploite; et
-     2 pidzomAtres provenant du precedant reseau pidzomdtrique.
Dans le cadre d'un projet, en cours de r6alisation, portant sur
1'exdcution de 63 pi4zomitres sur le territoire alg6rien, l'ANRH prAvoit
1'exdcution de deux piizom&tres dans le massiftdunaire de Boutelja.  Ces
ouvrages seront situ6s A proximnitA du littoral pour controler l'evolution de
la salinite de la nappe. Ce rdseau qui sera constitun de 5 points de aesures
n'est pas suffisant pour permettre une reprdsentation realiste de la
distribution de la pi6zomdtrie. On prAvoit done la rdalisation de 3
pi6zomAtres complementaires. Ces piAzom&tres soront nivelds.
(b)  R4alisation de dispositifs de mesure du ddbit des sources
Cette activite sera 4tendue aux sources des autres massifs dunaires:
uassif de la Vieille Calle, massif d'El Kala, massif d'Oum Theboul. Lorsque
cela sera possible les sources seront dquipees d'un canal avec seuil en nue
d'une lecture directe. On pr4voit l'equipement de 8 sites.



Page 15
(a) §uivi du rdseau de-mesures
Les pi6zom&tres feront l'objet de mesures mensuelles, par un technicien
de l'ANRH. Les sources captees feront 1lobjet de relev6s quotidiens par lI
gardien de la station de refoulement.
Los sources non captdes mais 6quipees d'un seuil feront lobjet de
relevds mensuels A l'occasion des tourndes pizomdtriques. Les sources non
dquipees feront l'objet d'un jaugeage mensuel. Cette activit4 se ddroulera
durant les trois anndes du projet et poursuivie au-delA.
(d)  Inventaire des Duits et forages
Cette operation couvrira le massif dunaire de Boutelja ainsi quo les
plaines d'Annaba et de Boutelja, la plaine d'El Tarf et les autres massifs
dunaires. Les captages g4r4s par l'EPE ou les industriels sont d6Ja
r4pertori6s.  Le recueil de l'information porcera donc sur leur dtat et leur
production.  Un effort particulier sera portd sur les pujts et les forages
rdalisds avec ou sans autorisation par des particuliers et sur lesquels on no
dispose pas d'information. Une enquete sur le terrain aupres des utilisateurs
devra permettre d'en connaitre la position, les caracteristiques techniques,
le debit instantand, et le rythme d'exploitation.
(o) Protection des sources
Les sources constituent un moyen d'exploitation tr&s dconomique
d'utilisation de la ressource en eau souterraine. A ae titre, il serait
souhaitable de les protdger contre les pollutions permanentes ou accidentelles
lides A l'activite humaine: htbitations, bdtail, ddfricbements, miss en
culture. Dans un premier temps, et conformdment au code de l'eau, £1 s'agit
d'ttablir les p4rimbtres de protection. On procedera ensuite A la
r4habilitation de certains captages (2 sites) et & la pose de cldtures pour la
protection rapproch&e (8 sites). Cette op6ration sera accompagnee de la
construction d'abreuvoirs ndcessaires pour le bdtail.
(f) Mod6lisation de la nappe des sables du massif de Boutella
L'ANRH dispose d'un mod&le du syst&me aquif&re nappe des graviers-nappe
du massif dunaire de la plaine d'Annaba-Boutelja. Ce modAle est en cours de
transfert sous le logiciel utilisd par cette agence. Une premi&re mise A jour
de cet outil devrait avoir lieu avant la fin de 1993 dans le cadre du projet
Plan National de l'Eau exdcute sous la responsabilite du Minist&re de
1'Equipement.  Un contrdle du calage et l'intdgration des nouvelles donnmes
seront r4alisds aLu cours de la derniere annea du projet. A l'issue de cette
operation les simulations concernant Ilexploitation seront rdalisges.

[E14J RECENSEMNT ET TYPOLOGIE DU CHEPTEL
(LIVESTOCK CENSUS)
Oblectif
Une enquete legere sur la typologie et ia productivitd des troupeaux
permettra de faire des recommandations en mati&re d'tlevage a inclure dans le
plan de gestion. Cette enquete devra s'appuyer sur un recensement initial car
les donndes disponibles sont aldatoires et incomplftes.
Activitds
Du fait de la diversitd des syst&xes de production il y a lieu tout
d'abord de rdaliser un recensement du cheptel dans la rdgion du PNEK. La
mdthode d'enqu6te devra tenir compte du fait que les eleveurs de cotte zone
frontaliere sont extremement prudents et qu'il n'est pas facile de les
interroger. Une typologie des 6levages coupl6tera le recensement. II y a
environ 87.000 personnes vivant dans le parc oa 1'dlevage est une activitd
primordiale tant autour des lacs (pAturages de ddcrue) qu'en zone forestibre,
sous les chenes li&ges. On estime A 80.000 le nombre de bovins et & 80.000
dgalement le nombre de petits ruminants. Les systemes d'6levage sont varids:
'satelier d'engraissement bovin horn-sol dans la plaine de ls Mekhrada;
l'dlevage intensif laitier en stabulation avec des Holstein; l'dlevage
extensif dans les montagnes proches, sous la suberaie; et toute la gamme de
systbmes intermddiaires. Enfin, cette typologie prendra en compte les aspects
de productivitd des troupeaux ainsi que leur mode de conduite.

[E16] ELABORATION D'UNE STRATEGIE FORESrIERE
Obiecti
L'objectif de cette dtude east d'adapter la politique forestibre de la
rdgion aux principes de prtservation des formations naturelles et do la
biodiversitd, ainsi qu'au contexts socio-dconomique de la Wilaya. En d'autros
tormes, il s'agit de mieux prendre en compte l'environnement dans les choix
forestiers. En effet, la gestion et l'amenagement des formations forestihres
dolvent repondre aux diverses fonctions quo peuvent et doivent avoir
localement ces boisements (fonct'ons ecologique, productive, sociale et
touristlque).
Activit6s
Compte tenu de ce qui prdcede, il est indispensable de d4finir
prdalablement AL toute intervention sylvicole, les vocations foresti&res des
diff4rents espaces, leurs modalitds de traitement et leur avenir. Par exemple
si les reboisements d'eucalyptus (esp&ce introduite dans les ann6es 70) ont
fait l'obJet d'une r6vision d'amenagement forestier par le BNEF en 1992,
I/impact de ceux-ci en zone sensible (site d'int6r6t dcologique et biologique
des lacs) n'a pas ete Atudi4, tandis qu'on se trouve dans un parc national. De
.Ame, il n'a pas ete d4fini lors de cette dtude, le devenir A moyen et long
terme de ces reboisements, pas plus que les debouch6s potentiels alors que ce
sont des boisements de production. I1 est important d'6tudier tous les
dAbouchAs et l'utilisation en particulier pour la fourniture de bois de feu
aux populations riveraines (consommation lie au chauffage et surtout A la
cuisson de la galette dans les fours traditionnels) et la fabrication de
piquats de cl6ture, ce qui permettrait de reduire en partie les ddfrichements
et coupes sauvages.
Les r4sultats attendus sont
une definition des vocations foresteires A moyen et long termes
sp6cifiques aux differents peuplements existants sur la r6gion, en
fonction des potentialiths et contraintes locales (economiques,
4col:giques, foncieres et sociales). En particulier, le devenir
et l'affectation (vocation) des espaces occupes par les
reboisements A i'int6rieur du Parc (objectifs, utilisation,
d6bouchds);
la r4alisation d'une carte de vocation des diffdrents espaces
forestiers (espaces reboisds), en ha-rnonie avec les objectifs du
Parc (preservation des formations naturelles et de la
biodiversitd), avec indication des objectifs de production (La

(SAND USE MASTER PLAIl
Ob1ectif
Le sable est un mat6riau precieux dans le contexte de ddveloppement et
d'accroissement ddmographique de la Wilaya d'El Tarf et d'Annaba, ce qui
explique l'extension et la multiplication des sites d'extraction.  Cependant,
le milieu dunaire pr6sente une certaine fragilitd et les risques d'erosion et
de d4stabilisation apres mise A nu du sol sableux sont tres importants.
L'exploitation rationnelle et durable des gisements naturels de sable exige
une rdflexion pr4alable, ainsi que l'Llaboration d'une planification
stratdgique a moyen et long teome dans laquelle la capacitd reelle
d'extraction de sable a partir du cordon dunaire doit 6tre determinde en
fonction de critbres dcologiques, techniques et decanomiques; de nmem que les
besoins thdoriques des differents secteurs consommateurs (habitat, industrie,
travaux publics), selon une prospective dtablie.
Activit6s
Un plan de gestion des gisements naturels de sable doit done atre
4labor4.   Ce plan de gestion sera basd sur un zonage du cordon dunaire selon
des crit&res de fragilit6 et de sensibilit A l' drosion (exposition aux vents
dominants, dtat de consolidation, dynamique de la vdgdtation et occupation
huamino), d'intdr6t icologique et de notion de pr6servation des formations
v6gdta'ies supportdes, ainsi que sur des crit&res de qualitd et
d'exploirabilit6 du sable.2 La zonage ainsi dtabli permettra de ddfinir les

climatiques), respect du niveau de la nappe (suivi pidzom6trique). Enfin, les
modalit6s de restauration/r6habilitation du site aprbs exploitation devront
6tre envisag6s dans chaque cas. Ces recommandations pour la rdhabilitation de

(ElBJ PLAN DE SAUVEGARDE DU CER DE BARBARIE
(DEER CONSERVATION)
Objectif
Le cerf de Barbarie (Cervus elaphus S/espdce barbarus, BENNETT 1833),
sous-esp&ce du cerf d'Europe, est le dernier representant des cervides
africains, dont l'aire de rdpartition se limite aujourd'hui aux Monts de la
Nedjerda et de iA Kroumirie aU nord-est de l'Algdrie et nord-ouest de la
Tuniste. Aucune estimation chiffrde des populations existantes ne peut-Otre
raisonnablement avancee. Neanmoins, en 1960 la population de cerfs de
barbarie avait ete estimue A 200-300 individus dont une dizaine en Tunisie.
En 1988, deux battues-dchantillonsy permettalent d'estimer les densitd de
cerfs sur is rdserve des Beni Salah (Wilaya de Guelma) A 4 cerfs/lOO ha et
dans la foret de Oum Sekak A 1 cerfE/00 ha.
Son aire de r6partition est en constante regression; du falt de la
r6duction de son biotope (incendies, d4frichement, sdeheresse), du braconnage
et de i'expansion demographique. Les plus fortes densitts actuelles semblent
se trouver dans le massif des Beni Salah et A la fronti&re algdro-tunisienne
au niveau du parc national d'El Kala et des for&ts frontalibres d'El Tarf et
Bouhadj ar.
Los services forestiers de la Wilaya de Guelma ont tentd de remedier &
sa disparition en cl8turant, en 1972, 2.000 ha de for6ts domaniale des Beni
Salah. Cette aire cl8tur4e a pris le non de Rdserve narurelle des Beni Salah,
mais ne disposerait pas encore d'un statut de reserve. Trois gardes forestiers
r-alis&rent, entre 1986 et 1989, par observation un suivi rdgulier de la
population de cerfs de la Rdserve. Dans le baut du pare de Brabtia, quelques
200 ha ont ete cldtures en 1980, afin de crder une zone de prdservation et de
multiplication du cerf de Barbarie en vue du repeuplement de la rdgion.
Ndanmoins, par faute de moyens, ce projet n'a pas vu le jour.
Activites
La prdparation du programme de pr6servation du cerf de barbarte sera
confiee A un consultant qui sera charg6 de :
- Ddfinir l'aire d'intervention du projet. De part son dtendue et

PROJET DE GESTION DU PARC NATIOfAL D' EL KALA ET DU COMPLEXE DE ZONES HEMIDES
A. ACTIONS A NETTRE EN PLACE IMMEDIATEMENT
Tandis que le Projet elaborera le plan de gestion du parc national d'El
Iala et du complexe de zones hunides avec une mise en application progressive
a partir de la premiAre ann6e, certaines actions seront entreprises
imm6diatement. Ces actions urgentes sont destin6es a freiner la d4gradation de
l'environnement en attendant que les 6tudes et la planification n4cessaires
prennent le relais. Ces actions prioritaires, qui seront entreprises en
majorit6 la premiere ann6e, concernent :
(1)  l'am6lioration de la Qesticn hydraulioue et 6coloaicue du lac
Tonga, avec en particulier : (a) I'installation de 4 nouvelles vannes plates a
cr6maillsre; (b) le renforcement de la digue; (c) le curage du chenal de la
Xessida; et Cd) la r6alisation d'flots de nidification;
(2)  la protection du site du lac des Oiseaux, avec principalement le
reboiaement du pourtour du lac et l'am6nagement d'une digue en terre. En
outre, la Wilaya devra prendre des mesuree 6nergiques visant a suspendre
i'exploitation de la carridre et la construction de nouvelles habitations A
proximitd du lac;
(3)  la protection des for8ts humides et ripisylves. Cette action
concerne les sites de Rirhia, El-Harada, Bouredim et Oued Kebir, et consiste
surtout en des actions de d6limitation, bornage et de cl8turage partiel;
(4) le rhtablissement des vassaces dWeau et des 6chanaes hvdrolocriaues.
Les problAmes de circulation des eaux de part et d'autre des routes se posent
de nanmire exacerb6e au sein de la Hekhada et en bordure du lac Mellah et du
lac des Oiseaux. Aprds un inventaire des points de blocage, des travaux do
rihabilitation, voir la realisation, de franchissements bus6s devront Atre
rdalises;
(5) la protection des sources. Cette action, qui concerne environ huit
sites, dans la zone de Bouglgs, comprend : (a) l'6tablissement de pdrimdtres
de protection avec des clOtures; (b) la rehabilitation de deux captages; et
Cc) la construction d'abreuvoirs pour le b4tail;
(6)  la _rotection de la zone dunaire de Berihane. L'objectif d'une
telle action est la stabilisation du front agricole et d'6viter le
dhfrichement et le p&lturage du cordon dunaire. Les investissements n4cessaires
comprennent la mise en place de bornes et dB clOtures de protection- En outre,
un important travail de sensibilisation des populations riveraines sera
entrepris par des gardes a cheval qui sillonneront r6guliArement la zone;



Annexe 4
Page 2
(7)  le bonacie des massifs forestiers domaniaux et des terres
collectives. Le domaine forestier de l'Etat, appelf  improprement fonds
forestier national, comprend les terrains domaniaux dont une partie eat
born6e, et les ancienneB terreB forestieres communales et terres forestieres
sectionnales ou collectives non born6ss et g6n6ralement situees en periph6rie
des forets domaniales. Si toutes ces terres foresti4res ont le meme statut
depuis lors qu'elles sont tomb4es dans le domaine forestier national, leur
reconnaissance ne vsa pas de soi pour les populations. Le bornage du domains
forestier de l'Etat s'avere donc un prealable indispensable S la d6finition et
la mise place d'am4nagements sylvopastoraux ainsi que d'op6rations de
restauration de 1'oleiculture en piedmont, afin que les droits d'usage des
riverains puissent etre clairement identifies. L'operation de bornage devra
bien sfir s'accompagner d'une modification de la r6glementation corncernant ces
droits d'usage en domaine forestier permettant de garantir l'usufruit sur des
periodes suffisamment longues pour atre int6ressantes viaS--vie des
populations riveraines. Les activit6s li6es au bornage comprennent :(i le
rep4rage des limites; (ii) la delimitation par un expert-g6omatre national
quand necessaire; (iii) la mise en place de bornes; (iv) la redaction de
procAs-verbal de bornage; (v) la cartographie; et (vi) les plans de servitude.
(8)  la d6limitation des r6serves de crotection int6crale:  Voir
6galement 1'6tude 19 en annexe 3 relatives aux etudes biologiques et
6cologiques pour am6liorer la connaissance de l'environnement.
(9)  lamise en place de  arcelles biologicues en vue du
auiviLconservation de formations v6cr6talen sensibles d'int6r8t biologioue, qui
concerne huit sites, de la cocciferaie littorale a la zeenaie de montagne.
Cinq A huit parcelles seront mises en d6fens et cl8turees, et un systAme de
suivi biologique sera elabor6. Lea sites proposes comprendraient : la suberaie
littorale (pres du lac Mellah ou prds du Djebel Segleb), la cocciferaie &
gen6vrier de Ph6nicie, la pinade du lac Hellah, l'aulnaie de Righia ou de Bou
Redim, la suberaie d6gradee de piedmont, la suberaie de Gourrah et les
formations mixtes de chdfne liAge-ch&ne zeen et la zeenaie de Gourrah.
(10) la mise en d6fena nrovisoire et la valorisation des sites
culturels. Il y a dans le parc de nombreux sites megalithiques (Mechtet-Kardi,
Ain Kebir, Skhour....), punico-lybiques, romaine, arabo-berb&res, et Prancais
du XVI siacle (Cap Segleb, Vieille Calle,..), qui n6ceasite une 6tude
arch6ologique ainsi que des actions de protection et d'am6nagement
(panneautage, brochures,...);
(11) la protection du cerf de Barbarie. Cette activit4 se concentrera
dan  la r4serve du massif des B6ni Salah qu'il faudra finir d'am4nager.  Voir
6galement 1'6tude 18 en annexe 3 sur le plan de sauvegarde du cerf de
barbarie.

B. OPERATIONJ A RHALISER EN APPLICATION DU PLAN DE GESTION
Ces op4rations de conservation, de r6habilitation et de r6generation
seront entreprises das la deuxieme annee du projet en application des
recommandations du plan de gestion. Maim d'ores et d4jA il est possible de
citer lee principales opdrations et d'en 6valuer les coilts. Ceo actions
concernent :
(3)  Fixation et rev6p4talisation de la dune vive de Messida. Sur la
rive gauche de l'oued Messida, & lembouchure de la plage, la dune littorale
possede une crete vive qui est soumise a l'erosion des vents marins. Cette
tendance a l'6rosion est accentu6e par la fr6quentation de la plage en ete, et
risque de provoquer a terme l'ensablemez.r de la vAg4tation situ6e en arriere
de la dune ainsi que le colmatage de l'oued Messida par glissement des sables
sur la rive gauche de l'oued. Pour prAvenir ces ph6nomdnes les op6rations
suivantes seront adoptdes: (i) semis et plantation d'especes psamophiles
locales : retan, et essences arborees; (ii) mise en place de ganivelles
(clayonnage) pour la fixation mecanique; (iii) mise en defens du site (&viter
la fr6quentation et le pietinement) surveillance.
(2)  Mise en d6fens du reboisement de protection de la dune de Mllo0l.
Le reboisement de pin maritime situ6 sur le versant interieur de la dune
littorale de Melloul est un reboisement de protection contre l'4rosion. Ie
pin maritime s'est substitu4 A l'eucalyptus suite a l'echec de ce dernier.  Ce
reboisement, Ag& d'une dizaine d'ann4es, est menacO par la presence permanente
de troupeaux de bovins entre les formations de maquis littorales et lea
p&turages du lac Tonga.  Le pi6tinement dl au passage des bovins ou A leur
stationnement a l'ombre des pins provoque une destabilisation du sable dunaire
et risque a moyen terme d'induire une erosion beaucoup plus grave de
l'ensemble de la dune de Melloul. I1 y a donc lieu de mettre rapidement en
d6fens ce reboisement pour conserver sa fonction initiale de protection contre
l'erosion des sole. Cette mise en d6fens, pour etre efficace et durable, devra
s'accompagner, en plus d'actions de sensibilisation des 61e-veurs,
d'alternatives concernant lea parcours et lea Aturages. Celles-ci seront A
mettre en place a 1'chelle de l'unit6 de gestion du lac Tonga.
(3) Reveqetalisation des zones ddnudeo sour massif dunaire . II s'agit
de la rev6getalisation de la tranchee rdalis6e a l'engin sur le massif dunaire
pour la construction de la route littorale" Draouch-Hennaya, oft le decapage
de la vegetation et du sol a OtO effectu4 sur une emprise d'environ 50m x 3
km, soit 15 ha. La revOg6talisation necessitera la plantation de boutures de
retam et d'especes psamophiles, ainsi qu'une mise en d6fens provisoire.  Dazs
ce contexte, une fixation mecanique n'est pas nicesBaire. L'ensemble des
opOrations sera realisA par l'ORDF ou i'EMIFOR, sur convention pass6e avec le
PNEHC
(4)  R6habilitntion et suivi des arboreta :]1 est indispensable do
remettre & jour le fichier de suivi des arboreta avec le nom des essences
(espdce, sous-espece, variete), leur provenance, l'ann6e de plantation, le



Annexe 4
Page 4
nombre d'individus par espAce, et de r6aliser quelques meaures dendrom6triques
a rappracher avec lee conditions de stations at 1'age des individus. Lee
travaux de rehabilitation viseront & assainir lee peuplements (coupee
sanitaires, 6clairciee, d6gagement des morts bois) et a les prot6ger par une
mise en d6fens au moyen de barriere en bois ou de grillage.
(S)  Am6naaement foreE6tier:
(a) Am6naaement des iinades. Lea reboisemente resineux (pin
maritime et pin pignon) effectu6s sur le vrersant int6rieur des
dunes littorales entre El Kala et Melloul sont souvent en
matuvais 6tat sanitaire. I1 en r6eulte une densit6 trop forte,
chablis, mortalit6 sur pied, faible diamiftre, peuplement tram
branchu. Or, ces reboisements se trouvant daneB ure zone a
vocation touristique 6tablie, il est nAcessaire de lee
remettre en 6tat afin d'offrir des conditions de milieu
tavorables. Des travaux d'6claircies, coupes sanitaires, et
d4gagements seront execut6s par l'ORDF, sous le contr8le de la
CF et du PNEK.
Cb) Am6lioration des eucalvptaies : Les reboisements dl'eucalyptus
situ6s sur lea massifs littoraux et p6riph6riques des lacs
doivent faire l'objet d'op6rations d'am6lioration et de
substitution progressive, 6tant donn6 queo: leur prAsence ne
se justifie pas dans un milieu oat l'objectif est la
pr4servation de la biodiversitg et des 4cosystAmes naturols;
ces bo.'sements ont AtA incendite en 1983, et n'ont fait depuis
1'objet d'aucune intervention; leur etat sanitaire eat
pr6occupant d'of des reboisements souvent delabres, descentes
de cimes, densit4 trop forte avec chablis, bois tar6s (attaque
du Foracancha), mal conformes, mort-bois,...  La substitution
sera r4alis6e sur la base des recammandations de l'Otude de
strategie forestiere. Sans en attendre lea r4sultats, il eat
d'ores et dAjA important d'ei!fectuer leg travaux
d'assainissement sylvicoles qui s'imposent. Ceux-ci viendront
en appui au programme d'amxnagement des eucalyptaies pr6vu par
le BNEF, et seront raalis: par l'ORDF sur la bass d'un ashier
des charges 6labor6 conjointement par la CF at le PNEK.
f6) Resteuration oavsaq0re des carribres (op6ration pilote) . I1 existe
plus d'une dizaine de sites de carrigres et sablieres disperses sur le PNE3 et
.a Wilaya.  Le projet interviendra cur trois sites pilotes, et cherchera £
dEfinir lee moyens et lea mEthodes A appliquer pour la rEhabilitation de
carri&res dans la Wilaya. La rEhabilitation dee sites de carri6re fera
l'objet d'une etude-projet prealable aux travaux, etude qui sera saoumise pour
avia au PN1K. Trois etudeB diff6rentes seront menrem notanment sur : (  un
site en zone dunaire {sablidre); et (ii) deux sites en massif gr6seux
(piedmont, montagne). Les Etudes auront des fonctions de formation et de
dEmonscration sur la mEthodologif et la definition des techniques a employer.
Elles comprendront toutes un volet formation. Enfin, la r6habilitation



Annexg 4
Page 5
proprement dite de site de carribre sera realisee sur la base d'un forfait de
10 ha et lea travaux confi6s a l'ORDF et/ou A I'ENIFOR, sous contr8le du
projet et du PNEK.
(7)  R4gAn6ration dles suberaies
(a) R46an6ration de la suberaie de Gourrah. La suberaie de Gourral
repr6sente la plus vieille suberaie du PNEK et fournit un
lidge reconnu de qualit6 superieure. Cette suberaie eat
susceptible de disparition faute de r6g6n6ration si aucune
intervention n'est entreprise. En effet, si elle presente la
particularit6 d'etre exempte de sous-bois suite a une
conjonction de facteurs - altitude, hygromdtrie, qualit6 des
sols, couvert ferm§, absence d'incendie, paturage caprin et
ovin important - elle nl6chappe pas au probleme majeur des
suberaies de la r4gion, a savoir l'absence de r6g6n6ration.
Compte tenu du caractdre exceptionnel de cette suberaie, et
sans attendre les r6sultats de 1'6tude d'nam6nagement du BsEF,
il est possible de pr6voir dans le cadre de son application,
la mise en place d'une parcelle de reg6neration naturelle
et/ou assistee. D'une superficie de 4 ha, cleturae, cette
parcelle de r6ghn6ration sera trait6e comme suit:
- s§lection des semenciers;
- coupe d'ensemencement par l'ouverture du peuplement et
6claircissage du sol pour favoriser la fructification
(gland4e);
- crochetage ou grattage du sol pour favoriser la germination;
- rep6rage des jeunes semis et plantation en regarnis si
n6cessaire;
- coupe d6finitive des semenciers.
(b) R6novation des veunlements dagradhs.  La renovation des
peuplements de ch§ne lidge dEgrad6s est nfcessaire pour
- restaurer leur fonStion Economique;
- dimirnuer la sensibilitE au feu des espaces hcmog@nes et agir
sur la structure et la physionomie des peuplements;
- restaurer l'snsomble des fonctions ecologiques et
biologiques de ces espaces dEgradEs et monotones par une
protection contre l'erosion et la restauration d&une
certaine biodiversiti.



Annexe 4
Page 6
L'objectif du projet n'est pas de mener ces op6rations sur d'importantes
superficies, mais de mettre en place des zones de demonstration des
possibilites de restauration de ces formations v4gitalcaS. Cette action
dSmonstrative sera mise en place dans les unites de c  :ion confrontees a ce
problime: unit6 de Bougous, des lacs (ex: Tonga et son basoin-versant), et
zones de piedmont. La r6novation prendra deux formes:
- une action de substitution progressive et partielle du
maquis par differentes techniques a but 6cologique et
6conomique: retour a la suberaie, traitement et valorisation
des essences ligneuses locales, substitution par quelques
reboisements, etc...; et
- operation de d4maquisation/d6broussaillement de peuplement
de chine liege en vue de faciliter la r4g6n4ration et
l'exploitation des peuplements. Dans le cas od le capital
chbne-liAge sera a reconstituer, il faudra recourir A des
techniques de r6ganGration artificielle : debroussaillement
par bandes au gyrobroyeur et/ou au debroussailleur travail
du sol (au crabe foreetier et dent de chisel), semis et
regarnis puis mise en defens pendant une douzaine d'ann6ees
on pourra ici se r6f6rer au programme d'am6nagement
forestier du massif des BAni Salah: ouverture de layons en
courbe de niveau dans le maquis dense afin de faciliter
lexploitation du li2ge, la p4n4tration du betail et
l'am4lioration des parcours (paturage herbac6 sur layons)
(C) Klee en d6fens des suberaies incendiees : Les suberaies
r6cemnent incendi6es (1991-92), dans lesquelles le feu a
d6truit le maquis et le sous-bois existants, doivent faire le
plus rapidement possible, l'objet de prograwmes sp6ciaux de
protection, rec6page, assainissement et r6g6n6ration. I1 faut
profiter de l'absence de maquis pour rialiser ces travaux de
restauration/r4g6n6ration et diminuer lee coiats. Dane les
suberaieos aines le d6broussaillement repr6sente a lui seul
lee 2/3 des codts de toute op6ration de rehabilitation.
D'autre part, la repousse apres incendie attire de nombreux
troupeaux, et ces derniers empechent et compromettent I'avenir
des peuplements r6siduels. I1 est donc important pour toute
suberaie incendiie de prac6der aux actions suivantes qui
feront 1'objet d' intervention a titre d6monstratif de la part
du Projet :
- mise en defens stricte des suberaies incendi4es durant au
moins 6 ans;
- rialisation de travaux d'assainissement, rec6page des arbres
brlOls et semis (novembre-d6cembre); et



ArnneX6 4
Page 7
- mise en andains des r6manents (issus des d6gagementsj salon
les courbes   de niveau pour diminuer 1'erosion;
Les travaux de demonstration porteront sur des surfaces de 1'ordre de 2
x 50 ha environ, seront pris en charge par le Projet et seront effectuds par
l'ORDF sous convention avec le Frojet et sous contr6le de la CF;

ALGIRIE
PROJET DE GESTION DU PARC NATIONAL f'EL KALA ET DU COMPLEXE DX ZONES  MIDES
DEVELOPPEKENT POTMNTEL DECS RESSOURCES NATURELLES
D4veloncement de Filiares :
1.    La pr6servation des ressources naturelles du Parc et des zones
environnantes doit avant tout contribuer a la sauvegarde du patrimoine
national sans pour autant interdire un developpement harmonieux et durable.
La region d'El Kala recale de grandes richesses naturelles dont il s'agit de
connatLre le potentiel afin de pouvoir mieux le contr8ler et partant mieux le
gerer. Les ressources comprennent entre autres miel, li4ge, bruyare, olivier
sauvage, plantes aromatiques et m,6dicinales, bois, produits de la peche et de
la chasse- Ces ressources ont du reste, et de longue date, ete utilis6es par
les populations locales-
2.     La meilleure maniere de prot6ger la diversitA des ressources naturelles
est d'associer les populations A leur pr6servation. Pour cela, il faut
qu'elles puissent en tirer un int4ret notammnent en am4liorant leurs revenus-
Pour etre durable, l'exploitation de ressources doit etre organis4e,
planifiee, controlde, suivie et evaluee. L'exploitation ne doit etre ni
laissee au hasard, ni effrenee, elle doit, au contraire, tenir compte de
l' impact sur lenvironnement et des risques d'e6puisement irr6versibles.  Pour
nr4venir ces risques, le projet lancera l 4tude de quelques fili&res de
production, transformation, valorisation et de commercialisation de produits
naturels. I1 s'agira essentiellement de d6gager une mhthodologie devant
permettre aux autorites de deceler des possibilit4s de developpement
susceptible d'int4resser le secteur prive. Ces etudes se concentreront sur la
recherche de nouveaux marches, tant exterieurs au'intdrieurs, et sur les
proced6s de transformation.
3.-  L'objectif de la mise en place de filiAres de valorisation de produits
naturels est de developper une pluri-activit6 saisonniere et compl6mentaire
chez les populations riveraines (petits mAtiers, artisanat, et petite
industrie), de favoriser l'emploi et d'amener les b6n6ficiaires a mieux g4rer
l'espace. I1 s'agira dans certains cas d'am6liorer l'exploitation actuelle de
certaines ressources. Ainsi par exemple pour le miel, le liege, la bruy&re,
certaines plantes aromatiques et m6dicinales, une am6lioration de la qualit6
et une diversification des produits pourra etre recherch6e.  Da.n  d'autres
cas, il pourra etre envisage l'exploitation de ressources nouvelles ou
simplement red6couvertes telles l'anguille, 1'elevage d'escargots, de
grenouilies, de vers a soie, etc. I1 est bien entendu que le projet ne
considerera qu'uan nombre limit6 d'6tudes de filiares, libre au secteur priv6
de prendre le relais au stade de la commercialisation.
4.   I1 est propose dans l'inumndiat de cibler les actions sur la valorisation
d'un certain nombre de produits naturels ligneux ou non qui sont dej&



Annexe S
Page 2
exploites en partie ou sont susceptibles de presenter un int6ret A la fois
conomique, 6cologique et pour l1am4nagement de Ilespace.  L'approche par
filiare est envisag4e pour les ressources suivantes : liege, bruy&re, miel,
aioastre, plantes A huiles essentielles telles le myrte et le lentisque.
S.    Chaque 6tude-filiere comprendra :
- le diagnostic de la ressource : potentiel, qualite, productivite,
localisation, dispersion et r6g6n6ration (ressource renouvelable);
- les nossibilit6s d'exploitation : accessibilit6, potentiel r&ellement
mobilisable, modalites d'exploitation, conditions d'am6lioration,
techniques a employer et mat6riel n4cessaire;
- les formes de cestion : identification des acteurs et exploitants,
modalit6s d'organisation et de participation des populations
riveraines, d6finition d'un plan de gestion en fonction du produit
recherch6 et des conditions de rentabilit6 optimale, formes possibles
d'exploitation du foncier;
- lanalyse des aspects r6ulementaires : elle concernera les differents
niveaux de la filiare;
- la recherche de marche au niveau local, national et international
definition des formes de valorisation du produit brut, des modalit6s
de fabrication et de conditionnement, des investissements
necessaires, des filieres de commercialisation, des contraintes au
developpement de cette production et recherche d'investisseurs
potentiels; et
- la formation et recherche-d6velowxement : identification et mise en
place des formations n4cessaires au        d6veloppement de la filiere
conearn6e, et dEfinition cie programmes cle recherche-developpement
6ventuels.
6.    En fonction du 'produit" concerne; des actions en cours et des
connaissances dEjA acquises (bruy6re, liAge), 1'etude so penchera
davantage sur l'une ou l'autre des phases decrites ci-dessus.
Olive.
7.    Les vestiges du passe notamment le grand nombre de presses A huile en
pierre diss6min6es a travers les zones montagneuses de la wilaya, temoignent
de l'importance economique de la production d'huile d'olive aux temps les plus
recules.  Une rer,;namisation de la culture passe par une Evaluation du capital
olivier lequel est represente pour partie par l'olivier europeen conunement
cultive (Olea europaea) et en majorit4 par l'olivier sauvage ou olEastre (Olea
europaea ssp. sylvesrris) - Environ 362 ha ont ete identifi6s A la fois en
olivier et en ol6astre.



Annexe 5
Page 3
8.    Un plan de relance de J2olivier est prevu par la DSA, comportant un
recensement des olivettes, des exploitants, la determination d'un cahier des
charges d'exploitation, et l'attribution de parcelles dans un cadre de mine en
valeur afin de contourner le probleme fancier.
9.   L'6tude filiere olive doit permettre de mieux appr6hender les inter-
actions entre le foncier, 1'6conomique et la gestion des ressources naturelles
par
- une evaluation du capital olivier existant et de sa qualit6, des
possibilites de production et d'amelioration, de Ilanalyse des
possibilites d'extension;
- la definition des droits d' usage spAcifiques aux terrains domaniaux
supportant un potentiel olive et des modalit&s d'exploitation et
d'attribution des oliy~ettes abandonn6es;
- l'identification des themes techniques vulgarisables, le type de
formation a mettre en place, les interlocuteurs et formes
d'organisation de la filiere; et
- la determination du produit A rechercher (huilerie, olive de
consommation) et des possibilit6s de commercialisation.
10.   Lea moyens mis en oeuvre par le projet consisteront en :
- 5 personne-semaines d'un consultant international sp6cialiste en
ol6iculture pour entreprendre une etude ressource-exploitation et une
4tude de march6;
- 5 personne-semaines d'un sp6cialiste consultant national olivier
(formes de gestion, probleme foncier, programnes de formation-
vulgarisation, march6 natibnal);
- sessions de formation d'exploitants A la taille de l'olivier et au
greffage de 1'oleastre, animees par un formateur national, A raison
de 5 semaines par an; et
- petit equipement
Bruyare.
11.   L'exploitation et la transformation de la bruyere pose aujourd'hui lea
probl8mes suivants
- 40.000 ha de vegetation ont  tEt  incendi6s dann la r6gion en 1983, et
les zones touchdes ne peuvent plus etre exploit6es avant 20 A 30 ama,
le temps que la bruy&re se r4g4nAre. En effet, la bruyrre incendide
eat creuse et prend une couleur rouge&tre qui est rejet6e dams la
fabrication des pipes. Dans la r6gion d'El Kala, il ne reste plus

que quelques poches priservtes et non encore exploit6es dang les
zones de Bougous, Bouhadjar, Brabtia, Layoune et Oum Th6boul. Au
rythme actuel, l'dpuisement des sites sera atteint d'ici 10 a 15 eans
Le probldme de la r6g6n4ration de la bruyare reste entier;
- 1 extraction de la bruyare se pratique au printemps et & 1lautomne A
la pioche-hache par groupes de 5 A 6 personnes; c'est un travail
penible qui n'int6resse pas lee jeunes;
- 1' exploitation laisse de nombreux dechets sur place, non r6cup6rEs
par le service forestier et qui augmentent les risques d'incendies en
6t6; et
- les produits exportes sont en majorit6 des produits semi-finis sous
forme d'6bauchons a faible valeur ajout6e; comme pour le liege, il
exists tres peu d'investissements pour l'exploitation de la bruy&re.
12.  L'etude filiare bruyAre comportera :
- une cartographie des stations A Erica arbores, bruy&re arboresrcente
utilis4e pour sa racine contrairement A d'autres bruiyAres existantes
mais non utilisables comme Erica scoparla; et
- une analyse de terrain et une cartographie des peuplements de bruyire
pour d6terminer la ressource utilisable.
13.  L'tniversit4 d'Annaba pourrait proceder A
- une 6tude des techniques et conditions de r6g6inration des  schampps
da bruy&re, sachant que lea terrains a bruyere sont tris accident&s
et impropre aux travaux m4caniques, mais aussi des modalites
pratiques d'exploitation, avec int6gration des populations
riveraines;
- une 4tude sur Ilutilisation et la valorisation du tronc et des
parties aeriennes de la brny6re apr8s exploitation; et
- une 4tude de march6 sur la valorisation de produits finis A base de
bruyere - petits objets, jeux d'Schecs, boutons, cendriers, pokvmaanx
de changement de viteese et placage de tableaux de bard de voitures
de luxe   Une partie de cette 4tude derra aborder la valorisation de
la partie ahrienne de la bruyare.
14.  Lea mayens ieiB en oeuvre par le projet comprendront
- 5 personne-semaines d'un consultant international pour entreprendre
1' tude ressource-exploitation * etude de march6;
- 4 personne-semaines d'un consultant national (formes da gestion,
programmes de formation, recherche d'investisseurs);

- Formation sur le terrain avec 3 semaines par an de formateurs;
- 6galement, pour m6moire, un 6tudiant de l'Universit6 d'Annaba pendant
6 mois (6tude 6cologique)
Li4ge.
15.   Les etudes r6alis6es dans le cadre du projet d'amenagement du massif den
BE6ni Salah ont montre que la Efiliare li&ge alg6rienne ne pourra se d6velopper
qu'k deux conditions :
- la r6alisation d'un important programme d'am4nagement de la suberaie
qui devrait permettre de mobiliser davantage de liege et de rattraper
le retard accuuul6 en travaux d'entretien et d'amelioration en
faisant payer le lidge aux entreprises utilisatrices; et
- l'augmentation de la productivit4 des unit6s de transformation du
liege pour leur permettre de payer le li&ge & sa juste valeur.
16.  En outre, pour que le liege des suberaies puisse etre mieux valorise, il
eat indispensable que lunite de trituration d'Oued-El-Aneb poursuive son
activite car les autres unit&s de transformation de 1ENL sont trop loin pour
envisager d'y transporter le li&ge de trituration. Le fonctionnement de
l'unit4 d'Oued-El-Aneb est donc essentiel a la bonne exploitation des massifs
de chine-liage de la rAgion d'Annaba et en particulier de la wilaya d'El Tarf.
Cependant, vu la v6tust6 des equipements et l'insuffisance chronique de
matieres premieres l'unit6 d'Oued-El-Aneb n'a fonctionn6 qu'& 55% de sa
capacit6 en 1989, sait seulement 300D tonnes. I1 serait souhaitable de mener
une 6tude sur la rentabilite d'une unit6 de remplacement, moderne et de nine
capacit& soit 7.000 tonnes/an sur 4 postes.
17.  L'6tude de la filiare liege devra se focaliser sur les points suivants
- contraintes d'exploitation et, investissements forestiers n4cessaires
pour une augmentation de la production de liege qui puisse soutenir
l'activit6 de l'usine ENL d'Oued-El-Aneb. Cette etude devra prendre
en compte les resultats de 16tude d'am6nagement des suberaies
actuellement en cours de realisation par le SHEF et s'attacher a la
partie amont de la filiere;
- principes d'am6nagement et travaux forestiers visant a restaurer la
suberaie de la wilaya, et augmenter la proportion de liege de
reproduction (bouchonnable et granule) par rapport au liege male de
ranassage pour agglom6r6s noirs : structuration des massifs,
ouverture de pistes, de layons d'exploitation, planification des
diffErents types d'interventions sylvicoles (e.g. coupes, rec4page,
d4broussaillement et rdgin6ration);
- modalit6s d' exploitation arec int6gration des populations riveraines.
La main d'oeuvre locale n'6tant pan toujours qualifi6e, est



Annexe-S
Page 6
n6cessaire de revoir la forme et l'organisation des travaux
forestiers; et
- facteurs economique et technologique sur la valorisation des residus
d'exploitation et de transformation, 1'organisation de la production
et l'utilisation artisanale de la matiere premi&re. I1 est a noter
que le liege peut &tre transforme en de nombreux articles & haute
valeur ajout6e.
18.  Les moyens mis en oEuvre par le projet concerneront
- 5 personne-semaines d'un consultant international (6tude forme
d'utilisation du liege et de tous les residus de li4ge);
- 4 personne-semaines d'un consultant national : am6nagement et
modalit6s d'exploitation qui travaillera de concert avec 1'ENL,
l'ORDF, la CF, et la BNEF
des sessions de formation douvriers-leveurs de liAge entre juin et
aoilt de chaque annee, avec 5 semaines par an de formateur national.
Plantes A huiles essentielles. medicinales et cosmetioues.
19.  Myrte. Son bois lourd, dur, homog&ne, gris rouge&tre peut &tre utilise
pour la fabrication de menus objets, tandis que l'6corce et les feuilles sout
utilis4es pour le tannage.  Les baies sont stomachiques, stimnlantes et
astringentes et donnent une liqueur appr4ci6e. Elles sont aussi utilis6es en
parfumerie- Le myrte tient une grande place dans la mythologie grecque.  I1
contient en abondance une huile essentielle, et est utilise coume 6pice, Minsi
qu'A des fins medicinales (traitement des affections des voies respiratoires).
20. Pistachier lentisoue. Le lentisque est aussi appel4 narbre A masticw
car il fournit le "mastic de Chios" tir4 de sa resine et qui se mfiche au Moyen
Orient. La r6sine r4colt4e du tronc s'utilise aussi en parfumerie, pour des
pansements, dans lee colles spdcialises, la pr4paration de vernis, et enfin de
chewing gum dans 1rest du bassin mdditerraneen. Le bois ros6, susceptible
d'un beau poli, s'utilise en menuiserie. Clest aussi un combustible
remarquable.  Enfin, lea fruits fournissent une huile pour l'6clairage qui est
egalement appr6ci6e pour ses propri6tts astringentes.
21.  T.' fit-ide ftilifre po-uir lea plantes A huiles essentiellea e-ra r-al iseta
selon le canevas d6crit ci-dessus. Trois points sont importants :
- 1'6valuation du potentiel de ressource r6ellement mobilisable Bur lea
plans 6cologique, 6conomique, technique, et social. Une analyse de
terrain et une cartographie des peuplements a lentisque et myrte,
avec des coefficients d'abondance-dominance seront n6cessaires pour
avoir une id4e aussi exacte que possible de la ressource utilisable;



Annexe 5
Page 7
- la possibilit6 de crder une actiAit6 secondaire voire principale pour
de petits exploitants qui soit rentable et bien organisee; et
- lea techniques d'exploitation durable de ces ressources ligneuses.
22.   Les moyens mis en oeuvre par le projet comprendront:
- a personne-semaines de consultant international sp&6ialis4 en Atude
ressource - exploitation et 6tude de marche;
- a personne-semaines de consultant national sp6cialis6 en formes de
gestion, programmes de formation, investissements et equipements
- Des sessions de formation sur le terrain, A raison de 5 semaines de
foruateurs la premiere annie, puis de 3 semaines pour les deux
derniares ann6es du projet.
23.   Hormis la coop6rative qui ne possede que 400 ruches, la majorit6 des
ruches sont tenues par de petits exploitants et procedent davantage de
l'artisanat que de l16levage. L'apiculture a jusque la 6t6 n6glig6e par les
services techniques de la Wilaya, ce qui explique en partie son &tat
traditionnel. Le frein au d6veloppement de cette apiculture tient aux
difficult6s suivantes :
- absence de maitrise de techniques de reproduction, de conduite et
d'alimentation; et
importants d6g&ts occasionn6s par la Vaorase et la Loque, probl&me de
traiteament et de disponibilite de produits.
24.   L'6tude de la filiere miel doit permettre :
- de recenser les apiculteurs - ce travail pourra etre realise par les
D6JEgu6s agricoles communaux - et le nombre de ruches;
- d'analyser de mani&re plus approfondie le potentiel mellifeAre dans la
rEgion en se basant sur des critares ecologiques dont la v4g4tation
mellifare, la pr6sence de points deau, de facteurs d4favorables.
Une cartographie de la capacit6 des parcours mellifares sera
egalement redigee;
- d'identifier les specificites mellifAres locales permettant d'obtenir
des produits diff4rents susceptibles de prix plus r6imun6rateurs (e.g.
miel d'acacia, d'eucalyptus, de maquis, de suberaie et des lacs);
- d' tudier les conditions de regroupement des apicilteurs pour une
amelioration de la vulgarisation des thames techniques et de la
commercialisation; et



Annexe 5
Page 8
- d'6tudier la qualite des miels produits ainsi que les possibilitds
d'am6lioration de cette qualit6 afin de trouver de nouveaux
d6bouch4s.
25.   Les moyens mis en oeuvre par le projet comprendront
- 3 personne-semaines d'un consultant international (6tude ressource-
qualit6 i etude de march6);
- 4 persorme-semaines d'un consultant national (fonmes d' exploitation
et de gestion des parcours melliferes, programmes de formation, -)
- des sessions de formations sur le terrr.&a des agriculteurs, A raison
de 3 puis 2 semaines de formateur par an.
- enf in du petit equipement apicole (cf Coopdrative), des
rdfractomftres et du materiel pour analyses laboratoires
Autres filiares
26.   Bois.  L'objectif est de proceder A une utilisation rationnelle des
reboisements d'eucalyptus et pins pour la fourniture de bois de feu et la
fabrication de piquets de clature. Pour cela il y aura lieu de recourir A
diverses actions dont :
- etude des modalites d'affectation de partie de reboisements riverains
des agglom6rations rurales pour la satisfaction en bois de feu et
piquets, en vue de limiter les coupes et d4frichement sauvages (cf
etude strat6gie forestiere); et
- gtude des possibilit6s d'utilisation conmerciale des eucalyptus et
des pins (pharmacie, pate & papier, bois d'oeuvre, trituration et
r4sines):
- d6finition des conditions d'exploitation par et/ou pour lea
populations d'espaces a vocation "bois de villagen, et mise en place
des modalit6s concretes de gestion de ceux-ci.
27.   On6ration filigre chasse.  II s'agit en un premier temps de proc6der &
une 6valuation du potentiel cyn4g6tique. Cette 6valuation doit viser & donner
une base scientifique a un d6veloppement des activit6s cyn6g6tiques a
1'int6rieur des zones du Parc o1- la chasse sportive - susceptible de gEn6rer
des recettes - etre envisag6e. Les principaux animaux-gibiers sont le
sanglier lequel occasionne de s6rieux dAgfits aux cultures, le li&vre, la
perdrix gambra, les grives, les cailles et la b6casse. La seule zone humide
our laquelle la chasse est envisageable (sous r4serve d'un zonage prEalable et
du respect de la r6glementation) est le marais de la Mekhada. Ce dexnier
subit d6j& une pression non n6gl'sreable des chasseurs. Une l6galisation et la
rationalisation de cette activit& seraient utile A la protection du site. Uhn
inventaire eatinatif de la faune cyn6g6tique et une difinition approximative



Annexe 5
Page 9
des zones de chasse seront les principaux thAmes de cette etude filiere.
L'inventaire preliminaire sera different du suivi des populations d' animaux-
gibiers lequel sera realisA annuellement sur les territoires chasses.
28.   Tourisme cvnEceticue.  Cette etude eat differente de celle mentionnEe
plus haut car visant une autre clientele (tours-operateurs). Le tourisme
cyneg6tique est avant tout hivernal et est pourvoyeur de devises.
29.   Pour ces trois etudes, aucun mayen n'a ete spEcifiquement alloue, mais
uine certaine mobilite des ressources de cette composante devrait permettre de
realiser certaines de ces etudes si elles sont jugees prioritaires.
L'Ecotourisme
30.   Developoement de I'ecotourisme.  Le PNEK presente des particularites
qu'il convient de valoriser. Lea paysages, la faune, la flore et les
richesses culturelles qu'il recele sont exceptionnels en region
mEditerranEenne. Le Parc fait l'objet d'un tourisme national estival
exclusivement baln4aire.  Les touristes rEsident A El Rala (dont la population
double l'OtE) et sur les plages accessibles (camping a Messida, Vieille Calle,
Cap Rosa, ...).  On estime A 30.000 la population touristique estivale.
Cependant, le tourisme national ignore lensemble des richesses naturelles et
culturelles du PNEK. Seul le parc zoologique de Brabtia, proche des plages,
est visite.
31.   Le tourisme international est inexistant tandis que le Parc presente un
grand potentiel. Du reste, les revenus touristiques que tire la Tunisie toute
proche sont indicatifs des potentialit6s de la rEgion.  Le PNEK est facilement
accessible d'Europe, soit A partir d'Annaba (60 km), soit de Tabarka (30 km),
toutes deux disposant d'aEroports internationaux.  Le developpement d'un
tourisme international de qualite est susceptible de rapporter des devises et
de creer des effets induits compatibles avec la protection des sites et les
comportements socio-culturels.  Le tourisme de nature ou ecotourisme est sann
aucun doute le type de tourisme a prEconiser dans le Parc. Force est
cependant de constater que si les potentialites touristiques sont nombreuses,
lea contraintee et blocages le sont 6galement notamment au niveau des
formalitEs6, l'absence d'infrastructures d'accueils, les coupures d'eau pour nie
citer que cea aspects.
32.  I1 eat propose deux types d'interventions   (  agir au niveau des
visiteurs nationaux afin de les inciter A dEcouvrir lea richesses non
balneaires du Parc durant leur sEjour estival, et (ii) realiser une etude de
marchE du potentiel de 1'Ecotouriame avec pour principal objectif le
developpement du tourisme hivernal et de demi-saison. Par la suite, au vu des
resultats de l'etude et en application du Plan de Gestion, il uera rEalisE un
programme de dEveloppement de 1'Ecotourisme et des activit.s connexes telles
que amEnagements, identification de partenaires privEs, formations, artisanat.
et crEation d'un label qualitE.

33.   Etude du march6 de l'6cotourisme.  Dans une premiere  tape, il s'agira
d'identifier la gamme des "produits touristiques" pouvant 8tre proposes tels
que lacs, birdwatching hivernal, marches en foret, brame du cerf, littoral,
ddcouverte sous-marine, promenades en bateau, tours 6questres, sites
archdologiques et historiques - y compris les sites de proximiite - Hippone,
cath6drale de Saint-Augustin, Seraidi. I1 sera ensuite prochd4 a une
6valuation du marche en Europe dont le volume, le type de clientAle, les
produits recherches, les cofts, la logistique n6cessaire.
34.   Dans une deuxieme 6tape, la compatibilite entre le march6 et les
produits propos4s sera examin6e et les contraintes au developpement de
1'6cotourisme seront identifi6es.  Enfin, des solutions seront proposees.
L'analyse du marche necessitera la r4alisation d'un certain nombre d'enqu8tes
aupres d'agences de voyages et organisations en tourisme de nature dans lea
principaux pays europeena pourvoyeurs de touristes.
35.   Les moyens pris en crmupte par le projet comprendront
- 6 personne-semaines d'un consultant international qui devra analyser
le march6 europ4en conduire des enqu&tes, et proc6der a des etudes
economiques et de compatibilite.
36.   Am6nagements touristiaues.  Le programme des Zones d'Exploitation
Touristiques (ZET) devra 8tre rdexamini afin de correspondre aux nouveaux
objectifs de conservation de la qualite des paysages et de pr4servation des
sites du Parc A m4me de garantir le d4veloppement de 1'Acotourisme.  Sans
pr6juger des r6sultats de l'&tude du march6 touristique, le Parc et la rigion
doivent &tre dot4s des aminagements suivants en matiere de circuits de
randonnte et de d&couverte
- itingraires pedestres        100 km (tours des lacs, digue du Tonga,
trekking littoral, for&ts de chAne-li4ge, zeenaie, sites culturels;
- itin6raires equestres        200 km (agr6ment avec un propri6taire de
chevaux);
- itin4raires en barque (lac Tonga) agrement avec un proprietaire de
barques A definir en fanction de la carte de vegetation;
- itindraire en bateau agrement avec utn armateur privh d'El Kr'. (c8te)
construction ponton;
- plates-formes flottantes 1 kin (d6couverte des milieux mar6cageux);
- amelioration de la valeur paysagare et Auucative de quelques axes
routiers;
. abris en matAriaux locaux,
. panneaux (cartes, ...), et
rAhabilitation de carriares (PM);



Page 11
- la rdhabilitation des miradors d'observation ornithologique des lacs
requiert :
. des travaux de gEnie civil,
* un habillage en bois, et
. des am6nagements interpretatifs;
- la fabrication et la pose de panneaux interpretatifs (acc&s
principaux, plages, lacs, bords de routes, ...);
- la construction et l'equipement de petits chalets sur trois sites
pilotes de plages du Pare;
la construction d'un petit centre d'interpr6tation au lac des
Oiseaux;
- la restauration du chalet du lac Tonga (Centre d'interpretation des
milieux lacustres) ce qui necessitera des equipements et un
embarcadere pour barques;
- la conception et 1'ddition de documents interpretatifs dont des
cartes tourist_ques. brochures et des dtpliants th4matiques;
- la formation de guides touristiques; et
- lidentification de gites d'accueil (auberges rurales), et la
formation des h6tes.

PROJET DE GESTION DU PARC NATIONAL D' EIL KALA ET DU COMPE  DE ZONES =HUIDES
SIG at EIE
A. Syst6me d' Information G4ocraohioue (13G)
1.   La SIG est a meme drutiliser de noanbreuses informations de base.
Celles-ci sont projettes sous foame de thAmes - par exemple la cartographie
des lieux ; la pluviometrie en quantit4, fr6quence et periodicite ; la
relief ; les types de sals ; le convert v6gital ; lea damages risultant de
pollution ou d' incendies ; les habitats menacEs. I1 peut ensuite Stre proc6dk
a la restitution de donn6es specifiques en vue de l'analyse et de la recherche
de solutions & des probldmes de gestion de l'espace.  Le systame permet, A
partir de donnres de reference, de visual ser 1 'evolution de nombroux
paramatres et de lee combiner entre eux. Le SIG eat eminemment tributaire des
types et, surtout, de la precision des donnees retenues. Celles-ci sont
issues de cartes digitalisees, de photographies a6riennes voire d'iimages en
provenance de satellites. De maniere plus specifique, le SIG est avant tout
un systeme de gestion de l'information destind a :
(a)   collecter, stocker et anlyser des donnies basoes sur leur
localisation gEographique;
(b) identifier des aires, au cein d'une rEgion gEographique dornnie
gui correspondent a des critires spEcifiques;
(c)   explorer les relations entre groupes de donn6es dan une rEgion
gEographique donnme;
(d)  analyser de facon speciale lee gzrmpes de donnees connexes et s'en
servir comme outil de price do decisions pour une region
gEographique prEcise;
Ce) Laciliter le d6veloppement de mnodAles analytiques a meme de faire
ressortir lee impacts de strategies alternatives de gestion pour
une aire gEographique donnEe; et
(f   faire apparattre lea donnees relatives A Une aire geographique
sons une force A la fois graphique et nunerique.
2.    Le SIG est un moyen efficace de procider a : (a) des analyses

planification d'aires prot6g6es, de suivi de la pollution marine, de l'6rosion
des sole et de Ilenvasement des barrages, de gestion de parcours, etc...
L'utilisation du SIG exige une formation prealable, un suivi regulier et la
v4rification des donnAes par recoupements sur le terrain.
3.    Avant de passer A l'acquisition d'un systeme informatique et d'un
logiciel donnes, il y aura lieu de proc6der A un inventaire rapide des moyens
informatiques disponibles et utilis4s au sein d'autres administrations (par
exemple, dana les secteurs de l'hydraulique ou des for8ts) au niveau national.
I1 sera, par ailleurs, opportun d'associer les scientifiques et les
utilisateurs au choix du syst&me a retenir. I1 s'agira ensuite de repertorier
les utilisations envisag6es et d6terminer les modalites pratiques lors des
sessions de formation. I1 est probable que la priorit6 sera, dans un premier
temps, donn6e a la d6limitation du nouveau zonage. D'of  l'importance de
pouvoir visualiser la situation r6f6rentielle au d£marrage du projet.  La
prdvention et la lutte contra les incendies, la gestion des forats domaniales,
la pollution marine seront sans aucun doute d'autres aspects qui b6n6ficieront
pleinement du SIG.
4.   I1 est pr6vu de doter respectivement l'ANN, la Wilaya et le PNEK d'une
station SIG. I1 ne s'agit pas de double-emploi puisque chaque entit6 suivra
des paramiAtre sp6cifiques. Ainsi, par exemple l'ANN sera davantage orientee
oers la gestion globale du parc national et ce, en relation avec d'autres
parca a travers le pays; la Wilaya suivra plus particuliArement les aspects
lies au developpement durable des ressources naturelles; le PNEX de son c8t6,
outre la gestion propre du Parc, suivra leas aspects liEs a la biodiversite et
aux changements 6ventuels des habitats dont il doit assurer la protection.
L'installation et la mise en route des stations SIG seront prd6cddes par la
formation des agents auxquels seront affectAs ces efquipements. La formation
sera essentiellement pratique et se deroulera sur place. Des visites des
administrations dejA pourvues du SIG seront 6galement envisagees.
B.  Etude d'imnact-sur l'Environnement (RIE)
S.   I1 existe une Inswection do l1'environnement, de creation rEcente, A la
Wilaya. Ce service ne comprend qu'un seul ing6nieur lequel eat d6pourvu de
moyens. Le responsable s'occupe essentiellement de la pollution des eaux et
de d6charges au nombre de 39 dont 3 seulement sont contr8l6es. Lee activitea
se limitent A des avis techniques sur dossiers ainsi qu'a des actions de
sensibilisation au niveau des etablissements scolaires. I1 s'agit alors
d inciter les comnmes A prendre directement en compte sur leur budget
coumunal dane les rubriques programme connumal decentralish et fonds conal
des collectivitEs locales, les problmeas locaux lies A l' environnement, le
service n'ayant pas de budget propreo  Lee problames prioritaires identifies
par le service environnement de la Wilaya resultent actuellaemnt des
decharges, de la pollution des ea-x de l'oued Kebir par lea effluents dee
conserveries de tomates, de 1'emploi de pesticides et des rejets des stations
d'essence NAPTAL qui risquont de polluer la nappe. Quelques anAlyses
bacteriologiques et physico-chimiques sont rEalisEes par le laboratoire de

l'ANPE & Annaba, mais leur nombro est insuffisant et il n'y a pas de Buivi.
6.    L'Inspection da l'environnement a sollicitA.que plusieurs itudes
d'impact environnemental soient inscrites sur is budget du plan de la Wilaya,
notamment Bur :
- lee effete de la pollution dann la Wilaya;
- les effets des ZET retenues dons la planification;
- la protection des plans d'eau au moyen de stations hydro-
climatologiquesr et
- lee modAles d'exploitation des plans d'eau avec ensemencement
en aspaces autochtones-
7.    On constate que l'Inspection de 1lenvironnement ne possade ni stratdgie,
ni mayens.  3Se actions sont au "coup par coupo, sans proc6dure & m8me de
filtrer les projeta et les activitEs qui gfnirant des problimes
d' environnemnot. Aussi, la nEcesaitE do dEvelopper la capacit6 de procEder A
den EIE au sein de la Wilaya s'avbre-t-elle iup6rieuse.
S.    Mine en niace d'une cellule SIR au n a  do la Wilava d'El Tart. La
d6marche qui consiste au niveau de la Wilaya a rojeter systhmatiquement lea
projets de d6veloppement & priori non conforma aux objectife do pr6servation
de lenvirannement ent difficile L maintenir & term  en l'absenco d'un autil
tel que 1'IE. La procEdure EIN vise Ossentiollement A analyser l'impact des
projets et el suuggrer doe mesures cc Ilhnzntaires et cczpensatoires A mettre
en oeuvre pour minimiser les impacts envirfnnementaux. ceci n6cessite une
r6vision de la lEgislation afin, qu'au soin du PlBK et do la Wilaya, les
infrastructures et projets scient sounds a une procEdure KIN, sorte do
wcontr8le-qualith" obligatoire. C'est ainai qu'il y a lieu de ripertorier
- les barrages;
- les aires de poompago;
- lee infrastructures routihres et autoroutihres;
- les infrastructures touristiques;
- les zones d' extension urbaine;
- les lieux d'implantations des entreprises : industrielles et agro-
alimentaires;
- pErimitres irriguEs;
- lea zones de reboisements importants en essences allochtones; et
- les travaux de drainage.
9.   I1 conviendra de d6finir lea attributions de la cellule ENI. Sans
prijugor de 1'etude A rialiser, on pout anticiper quo lea principales t&hes
de cette cellule consisteront & :
- passer en revue l'ensemble des projets;



Annexe 6
Page 4
- suivre la prise en compte des recommandations de la cellule lors des
phases de conception et de formulation du projet;
- suivre l'application des recommandations pendant le ddroulement du
projet;
- s'assurer de la realisation d'une evaluation environnementale ex-post
de chaque projet;
- concevoir et diffuser des guides mdthodologiques sur les EIE;
- faire des recherches documentaires; et
- participer a la mise en place d'une r6glementation sur les EIE.
10.   Localisation de la cellule EIE.  La position hidrarchique de la cellule
d'EIE au sein de la Wilaya, douc son autorite, dApendra de l'importance qui
sera accordde aux EIE. II s'agit de renforcer l'Inspection de
1'environnemental et de la doter des capacit4s ndcessaires en vue de
'llaborntion de cahiers des charges et de l'analyse des etudes
environnementales qui, a terme, devront obligatoirement accompagner les
dossiers techniques des projets d'investissement. I} n'est, a priori, pas
prevu que la cellule d'EIE realise elle-meme les 6tudes d'impact. Au debut,
sans cadre legislatif adapte, son role sera essentiellement consultatif.
Progressivement et en harmonie avec la mise en place d'une reglementation
naticnale donnant plus d'importance aux EIE, cette cellule accroitra son
autonomie, quitte A se trouver placde au-dessus des services techniques de la
Wilaya. La cellule sera dotee de moyens suffisants et propres A assurer son
indhpendance.
11.  I1 sera mis un accent tout particulier sur la formation des cadres et
agents en matiere d'EIE. En effet, il s'agira en un premier temps de
sensibiliser les d6cideurs, dont les directeurs techniques de la Wilaya pour
qu'ils acquierent le r6flexa de se soucier ddsormais au stade de la conception
de projets, de l'impact ultdrieur des interventions considerees. Une
formation de courte durde se ddroulera en Algerie avec la venue d'un expert en
EIE. Enfin, des voyages d'etudes dans des pays du bassin mdditerranden
permettront l'examen de cas concrets.

PROJET DE GESTION PU PARC NATIONAL D'EL KALA ET DU COMPLEKE DE ZONES HUMIDES
FORMATION ET EDUgATXION ENVIRONNEMENTALE
1.    Le projet comprendra un programme dtendu de formation destine A
l'ensemble des catdgories de personnel avec toutefois une prioritd donnde A
ceux/celles op6rant sur le terrain. La formation se deroulera essentiellement
en Algerie mats aussi, occasionnelleoent, A l'4tranger.  Les thtmes de
formation qui semblent particuli&rement importants comprennent la protection
des zones tampons ou interm4diaires, le contrble de la faune, les technique
pour une agriculture 6cologique, la pr6vL-nt4o. et le contr8le des incendies,
les relations et la communication avec le public. Une formation sera
egalement dispensee en mati6re de SIC, EIE et de suivi et evaluation. Enfin,
et non moins important, les usagers et les membres de ONGs pourront dgalement
bdndficier d'une etucation environneoentale.
2.    Formation a6nerale.  Les besoins en formation des agents du projet
seront d6termines par un specialiste en ressources humaines. Ces besoins
doivent decouler de termes de rdfdrence et de profiles claires et actualis6es,
de la connaissance de la formation ant6rieure des agents, de leur exp6rience,
de leurs preferences, enfin du suivi regulier de leur travail au fil du temps.
La formation comprendra essentiellement: (i) un atelier initial au cours
duquel l'objet du projet, les composantes et les moyens seront expliquds en
d4tail a 1'ensemble du personnel; (ii) des cours de recyclage n'excedant pas
5 journ4es chacun; (iii) des cours en communication et en relations humaines,
principalement de courte duree pour les specialistes (n'excddant pas une
semaine chacune) et (iv) des sessions de formation ne ddpassant pas trois mois
pour des specialistes en biodiversit4 et environnement, en SIG et en EIE, et
des gestionnaires de parcs. Les sujets de formation ci-dessus sont indicatifs
et devront etre confort6s par le spdcialiste en ressources humaines. En
attendant, le tableau 8.1 fournit des recounandations et des indications quant
aux types et aux couits des formations envisagdes.
3.    Formation en Gestion et rlanification environnementale.  Le directeur
g6n6ral de l'ANN ou son adjoint, le directeur du PNEK et deux reprdsentants de
la Wilaya auront l'opportunite de se rendre en voyage d'dtude en Europe ou en
Tunisie (lac Ishkeul) dans le cadre d'une formation en gestion et
planification environnementale. Gela devrait permettre aux participants
d'acqu6rir de 1'experience pratique en gestion notamnent en relation avec les
objectifs des programmes sp6cifiques au sein de leurs dopartements respectifs.
D'autres aspects concerneraient : une meilleure definition et mise en place
d'une politique sur l'environnement, une meilleure vision des responsabilites
des agences de conservation de l'environnement, l1'laboration de rdgulations
et de references, la conceptualisation et la mise en oeuvre d'enquates
d'impact sur l'environnement (EIE), et Ilexamon de systemes a meme de
favoriser une politique de ddveloppement interministerielle.



Annexe "
Page 2
4.    Formation en Etude d'Tmnact sur l'Environnement.  La capacite
institutionnelle de proceder A des EIE est encore faible en Algdrie tandis
qu'elle est quasi inexistante dans la Wilaya d'EI Tarf. Peu de personnes ont
eu l'opportunitd de recevoir la formation appropriee et pratique en la
matiAre. Une formation en EIE est indispensable pour slassurer que des
enquetes d'impact seront entreprises des lors lue des projets de ddveloppement
seront envisages. Cette formation devrait dgalement permettre 1'etablissement
d'une base institutionnelle solide A m6me de faciliter la prise de decisions
de politique et de planification environnementale.
5.    Un expert international sera chargb de conduire un seminaire sur l'EIE
au ddmarrage du projet, puis elaborera et lancera un programme de formation
sur les dtudes d'impact. Les trois jours de sdminaire dlinitiation seront
organisds A Alger par l'ANN. Les groupes cibles inclueront essentiellement
des cadres des ministeres de l'dconomie, de la planification, de l'dnergie, de
l'industrie, de 3'hydraulique, de l'agriculture, des infrastructures et du
tourisme. Un sdminaire similaire se tiendra peu aprbs a El Tarf, destine aux
cadres de la Wilaya, du PNEK et des ONGs. Le consultant fera par ailleurs des
recommandations lors de la confection de directives at de procddures en
mati&re d'EIE.  De facon plus specifique, l'Inspection de l'environnement de
la Wilaya, oiu sera logee la cellule d'EIE, sera chargde des activitds
suivantes: (i) ddfinir une categorisation at des procedures de sdlection des
projets requerant des etudes d'impact; (ii) procedder A l'valuation des EIE de
projets spdcifiques et ddcider s'lil y a lieu d'accepter ou de rejeter les
propositions; (iii) d4velopper et mettre au point des proceddures, normes et
rdgulations pour la conduite de EIE; (iv) ddfinir des proceddures de suivi et
dvaluation; et (v) trouver les meilleurs moyens de dissdmination des rdsultats
d'EIE aupres du public.
6.    Formation sur les Ressources Naturelles et les AsDects Economigues li6s
A l.Environnement. La prise de conscience croissante des relations qu'il y a
entre la gestion des ressources naturelles, la d6gradation de 1'environnement
et le ddveloppement economique entraine le besoin d'expertise spdcialisde.
Elle devra dvaluer les couts et bendfices des politiques environnementales,
Ilimpact de politiques sectoriell's sur la gestion de ressources naturelles et
l'dvaluation des projets qui soit utilisent des ressources naturelles, soit
ont un impact sur i'environnement. L'operation contribuera a la formation de
diplomds en ressources naturelles et aux aspects dconomiques lids a
l'environnement. La duree de tels programmes serait de 2 A 4 mois et, au
plus, trois candidats pourraient etre admis.
7.    Education Environnementale.  Le projet prdvoit d'accroitre sensiblement
les activitds d'dducation environnementale A la fois au niveau rdgional et
local. La contribution attendue consistera en la diss6mination de
l'information, I'accroissament de la sensibilisation du public et de sa
connaissance des problemes de l'environnement et des liens de ces derniers
avec le ddveloppement dconomique, et la recherche d'une participation active
des comnunautes- L'accent sera mis essentiellement sur les trois groupes
suivants: (i) les communaut6s d'agriculteurs, chasseurs, pecheurs, forestiers
et autres corporations residant dans les aires tampons et dans le parc; (ii)



Annexe 8
Page 3
les enfants d'age scolaire et les jeunes, les associations de volontaires de
la conservation; et, (iii) le public en gen6ral a qui sera adresse des
messages educatifs par la radio, la t6l6vision, par le biais d'expositions,
d'affiches   et de documentation.  Les programmes de sensibilisation
impliqueront une interaction directe des populations avec un personnel
specialement form6 comprenant des guides et des conciliateurs. Le cursus de
la formation destinee aux etudiants et aux communautes tiendra compte des
aspects 4cologiques et environnementaux particuliers de la region. Les themes
inclueront notamment: la gestion de leau, environnement et lee populations,
la prevention et le contr8le des incendies, preservation et developpement
durable-
8.    L'universit6 de Annaba ainsi que celles d'Alger et de Constantine
constitueront sans aucun doute de bonnes sources de formation. Leurs
comp6tences comprennent des 6tudes et enquetes sur la faune et la flore,
1'hydrologie, la sociologie et lea techniques de communication. L'ANN
pourrait egalement solliciter le CNPA qui a une solide experience dans la
production de mat6riel audio-visuel y compris les films, messages radio, les
brochures et affiches. Le premier programme annuel de formation sera prdpar6
puis soumis A la Banque pour commentaires en meme temps que le plan de
gestion. Les programmes de formation suivants seront regulierement mis a jour
et pass6s en revue par les missions de supervision.
9.    Le projet slattachera autant que possible a avoir la participation des
ONGs. Ces dernieres ayant des moyens tres limit6s mais une bonne volont6
infinie, le projet mettra de cot6 un fond ne depassant pas US$100,000 pour
mat&rialiser les meilleures idees provenant d'ONG ou de groupes communautaires
et jugees comme tel par I'ANN et le comite de Wilaya. Lee ONGs seront
certainement tr2s qualifi6es pour le tournage de films sur la faune et lea
habitats naturels, pour diriger des tours commentes d'ecoliers et de jeunes
gens, avec par ailleurs leur participation danm des expositions et des foires,
tout en etant a l'avant garde dans la sensibilisation des populations.
10. Le projet fournira des 4quipements audio-visuels ainsi que deux minibus.
L'un sera utilise par la direction des services agricoles tandis que l'autre
sera reparti a tour de role entre les 2-3 ONGs de la Wilaya. Le minibus
destine aux ONGs operera en fonction d'une planification etablie par le PNEK.

ALGERIA
EL KALA NATIONKAL PARK AND WETLAND COMPLEX MANAGEMENT PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING
Backqround
1.    At the central level.  The Agence nationale pour la conservation de la
nature (ANN), which comes under the Ministry for Agriculture is officially
responsible for the preservation of the fauna and flora nationwide. It was
created in 1991 as a public organization and competes with rather than
supersedes other public entities such as the Institute of Forestry and the
Agency for Forestry. ANN has had in the past no vision as to its potential
role in linking conservation with development. Instead the traditional
approaches to park management prevailed which were unsympathetic to the
constraints facing local people, and relied on guard patrols and fines. ANN's
current conservation policies and staff mix do highlight these trends. For
instance, the agency had no sociologist and never conducted socioeconomic
assessments of targeted beneficiaries. Such a need was not perceived since
ANN had been created mainly to preserve the environment. It had no specific
mandate to facilitate, contribute or control development. ANN lacked a
monitoring and evaluation section and remained out of touch of even major
changes in the environment.
2.    At the regional level.  The El Kala National Park (EXNP) was run
acording to ANN's rules of strict conservation of the environment. The Park,
however, achieved little as it had no more than 5 engineers, 1 technician and
6 junior agents, and no experience in project management. It also had no
enforcement authority or land ownership.
3t    The Interministerial Committee.  At the Bank's request, Government
created in 1991 an Interministerial Committee (IC) comprised of
representatives from the key ministries involved in, one way or another,
environmental issues, i.e. the Ministries of Economy, Interior, Equipment,
Agriculture, Scientific Research, and the National Planning Council.
4.    Project Implementation.  ANN would be markedly strengthened and would
have overall responsibility for the project. It would rely on the IC for
policy decisions. The IC would meet a minimmm of twice per year and would
also be involved in major decisions whenever necessary. This would definitely
be a way to improve coordination, consultation and collaboraticn among
government's strongly sectoral organizations. Day to day management of the
project would be the responsibility of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU).
See the list of institutional responsibilities and the organigram for details
(Annex 9, page __
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Annex 9
Page 2
5.   Proiect Implementation Unit: The PIU which would be part of ANN would be
established prior to the initial grant disbursement. The unit would include a
full time Algerian Project Manager (acceptable to the GEF) who would be
appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture prior to negotiations. He would be
seconded by a full time expatriate Assistant Manager. The PIU would be a
small unit including four persons: (a) the Project Manager, director of the
PFU; (b) an administrative staff, also seconded by an expatriate; (c) a
Training and Environmental Education Coordinator; and (d) a Monitoring and
Evaluation Coordinator. With the exception for the persons in charge of
administration and financing who would be located in Algiers, the PIU would be
based in El Kala.
6.   In addition, one local consultant would be recruited for 14 months to
follow-up, coordinate and synthesize the several studies required for the
preparation of the El Kala National Park management plan.
7.   The Project Manager who would have the rank of director within ANN,
would be responsible for coordinating project operations and expenditures,
ensuring close working relationship with the Wilaya, sub-contracting specific
activities to local government organizations, NGO and other associations, and
for submitting biannual progress reports to the Bank. The Project Manager
would be above the director of the Park. It is expected that once the projecc
is complete, the PIU would be transferred to another National Park should the
El Kala case proves replicable.
8.   The organigram of the EKNP would been modified to reflect the Park's new
goals.  Additional personnel would be obtained through transfers mainly fr
the forestry department.
9.   Within the Wilaya of El Tarf, the Conseil d'orientation du Parc would
advise on project implementation and help solve inter-sectoral issues. The
Wali - the head of the Wilaya - while promoting development is anxious that
there be no irreversible damage to the environment. Meanwhile, the Wilaya
Environmental Inspectorate has only one inspector and no capability. The
project would therefore provide the Wilaya with the capacity including
personal, equipment and training to supervise Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIA) studies. This would be one of the project's greatest contribution. The
Environmental Inspectorate (EIl would also have access to GIS technology
allowing both the Wiiaya and the project to better monitor the environment.
It is expected that the EI would play a major role in coordinating activities
and interveations between the Wilaya's several technical directorates and ERNP
management including the PIU.
10.  Community Participation: The over-ridi=g issue for the management of
the El Wcla ecosystem is the traditional conflict between the short term
aspiration and needs of a rapidly growing population and the absolute
necessity to preserve the environment in order to provide for sustai-able
development. There is no doubt that the safeguarding of the biodiversity and
natural resources of the El Kala region will depend heavily on the
participation and cooperation of the local populations. It is thun essential
that the management plan be conceptualized and gradually implemented with the



Annex 9
Page 3
support and understanding of an increasingly involved and well informed
public. It means participation in decision-making, in problem identification,
in project design and implementation, and in project monitoring and
evaluation.
11.   Participatorv AyRroach.  Two social scientists (one Algerian, one
foreign) have been contracted to address these issues (e.g. people's
participation, environmental education through the ground-up approach,
consideration of the farming and hunting population). Their work will mainly
consist of initiating a process of consultation and participation which will
feed into the Management Plan. They will establish the baseline situation and
advise on how to integrate the local culture into the project.
12.   Traditional parks totally excluded local people from consideration when
they were initially established and El Kala is no exception. The project
would therefore put much emphasis on the introduction of the participatory
approach. At the beginning of the project Consultant sociologists would be
involved to better understand the populations' problems, constraints and
aspirations. This approach would seek to involve the local populations in
the project at an early stage and possibly down to the village level. The
establishment of a close consultative relationship between the administrative
authorities at all levels and the local population, whose development is being
planned is an additional imperative. The successful long term management of
the Park depends on the cooperation and support of the local people and it
will be essential that the project seeks and provides them with alternative
mean-s of livelihood through systematic experiments.
13.  Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation. Another internationally
recruited consultant (assisted by an Algerian specialist) will define, shortly
before the project start-up, the broad framework for environmental monitoring
and evaluation and will establish the main key indicators. These will be
further refined as the Management Plan takes shape.
14.   NGOs Participation.  Government has indicated it would encourage the
participation of NGOs to the project. A few such organizations exist in El
Kala and have expressed great interest to the idea. Meanwhile, besides their
good will, NCOs currently have very little means to operate and make a
difference. The project would thus provide funds - not to exceed a total of
US$100,000 - for several local NGOs to be funded based on proposals. They
would be involved in conservation, establishing inventories, training local
populations through education campaigns, conducting guided tours, and being
associated in the evaluation of the above project activities. The University
of Annaba would also be invited to participate in the project mainly through
inventories, studies and adaptive research programs.

ORGANISATION DU PROJET DU PARC D'EL-KALA
ET DU COMPLEXE DE ZONES HUMIDES
I.  ORGANKS DR GESTION
1-    Au niveau national : L'ANN
Le projet sera mis en place par 1'Agence Nationale pour la Conservation
de la Nature, dans la limite de ses attributions et sous le contr8le du ComitL
Interministeriel.
Cr6ation d'une unit6 de mise en place du pro iet : Unit6 du Projet El Kala/UPEK
Cette unite, d6pendant hi&rarchiquement du Directeur Gendral de l'ANN,
sera situ6e au meme niveau que les Directions techniques de l'agence. Le Chef
de l'unit6 aura rang de directeur.
Structure de 1'UPEK:
L'UPEK sera une structure legere. Elle ne comprendra que quatre
fanctionnaires alg6riens a plein temps qui seront assist6s par deux assistants
techniques pendant une partie du projet. La composition de l"UPEK sera donc
comme suit :
- Un Directeur alg6rien sera nomm4 a la tete de 1'UPEK et assumera la
fonction de Chef de Projet. I1 sera assist6 par un Directeur adjoint
expatri&, sur la base de contrats d'un an renouvelable pour une dur6e de
deux ans ;
- Un Responsable administratif et financier algerien, qui sera assist&
d'un expatrie, sur la base de contrats de six mois renouvelables pour
men duree de 18 mois ;
- Un responsable de la formation et de 1'6ducation environnementale sera
charge de preparer et de suivre les programmes destines tant au
personnel de l'ANN, du Parc et de la Wilaya, qu'aux personnes impliquees
dans le projet Cpopulations riveraines, ONGs, reprAsentants des
autorites locales, etc - ) ;
- Un responsable du suivi-evaluation tt de la planification du projet qui
sera charge, entre autre, d'6laborer le chronogramme du projet et de
veiller a sa bonne marche-
En outre, un consultant national sera recrut4 pour une dur6e de 14 mois
pour coordonner et faire la synth4se des 4tudes de pr4paration du Plan de
gestion du Parc National d'El-Kala (PNEK).



Annex 9
Page 5
Attribution de 1'UPEI
L'UPEK sera responsable de la gestion du projet, dont la pr4paration et
la mise en place du Plan de gestion du Parc National d'El-Kala, l'acquisition
du mat6riel et des equipements, la gestion des ressources humaines, le
contr8le financier et budgetaire, la coordination entre la Wilaya et le PNEK,
et le suivi-4valuation.
D6localisation de Z'UPEK
Pendant la dur6e du projet, l'essentiel du personnel de l'UPEK, A
l'exception des responsables administratifs et financiers, sera local±sd a El-
Rala.  I1 eat concevable qu'a l'issue du projet, l'UPEK puisse etre erigee en
Direction de la gestion des parcs, afin de se consacrer, depuis Alger, ft la
conservation du patrimoine naturel pour l'ensemble du territoire national.
Comvte srdcial:
Un compte sp6cial sera ouvert A la Banque Centrale sous la fornme d'un
fonds de roulement utilise par l'Agence Nationale de la Conservation de la
Nature. La d6budg6tisation du projet se fera A partir de l'ANN vers le PNEK et
la Wilaya D'El Tarf selon des procedures a definir lors des n6gociations.
2.    Au niveau local
2.1. Le Parc National d'El-Kala (PNEX)
Structure du PHEK
Le projet, dans sa premi&re phase, correspondant A la prdparation du
plan de gestion, saappuira sur lorganigramme actuel du PNEK. Cet organigrame
correspond A celui d'un "projet r4f4rentiel" de parc national, canformiment au
statut-type, calqu8 sur un modile administratif.
An niveau central, le PNEK comprend actuellement :
- Une Direction ;
- Un Secr4tariat gdn6ral, comprenant deux services : i) Service budget et
mayen et (ii) Service personnel et r6glementation ;
- tTn D6partement de la pr6servation et de la promotion des ressources
naturelles et des sites, comprenant deux services : (i) Service
pr6servation et cromotion de la flore et de la faune et (ii) Service de
la protection des sites ;
-  iUn D6partement animation et vulgarisation, comprenant Egalement deux
services   (i) Service accueil, Orientation et Vulgarisation et Service
Administration scientifique, culturelle et sportive.
Le personnel initialement pr6vu pour le PNEK, bien que son d&cret de
creation de 1983 ne pr6cise pas lorganisation du personnel, 6tait de 10
personnes (I Directeur, 1 secretaire g6n&ral, 2 chefs de d6partement et 6



AmEex 9
Page 6
chefs de service), dont seulement 4 sont prdsentes.  Le tableau 9.1 repr6aente
lea besoins ad minima en personnel pour lea besoins du projet. Ainsi, au
niveau central, quatre personnes devront etre recrut4es avant l'entree en
vigueur du projet, portant ainsi le nombre A huit.
De m&ime au niveau d6centralise, la prkparation et la mise en place du
plan de gestion doit se faire dans les limites du budget en personnel alloun
par l'Etat a la zone du Parc. Au total 46 personnes devront etre localis6s sur
le terrain :
- 20 cardes-parc. Ces gardes seront des agents forestiers de la Wilaya, de
pr6firence travaillant sur laire couverte par is PNEX, d6tach4s ;
-  5 charces ina6nieurs. Ces ingenieurs seront chargAs des programmes
d'ecodeveloppement des unites de gestion de Bougous, du lac Tonga, des
Lacs Mellah et Oubeira, de Berihane et de Cheffia-Bouteldja. Un seul de
ces ing4nieurs sera recrutd, les quatre devant &tre red6ploye depuis le
siege du PNEX vers les unitis de gestion ;
-  15  uides et animateurs. Le projet slassurera la collaboration, sur une
base contractuelle, de guides touristiques et maritimes et d'animateurs,
en particulier aupr&s des ONGs operant dann la r6gion. Parmi ces
personnes, en particulier parmi les animateurs, des fommep devront Otre
recrut6es ;
-  6 crardiens. Ils seront charg6s de surveiller certains sites et awtres
chalets d'information : le port (2 gardiens), le Lac des Oiseaux (1
gardien), le lac Tonga (2 gardiens) et le Cap Segleb (1 gardien). Un
seul gardien sera A recruter
- personnel subalterne. Les estimations des besoins en personnel
subalterne rendront probablement necessaire le recrutement de deux
secr6taires temporaires et de cing nouveaux chauffeurs qui viendront
s'ajouter aux trois existants actuellement.
A terme, l'organigramme du PNE deovrait 6voluer vers une structure plus
plate avec suppression des services et crdation, a la place des deux
dfpartements existants actuellement, des cing d6partements suivants
(i)   Departement de la conservation du milieu terrestre;
(ii) D4partement de la conservation du milieu marin;
(iii) D4partement du tourisme et de 1'6ducation environnementale;
(iv) Departement du suivi environnemental et de la recherche;
(v) D6partement de 1'co-d6velcppement.
Uhe proposition de nouvel organigramme, cob£rent avec le plan de
gestion, devra donc etre faite a l'issue de la premiAre ann4e du projet. De
meme, en cours de projet, des propositions devront 6galement etre faites
visant a 1' autofinancement A terme des guides et animateurs, ou A leurs prise
en charge par lea ONG et autres associations bin6voles.

2.2. La Wilava d'El Tarf
Renforeement de 1l'Inspection de 1'environnefnfent (IE)
Dana le cadre du projet, il est prwvu de renforcer sensiblement cette
structure qui, A l'heure actuelle, ne compte en tout et pour tout qu'un
inspecteur. La Wilaya d'El Tarf devra doter 1'IE des moyena humains,
conform&ment a son nouveau r8le. Ainsi, avant 1lentr4e en vigueur du projet,
Ia Wilaya devra recruter 3 nouveaux agents qui constitueront la Cellule
d'etude d'imoact sur 1lenvironnement. Le projet equipera 1'IE en mat6riel et
financera une assistance technique d'appui.

ALGERL
EL KALA NATIONAL PARK AND WETLAND COMPLEX MANAGEMENT PROJECT
PARTICIPATORY APPROACH - ROLE OF EGOs
Terms of Reference (August 1993 Mission)
SocioloRist/Community Participation Specialist(s)
Objectives
The objective of the sociologist/community participation specialist
mission is twofold:
(a)   identify necessary baseline studies and key indicators for
monitoring and evaluating community participation; and
(b)   design a monitoring and evaluation program which is community
participatory (involves the local communities implicated in tha
project).
Scope of Work
As little consultation of local populations has occurred, the specialist
should first work closely with the populations to gather data on the area of
influence and the affected populations. This should include Social-Cultural
Profiles and Local Participation Plans (see Social Aspects of Biodiversity
Conservation, World Bank, 1993). The specialist will in conjunction with the
affected populations identify and define:
(a)   the goals of the monitoring and evaluation program;
(b)   the role of the affected communities in gathering information;
(c)   the gaps and needs of baseline studies;
(d)   key monitoring indicators;
(e)   targets, outputs and information sharing;
(f)   in conjunction with the ecologist/biodiversity specialist, the
initial Terms of Reference for the unit wiihin the project in
charge of monitoring and evaluation, including the staffing of the
unit; and
(g)   in conjunction with the ecologist/biodiversity specialist, the
legal and institutional key indicators which relate to the above
and have to be monitored.



Annex 10
Page 2
Prior to the mission, the specialist will review:
(a)   the World Bank/GEF's Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines for
Biodiversity Projects;
(b)   "Social Aspects of Biodiversity Conservation - Guidelines for
Socio-Cultural Profiles and Local Participation Plans" (WB); and
(c) all appropriate documents provided by the World Bank concerning
the preparation and presentation of the proposed project including
the Memorandum of the Director and appropriate working papers
describing specific project components.
ReRorting
The specialist will prepare a report for presentation to the Government
of Algeria which will include the items outlined in the "scope of work" and
specific recommendations for design of baseline data collection protocols,
establishment of regular monitoring procedures and a proposed schedule and
outline of reporting procedures for monitoring results. The specialist will
also prepare the appropriate Socio-Cultural Profiles and Local Participation
Plans. Recommendations should be made on periodic review of program and
format for tracking project performance. This should include mechanisms to
review the involvement of affected populations and local Government.
Oualifications
The specialist must hold recognized professional qualifications in the
field -f social anthropology, sociology or human ecology. The specialist
should have broad experience in conservation planning and modern principles
and practices in protected area design and management. He should have working
experience in the Maghreb and in particular experience in working with
national and local institutions concerned with protected areas management and
grassroots rural development. The specialist should be fluent in French.
Duration and Schedule
The consultant will work closely with the Agence nationale pour la
conservation de la nature (ANN). He will travel to Algeria possibly in June-
July and stay four weeks in the country, mainly at El Kala, the site of the
project. One additional week will be devoted to report writing in the
consultant's country. The report should be sent to the Government and the
Bank no later than 10 days after completion of the mission.

ALGERIE
PROJET DE GESTION D1J PARC NATIONAL D'EL KAIA ET D1J COMPLEXE DE ZONES HUMIDES
SUIVI ET EVALUATION ENVIRONNEMENTAL
1.    La projet sera dote d'une cellule de Suivi et Evaluation (S&E) dont la
constitution. les attributions et le r6le seront determin4s avec le plus grand
soin. En effet, la creation d'une capacitd de Suivi et Evaluation (S&E) est
d'autant plus importante que le projet considerie se propose d'dlaborer puis de
mettre en place un plan de gestion A partir de la premiere annee.  Ce plan de
gestion sera evolutif dans le temps et devra etre enrichi par la participation
effective des communautds concernees.  Enfin, le caractere novateur de
certaines composantes, notamment celles relatives au zonage, A la preservation
des ressources naturelles, et A la recherche d'un d6veloppement durable dans
des aires specifiques, fait qu'il est indispensable de pourvoir le projet avec
une solide capacite de S&E-
2,    L'objectif des actitvitds de suivi et evaluation environnemental durant
le projet est triple: (i) servir d'outil de gestion aux responsables du
projet en leur fournissant en temps voulu les informations leur permettant de
suivre la mise en place des diffdrentes composantes, et pouvoir reuddier tr&s
rapidement a tout retard ou deviation par rapport au pr6vu; (ii) fournir peu
apr&s la mise en place de chaque nouvelle etape des donudes permettant de
constater et d'analyser les premi&res r6actions des usagers; et, (iii) dvaluer
en fin de phase les r6sultats obtenus-
3.    Pour &tre efficace le systbme de S&E doit &tre concu avant la mise en
place des activitds et en tout cas au ddmarrage du projet.  En effet,
l'exptrience prouve que dans la majoritd des cas les retards en matiere de S&E
sont irrecupdrables et entrainent bien souvent une ddsaffection regrettable
envers cet outil de gestion primordial. "Qui collecte quoi 7 quand 7 a quel
intervalle ? en quelle quantite ? et pour quoi faire ?" sont les questions
fondamentales a m&me d'6tayer un systeme S&E efficace. En effet, soit il est
collecte trop d'informations rendant la gestion onereuse et peu efficace soit
l'indigence des donndes est telle qu'il nWest guere possible d'en tirer quoi
qua ce soit. La collecte d'informations est un exercice d'dquilibre et de bon
sens. Une certaine quantitd d'informations est ndcessaire pour d6terminer une
politique, toutefois trop de donn6es peat paralyser I'action. Enfin, il y a
lieu de souligner que des decisions peuvaent etre prises et des actions
entamees avant m&me que toutes les informations requises soient collectees.
4.    Le suivi et dvaluation de routine propre a tout projet est bien connu et
les indicateurs necessaires seront determines au cours du seminaire prdvu au
ddmarrage du projet et rdunissant les chefs de services et le consultant en
S&E. Le suivi environnementale par contre est beaucoup plus particulier et
requerra des responsables de l'ANN et du PNEK le suivi des trois aspects
ci-apres pour lesquels des points cle specifiques seront arr6t4s:



Annexe_11
Page 2
(a)   La Rrotection de la biodiversite et des aires urot6gees    Ceci
implique un S&E A indicateurs hierarchises notamment au niveau du
paysage regional, de l'ecosysteme et des esp&ces. Les risques A
court et long terme seront identifids et des indicateurs sensibles
aux changements d4terminAs. Les indicateurs retenus seront suivis
pour une aire et pendant un temps donnes. L'dvolution des
indicateurs sera compar6e A celle d'aires de rdference qu'il
s'agira de localiser. Enfin les informations recueillies devront
etre presentees sous une forme facilement exploitable;
(b)   Conditions socio-4conomigues et participation communautaire
L'un des principaux objectifs du projet est d'aboutir A la
participation des populations locales et obtenir leur support A
long terme. Ceci implique par ailleurs l'identification des
moyens susceptibles d'ameliorer les conditions socio-6conomiques
des comitmautes vivant dans et autour des aires protegdes- Les
communaut6s doivent etre impliqu6es dains l'dtablissement des
objectifs pour celles des composantes les concernant. II s'agir
de bien ddfinir les m6canismes de cette participation afin d'en
tirer des le,ons exploitables et si possible extrapolables;
(c)   Asnects legaux et institutionnels : La ldgislation nationale doit
etre en conformitd avec les traitds internationaux pour lesquels
ie pays est signataire.  La responsabilite du contenu de chaque
accord doit &tre attribuee par arret6 A un minist6re ou A une
entit4 officielle- Sitot le dAmarrage, il devra &tre procdde a
; inventaire des traites et accords internationaux en relation
avec les objectifs du projet. De m6xme, il faudra faire
I'inventaire de la l6gislation locale en matibre environnementale
et ddterminer les attributions de responsabilitds dans la gestion
des ressources naturelles. Enfin, il sera important d'examiner
les attributions et les fonctions des diff6rents services du
projet y compris les aspects lids au personnel et aux moyens
financiers.
5.    La cellule suivi-Avaluation.  La cellule S&E sera partie int6grante de
lIUnit6 de mise en place di- projet (UPEK) at sera basde datns la region d'El
Kala.  Elle sera dirigde par un specialiste en biodiversite (coordinateur du
S&E, cf. annexe 9 p. 4) lequel sera conseiLl6 par le directeur adjoint de
1'UPEK.  En outre, il sera procede, sur tne base contractuelle, au recrutement
d'un statisticien/informaticien, d'un sociologue/anthropologue et d'une dquipe
d'enqueteurs. Les informations de base et les enquAtes seront conduites par
cette 4quipe de 6 enqueteurs dont le travail alternera entre la collecte de
donn6es et le traitement de celles-ci.  A l'issue des trois annees du projet,
les competences de cette cellule S&E pourront &tre transf6rees A l'Inspection
environnementale de Wilaya. Le personnel inclura en outre une secretaire et
un chauffeur. Les principaux equipements comprendront un v6hicule tout
terrain, six notocyclettes, un ordinateur et du materiel de bureau.



Annexe 11
Page 3
6.    De l'assistance technique renforcera la cellule de mani&re periodique.
C'est ainsi qu'un consultant specialiste du suivi-Avaluation environnemental
s'est rendu en Algerie au mois d'aoiat 1993 pour une dur6e de 2 semaines. A
l'issue de cette mission, un rapport a 4t& prepar6 qui jette les bases du
systame a mettre en place pour assurer principalement le suivi de la
biodiversit6, de la diversit6i des habitats et du fonctionnement de
l'6cosysteme'.  En outre, un consultant en S&E environnemental participera au
seminaire de demarrage du projet.  I1 se rendra deux fois en Alg6rie pour un
total de deux mois (y compris le s6minaire) la premiere ann6e, et un mois pour
chacune des deux ann&es suivantes. Ce consultant aura un rale important dans
la concertation destinee A cerner les points c16. I1 s'assurera avec la
direction du projet de la participation des autorites locales, des ONGs et
autres representants des usagers au cours de rdunions annuelles (une par an)
dites d'analyse et de bilan relatives au S&E, des principales composantes du
projet. L'expert devra d6finir le plan de travail du personnel de la cellule,
les echantillons statistiques pour les differentes categories d'enqu8tes, et
indiquer les etudes ponctuelles susceptibles d'§tre recommandees en cours de
projet. Le consultant d6finira par ailleurs, en collaboration avec la
direction du proj et, les types et periodicit6s des rapports devant etre
produits par les diff6rents services et departements et, en arratera les
canevas respectifs. Enfin, il sera responsable de la formation
mtthodologique, pratique et informatique qui sera apportee aux agents de la
cellule.
7.    Princi aux elements a prendre en compte par le syst&me S&E. Sans
prejuger des resultats et conclusions der. travaux de 1'expert, la cellule de
S&E se penchera sur la preservation des ecosystAmes et des ressources
naturelles de la r6gion des lacs et du complexe de zones humides lesquelles
constituent des habitats importants pour de nombreux oiseaux migrateurs. Non
moins importante est l'implication des populations riveraines vivant dans ces
zones dans la planification et la mise en place de programmes de gestion . Au
niveau de la biodiversite il sera tenu compte :
- de l'identification des 4cosyst8mes et habitats;
- des populations, des revenus et des systdmes d'exploitation;
- de la pollution des eaux;
- de la surexploitation de la nappe phr4atique;
- de la devegetalisation des dunes c8ti6res;
- des incendies de forets, de l'4rosion et du surpaturage; et
- de la biomasse marine, ainsi que de la gestion des ressources
halieutiques et coliares.
En matiere de biologie le suivi concernera

differentes composantes du projet soit 18 mois apr&s le lanccement des
premieres activit6s. Ce sera l'occasion pour un examen approfondi effectue
avec la collaboration d'experts etrangers au projet. Les conclusions
devraient selon les circonstances aboutir soit au maintien des objectifs
initiaux soit A leur r6am4nagement.

ALGERI
EL IWA NATIONAL PARK AND WETLAND COMPLEX MANAGEMENT PROJECT
PROJECT SUPERVISION PLAN
1.    The proposed Project has a number of innovative components and is to be
implemented in a short time frame of only three years. A wider and more
intensive program of supervision than is normally applied for Bank operations
is thus anticipated. The project in itself differs somewhat from the normal
concerns of the ANN and the latter definitely lacks the necessary experience
to conduct supervision activities. Also, a mid-term review has been scheduled
that will require proper data and information in order for decision-makers to
draw valuable lessons-
2.    Supervision would take place at two levels, and would be intensive
throughout the implementation period. The main responsibility for supervision
would rest with ANN through the PIU, and dhe Bank including support from the
Environmental division in the Maghreb department. ANN would routinely
supervise the work of PIU and EKNP through field visits as well as on the
basis of periodic monitoring and evaluation reports prepared by both entities.
The interministerial committee would also be invited to join some
suptrvisions. It would meet twice a year to review project implementation and
to contribute in policy decision-making on outstanding issues.
3.   Within the Bank, MNlAG would coordinate all supervision work on the
project. The Bank would receive two semestral progress reports prepared by
PIU. The timing of supervision inputs may vary over the course of any one
year but normally two supervisions would be planned in March/April and in
September/October respectively. The first supervision would consist of a full
joint Bank-Government implementation mission whereas the second would review
the report for the first semester of that project year and the annual audit
report on the use of the grant. The mission would also be timed to coincide
with the review of the annual operating plan for the following year.
4.    Although indicative, the skill mix envisaged in the table below suggests
that the initial experts be employed to work with the Task Manager all of whom
were part of the preparation work. The rationale is driven by the
desirability of comparing progress or unanticipated changes against the
conceptual baseline at Project development.

5.   Two supervision missions have been planned for each year of the proposed
three year project implementation period. Each of the missions would have the
necessary flexibility to adapt to the conditions prevailing at the time. The
ccre team would consist of the Task Manager and the biodiversity specialist.
The latter would be gradually taken over by the environment specialist. The
initial mission would consist of a workshop aimed at explaining the project
concept and main components to the local authorities, the users, NGOs and the
personnel. A mid-term review has been planned that should allow to measure
progress and make adjustments whenever necessary. Supervision during the
three years would require a total 58.5 staff weeks with an average of 19.5
staff weeks per annum. The Division could expect some 18 staff weeks to be
eligible for Trust Fund support. This should leave a direct supervision
charge of some 40 weeks, which is in line with regular GEF supervision
coefficients on an annualized basis of about 12 staff weeks per year. A
Project Completion Report requiring some 14 weeks would be prepared in FY 98.
