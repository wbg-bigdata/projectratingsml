REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SECOND LOAN
TO THE EAST AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
WITH THE JOINT AND SEVERAL GUARANTEES OF
KENYA, TANZANIA AND UGANDA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
second loan to the East African Development Bank (EADB) tobe jointly and
severally guaranteed by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, for the equivalent of
$15 million to help finance the foreign exchange component of industrial
projects in the East African Community. The interest on the loan would be
8-1/2 percent per annum. Amortization will conform substantially to the
aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific invest-
ment projects financed out of the proceeds of the loan.
PART I. THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY
2.        Economic cooperation between all three Partner States began in
1923 when what is now Tanzania joined the cwstoms union initiated between
Kenya and Uganda in 1917. Closer integration was encouraged and developed
under the common British colonial administration. At the pre-independence
peak of communal relations the three territories had what amounted to a
common market (common external tariffs and free factor movement), as well
as a single currency, one taxation system and common services in communi-
cations and transportation.
3.        Following independence, more nationalistic viewpoints emerged
in all three countries. Perhaps inevitably, each of the countries began to
question the balance between the costs and benefits of their economic
relationship. Uganda and Tanzania were particularly concerned about
the growing economic strength of Kenya and what they felt were the dis-
proportionate advantageaof the relationship to Kenya. The location of all
the common services headquarters in Nairobi provided a symbol of the
inequity they felt was growing. hence, in the mid-60s the growth of
individual national identities brought about a reversal of the integration
process. Separate currencies and national banks were established.
Tanzania's imposition of import restrictions on Ugandan and Kenyan
goods initiated wide ranging trade restrictions.
4.        The Treaty for East African Cooperation.   Concerned about the
deterioration of the common market and common services, a Commission on
East African Cooperation was appointed in 1965 to review the existing
arrangements and suggest improvements. The resulting recommendations
formed the basis of the Treaty for East African Cooperation, which was
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



-2-
signed in June 1967.
5.        This treaty marked the beginning   of the East African Community
and provided for the continuation of the common market and common
services with a number of modifications.   The changes were primarily designed
to increase the benefits of cooperation to Tanzania and Uganda and to
promote a more balanced industrial growth between Kenya and the other
two members. The first of these objectives was to be achieved by the
reorganization, relocation and decentralization of the common services.
While the commercial services   (in transport and communications) continuad
on a regional basis in the form of community corporations, their head-
quarters were distributed between the Partner States. The second objective
was to be ensured through limited facilities for the imposition of
duties on intercountry l:rade (transfer taxes) and through the estab-
lisnment of the East African Development Bank (EADB). Its resources would
be invested in projects in such a way to favor Tanzania and Uganda and to
assist in the complementary development of the industrial sectors in the
Partner States. The reraaining services were decentralized as far as
possible and headquarters relocated among the three countries.
6.        Strains in the Community.    A period of adjustment and reorganiza-
tion followed the signiing of the Treaty, and during the late sixties
and early seventies there were promising signs that a viable community was
emerging. The community corporations were providing efficient services
to the Partner States: investment plans were prepared and being
implemented, corporate management was good and the levels of services
and revenues were expanding. However, in the past three years political
and economic developments have led to serious strains among the
Partner States and an accompanying deterioration in the trend torward
regional integration. On the national level the primary factor in this
deterioration has been the divergent development paths chosen by Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda.   In spite of  similar colonial histories, these
three countries are today operating under markedly different political
and economic systems. With the passage of time the ability of their
leaderships to join together and meaningfully address and solve community
problems has been reduced. The fact that the Authority of the Community
(composed of the 3 Heads of State ) has not met since 1971 symbolizes this
growing separation. Furthermore, these developments have been aggravated
by international economic developments and the resulting balance of payments
difficulties each country has faced.   During  times marked by economic
hardship the Community is an obvious and politically attractive target
for criticism by individual Partner States.
7.        Yet these developments should be viewed in a realistic
context. After the signiing of the Treaty there has been a tendency
to extol and emphasize its long run objective of regional integration.
As a result, observers have been discouraged with the emergence of
nationalism and the tendency to follow immediate national interests,
often at variance with the interests of the Community. It is now clear
that the Treaty is more appropriately viewed as an attempt to maintain



- 3 -
some vestige of an integrated market for goods and mutually beneficial
regional services in an era when the centrifugal political and economic
forces following independence could be expected to be growing stronger.
One should therefore judge the Community not in terms of deviations from
the grandiose language of the ideals embodied in the Treaty but in
terms of what each institution has managed to achieve in terms of
regional cooperation in what at times have been understandably nationalistic
environments.
8.        The increase in tensions between the Partner States has
led to a substantial loosening of economic ties. The effectiveness of
the common market has been diminished by restrictions on trade and
financial transfers. With respect to the four common service corpora-
tions (Harbours, Airways, Railways and Posts and Telecommunications) the
last three years have been marked by the re-emergence of the conviction
on tile part of individual states that they are being assessed more
than their share of the costs of regional services. Perhaps unavoidably,
the strains noted above have created an environment where the corporations
are open to direct intervention by individual Partner States in day-to-
day operations, investment planning and even hiring and firing. The
leadership of the headquarters corporate management has on occasion been
seriously undermined by instances of regional staff responding only to
directives from national governments. The common services organiza-
tions obviously cannot act as-unified corporations when instructions to
staff go   unanswered or when lower level national civil servants
interfere in important policy matters.
9.        While the actual levels of intervention and resulting operating
difficulties have varied widely in the three client corporations
of the Bank (Harbours, Postsand Telecommunications and Railways),
there can be no question that the present Railwayssituation reflects
the potential for serious difficulties withlinl the existing environmenit.
Having consistently suffered the most disruption, the East African
Railways almost came to a halt last year. At that time needed
reduction in headquarter's authority made coordination impossible:
supplies could not be purchased, staff could not be moved, operating
statistics were limited, workshops were not fully operational, and
wagons and locmotives were not in the regions where most needed. As
a result, operations and services deteriorated and there was a fall
in traffic carried. In Kenya, passenger service was suspended between
February and September 1975 while in Uganda the major export crop,
coffee, could not be moved to iMombasa for export. In addition, all
traffic was halted between Kenya and Tanzania. Of more long term
interest, no formal development plan has been accepted since the plan
cover4.ig 1969-72. The resulting lack of investment Planning and coor-
dination may seriously restrict recovery from the present situation.
10.       The particular issue which has provided a focus for the
dissatisfaction within the Community as presently organized has been
the transferring of funds from regional corporation offices to the



-4-
central headquarters.   The inability of regional offices to transfer
needed funds to hieadquarters or to agree on the appropriate size of
transfers of available funds has been the major cause of recent diffi-
culties in the Community. The failure to transfer funds
has in turn considerably delayed the repayment of external debt which
now threatens the credit standings of the corporations. It was these
delays that led in 1974 to the suspension of some Bank loans to the
corporations. An initial agreement on the transfer issue was reached
between the member governments with Bank assistance in July 1974.
However, as this agreement was never fully implemented, disbursements
under Loan No. 674-LA (East African Railways III) were suspended in
February 1975. A second attempt to resolve the immediate problems of
loan repayment and begin to establish a framework under which the long
range development of the Community could be achieved was undertaken by
a Bank mission in June/July 1975. After that mission's return, important
understandings were reached in both areas. On the general question of
the future of the EAC, a decision was made to review the entire EAC
package as now incorporated in the 1967 Treaty. For this purpose, a
commission has been appointed consisting of three Cabinet level
officials from each country with Mr. William Demas, President of the
Caribbean Development Bank, as Chairman. The Commission which started
its work in November 1975 is expected to submit its report by end-1976.
To address the im±mediate f:inancial and managerial problems that
remain pending the acceptance of a long range proposal, the Governments
of the Partner States reached three major accords. To deal with the
transfer problem, an arrangement was reached on the mechianism for the
transfer of funds from the regions to the corporation headquarters.
To ensure a workable plan for railway decentralization, a consulting
firm has been appointed to study reorganization of the railways (financed
under IBRD Loan 674-EA). Finally, the Governments approved the
appointment of consultants to examine the financial status of the
Bank's three client corporations. This is viewed as a necessary
step in providing a basis for the anticipated decentralization of the
corporations and is being financed by the United Kingdom. The above two
consultants studies, which are expected to be completed in the first
half of this year, would be available for the Treaty Review Commission's
consideration.
11.       Hopefully, this broad agreement between the Partner States
will provide a basis for the short term financial operations of the
Community Corporations. It should be noted that in substance, the
1975 accord is quite similar to that reached during the July 1974
meeting. The major change has been a growing political awareness at
the highest levels in each Partner State of the potential costs of
allowing a continuation of the past difficulties. The June/July 1975
mission emphasized to all three Heads of State the economic costs of
allowing a continued deterioration in the valuable community assets.
Both that missioII and more recent missions lhave noted consistent and
substantial commitments to policies and procedures which address
Community problems in a pragmatic manner. Indeed, the Partner States'



-5-
concern with the Railways situation and their firm desire to prevent
similar levels of deterioration in the other corporations should allow
for honest and positive assessments by the States of the organizational
and operational changes that need to be made to reestablish full support
in the corporations. With regard to the meeting of external obligations,
including debt repayments, the Partner States have managed to pull
together on recent occasions and make the payments, although often in a
belated manner. As a resultithe suspension of Loan 674-EA hias been
lifted and the remainder of the Loan will be used to finance consultant
services and emergency supplies for the Railways.
12.       It is now clear that the fundamental political and economic
forces in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda areseeking important modifications
in Community arrangements, particularly for the corporations. The issue
of national control and its relationship to the effective functioning of the
corporations is obviously critical. The extent of the decentraliza-
tion of corporation services to the national level will probably vary
depending on organization involved, but it is clear that some major
changes will be made. It is the Bank's intention to assist in the de-
centralization and reorganization process in order to ensure that
the changes endorsed by the Partner States are implemented through as
rational and efficient a process as possible. As an impartial but
interested development agency, the Bank has a role to play in assisting
the countries in maintaining a constructive dialogue between themselves,
as well as with the Bank, for a full understanding of the problems
of and the opportunities from regional integration of the economies
and services. In order to oversee Bank assistance during the present
critical stage of the Community's development, a senior staff member has
recently been appointed the East African Community Coordinator in the Bank.
A task force of Projects and Legal staff has also been constituted' to
assist the Coordinator in this important work. The Bank, through the
Coordinator, is keeping in close touch with Community developments,
including the progress of the Review Commission's work, and is
maintaining liaison with other external donors.
13.       In contrast to the problems encountered by the Corporations, the
East African Development Bank has weathered minor and major crises with
consistent resilience. One reason for this is the very nature of EADB's
operations: as the repayment schedules of EADB's loans are individualized
by country, there is no room to debate the sharing of benefits and costs.
Secondly, EADB is a source of much needed foreign exchange for the Partner
States and as an institution is highly regarded by the Partner States who
have relied on it for technical advice. All three Partner States
expressed firm commitments to EADB. Finally, if BADB is judged in
terms of its contribution to regional cooperation in the context of the
difficulties that have been present, its numerous accomplishments should
be recognized. While it has not been able to finance region-wide proposals,
it has promoted a more rational pattern of industrial investment in the
region. For example, as a result of its involvement in a
tire plant in Tanzania it was able to persuade the Ugandans not to undertake



a similar investment at that time but tc buy from the Tanzanian factory.
EADB negotiated with both governments and through its good offices an agree-
ment under which Uganda could purchase a 25% equity holding in the tire plant
emerged.  In another case, concerning a proposed Kenya textile investment,
EADB's research department determined that in light of similar expansion
plans in Tanzania and Uganda, market possibilities anticipated by the Kenya
company were unrealistic. EADB was subsequently able to persuade its Kenya
client to reduce its proposed mill capacity by about a third. EADB has also
promoted regional integration by promoting a number of projects in Kenya and
Tanzania which utilize raw materials from other Partner States. Examples
include a textile mill in Kenya using cotton from Uganda and Tanzania and a
Tanzanian soap factory using caustic soda from Kenya. Although it is not
inconceivable that national banks could have performed these functions,
EADB's unique position as an independent community body has undoubtedly
resulted in greater regional integrrtion than might otherwise be the case.
14.       At the end of 1974, the total outstanding disbursed debt of all
the Community organizations was about $250 million. The creditworthiness
of the East African Community is based on the creditworthiness of each of
the three Partner States, which jointly and severally guarantee all external
Community debts. Kenya has, since independence, continued to follow a con-
servative policy with respect: to external borrowing. In the early 1970's
it had accumulated new commitments at a rate of approximately 8.5% per year,
somewhat less than the rate of growth of the economy in current prices.
While recently new commitments have grown somewhat more rapidly in current
prices, Kenya's total debt service ratio is low, about 6% even when a notional
one third of the East African Community is included, and is expected to rise
to 12.5% by 1975. Therefore Kenya can 'afford to resort to borrowing on
commercial terms without impairing long term creditworthiness. Tanzania has
received substantial external capital aid on very favorable terms. The
Government has also been successful in reducing the amount of tied aid and
in keeping supplier credits to a minimum. The overall debt service ratio
(including the notional one third of Community debt) is about 6% and is
expected to increase to 13% by 1985.   In view of this lowVJ ratio, reflecting
the Government's prudent debt: management, there is scope for additional
lending for Tanzania on conventional Bank terms. Otn the basis of reported
debt in 1974 Uganda's debt service ratio was approximately 8% (with the allo-
cation of one third of the Community debt) excluding supplier credits on
which data are not available. If the entire debt of the Com-
munity is allocated to each Partner State individually the resulting debt
service ratios are 6.4% in Kenya,8.6% in Tanzania and 11.5% in Uganda.



PART II. BANK GROUP LENDING TO THE COMM4UNITY
15.       Starting in 1955 with a loan to the East African High Commission
for the development of East African Railways, the Bank has to date made
a total of nine loans to three common services corporations (Railways,
liarbours and Postsand Telecommunications) and to EADB totaling $230
million. In addition, the Bank Group has extended loans and credits
to the three Partner States for projects across the entire spectrum
of Bank lending sectors. Summary statements of Bank loans/IDA credits
to the EAC common services organizations and comments on the progress
made in execution of projects are in Annex II.    Summary statements of
Bank loans and IDA credits to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are also provided
in Annex II.
16.       While the exact form of the reorganized Community services
remains to be determined, the development of the transport and commu-
nications infrastructures to facilitate national programs of the Partner
States would continue to be an important aspect of the
development of the three countries.    We anticipate a continuing role in
investment in the sectors where we have previously lent in the EAC.
Following the July 1975 agreement, field appraisal of a fourth Posts and
Telecommunications Project has been completed and a Railways project and a
Harbours project will be ready for appraisal later this calendar year.
In each instance the organizational and guarantee questions will be
resolved before conclusion of lending arrangements.
PART III. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
17.       East Africa is still in the early stages of industrialization.
The economies of all three States remain overwhelmingly agrarian -- manu-
facturing accounts for only slightly greater than 10% of the Community's
total GDP. Yet the industrial sector had been a center of impressive
growth in Tanzania and Kenya before the bil crisis and related economic
changes from 1973-74. In Uganda, the expulsion of non-citizens has been
the overriding factor in the industrial sector and has had serious negative
effects on economic growth.



-8-
18.       Until recently, the primary focus of industrialization in all
three countries had been on import substitution. Import controls and
specific duties and tariffs have been used to protect local infant indus-
tries. As import licensing is wholly under national authorities (unlike
tariffs), it has been increasingly resorted to. While the limited informa-
tion on Uganda makes it difficult to discuss its future strategy, it is
clear that Kenya and Tanzania appear to be moving away from traditional
import substitution strategies. This reflects both the reduced possibilities
for further import substitution and a recognition of the balance of trade
constraints that both countries will face in the near future. To address
these constraints, both countries are emphasizing the importance of increasing
industrial exports. The Bank is assisting this effort, particularly throuRh
its economic work and DFC projects.
19.       The transfer tax system introduced in the 1967 Treaty for East
African Cooperation has not resulted in substantial progress toward its
intended goal of reducing the gap in the levels of industrial development
between the three countries although it might possibly have helped in
preventing a deterioration. About half of the manufacturing sector's value
added in 1972 originated in Kenya, 30% in Tanzania and marginally above
20% in Uganda. While Tanzania's share remained constant between 1968 and
1972, Uganda's share has declined, with Kenya's increasing accordingly.
20.       Attempts to form regional industries to take advantage of economies
of scale and efforts to allot certain industries to specific countries have
not to date been successful. However, as indicated in paragraph 13 above,
in its operations EADB has attempted to ensure that investment proposals do
not involve duplication of capacity within the Community. In addition, EADB
has encouraged the use of raw materials from the Partner States when feasible.
Of the nine projects being financed under the first Bank loan to EADB, three
utilize raw materials from other Partner States and three others have a
sufficient production capacity to service more than one Partner State
market.
21.       A major proportion of trade between the member states is in
manufacturing -- about 80% of total intra-community trade. There is little
doubt that the industrial sector in Kenya has benefitted substantially from
its access to Ugandan and Tanzanian markets. In 1974, 45% of Kenya's total
industrial exports were to the EAC while in the case of Tanzania the per-
centage is only 22%, partly reflecting the rapid decline in exports to Uganda
since the military takeover in 1971   Therefore, while the   countries' present re-
lationships are strained, trade between them in manufactured goods is important
to their economies and is likely, therefore, to be of significance in deter-
mining the future basis on w'hich cooperation can be easily and profitably
re-established.



-9-
22.       A brief discussion of the industrial sector in each member State
follows:
23.       Kenya.  In Kenya, the Government has made substantial progress in
its drive for Kenyanization of employment and ownership, particularly in
trade and agriculture. However, in manufacturing it has encouraged the
participation of non-citizens as well as Kenyans and has emphasized the
value of joint ventures with foreign investors. Private ownership is the
basic organizational form in the industrial sector, but where private ini-
tiative is not forthcoming, the Kenyan Government has expressed the willing-
ness to take a minority or majority interest in new investments.
24.       Growth of manufacturing output averaged 8.8% per year from 1964-73
in Kenya. Its contribution to GDP increased from 10.4% to 12% over that
period and recently the manufacturing sector has displaced agriculture as
the largest contributor to GDP within the monetary economy. Employment in
the industrial sector grew at a rate 50% higher than all modern sector
employment and in 1973 represented approximately 13% of total wage employment.
To enable industry to make an even greater contribution to alleviating the
growing unemployment problem, the Government is encouraging labor intensive
industry through price and wage policies and a small- sale business devel-
opment program.
25.       The Kenyan economy was hard hit by   jiie recent inflation and the rapid
rise in import prices with the resulting shortages in foreign exchange.
The industrial sector therefore faces a particularly difficult adjustment
period, since it is almost wholly dependent upon imported capital equipment
and spare parts. The Government's reaction has been to attempt to shift
the emphasis of industrialization toward domestic resource hased manufacturing
and exports. Foreign exchange and credit guidelines have been established
by the government to support its strategies, and a 10% export subsidy has
been introduced on exports outside the EAC. In addition, the recent devaluation
should provide a strong incentive for export expansion. The Bank is now dis-
cussing some major industrial policy issues, including promotion of small-
scale business. A preparation mission for a small-scale business project is
scheduled for spring 1977.
26.       Tanzania.  Since the Arusha Declaration in 1967, Tanzania has
moved toward a centrally planned economy. The Government has acquired a
majority interest in nearly all manufacturing enterprises and financial
institutions. Almost all major projects initiated after 1967 have been



- 10 -
public sector projects, sometimes on the basis of joint ventures with
foreign companies. Public sector institutions have assumed direct respon-
sibility for most external and domestic wholesale trade, while retail trade
is still predominantly in the private sector. In managing the economy,
increasing emphasis has been placed on central planning and direct economic
controls whilst the role of the market has been de-emphasized. During
1964-73, manufacturing had been the most rapidly growing sector in Tanzania.
The real rate of growth in this sector was 9.5% and its contributinn to GDP
increased from 8% to 10%. Total employment in firms of over ten employees
more than doubled between 1965 and 1972 and by 1973, 15% of Tanzania's wage
earners were employed in manufacturing.
27.       However, it appears that the growth rate of manufacturing output
slowed down in the later years of the 1964-73 period. This was primarily
the result of operational problems (to some extent inevitable, given the
major structural change in the economy) and a number of poor investments.
The resulting difficulties were compounded by external economic developments
in 1973 and 1974. While export prices of Tanzania's major crops fell, the
import price rise and increasing costs of capital and other imports aggravated
the deterioration in Tanzania's terms of trade. In addition, two years
of crop failures in Tanzania necessitated massive food imports at a time
when grain prices were at record highs.
28.       While Tanzania will continue to face economic difficulties over
the next few years, massive food imports have ceased thereby reducing some-
what the foreign exchange shortage. Looking to the future the Government
now regards the industrial sector as a major focus of attention and potential
source of growth. The Government has adopted a basic industry strategy
emphasizing industries that utilize domestic natural resources for the
home market and exports. Recognizing the severe resource constraint, it has
adopted a pragmatic attitude toward addressing the operational problems and
is carefully reviewing the economic potential of proposed investments.
These new policies should foster growth in the sector and the Bank is anti-
cipating major involvement in a number of industrial proposals now being
prepared by the Government and consultants.
29.       Uganda.  During the 60's, industrial output in Uganda grew at
an average annual rate of 6.5%.   In 1970-71, the entire economy stagnated
as a result of adverse weather conditions which affected the major cash
crops and corresponding processing industries. The period 1972-75 has been
dominated by the expulsion of non-citizens and the take-over of the indus-
trial sector by Ugandan nationals. Operating problems caused by inadequately
trained management have been compounded by a lack of foreign exchange for
raw materials and spare parts.



30.       Recent decisions indicate Government recognition of these prob-
lems. Firstly, eight Government enterprises have been established in
important industrial sectors to identify problems and propose solutions.
Particular attention has been focused on the sugar and textile industries,
traditionally major export earners in Uganda. Secondly, the Government
has recruited foreign staff (primarily from Pakistan and India) to occupy
key advisory positions in both public enterprises and those allocated to
Uganda nationals. In addition, the Government has decided to make regular
allocations of foreign exchange for the raw materials and spare parts
needed by priority industries.
31.       Available information indicates that although foreign exchange
reserves remain low, the severe controls imposed by Government have been
successful in restricting the outflow of foreign exchange. Assuming that
the Ugandan Government continues its effort to review systematically the
problems facing each industry there is substantial potential for expansion
in the industrial sector from its presently depressed level. Nevertheless,
as these measures have only been taken recently, it will take time for the
sector to show real signs of recovery.
PART IV. THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "East African Community - Appraisal of the
East African Development Bank" (No. 866-EA, dated January 15, 1976) is
being circulated to the Executive Directors separately. A Loan and Project
Summary is included in Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington on
November 3-7, 1975. EADB was represented by Mr. I. Simba, Director General;
Kenya was represented by Mr. C. Mbindyo, Ministry of Finance; Tanzania was
represented by Mr. R. Mariki, Ministry of Finance; and Uganda was represented
by Mr. Odong, Ministry of Finance.
History and Objectives of EADB
33.       EADB is one of the institutions of the East African Community.
It was created in 1967 under the Treaty for East African Cooperation signed
by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, and began operations in July 1968. Each
Partner State currently holds 30.8% of EADB's equity, the balance being held
by various foreign banks. The Bank has been in dialogue with EADB since
its inception; in June 1972 the Bank approved a first loan of US$8 million
which is now fully committed. The projectmfinanced under that loan have
attrartive economic rates of return and are expected to make substantial
contributions to the industrial development of the Community. The initial loan to
EADB was the first made by the Bank to a development finance company in the
East African Community.
34.       EADB's Charter identified its main objectives as providing financial
and technical assistance to promote industrial development in the Partner States
in such a way as to correct the imbalance in industrial development between the



- 12 -
Partner States and to undertake investments which would make the economies of
the three States increasingly complementary in the industrial sector. EADB also
has a Statement of Operating Policies which is designed to safeguard EADB's
financial viability; the provisions are both reasonable and prudent.
Board of Directors
35.       All three Partner States are represented on the Board, which is
EADB's highest authority on operational matters. The Board takes an active
interest in all EADB's operations and meets regularly. Unlike other dom-
munity organizations, EADB is not responsible to any of the Community councils
or ministers but to the Authority of the Community (i.e. the three Heads of
State). Major decisions such as amendments to the Charter therefore require
the approval of the Authority.
Management and Organization
36.       EADB's chief executive and only Director General since inception
is Mr. Iddi Simba, a Tanzanian. He has provided exceptional leadership and
has developed a very competent senior management team and staff. Nearly all
the professional staff, which now number 36, are from East Africa.
37.       The Director General, the Directors of Operations, Finance and
Administration, and Research and Project Promotion plus the major support
functions are located at the headquarters in Kampala. Following the poli-
tical changes in Uganda in 1973 EADB's operations were reorganized on a
decentralized basis. Regional offices headed by Regional Managers were formed
in Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and Kampala with complete appraisal and supervision
teams. By early 1974, the regional offices were fully operational and the
volume of loan approvals has steadily increased as the regional appraisal
teams have become familiar with standardized appraisal procedures. The speed
and efficiency with which the reorganization was implemented is a clear indi-
cation of EADB's management capability.
Operations
38.       Since its establishment, EADB has approved $40.7 million (Shs 328
million) in loans. Two thirds of these loans have been for foreign exchange
costs and the remainder for local costs. In both value and number, 75% of
EADB's 52 loans have been to manufacturing projects and 21% to processing
projects. This lending has encompassed a wide variety of industrial subsectors;
textiles, iron and steel, wood industries, plastics and rubber, cement, salt
and sugar. Following the reduction in operations during its reorganization
(para. 37) EADB has rapidly expanded its financing activity. Between early
1974 and March 1975, 28% of EADB's total number of loans were approved. In
the future this growth is expected to be maintained and expanded.
39.       To correct the imbalance in industrial development between the
Partner States, the Charter included an investment formula which stipulated
that 38.75% of EADB's investments should be made in Uganda and Tanzania and
only 22.5% in Kenya. Although on the basis of loan approvals EADB has been
reasonably successful in complying with this formula, actual disbursements



- 13 -
have lagged substantially in Uganda which accounted for only 24% of EADB's
disbursements as of March 31, 1975. This was primarily the result of the
deferment and indefinite postponement of some previously approved projects due
to lack of management and skilled manpower following the departure of the non-
citizens in 1973, and shortages of foreign exchange for raw materials and spare
parts.
40.       EADB has played a significant role in trying to achieve the complementary
development of the Partner States' industrial sectors. EADB has financed many
projects designed to service the market of more than one Partner State or make
use of more than one Community source of raw materials. By having operations in
all three Partner States, EADB has been able to provide valuable intelligence on
Community industrial sector developments and influence the design and size of
many projects in order to prevent duplication of productive capacity. Further-
more, EADB has cooperated extensively with the other development banks in East
Africa. In the many jointly financed projects undertaken, the experience and
expertise of EADB's appraisal staff has been of assistance to the newer national
institutions. EADB's single project investment capability remains larger than
that of the national development banks although the margin continues to be eroded
as the national banks grow. Because of EADB's multinational ownership, the findings
of the analyses and studies undertaken by EADB has been considered independent
of national bias by member governments. EADB has the staff and resources to
independently undertake studies on behalf of Government or private clients.
41.       Although some of these functions could   have been performed by the
national banks, EADB has been in a unique position as a respected and inde-
pendent community body to play an important role in the development of the
Community's industrial sector through its financing of economically and
financially attractive projects.
Lending Terms
42.       EADB currently charges an interest rate of 10% per annum on all new
loans, with a commitment fee of 1% and a one time service charge of 1% on the
total loan amount. The maximum maturity of the loan is 15 years. EADB is
currently seeking the approval of its board to raise its onlending rate to 11%
in a first phase and 12% later on if circumstances warrant it, although it is
expected that the increase will be resisted by some member governments. Under
the proposed loan, the foreign exchange risk will be borne by EADB's sub-
borrowers.
Portfolio
43.       As of March 31, 1975, EADB had loans outstanding totalling Shs 156
million and equity investments totalling Shs 7 million. At the same date,
approximately 41% of the loan portfolio outstanding (Shs 64 million) was
affected by arrears of over three months. In Uganda, the arrears-affected
portfolio amounted to Shs 23 million from six projects. Four of these projects
were taken over by Ugandan nationals in 1973 following the departure of non-
citizens. An understanding has recently been reached between the Ugandan
Government and EADB for the repayment of monies outstanding on projects taken
over by Ugandan nationals. The monies are to be repaid in three installments
through mid-1976; the first installment amounting to Shs 3.6 million was paid
in October 1975. Another project in arrears is no longer operational but this
loan is guaranteed by the Ugandan Government and is being discussed between



- 14 -
EADB and the Government. The remaining Uganda project, Uganda Cement Indus-
tries, is currently in financial difficulties.
44.        In Tanzania, the arrears-affected portfolio amounts to Shs 34 million
from four projects. EADB undertook major supervisory missions to these projects
in 1974 and made proposals for their recovery. In only one case (Nyanza
Salt Mines, Shs 14 million) has little progress been made and EADB agreed to
make suitable provisions for this project by the end of the year if adequate
progress is not made. In Kenya, the arrears-affected portfolio amounts to
Shs 7 million from three projects, all of which are expected to recover from
their current operating problems.
Audit
45.       Following the departure of EADB's original auditors from Kampala,
the 1974 audit did not fully comply with the Bank's requirements. This
matter was reviewed during negotiations and the Bank has agreed to the reappoint-
ment of the present auditors for a further year subject to their fully complying
with Bank auditing requirements.
Financial Condition
46.        EADB's financial condition is basically sound due to the large
equity base of the bank (Shs 158 million as of December 31, 1974). The
net loan portfolio at the same date was Shs 146 million of which only
Shs 52 million has been funded from term liabilities. EADB's debt/equity
ratio is therefore low at.3:1 and the bank has a large debt capacity avail-
able to fund future investments. The debt/equity limit is 4:1. Although
current provisions at Shs 5.6 million may not adequately reflect the state
of the portfolio, fully providing for the two major Ugandan and Tanzanian
projects in arrears would not significantly impair the enuity bse or financial
condition of EADB. Net profit as a percent of average net worth increased
to 4.4% in 1974 despite rising administrative expenses incurred in 1973/74
following the decentralization of the organization.
Prospects
47.       EADB's project pipeline at March 31, 1975 includes sixteen pro-
jects accepted for appraisal, involving a potential EADB investment of some
Shs 170 million; many of these projects are of a regional nature. Further
project proposals involving an EADB investment of Shs 100 million have been
received but not yet accepted for appraisal. The pipeline under appraisal
includes four Ugandan projects involving a potential EADB investment of
Shs 50 million. The differential formula is unlikely to inhibit
EADB's investment operations. EADB considers that the steps recently taken
by the Ugandan Government to rehabilitate the industrial sector (forming
parastatal institutions in priority industries, recruiting foreign technical
advisors and allocating foreign exchange for the import of raw materials and
spare parts) are likely to result in EADB being able to identify bankable
projects meeting EADB's normal investment criteria prior to the 1978 review,
thereby allowing it to comply with the formula. In any case, the differential
formula may be reconsidered in the forthcoming Treaty review. EADB intends
to disburse funds on new projects in Uganda following receipt of the repay-
ments discussed in para. 43. EADB does not foresee problems
in continuing to invest in the industrial sectors of Tanzania and Kenya.



- 15 -
48.       EADB will continue to fill its Community role in the future
(para. 40) and in particular is cutrently attempting to identify and promote
projects in the agricultural processing sector in which investments might
be made in all three Partner States. Three main projects are under con-
sideration -- a Lake Victoria fisheries complex, a beef ranching complex
and a fruit and vegetables complex.
Resource Requirements
49.       As of March 31, 1975, EADB's forecast resource requirements to meet
projected commitments to December 31, 1977 amounted to Shs 47 million in
local currency and Shs 230 million in foreign exchange. Local currency
requirements will be met through net cash generation -and repayments to EADB
from previous local currency financings. In June 1975, EADB signed an agree-
ment with the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) for a second
loan of Shs 60 million to be committed over a three-year period which will
cover approximately 26% of the foreign exchange requirements to December 31,
1977. For the remaining foreign exchange gap, discussions with other lenders
have been initiated but are unlikely to result in loans to EADB until mid-/late
1976. Therefore, a Bank loan of $15 million is proposed to cover approximately
50% of EADB's foreign exchange needs and 40% of EADB's total resource require-
ments to December 31, 1977.
Terms of the Bank Loan
50.       The proposed Bank loan would be on terms similar to those for
other development finance companies. It will be repayable in accordance
with the aggregate of the amortization schedules for sub-loans and invest-
ments financed by EADB out of the proceeds of the proposed loan.
51.       Prior Bank approval would be necessary for each sub-project re-
quiring Bank funds in excess of $650,000 and the aggregate free limit would
be a $5.0 million. This should allow the Bank to review about 40% of the
projects by number and at least 65% by value of the financing to be provided.
The proposed loan would be restricted to financing the cost of imported
goods and services needed for EADB-approved investments.
PART V. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the East African
Development Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreements between the Republic of
Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania, the Republic of Uganda, respectively,
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.



- 16 -
53.       The legal structure of the loan documents follows the similar
pattern used for all the Bank's loans for projects in the East African
Community. As in past loans, a number of modifications have been made in
the Bank's General Conditions to adapt them for the three guarantors (see
Schedule 2 to the draft Loan Agreement). The draft Loan Agreement contains
provisions normally used for development finance company projects. The
draft Guarantee Agreements are substantially similar to each other and
Section 2.01 of each of these Agreements provides for the joint and several
guarantee of the three guarantors.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI. RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

E.   EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY
Loan No. 674-EA - Third Railways Project: $42.4 million Loan of May 25,
1970: Date of Effectiveness: October 30, 1970; Closing Date - June 30,
1976
The physical execution of the original project has been
seriously delayed due to administrative and political problems within
the Community and the East African Railways Corporation's unsatisfactory
procedures for procurement, investment planning and coordination. In
November 1974, the Executive Directors approved a reallocation of the
uncommitted balance of the Loan to be used for consultant services and
emergency investments. Following a series of difficulties (including
the suspension of this Loan) agre-ments were reached in July 1975 between
the Partner States, the Bank an, LARC on how to meet EARC's external
obligations. Agreement was also reached for the hiring of consultants
to assist EARC with outstanding organizational and financial issues.
Coopers and Lybrand (financial consultants hired by ODM) expect to complete
their asset studies in early 1976 and CANAC (technical consultants)
are expected to commence the decentralization study shortly. A letter
amending the Loan Agreement has been signed and it is expected that the
project can now be concluded.
Loan No. 638-EA - Second Harbours Project: $35.0 million Loan of
August 25, 1969: Date of Effectiveness: December 16, 1969; Closing
Date - December 31, 1976
Loan No. 865-EA - Third Harbours Project: $26.5 million Loan of
December 18, 1972: Date of Effectiveness: April 16, 1973; Closing
Date - June 30, 1976
Considerable delays have occurred in implementing the project
financed partly by Loan 638-EA. However, construction is now more than
95 percent complete. The Closing Date has been postponed from December 31,
1975 to December 31, 1976. The major civil works financed partly by
Loan 865-EA were completed in September 1975, six months behind schedule.
Some smaller project elements intended to be financed under Loan 865-EA,
will have to be deleted. Serious cost overruns for cargo handling
equipment, tugs and lighters financed by CIDA have occurred, and its
credit has been increased accordingly from Can.$ 26.0 million to
Can.$ 33.5 million. Port labor productivity has stagnated in Mombasa
and declined in Dar es Salaam. At the same time cargo throughput has
declined considerably for Mombasa and increased above forecasts for
Dar es Salaam, where the three berths financed under Loan 865-EA are now
being used, although transit sheds and open storage areas for them have
not yet been completed.

Loan No. 843-EA - East African Development Bank Project: $8.0 million
Loan of June 28, 1972: Date of Effectiveness: September 28, 1972;
Closing Date - May 31, 1976
Operations of the Bank have been decentralized and the newly
formed regional office teams are now competent in dealing with all
aspects of development financing operations. The entire first loan
has now been committed by EADB.
Loan No. 675-EA - Second Telecommunications Project: $10.4 million Loan
of May 25, 1970; Date of Effectiveness: November 9, 1970; Closing Date -
December 31, 1975
This project has been completed, but the Closing Date of the
Loan was extended from June 30, 1975 to December 31, 1975 to enable
final payments from the Loan Account. Except for a very small amount,
the project account has been drawn down as of December 31, 1975.
Loan No. 914-EA - Third Telecommunications Project: $32.5 million Loan
of June 22, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: September 19, 1973; Closing
Date - December 31, 1976
Problems within the EAC have only marginally affected the
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation due to the considerable
existing decentralization of operating authority. Deterioration of the
corporate cash position and rate of return has been slight in comparison
to other Community Corporations and the situation has improved by a
rate increase allowed by the Community in February 1975. All major items
have been completed by mid-1975, except two microwave links which,
due to a long lead time for delivery, will be delayed by 12 months.
