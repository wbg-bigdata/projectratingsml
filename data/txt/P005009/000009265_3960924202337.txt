PREFACE
These are the Project Completion Reports (PCRs) for the Second and
Third Telecommunicatinns Projects in Egypt, tir which Credit 774-EGT of US$53
million and Loan 2041-EGT of US$64 million were approved in March 1978 and
July 1981, respectively. The credit was closed in June 1984, 30 months behind
schedule and the loan in June 1988, i.e. 18 months later than agreed at the
negotiations.
Parts I and III were prepared by Industry and Energy Division of the
Europe Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, based on information
provided by the Beneficiary, whose comments on the Bank Group's evaluation are
set forth as Part II of the present report.
Preparation of the PCRs was started during the Bank's final super-
vision mission of the third project in November 1988.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
SECOND AIND THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS
(CREDIT 774-EGT AND LOAN 2041-EGT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        In March 1978, IDA made a credit of US$53 million to the Government
of Egypt for the second Bank Group telecommunications project in the country.
The Government-owned Arab Republic of Egypt Telecommunications Organization
(ARENTO) was the beneficiary and, under the associated project, carried out
the most urgent works of its 1978-1980 development program. In July 1981, the
Bank approved a loan of US$64 million to ARENTO for the third telecommunica-
tions project, which covered a substantial part of the utility's 1982-85
investment program. The physical components of both projects included equip-
ment for exchanges, manual telephone systems, coaxial cables, etc. The second
project concentrated on improving service in the main cities, whereas the
follow-on project addressed more the service deficiencies in smaller agglome-
rations and in rural areas. The earlier project helped introduce electronic
switching technology, the use of which was subsequently vastly expanded in the
context of projects largely financed by other entities, in particular USAID
and a European consortium.
Objectives
2.        The main project objectives were:
-    For the second project: To support the most urgent rehabilitation
and expansion of telecommunications services in Cairo and other
major areas and to consolidate ARENTO as an institution. (PCR Second
Project, para. 3.01).
-    For the third project: To sapport rehabilitation and expansion of
service in areas outside the main cities, and to assist ARENTO,
under its new institutional charter, to develop into an efficient
utility. (PCR Third Project, para. 3.01)
Implementation Experience
3.        The two projects were completed three and two years late, respec-
tively. The reasons were:
-    For the second project: Delays in procurement, mainly related to
changes in the items to be financed from the IDA credit.



iii
-    For the third project: (i) ARENTO's implementation capability was
overtaxed, (ii) ARENTO gave low priority to Bank project, which
concentrated on areas outside the main centers, (iii) delays in
preparatory work for microwave links, (iv) late formation of project
implementation unit, and (v) protracted discussions of management
proposal to revise projec,t scope.
4.        The costs of the two projects amounted to US$261 million and US$169
million against US$210 million and US$141 million, respectively, estimated at
appraisal.  In the second project, the increase is mainly due to the higher
than expected local inflation compounded by the delays in implementation. In
the third project, it is mostly related to the increase in project scope. (PCR
Second Project, paras. 5 51 to 5.06 and PCR Third Project paras. 5.01 to
5.07).
Results
5.        The second project achieved, albeit later than forecast, its physi-
cal and institutional objectives. In partictlar, it introduced modern tech-
nology and establJshed ARENTO under a new charter providing it m-ore financial
and administrative autonomy. The third p:oject was also successful in improv-
ing access to, and quality of telecommunications services. It also contribu-
ted to strengthening ARENTO's management and organization. (PCR Second Pro-
ject, paras. 6.01, 6.02, 6.05, 9.01, 10.01, 11.01, and 12.01; PCR Third
Project paras. 6.01 to 6.06).
6.        ARENTO's financial performance was poor until the utility's re-
organization in 1981. From then on, financial returns on net fixed assets in
operation averaged some 26Z until 1987, which was about as expected at ap-
praisal. The improvement was due to tariff increases and to increased ef-
ficiency (in particular a reduction in the staffing ratios). In 1987, ARENTO
earned only a 92 return, i.e. less than the covenanted 10X. The return for
1988 is estimated at some 11Z, with further improvement expected in 1989. In
recent years, ARENTO was able to generate internally betweeu 35 and 40X of the
investment requirements. However, it did not succeed in obtaining settlement
of Government receivables within reasonable time. Indeed these decreased
only from some 20 months' billing in 1987 to 15 months' billings in 1988. (PCR
Second Project, paras.6.02 to 6.05 and PCR Third Project, paras. 6.03 to
6.05).
Sustainability
7.        ARENTO, in its new setup, is technically and commercially reasonably
efficient, and Government, though failing to pay up its arrears, has shown
willingness to support the sector in approving politically unpopular tariff
adjustments. Therefore, it would seem that, all in all, sustainability of
project benefits is assured.(PCR Second Project, para. 7.01, and PCR Third
Project, paras. 7.01 to 7.03).



iv
Findings and Lessons
8.        Through the two projects, the Bank Group was able to make a substan-
tial contribution to sector development. In the context of the second project
close cooperation with USAID, it helped set the bases for a coherent develop-
ment of telecommunications services. It also contributed to setting up a
reasonably autonomous telecommunications utility. (PCR, Second Project, para.
8.01). Through the third project, the Bank made a major impact on telecom-
munications services in the minor population centers and in rural areas. (PCR,
Third Project, para. 6.06).
9.        The Second Project suggests that the Bank Group over-evaluated
ARENTO's capacity to carry out the large amount of detailed engineering,
procurement, and installation associated with the project and should have
insisted that the utility hire appropriate consultants to assist it in these
tasks. Further, the PCR concludes that a special project implementation unit
and advance procurement action would have helped reduce the delays. (PCR
Second Project, para. 8.02).

Country            : Egypt
Sector             : Telecommunications
2. Background
2.01     Public Telecommunications facilities in Egypt are state owned.
The Arab Republic of Egypt National Telecommunications Organization
(ARENTO) under the Ministry of Communications, is responsible fir the
operation, management and development of all public telecommunications
services in the country. Supported by the Bank and other donors, ARENTO
was established in July 1980 under a new charter with a greater degree of
fiscal and administrative autonomy than the earlier Arab Republic of Egypt
Telecommunications Organization (ARETO).
2.02     IDV's involvement in the sector started with a credit of US$30
million for the First Telecommunications Project in 1975 to help finance
ARETO's 1975-77 program aimed mainly at rehabilitation of existing
telephone networks and improvement of service to existing subscribers.
Through the first rroject, IDA also initiated some basic institutional
reforms in ARETO's organization in planning, accounting and financial
areas.
2.03     The Government of Egypt recognizing the importance of
telecommunications services to the economic and social development had
given high priority to the development of the sector. In line with this,
the government's sector development objectives were to increase the access
for telecommunications service to meet the high demand and to develop a
sound financial basis and policies for ARETO to maintain sustained growth
to provide satisfactory service at economic prices. The short term
objectives for the sector during the 1978-80 period were to:
(a)  improve the access to, and quality of, telecommunications
services particularly in Cairo and meeting priority demand in
the country;
(b) improve the long distance and international telephone services;
and
(c) consolidate the steps initiated under the first project for
organizational improvement.



-2-
3. Prolect Objectives and Description
3.01       Project Objectives:  In line with government's sector
objectives, the objectives of the project were to support the urgent
rehabilitation and expansion of telecoLmunications services in Cairo and
other major urban areas: and consolidate steps for institution building.
3.02       Project Descriptions:  The project consisted of the most urgent
works under hRETO's development program for the period 1978-1980. The
project supported the institutional building efforts financed under USAID.
It provided for the following installations:
(a)  about 102,400 lines of main automatic telenhone exchange equipment
in Cairo, 78,000 lines in other principal cities, 25,000 lines in
small towns, and 15,000 lines in suburban Cairo;
(b)  about 6,000 lines of manual telephone systems in the rural areas;
(c) about 35,000 lines of PABXs;
(d) local and junction cable networks for about 75,000 subscriber
connections with accessories and cable laying equipment;
(e) a coaxial cable from Damiette to Mansura;
(f) automatic trunk exchanges of 5,000 lines additional capacity; and
(g) a 3,000 lines telex exchange at Cairo and 2,000 tele-printers.
4. Project Design
4.01     The original pjroject concept and design was to support the most
urgent works in the 1978-80 development program of ARETO and institutional
development program. Provision was made in the project design to introduce
modern electronic switching systems with two main exchanges at Kubba and
Maadi. Subsequently, to facilitate standardization, the Kubba and Maadi
exchanges were covered by financing from USAID and European consortium as
part of a much larger program of replacement and expansion in the Cairo,
Alexandria and Lower Egypt areas. IDA funds were then reallocated to
finance 13 mobile electronic exchanges with a capacity of 26,000 lines in
the towns in Lower and Upper Egypt and the equipped capacity of the Cairo
telex exchange was increased from 3,000 to 4,500 lines to integrate the
national telex service from Cairo. These changes were justified due to the
changing needs and resources made available through cofinancing.
5. Project Implementation
5.01     Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up:  Credit 774-EGT was
s-gned on March 21, 1978. The agreement specified July 19, 1978 as the
terminal date for effectiveness of the credit. However due to delay in



- 3 -
increasing tariffs, a condition for credit effectiveness, the credit became
effec ive on September 19, 1978.
5.02     Implementation Schedule:  The project, originally scheduled to be
completed by December 31, 1981, was completed in December. 1984 about three
years behind schedule. This was mainly due to delays in procurement due to
changes made to items to be financed by IDA (para 4.01). The initial
procurement inviting bids for the Bank financed items covering network
material, PABXs and telex equipment and manual exchan3es was started only
in mid 1980 and the awards were made during 1981 and 1982. Installation
and commissioning took place in 1983 and 1984.
5.03      Although there were delays in procurement, the procurement
process went generally well except for a complaint in ARENTO's decision to
award the mobile exchanges procured under the credit. The bids for this
equipment were opened in August 1980 and evaluation took considerable time
and the decision to award was made in October 1981 at the prevalent
currency rates. Unfortunately, this was well beyond the initial validity
period and provided grounds for complaint from a bidder who was affected by
the change in currency rates during this period. However, ARENTO awarded
the contract to the lowest bidder on the basis of the currency values at
the time of the decision to award, consistent with Bank guidelines at that
time.
5.04      Project Costs:  The estimated project cost of the Second
Telecommunications Project was about US$210 million. The final cost is
about US$261 m- lion as shown in Table S in Part III. The main reason for
the variance in the project costs is the increase in the local cost caused
by higher local inflation compounded by delays in installation.
5.05      Disbursements:  The estimated and actual total disbursements of
the credit is given in Table 3 Part III. The disbursements were delayed
due to the delays in implementation of the project. The original closing
date for the credit was December 31, 1981, but the credit was closed only
on June 30, 1984, after three extensions of closing of the credit. US$4.8
million of the credit was cancelled.
5.06      Credit Allocation:  The original and revised allocation and final
disbursement for the credit are shown in Table 5 in Part III. The revised
allocation was agreed in June 1979. Allocation for cables was increased
and correspondingly the allocation for telephone switching equipment was
decreased to reflect changes in items to be financed under the credit (para
4.01).
6. Project Results
6.01      Project Objectives:  The project achieved its objectives, both
physical as well as institutional. The project increased access to and
imprcved quality of telephone services in the major urban areas and
expanded telex services. During the project period, ARETO was re-



- 4 -
established as ARENTO under a new charter providing it more financial and
administrative autonomy.
6.02      Physical Results:  The plysical targets of the project were
achieved as planned. The annuai growth in the lines is shown in Annex 1.
The increase in the overall telecommunications network as a result of the
project is shown in Tables 4 and 6 in Part III. However the results were
achieved later than forecasted at appraisal due to delays in
implementation.
6.03     Financial Performance:  ARENTO's financial statements, including
both appraisal estimates and actual results for FY1978-84 are given in
Annex 2. The financial performance of ARENTO improved during the project
period. Prior to 1981, ARENTO's performance reflects largely the
institutional framework in which it had been operating up until July 1980.
The performance was poor when compared to the appraisal forecasts. The
rate of return on net operating assets averaged about 122 instead of 242
and debt service coverage was below 1. Since 1981, the financial
performance improved with higher profits and rates of return averaged about
26Z in the 1983 through 1985 period. The improvement was due to increases
in tariffs in 1982 and 1985 and reduction in staffing ratio. The
covenanted return of 11X on revalued assets was met during the 1983 to 1985
period.
6.04     Due to lack of adequate documentation, it is difficult to fully
establish the methodology used at appraisal to calculate the internal rate
of return of the program. The internal financial rate of return for the
program as executed over the 1978-84 period has been calculated using
methodology currently being used by the Bank to appraise telecommunications
projects and is estimated at about 6Z. The financial rate of return
underestimates benefits that would be derived from the investment program.
It does not take into account consumer surplus and indirect and external
benefits that would be received by non-users of telecommunications
services. Assuming that existing and new subscribers are willing to pay
for telecommunications services, as a minimum, prices in real terms they
were paying at the start of the program, then the economic rate of return
for the program is estimated at 222 as outlined in Table 6B in Part III.
The economic return estimated at appraisal was 23Z.
6.05      Impact of Project:  The project increased access to
telecommunications services and brought about improvements in quality of
service for both telephone and telex. It also introduced modern technology
through the introduction of electronic telex and telephone switching and
electronic PABXs and mobile switching systems. The creation of a more
commercially oriented entity, ARENTO, with greater financial and
administrative autonomy has led to sustained high growth in service since
1983.
7. Project SuLtainability
7.01     The Project has had benefits resulting in improved quality of
service and the expanded coverage of telephone and telex services. It is



-5-
foreseen that the current demand for services far exceeds supply and the
physical facilities provided under the project will continue to provide
benefits throughout its economic life.
8. Bank Performance
8.01     The Bank through the Second Telecommunications Project was able to
make a positive contribution to the development of the sector. In close
cooperation with USAID, the Bank actively participated in the framing of
the terms of reference of the telecommunications sector study financed hy
USAID and review of the progress and recommendationis arising therefrom. In
particular, the Bank provided in depth comments on the initial consultant
report in 1978 and made specific recommendations on the scale of overall
costs and implementation of the proposed development program, which
provided ARENTO with a better appreciation of investment requirements with
programs of this order. IDA's involvement in the second project provided
support for (a) continued exparnsion and improvement of existing facilities
and (b) consolidation of steps for institution building especially creation
of a more autonomous telecommunications entity effective July 1980.
8.02    In general, Bank performance has been satisfactory.  The Bank
successfully coordinated with the major cofinanciers, especially on the
institutional support provided by USAID. The major lesson that may be
learnt from the experience in the project is that the implementation
capacity when it depended upon detailed engineering, procurement and
installation was not taken fully into account, contributing to longer than
anticipated implementation time. Consultancy service should have been
provided to assist ARENTO in preparation of procurement documents. A
special project management unit assisted by consultants to coordinate all
the related works in implementation of the various components of the
project would have minimized delays. In addition, advance preparation and
procurement action in the project as is being adopted in all current
telecommunications projects would have speeded up implementation.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     Government was the borrower and ARENTO was the implementing
.gency. Table 7 Part III contains a review of the performance of the
Government and ARENTO in complying with the covenant in the Credit and the
Project Agreement. Government's performance was satisfactory except for
settlement of accounts receivables for services rendered b' ARENTO.
ARENTO's performance was satisfactory except for the delay in submission of
audited accounts and settlement of accounts receivables from government.
During project preparation and appraisal, ARENTO provided all the support
needed.
10. Project Relationship
10.01    Bank relationship with Government and ARENTO on the project has
been good.



-6-
11. Consulting Services
11.01    Under the Second Telecommunications Project, no provision was made
for employment of consultants as ARENTO's staff was appraised to have the
capability of planning, designing and supervision of execution of most of
the works in the project. However, for implementation of the new
electronic telephone switching systems for Cairo, which were financed by
USAID and European Consortium, engineering consultant services were
provided. The main consultancy support for institution building during the
1977-82 period came from USAID. The Continental Telephone International
(CTI) was appointed in May 1977 by USAID for a comprehensive study of the
telecommunications sector under terms of reference which were agreed with
the Bank. This study was completed in May 1978 and USAID contracted A.D.
Little Inc. (ADL) to implement the major recommendations of this study.
The Bank was very actively involved in reviewing the progress and
recommendation of the consultants in close cooperation with USAID.
Although the Bank did not directly oversee the work of these consultants,
their overall performance was satisfactory.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01    The Development Credit and Project Agreements in the case of
Credit 744-EGT were quite adequate and appropriate for achieving project
objectives in the key organizational and financial areas. The appraisal
report for the project provided a useful framework for both Bank and ARENTO
for review of project implementation. ARENTO submitted quarterly reports
on progress of the project. ARENTO provided draft project completion
reports for the project and subsequent clarifications.

We have the pleasure to inform you that we have reviewed the Project
Completion Report (PCR) on the above projects attached to your letter dated
4.4.1989, and appreciate very much the efforts in preparing this report, which
reflects the progress in the field of telecommunications in EGYPT.
Although most of the items in the two reports are acceptable, ARENTO has
the following comments:
1)   Procurement:
According to government regulations, ARENTO cannot release the
tender documents to the World Bank before the final approval of the loan.
Yet, ARENTO thinks that for future projects this comment should be taken
into account.
2)   Consultancy:
It is a general policy to minimize consultancy services and make
best use of ARENTO staff capabilities and expertise.
During the past five years major projects were successfully
implemented without consultancy services specially in microwave, coaxial
cables and satellite communication systems.
3)   Rural Areas:
The World Bank project for improving the services in Rural Areas is
considered as an integral part of ARENTO's approved Master Plan for the
development of telecommunication facilities in Egypt. Other projects had



- 8 -
to be implemented and financed from funds other than the World Bank to
complement and achieve maximum benefits of the World Bank project which
has been already done.
It should be noted that microwave links established are or will be
used before the end of this year, to link full automatic exchanges to the
trunk exchange network. Now subscribers in 140 cities and villages have
automatic trunk dialing facilities and this figure will be 178 before the
end of 1989

l/ Estimated completion costs:
Reasons for increase in project costs were as follows:
Local Costs: The increase in local costs of about 62Z is mainly caused by
higher rates of inflation compounded by the delays overall of about three
years in installation of the main components of the project.
Foreign Costs:  The foreign costs are about the same as at appraisal.
Total Costs:  The overall increase in total costs is estimated at about
24Z.

Economic Rate of Return                       23                  22
Underlying Assumptions
1. The benefit period of the program extends from 1982 to 2005, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2. All costs streams have been expressed in 1980 prices.
3. Existing and new subscribers are willing to pay for telecommunications
services, the same prices in real terms as they were paying at the start
of the program.
4. Actual capital cost streams are based on the program as actually
implemented from 1978-84.
5. Without the program, the revenue and operating costs are expected to
remain at the 1981 levels. The benefit attributed to the program, due
to the increase in traffic due to new lines and higher traffic on
existing lines, is the incremental revenue with respect to 1981 level.
Similarly, the operating costs attributed to the program due to the
costs of the new lines less the operating costs realized on existing
lines is the incremental operating cost with respect to 1981 level.
6. From 1985 on, benefits and operating costs are constant.
7. No residual value of fixed assets are taken into account as the present
value of those in real terms would be minimal.
Comments:
1. The close relationship between project and non-project investments makes
any attempt at separation of benefits arbitrary. Consequently, the rate
of return calculation is made on the entire investment program, as at
appraisal.
2. The economic rate of return calculated using this methodology does not
take into account fully, the consumer surplus and indirect and external
benefits received by non-users of telecommunications services.

Other Financial Indicators: The financial indicators, appraisal compared
with actuals are given in Annex 2.
/ the methodology used at appraisal to estimate the return is different
from that used to reestimate the return. The method used is similar
to the one outlined for economic rate of return except that the
incremental benefit streams are in constant 1980 prices.

Comments:
Subsequent to the CTI study under financing from USAID, AP.ENTO retained
A.D. Little consultants to broadly implement the recommendations of the C'iI
study and in particular to review the management, operations and training
program of ARENTO and implementation of the program of service
improvements. The Bank participated in the review of the A.D. Little study
reports and recommendations.

Sector                   : Telecommunications
2. Background
2.01     Public telecommunications facilities in Egypt are state owned.
The Arab Republic of Egypt National Tele -mmunications Organization
(ARENTO) under the Ministry of Communications, is responsible for the
operation, management and development of all public telecommunications
facilities in the country. Supported by the Bank and other donors. ARENTO
was established in July 1980 under a new charter with a greater degree of
fiscal and administrative autonomy than the earlier Arab Republic of Egypt
Telecommunications Organization (ARETO).
2.02     IDA's involvement in the sector started with a credit of US$30
million for the First Telecommunications Project in 1975 to help finance
ARETO's 1975-77 program aimed mainly at rehabilitation of existing
telephone networks and improvement of service to existing subscribers. The
IDA project initiated some basic institutional reforms in ARETO's
organization in planning, accounting and financial areas.
2.03     IDA approved a credit of USSS3 million for the Second
Telecommunications Project in March 1978 to help finance the most urgent
works for ARETO rehabilitation and expansion in the 1978-80 investment
program. The project also supported ARETO's efforts for institutional
building financed under USAID.
2.04      In 1980 the Government of Egypt recognizing that well functioning
telecommunications services were crucial to the economic and social
development established the following sector development objectives:
(a) improve the access to, and quality of, telecommunications
services throughout the country through network rehabilitation
and efficient and cost effective network expansion to meet the
large unsatisfied demand; and
(b)   develop ARENTO into a commercially oriented organization with
more administrative and financial autonomy and enable it to be
financially self-sufficient.



-2-
3. Proiect Oblectives and Description
3.01       Proiect Objectives:  In furtherance of the government's sector
objectives, the objectives of the Third Telecommunications Project were to
provide assistance in the institution building of ARENTO, particularly in
key financial and organizational areas, and for the rehabilitation and
expansion of the telecommunications facilities in the previously neglected
small towns and rural areas of Egypt. The project, together with other
cofinanced components which covered the main urban areas, constituted an
integral part of Egypt's FY82-85 telecommunications development program.
3.02      Project Description:  The Third Telecommunications Project (Loan
2041-EGT) provided for:
(a) installation of about 67,500 lines of semi-automatic exchange
equipmert in small towns in Lower and Upper Egypt;
(b) rehabilitation and reinstallation of about 60,000 lines of
manual telephone exchange equipment in rural areas;
(c) replacement and expansion of the outside plant networks for
about 180,000 lines in manual and semi-automatic exchange
areas;
(d)  rehabilitation ana expansion of long distance networks by
installation of small coaxial cables, UHF/VHF radio links,
overhead cables and open wire lines and carrier systems
connecting small towns and rural areas; and
(e) provision of tools, vehicles, testing and miscellaneous
equipment, including telegraphs and telex.
3.03     In addition to financing above items, Bank advised ARENTO in key
institutional aspects, finance and organization.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01     The Third Telecommunications Project was designed mainly to
provide telecommunications services in small towns and rural areas of
Egypt; Cairo, Alexandria and the bigger towns of Egypt were covered by
USAID and European Consortium financing. The project concept and design
was appropriate and timely in order to ensure that adequate priority was
given to the development of the rural telecommunications which is vital to
the economic development of the rural areas.   Without the Bank support for
the rural telecommunications development, these areas would have been
neglected as in the past as evidenced by the efforts of the new management
of ARENTO, which took office in October 1981, to change the scope of the
project as appraised in June 1980 to include a new microwave system between
Cairo and Aswan and also a satellite earth station to work with ABRABSAT.
The Bank maintained that the project as appraised was targeted to improve
access to, and quality of telephone services to the small towns and rural



areas, and did not agree to the request. However, the Bank agreed to
ARENTO's request to include an electronic telex exchange of 1000 lines with
1,500 teleprinters for Alexandria under Bank financing as this was needed
for the development of telegraphs service which was within the original
project scope.
4.02     The Bank project was about US$141 million out of the total program
of about US$2.124 million and the Bank financed only US$64 million of the
total foreign cost requirement of the program of US$1,362 million. The
European Consortium contributed over US$500 million for the program. Thus
the Bank financing was a very small part of the total investment. Given
the higher priority placed on urban telecommunications development,
especially due to pressure on ARENTO from its more vociferous important
customers, who were covered by the works associated with USAID and European
Consortium projects, ARENTO gave low priority to the Bank's project. This
resulted in slow start up of the Bank project and consequent delay in
project completion.
4.03     ARENTO was responsible for the implementation of the project.  In
retrospect, the program for FY82-85 period, which was about five times the
previous program for FY78-80 period, was too large for ARENTO to implement
within four years even with some assistance from consultants.
5. Project Implementation
5.01      Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up:  Although Loan 2041-EGT
was approved on July 21, 1981, it was signed only on August 20, 1982, due
to the delay in increase in tariffs which was a condition for loan
signature. Due to the delay in the formation of the project implementation
unit and the appointment of the project manager which were conditions for
loan effectiveness, the loan was effective only on February 25 1983, a
delay of over two years from the originally planned effective date for the
loan.
5.02     Implementation Schedule:  The project was originally scheduled to
be completed by December 31, 1985, but most of the project components were
only completed by December 1987, and the microwave links, a major project
component, is expected to be completed by March 31, 1989. The main reasons
for the delays were:
(a) large investment program, about five times the previous program
for FY78-80, which strained ARENTO's implementation capacity;
(b) low priority given by ARENTO to the Bank project (para 4.02);
(c) ARENTO's new management proposal to revise the project scope
which took time to resolve;
(d) over a year delay in the supplier declaring the microwave
contract effective due to the need of carrying out a detailed



- 4 -
survey to obtain all the necessary information to supply and
install the microwave links;
(e) delays in formation of a project implementation unit and
appointment of a project manager; and
(f) slow start up in procurement action.
What the Bank could have done to avoid the above, is discussed as the
lessons learnt by the Bank in para 8.02.
5.03     Procurement:  Except for progress on procurement of the telex
exchange and teleprinters in Alexandria and which were items originally
proposed under the second project (Credit 774-EGT), the procurement action
on other items was slow. The main reasons for the delays in procurement
were:
(a) according to ARENTO's understanding of government regulations, it
is not permitted to send bid documents to the government for
clearance for announcing bids until the financing source was
confirmed. Since there was delay in the date of effectiveness of
the loan, preparatory work was not started until the loan was
effective in February 1983, over 18 months after loan approval:
(b) low priority was given to the Bank project by ARENTO's new
management; and
(c) delay in the preparation of the specifications of the microwave
links.
5.04     Procurement action proceeded satisfactorily in the Bank project
only after the works financed by European Consortium and USAID were largely
completed. In general, the procurement action followed Bank guidelines. A
mission from ARENTO visited Washington in July 1985 to discuss procurement
action. The procurement process accelerated thereafter as a result of
ARENTO adopting the Bank Sample Bid document as a standard.
5.05     Project Costs:  The estimated cost of the Third Telecommunications
Project at appraisal was about US$141.24 million. The final cost is about
US$169.34 million as shown in Table 5A in Part III. The increase in total
cost of about 20 percent is due to about 9 percent and 13.5 percent
increases respectively in foreign and local costs because of the increase
in project scope. Because of the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, the
increase in local cost in US dollar terms is lower.
5.06      Disbursements:  The estimated disbursements of the Loan 2041-EGT
are given in Table 3 in Part III. The disbursements were delayed due to
delays in implementation of the project. The original closing date was
December 31, 1986; but the loan was closed only on June 30, 1988, after two
extensions of the closing date of the loan. Disbursement against
commitments were made till December 31, 1988 and an outstanding balance of
US$1.17 was cancelled.



5.07      Loan Allocation:  The original and revised allocations and actual
disbursements for Loan 2041-EGT are shown in Table 5 Part III. The
original allocations were revised in December 1986 to reflect changes in
financing for the long distance equipment and telephone cables.
6. Project Results
6.01      Proiect Obiectives:  Overall, the project was successful in
meeting its principal objectives of improving access to and quality of
telecommunications services to the small towns and rural areas. The
project also assisted in strengthening the management and organization of
ARENTO. The project, together with the other components of the program,
which were financed mostly by USAID and European Consortium, concentrated
on the rehabilitation and expansion of telecommunications facilities in
Cairo, Alexandria and the bigger towns in Egypt, has contributed to the
overall development of the telecommunications sector in Egypt.
6.02     Physical. Results:  The physical targets of the project were
achieved substantially as planned. The overall increase of the
telecommunications services as a result of the Project is shown in Tables 4
and 6 in Part III. The annual growth in the telephone lines is given in
Annex 1.
6.03     Financial Performance:  The financial statements, including both
appraisal estimates and actual results for FY81-88 are given in Annex 2.
The financial performance of ARENTO was comparable with the appraisal
estimates during FY81-86 period. The covenanted rate of return of 10
percent on revalued assets was met during the period. However, the
covenanted return was not met in FY87, when the return was only about 9
percent. This was mainly due to the lack of adequate tariff increases.
Tariffs did not keep pace with inflation.  The financial performance in
FY88 improved.  The return on revalued assets is estimated at about 11
percent and ARENTO was able to generate about 37 percent of its capital
expenditure in FY88. This improvement was mainly due to increase in tne
international tariffs by an average of about 20 percent effective September
1, 1987 and introduction of local call timing in Cairo and Alexandria since
January 1, 1988. The financial .erformance in FY89 is expected to improve
due to the tariff increases.
6.04     ARENTO had very limited success in settlement of government
receivables during the project. As of June 30, 1988, the total receivables
outstanding from government stood at LE50.8 million, which represents about
15 months of billing to government for the year and is high. However this
is an improvement from FY87, when the accounts receivables represented
about 20 months of billing. ARENTO is aware of the severity of the problem
and is taking all necessary actions in its power to collect the outstanding
arrears.



6.05     The internal financial rate of return for the program as executed
over the 1983-88 period is estimated at 9 percent. This compares
reasonably with a returr. on the program of 12 percent estimated at
appraisal given the cost overrun and delays in implementation. The
financial rate of return undarestimates benefits that would be derived from
the investment program. It does not take into account consumer surplus and
indirect and external benefits that would be received by non-users of
telecommunications services. Assuming that existing and new subscribers
are willing to pay for telecommunications services, as a minimum, prices in
real terms they were paying at the start of the benefit of the program,
then the economic rate of return is about 47 percent. This is not directly
comparable with the return of 21 percent estimated at appraisal because the
analysis employed a different methodology.
6.06     Impact of Proiect:  The project made a major impact on rural
telecommunications development.   The social and economic conditions of
rural living were enhanced by the improvement brought about in rural
telecommunications systems through expansion of service and automization
and new transmission links which enabled introduction of direct dialling to
most parts of the country and abroad. There is, currently, heavy demand
from the rural communities that are at present not covered by these
facilities to extend these services to their communities as well.
7. Project Sustainability
7.31     The project has had significant benefits in the following:
(a) an increase both in the quality and the coverage of
telecommunications services to small towns and rural areas
which had been previously neglected and where other donors were
not interested in financing; and
(b) strengthening the management and organization of ARENTO to
enable it to attain sustained growth in annual subscriber
connections of 20 percent since 1983 as compared to 5 percent
per annum during the 1978-82 period.
,.02     To further improve the benefits, ARENTO and the government need to
focus on continued institutional development and tariffs policy, structure
and levels. In light of the time lapse since the last review of the sector
and the large growth in the network and development of technology, there is
a need to review the adequacy of ARENTO's existing organizational structure
and charter. In this context, it is important to also review the
government policy in the sector and the regulatory framework to ensure that
they facilitate the rapid and coherent development of this vital sector.
However, there are no current plans for future Bank involvement in the
sector and ARENTO has not sought further Bank assistance.
7.03       To ensure continued financial viability of ARENTO and enable it
to financially support the necessary sustained growth there is a need to
review the existing tariff policy, levels and structure and establish



- 7 -
mechanism for periodic adjustments of tariffs to reflect the economic cost
of providing the services. Both items to an extent, are being addressed
through ARENTO's own internal review. However, for actions in bot'n these
areas, government involvement and commitment is needed.
8. Bank Performance
8.01     Through the Third Telecommunications Project, the Bank made a
positive contribution to the physical and institutional development of the
sector and ensured continued financial viability of ARENTO. Bank
performance has been satisfactory. However, in retrospect, the following
lessons may be learnt from the experience in the project:
(a) considering the large size of ARENTO's program, the Bank could
have advised the government and ARENTO to relate the size to
ARENTO's implementation capacity. However, by introducing the
Bank project in the investment program, the Bank escalated the
issue. On the other hand, without the Bank project the
telecommunications development in the rural areas would have
been neglected;
(b) Bank should have been more forceful in persuading ARENTO to
give higher priority then actually given to the Bank project,
in light of the importance of telecommunications in the social
and economic development of the rural areas;
(c) considering the large investment program, the Bank should have
required ARENTO to employ consultants to assist in
implementation of the program;
(d) advance preparation and procurement action in these projects as
is being adopted in all current telecommunications projects
would speed up implementation; and
(e) need to package the procurement items in bigger packages to
avoid procurement actions on too many individual items.
Given the large size of the investment program and the limited capacity of
ARENTO to implement the program on time, in retrospect, as a commercial
oriented entity, ARENTO's decision to place higher priority on development
of the urban telecommunications, which generates higher revenue per line,
cannot be questioned.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     Table 7 Part III contains the review of performance of the
borrower, ARENTO. Except for the delays in submitting audited accounts and
settling of Government bills, ARLNTO's performance has been satisfactory.
ARENTO's performance in keeping good control over staff increases has been
very noteworthy (Annex 3). During project preparation and appraisal,



- 8 -
ARENTO provided all the support needed. However, there were delays in the
formation of the project unit and appointment of a project manager.
Although the size of the program was five times larger than A.RENTO's
previous programs, no consultants were hired to assist ARENTO to implement
the program and the component works were carried out by the section chiefs
who were responsible for all works concerning switching, networks and
transmission as applicable. Thus the focus in the project execution was
diffused and control on project execution particularly on the microwave
system could have been more effective. The main lessons that can be learnt
by the borrower from the experience from the project are:
(a) to undertake a large program, ARENTO needs to employ
consultants to assist it in the implementation or reduce the
program to relate it to its implementation capacity; and
(b) procurement action should commence as part of the planning
process and not be related to the financing source (para 5.03).
10. Project Relationship
10.01    Bank relationship with Government and ARENTO on the project has
been good.
11. Consulting Services
11.01    For the Third Telecommunications Project, consultancy assistance
was not provided for. The main consultancy support for institution
building during the 1977-82 period came from USAID. The Continental
Telephone International (CTT) was appointed in May 1977 by USAID for a
comprehensive study of the telecommunications sector under terms of
reference which were agreed with the Bank. This study was completed in May
1978 and USAID contracted A.D. Little Inc. (ADL) to implement the major
recommendations of this study. The Bar.k was very actively involved in
reviewing the progress and recommendation of the consultants in close
cooperation with USAID. Although the Bank did not directly oversee the
work of these consultants, the overall opinion placed their performance as
satisfactory. The performance of the consultants and supplier in both the
projects has been satisfactory.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01    The Loan Agreement in the case of Loan 2041-EGT was quite adequate
and appropriate for achieving project objectives in the key organizational
and financial areas. The appraisal report of the project provided a useful
framework for both Bank and ARENTO for review of project implementation.
ARENTO provided draft project completion reports for the project and
subsequent clarifications. Since 1983, the database for the project cost
accounting setup has considerably improved monitoring in this area. ARENTO
is currently integrating a Management Information System.

Re: Second and Third Telecommunications Projects
(Credit 774-EGT and Loan 2041-EGT)
Pass-Through Audit Report
Dear Mr. Nowicki,
We have the pleasure to inform you that we have reviewed the Project
Completion Report (PCR) on the above projects attached to your letter dated
4.4.1989, and appreciate very much the efforts in preparing this report, which
reflects the progress in the field of telecommunications in EGYPT.
Although most of the items in the two reports are acceptable. ARENTO has
the following comments:
1)   Procurement:
According to government regulations, ARENTO cannot release the
tender documents to the World Bank before the final approval of the loan.
Yet, ARENTO thinks that for future projects this comment should be taken
into account.
2)   Consultancy:
It is a general policy to minimize consultancy services and make
best use of ARENTO staff capabilities and expertise.
During the past five years major projects were successfully
implemented without consultancy services specially in microwave, coaxial
cables and satellite communication systems.
3)   Rural Areas:
The World Bank project for improving the services in Rural Areas is
considered as an integral part of ARENTO's approved Master Plan for the
development of telecommunication facilities in Egypt. Other projects had



- 10 -
to be implemented and financed from funds other than the World Bank to
complement and achieve maximum benefits of the World Bank project which
has been already done.
It should be noted that microwave links established are or will be
used before the end of this year, to link full automatic exchanges to the
trunk exchange network. Now subscribers in 140 cities and villages have
automatic trunk dialing facilities and this figure will be 178 before the
end of 1989

Local Costs:    The increase in local costs of about 13.5 Z is caused by
the increase in the installed lines and network in the project. It however
does not reflect the increase in local costs in Egyptian Pounds as the
currency devalued considerably from US$l = .70LE at appraisal in 1980 to
US$l - LE2.33 in July 1988.
Foreign Costs: The increase in foreign costs of about 92 is caused mainly
by the increase in the installed lines and networks.
Total Costs:    The overall increase in total costs is estimated at about
20Z.

Estimate          Actual
Economic Rate of Return                       21Z             47Z
Underlying Assumptions
1. The benefit period of the program extends from 1986 to 2010, when on
average, the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2. All costs streams have been expressed in 1980 prices.
3. Existing and new subscribers are willing to pay for telecommunications
services, the same prices in real terms as they were paying at the start
of the program.
4. Actual capital cost streams are based on the program as actually
implemented from 1983-1988.
5. Without the program, the revenue and operating costs are expected to
remain at the 1984 levels. The benefit attributed to the program, due
to the increase in traffic due to new lines and higher traffic on
existing lines, is the incremental revenue with respect to 1984 level.
Similarly, the operating costs attributed to the program due to the
costs of the new lines less the operating costs realized on existing
lines is the incremental operating cost with respect to 1984 level.
6. From 1989 on, benefits and operating costs are constant.
7. No residual value of fixed assets are taken into account as the present
value of those in real terms would be minimal.
Comments:
1. The close relationship between project and non-project investments makes
any attempt at separation of benefits arbitrary. Consequently, the rate
of return calculation is made on the entire investment program, as at
appraisal.
2. The economic rate of return calculated using this methodology does not
take into account fully the consumer surplus and indirect and external
benefits received by non-users of telecommunications services.

Other Financial Indicators: The financial indica:ors, appraisal compared
with actuals are given in Annex 2.
The difference in financial rate of return is due to increase in cost of
program and delays in implementation.

Subsequent to the CTI study under financing from USAID, ARENTO retained
A.D. Little consultants to broadly implement the recommendations of the CTI
study and in particular to review the management, operations and training
program of ARENTO and implementation of the program of service
improvements. The Bank participated in the review of the A.D. Little study
