DEPARTMENT OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOSMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUM&ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Administration of Papua New Guinea which would be t:i'e
Borrower has requested a Bank loan to help finance the further expansion
of its telecommunications services.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs
(P&T) which is responsible for telecommunications services in the Territory
would carry out the project.  The Govermnent of the Commonwealth c,f Australia
would guarantee the proposed loan of US$10 million.
ii.       P&T's telecommunications development program for the fiscal
years 1973-75, including ongoing works, is estimated to cost US$20.7
million equivalent. The project for which Bank financing is proposed is
estimated to cost US$17.2 million equivalent, forming 83% of the total
program. The proposed loan of US$10.0 million would cover part ofl' the
project's offshore cost estimated at US$12.0 uiillion. The balance of the
offshore costs and all the local costs would be met from P&T's internal
resources and Treasury advances.
iii.      The loan now proposed would be the second for telecommmuications
in Papua New Guinea. The first, Loan 5h6-PNG, for US$7.0 million
was approved in June 196t and was primarily inatended to provide backbone
long distance routes in the Territory. Progress has been satisfactory
and the project is expected to be completed on schedule in mid-1972.
iv.       The new project is designed to utilize and expand the facilities
provided by the earlier project. It includes the provision of about
13,500 lines of local exchange capacity, the associated distribution
plant and subscribers' equipment, about 65o additional long distance
circuits on existing routes and telex exchanges with a total of 600 lines.
v.        Rapid and reliable telecommunications services are essential
to the economic development of the Territory, whose scattered population
centers are isolated by its rugged terrain and its insular character.
The project is technically sound and would be carried out with the
assistance of consultants.
vi.       Procurement of equipment to be obtained under the Bank loan
would be by international competitive bidding, except for additionis to
existing automatic exchange equipment, with a total cost of US$0.8 million
(about 9% of procurement under the loan), where direct compatibility is
essential.
vii.      P&T has taken the first steps to correct weaknesses in its
planning and financial divisions and plans to improve them further
during the project period. Commercial accounting has been introduced



- ii -
as required under Loan 546-PNG. With the assistance of engineering
consultants, to be retained for the project period, P&T is capable of
carrying out the program and maintaining operating efficiency.
viii.     More than 50% of the funds required for the program are
expected to be generated internally. The fibancial position is satis-
factory and since all capital except the Bank loan has been contributed
as equity, debt service coverage is not expected to fall below 5 times
during the fiscal years up to 1977.
ix.       The internal economic  rate of return of the project is
estimnted at about 17%.
x.        During negotiations, agreement was reached on the points set
out in paragraph 7.01. The project would be suitable for a Bank loan
of US$10.0 million for a period of 20 years including a grace period
of 4 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Administration of Papua New Guinea, through the
Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, has requested a Bank
loan to help finance a project that forms part of the FY 1973-75
telecommunications development program.
1.02      This would be the Bank's second loan to the Territory for
telecommunications. The first one, Loan 546-PNG for US$7.0 milliom,
was made in 1968 to help finance the offshore costs of a project to
extend and improve the local and long distance telephone services.,
Progress has been satisfactory on this project, which is expected to
be completed on schedule in mid-1972.
1.03      The new project to be undertaken during the FY 1973-75 forms
part of a program which provides for the extension of telephone fa.cil-
ities upon completion of the ongoing project and for the installat,ion
of modern telex facilities.
1.04      The Administration of Papua New Guinea would be the Borrower
and would make the funds available on the same terms to the Posts and
Telegraphs Department (P&T) which is responsible for planning and
operating telecommunications and postal services in the Territory.
1.05      This report is based on information obtained from P&T and on
the findings of a mission comprised of Messrs. M. DbLima and J. Brown
which visited Papua New Guinea in October/November 1971.

2. THE ECONOMY AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
The Territory and Its Economy
2.01      Since 1949, Australia has administered its Territory of Papua
and the UN Trust Territory of New Guinea as a single political and
economic unit -  the Territory of Papua New Guinea. Situated off
Australia's northerncoast, the Territory comprises the eastern half of
the island of New Guinea and a number of adjacent islands, the largest
of which are New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville and Manus.  Forests
cover more than 70% of the land area of 183,540 square miles, which is
one of great diversity with marn rugged mountain ranges, vast swamps
and large rivers making road transport very difficult to develop. For
much of the Territory, air transport still provides the means of internal
movement.
2.02      The population is estimated at 2.4 million (49,000 non-
indigenous) and is growing at about 2.6% per year. Average population
density is 13 per square mile and varies widely, from 1.5 to 60, with
the highest density in the New Guinea Highlands. The Territory's admin-
istrative and commercial center is Port Moresby in Papua. The other
main towns are Lao and Madang in New Guinea, Rabaul in New Britain,
and Kieta in Bougainville.
2.03      In 1970 the GNP amounted to US$640 million and the annual
growth rate over the past five years averaged 9.5%. The annual per
capita income was US$265. While the economy is based mainly on primary
production, the small manufacturing sector is growing rapidly, and its
1970 output reached about US$67 million. Processing of primary products
for export is the main manufacturing activity. In 1970 the major exports
were copra (US$26 million), coffee (US$23 million), cocoa (US$19 million),
and timber and timber products (US$7 million). Rubber is also exported,
mostly to Australia. Oil palm, beef cattle and fishing industries are
being developed and tea production is being increased. The discovery of
large copper ore deposits on Bougainville, and more recently in New Guinea's
Western Highlands, marks a turning point in the economic development of
the Territory. The Bougainville mining operations are scheduled to
commence in mid-1972, with the value of output in copper, silver and gold
expected to be about US$200 million per year when full production is
reached in about three years time.
2.04      Rapid and reliable telecommunication services are essential
to economic development because they provide a means of exchanging
information between the producers and the administrative and commercial
centers of the Territory. Furthermore, the Territory's exceptionally
rugged terrain, insular character, widely scattered population centers
and limited surface communications make it necessary for administrative
purposes to establish an adequate telecommunications network.



- 3-
The Telecormmunications Sector
2.05      The Posts and Telegraphs Department (P&T) is responsible for
providing local and long distance telecommunications services within the
Territory. When not able to provide suitable long distance service, P&T
allows private users to obtain licenses annually from the Governmnent to
operate point-to-point HF radio systems. These systems are inefficient
and difficult to maintain. Many of them will be discontinued and modern
P&T services utilized as they become available. For their special
operational needs, the military and civil aviation authorities have
established some telecommunication facilities. The Overseas Telecom-
munications Commission of Australia (OTC), which has statutory respon-
sibility for the external telecommunications services of the Territory,
handles international telecommunications traffic at Port Moresby through
HF radio and at Lae and Rabaul through the Madang submarine cable
terminal.
Existing Facilities
2.06      The telephone density in the Territory is 1.0 telephone per
100 persons. Annex 1 gives statistical information on telephones in
various countries. The existing exchange and long distance network is
shown on the map attached to this report. The telecommunication facil-
ities are currently inadequate in quality and capacity to meet the
Territory's development needs. Annex 2 sets out basic data on the
existing facilities and the expansion program planned for execution
during 1973-75 (see also paragraphs 3.01 - 3.02).
Local Telephone Service
2.07      As of June 30, 1971, 20 local automatic and 16 manual exchanges
were in operation with a total capacity of 14,780 lines and 11,705 con-
nected lines. Annex 3 gives a list of the exchanges, their capacity and
the number of connected lines. As shown in Annex 4., the growth in
connected lines during FY 1969-1971 averaged 14g per annum, with sn
average exchange fill of 75%.
Long Distance Service
2.08      Long distance service between the main urban and rural centers
is provided through HF and VAF radio systeme, but the HF system is sub-
ject to fading and interference, and the VHF facilities do not provide
adequate capacity to meet traffic demand and growth.  Tropospheric scatter
radio links have been installed on the Lae-Rabaul-Kieta route; fuLl use
of the links will not be possible until the main microwave backbone route
(Port Moresby-Lae-Madang-Goroka-Mt. Hagen) become= operational in June
1972.  This microwave system and the long distance exchanges which are
to be installed after June 1972 will provide widespread long distance
dialing facilities which at present are available only between Lae and
Rabaul. Thirty outstations are connected to the main centers through
point-to-point HF radio systems.



- -
Telegraph and Telex Service
2.09      A telegraph network connects various towns by trunk channels
provided by VHF/HF radio. These towns are served by 31 telegraph offices.
2.10      Port Moresby (Boroko) and Lae are served by two manual telex
exchanges, with a total capacity of 120 lines and 100 subscribers.
There is unfilled demand because of the shortage of equipment and it
is estimated that a further 350 subscribers will require service by
1975. Telex calls have increased from 1,170 paid nminutes in 1969 to
13,251 in 1971.
International Facilities
2.11      All international traffic is routed through Sydney, Australia.
Madang is connected to 5 manually operated channels on a submarine cable.
Lae operates semi-automatically on 16 circuits via Madang. Port Moresby
has 15 HF circuits, operated manually at each end. The traffic has
risen sharply, from 7,500 calls in 1968 to 206,000 in 1971.
2.12      International telex calls from Port Mbresby and Lae are also
routed through Sydney. The traffic has grown rapidly, from 95,300 paid
minutes in 1968 to 238,281 in 1971.
Quality of Service
2.13      Because of limited investment and technical resources the
local telephone network has a number of deficiencies leading to indiffer-
ent and restricted service. With the exception of the new Lae-Rabaul
link, all long distance routes are severely congested and the service
is totally inadequate. Many of the deficiencies in the long distance
service will be remedied when the project financed under Loan 546-PNG
is conpleted and the microwave system becomes operational in mid-1972.
The second project, appraised in this report, is designed to extend and
improve the local and long distance services, and by mid-1975 direct
long distance dialing facilities will be available to most subscribers.
There is a large unfilled demand for telephone service, but this cannot
be assessed accurately since potential subscribers are unwilling to apply
for service under present conditions and the true level of demand will
only become evident as the service is improved.

3. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
The FY 1973-75 Program
3.01      PT has drawn up and the Government has approved a telecom-
munications development program planned for execution during 1973-75.
It consists of the following main items:
(a) Ongoing works on Loan 546-PNG;
(b) Construction of the headquarters administration and other
non project buildings;
(c) Vehicles and tools
(d) The project proposed for Bank financing described below
(paragraph 3.03).
3.02      The program's cost is estimated at A$17.4 million (US$20.7
million), including a foreign exchange component of US$12.8 million
equivalent. Annex 5 gives the program's and project's estimated eosts
for each of the three years; Annex 6 gives the physical content. The
program is technically sound and is designed to meet urgent requirements
within the limited available technical and financial resources and the
financing plan has been drawn up for this program. Daring negotiations
agreement was reached that until the completion of the project, the
Administration of Papua New Guinea shall ensure that its Posts and
Telegraphs Department obtains Bank's agreement to a revised finan.oing
plan before committing itself to any capital expenditure not requ:ired for
the project if the aggregate of such capital expenditure made or to be
made in any one fiscal year should exceed an amount equivalent to
US$0.5 million.
The Project
3.03      The project proposed for Bank financing forms part of the
FY 1973-75 telecommunications development program and includes the
following:
(a) Installation of about 13,500 lines of local automatic
exchange equipment; and recovery of about 3,300 lines;
(b) Provision of local exchange cable network and telephone
equipment at subscriber premises to connect about 6,100
additional direct exchange '-Ines;
(c)  Installation of UHF/VHF radio systems, and outstation radio
equipment to connect 11 base stations;



- 6 -
(d) Installation of multiplex equipment on long distance routes
to provide about 650 additional circuits (152,000 channel
miles);
(e) Extension of long distance automatic exchanges;
(f) Installation of telex exchanges with a total of 600 lines
and provision of 500 teleprinters;
(g) Construction of technical and operational buildings;
(h) Engineering consultants to assist PO in the preparation of
specifications and bid documents, evaluation of bids, planning,
and maintenance and operations procedures (see Annex 7 for the
terms of reference).

3.05      The estimates for equipment and cables have been worked out from
unit costs based on experience with the first loan in Papua New Guinea.
The unit costs have been based on the Australian dollar and make allowance
for the effects of changes in exchange rates in the probable countries



of supply up to date. Prices for exchange, long distance and telex equip-
ment have tended to be fairlysteady over the past few years; in respect
of cables, a contingency provision of 10% has been included in the cost
estimates to provide for copper price variations. No separate pr-!ce
contingency for foreign exchange has therefore been provided. A contin-
gency allowance of 5% has been provided in the project?s foreign costs to
cover quantitative increases in equipment and cables when final designs
are prepared.  A contingency allowance of 10% has been provided in the
local costs to cover possible additional labor costs due to increases in
equipment quantities and labor rates.
Items Proposed for Bank Financing
3.06      The estimated foreign currency costs of goods to be imported
for the project is US$12 million. Goods, principally switching ecquipment,
of a total value of US$2 million have been earmarked for procuremont by
P&T with its own resources and Treasury advances; some Of these goods
are in process of installation and the others are being procured. The
proposed loan would provide the balance of US$10 million for the following
items:

Execution of the Project
3.07      Annex 8 gives the timetable for executicn of the project;
the proposals are realistic. P&T's staff will draw up the specifica-
tions and will plan, lay and commission the cables. The engineering
consultants (paragraph 5.03) will assist P&T in preparing the specifi-
cations and bid documents, evaluating bids, and carrying out acceptance
tests of all equipment. Suppliers of the main items of equipment will
be responsible for their installation and performance.



Procurement
3.08      All equipment to be obtained under the project with Bank
financing will be procured through international competitive bidding,
except certain additions to existing automatic exchanges where on grounds
of compatibility, and in order to use existing common equipment facilities,
standardization is justified. The existing automatic exchange equipment
was obtained after calling bids from L. M. Ericsson (Australia) Ltd.,
Telephone Equipment Industries (Division of Plessey UK) and STC Au,tralia
(an IT&T Company). P&T proposes procuring the exchange additions from
these suppliers, by competitive bidding. The total estimated cost is
Us$0.8 million or about 9% of the procurement to be financed by the Bank.
The prices to be paid will be those currently prevalent for such equipment
and will be subject to the Bank!s approval prior to the placement of orders.
P&T do not pay any custom duties for imported equipment.
Disbursements
3.09      Annex 9 gives the estimated loan disbursements during the
1973-75 period. Disbursement would be for the CIF cost of equipment,
the foreign costs of its installation, and consultants' fees. As the
project as designed does not meet all the estimated demand, any unused
balance of the loan should be used to finance additional equipment,
similar to that already procured under the loan, after consultation with
the Bank.

4. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The project is intended to extend and improve the local and
long distance services in the Territory and to meet as much of the
latent demand for service as is possible within the constraints of the
limited fiaancial and personnel resources available.  On completion of
the project at the end of FY 1975, the telephone density will have
increased from the present figure of 1.0 telephone per 100 population
to 1.5.
Local Facilities
4.02      As of June 30, 1971, there were 11,706 connected subscribers
in the Territory, and this figure is expected to increase to 13,60)O by
June 30, 1972.  Between 1968 and 1971 the annual subscriber growth rate
averaged 1L4%.
4.03      The demand for telephone service has been limited by the lack
of adequate long distance facilities, and the small present waiti.ng list
is only an indication of the fact that potential subscribers are rLot
prepared to apply for connection until the service is improved.  1'he
ongoing project will result in a major improvement in the long di.stance
service, and a survey carried out by P&T indicates that there will. be a
marked upsurge in demand when the new facilities come into service in
June 1972. However, precise forecasts of demand are not possible in the
present situation, and P&T has planned for an average subscriber gyrowth
rate of 13% per annum in the period up to 1975.  This is a reasonable
planning basis.
Long Distance Facilities
4.04      The Territory's present long disteaace facilities are inadequate
and congested, and will remain so until the completion of the bacscbone
r,crowave route in June 1972.  It is not possible to forecast futire
traffic growth accurately under these conditions, but estimates have
been made taking into account (a) the expected growth in traffic d1ue to
iammediate improvement in quality and reliability of service on co;npletion
of the microwave system, (b) the expected increase in connected sabscribers,
(c) the progressive introduction of subscriber trunk dialing faciL:ities
and (d) the effects of the Bougainville copper mining operations. The
projoct is designed to meet the estimated demand through FY 1976 b;y the
provision of about 600 extra long distance circuits, an average a.:rfual
increase of 45%. This high rate of increase starts from a very lotw base
since long distance facilities before the first Bu.A project were virtually
nonexistent.
Telex
l.0o5     The annual rate of growth of telex subscribers averaged 140%
from 196U  to 1971 and with 83 subscribers as of June 30, 1971, the equip-
ment was working at almost full capacity. P&T proposes to replace the



- 10 -
existing manual exchanges at Lae and Port Moresby (Boroko) with automatic
equipment including automatic working to Australia. This improvement and
the provision of adequate long distance circuits will create a heavy
demand for service, and the project provides for an annual subscriber
growth rate of 45% of FY 1973-1975, with 350 subscribers connected by
June 30, 1975.
Least-Cost Solution
4.06      Fundamental decisions determining the Territory's network
structure were taken in 1965 when a national development plan was pre-
prepared by a planning group from the Australian Post Office. National
numbering, switching and transmission plans were selected, and radio
was chosen as the only practicable means of providing long distance
service in view of the topography of the Territory and the difficulties
of road access. Within this basic framework, major works in the first
loan project were designed on the basis of present value studies of
engineering alternatives over a typical 20-year period. This project
provides for additions of local and long distance facilities to exist-
ing installations and routes which were planned during the last project
period to provide least cost system development.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
4.07      The internal economic rate of return on the project, at
present.tariffs, is 17.3% (see Annex 10). A sensitivity analysis
(paragraph 5 of Annex 10) has been carried out showing the rate of
return dropping to 14.8% if there is a one year delay in completing
the project and a reduction of 10% in attributable revenues. Since
this return is based on current tariffs, it is a minimum estimate of
the internal economic rate of return.

5. THE BORROWIER
5.01      The Posts and Telegraphs Department (P&T) operates as a
Government department under the jurisdiction of the Administrator of
Papua New Guinea.  P&T is responsible for the planning, acquisition,
construction and operation of telecommunication and postal facilities
within the budget allocation approved by the Papua New Guinea Adm:.nistration.
Organization
5.02      P&T's chief executive is the Director, who is responsible to
the Administrator of Papua New Guinea. The Director is assisted by the
First Assistant Director - Telecanmunications, who is responsible for
the overall operations of the Telecommunications Branch, which coirprises
three main groups (Construction, Planming, Operations). This organiza-
tional set-up, which is similar to that of many other telecomnunications
entities, is satisfactory. Until about three years ago the technical
sections were weak, due mostly to staff shortages and inexperience.  P&T
has taken steps to. correct these deficiencies by the recruitment of
expatriates and increased emphasis on the training of local technicians.
An organization chart is at Annex 11.
5.03      While P&T can operate and maintain the telecommunication facil-
ities satisfactorily, its staff does not have the capability to plan
major works, draw up specifications and bid documents, evaluate bids and
supervise construction. To assist the staff in these functions, P&T has
for the ongoing project retained Preece, Cardew & Rider as technical
consultants; they are financed under Loan 546-Pm . Being satisfied with
thlese consultants, P&T proposes to retain them for three years longer to
assist in carrying out the new project. During negotiations agreennent
was reached that the Borrower shall employ engineering consultanits accept-
able to the Bank upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Banc to
assist the Borrower in the (a) preparation of specifications and tbid docu-
ments; (b) evaluation of bids; (c) planningj and (d) maintenance aad
operations procedures.
Accounts and Audit
5.04      Under Loan 546-PNG, P&T agreed to introduce commercial account-
ing and to maintain separate accounts for its postal and telecommunication
operations. This has been done and acceptable accounts have been prepared
for fiscal years 1970 and 1971. The Ff1970 accounts were seriously
delayed, however, and problems concerning the apportionment of expenses
and revenues in the FY 1971 accounts have only recently been resolved with
the auditors. The introduction of commercial accourting revealed treak-
nesses in the accounting organization which are being resolved foLlowing
the recommendations of a Bank supervision mission in March 1971 by orga-
nizational changes including the creation of new senior posts, rea.location
of duties, improvement in the quality of staff and strengthening of' the
internal audit division.



- 12 -
5.05      P&T's accounts are audited by the Auditor General of the
Commonwealth of Australia, as agreed in the terms of Loan 546-PNG.
This arrangement is satisfactory and an undertaking that certified
accounts and the auditor's report will be sent to the Bank no later
than six months after the end of the financial year is included
in the proposed loan agreement.
Staff
5.06      P&T's telecommunication staff totals about 1,150, of whom 948
are telephone employees. With 24,000 working telephones in the Territory,
the employee ratio comes to 39 per 1,000 telephones. Given the relative-
ly large number of manual exchanges, the present stage of telecommunication
development and the inexperience of the local telephone staff, this ratio
is reasonable.
5.07      Annex 12 gives details of the number of employees in each
function and a breakdown between local and overseas staff. During
1973-75, the number of overseas staff will continue to increase (new
expatriate staff are now recruited on a temporary basis) along with the
increase in total staff and operations. But from 1976 onward, as local
staff are trained, it is expected there will be a gradual decrease in
the nunber of overseas staff, with more local staff taking over higher
responsibilities on the expiration of contracts of expatriates.
Taining
5.o8      In 1960, P&T established a training college with residential
facilities to train operating, clerical and lower-grade technical staff.
P&T has had difficulty in recruiting an adequate number of staff for
training in the technician fields, due to the limited availability of
educated staff and the great demand for them in other Government depart-
ments. However, good results have been achieved in training the few who
are available. The shortage of educated staff is likely to ease within
the next few years as the Government's drive to expand the Territory's
education programs makes more of them available.
5.09      The Australian Post Office assists P&T with specialist advice
and training, and also provides experienced personnel for the operation
of telecommunications in the Territory.
5.10      With the steps being taken to recruLit high-level technical
staff from overseas and to recruit and train other technical and non-
technical local staff, P&T should have adequately trained personnel for
the operation and maintenance of the facilities being added under the
ongoing project and those projected for the 1973-75 expansion.



- 13 -
6. FINANCES
6.01      Until July 1969, P&T operated under the normal governmeint
grant system, transferring its revenues to the Territory Revenue Fund
and meeting expenditures from annual appropriations. The shortage of
available capital severely restricted development, and during the period
1965-1969 the Territory Treasury was able to provide only about A$1
million each year for capital works in addition to an average subsidy
of A$0.5 million to cover the telecommunications operating deficit. In
fiscal year 1970 commercial accounting and a greater degree of financial
autonomy were introduced and the first major expansion program waEs
launched with the support of Loan 546-PNG. In FY 1971 P&T achieveid its
first operating surplus. It is now expected that rapid further inprove-
ment in P&T's profitability will ensure that no further development
capital or operating subsidies will be required from Treasury after
FY 1973 and that by FY 1977 P&T will be in a position to pay 8% arnual
interest (A$2 million) on government equity and finance a substantial
part of future development programs (see paragraph 6.09).
Past Earnings
6.02      Income statements for FY 1970 and 1971 are shown in Annex 13.
The rate of return on net fixed telecormmnications assets was negative
in FY 1970 and 4.4% in FY 1971.  Under Loan 546-PNG, P&T undertook as
an objective to achieve a rate of return of 8% per annum as soon as
practicable after the end of the project (1972). Progress toward this
objective is discussed in paragraph 6.13.
Tariffs
6.03      Telecommunications tariffs are fixed by regulations issued by
the Administrator of the Territory, and details of the current charges
are given in Annex 15. Annual rentals vary from A$26, for a private
subscriber connected to a small automatic exchange with metered lozal
calls, to A$91 for a business subscriber connected to a large manual
exchange with free local call facilities. With the gradual extension
of automatic working and subscriber trunk dialing, rentals will be
standardized at A$39 per annum for both residential and business sab-
scribers with all calls metered and charged. No loss of revenue will
result from the change. Local calls are charged at A07 per call, and
toll call charges range from A¢12 to A035 per minute according to
distance. The installation fee for a new line is A$50.
6.o0      P&T's charges are high by world standards, but are neces3itated
by the cost of operating on a small scale in rugged terrain and be, ween
scattered is'ands. The latest increases in call charges, which averaged
16%, were introduced in April 1971 and there was no fall off in deniand
following their introduction.



- 14 -
6.05      Calls to AustralJia, which account for nearly all the inter-
national traffic, are charged at A$1.25 per minute. The overseas
circuits are operated by OTC, and P&T receives A¢30 per minute for
outgoing calls and A¢25 per minute for incoming calls. These terminal
charges are reasonable.
6.o6      Subscribers are billed quarterly, in advance for rentals and
in arrears for calls and collection procedures are efficient. It has
been decided to change to a monthly billing cycle as soon as possible
and studies are in hand to establish the cost and possible advantages of
using computer bureau facilities for this purpose.
Present Financial Position

Annex 17) is given below.

- 15 -
6.08      Capital assets were revalued as at July 1, 1969, by a team
of experts from the Australian Post Office and a depreciation schedule
was prepared in accordance with the assessed remaining operating LiSe
of the various categories of plant. New assets are being depreciated
at reasonable rates, which average about 5% per annum. Assets are now
fairly valued.
6.o9      Of the total equity figure, A$18.5 million represents Treasury
funds provided for capital development. The P&T (Finance) Ordinance 1970
provides that the Treasurer may call for the repayment of these funids or
for the payment of interest at rates to be determined by him.  In cis-
cussions with Treasury officials, it was stated that repayment would not
be required but that interest at an annual rate of 8% would be cal]ed for
when P&T finances improved sufficiently. The forecasts in Annex 16
indicate that P&T should be able to pay 4% interest in 1976 and 8%
thereafter. Assurances have been obtained that:
(a) It is not the intention of the Treasurer to require repayment
of Governent Equity during the project period;
(b) No interest on Government Equity will be called for durirg
the project period.
6.10      P&T has no long-term debt other than that owed the Bank.  The
debt/equity ratio was 7/93 and debt service was covered more than 18 times
by internal cash generation in FY 1971.
Financing Plan
6.11      Forecast sources and applications of funds are given in Annex 16,
and the financing plan for P&T covering the project period FY 1973.-75, as
summarized below, is satisfactory. Net internal resources will meet 53%
of requirements; 39% will be met by the current and proposed Bank loans
and the balance of 8% will be provided through Treasury advances of A$1.8
million in FY 1973. Assurances have been obtained that the funds required
from the Treasurer will be made available and treated as Government, equity.

Future Operating Results
6.12      Forecast telecommunications operating results for the fiscal
years 1972-1977 (see Annex 13) are summarized below:
(A$ million)
1972   1973   1974   1975   1976   1977
Total operating revenue          5.0    6.6    8.5   1o.6   12.9   15.1
Total operating expenditure      4.6    5.4    6.1    6.7    7.5    8.3

Rate of return %                 2.2    4.4    7.5   10.5   12.6   13.8
6.13      The forecasts assume that the present tariffs will be maintained,
and assurances have been obtained that they will not be reduced during the
project period without the Bank's agreement.  Other assumptions are detailed
in Annex 14. The effect of the improvement and expansion of the telephone



- 1'1 --
system particularly in the long distance network is evident in the rates
of return, which improve from a negative figure in FY 1970 to 13.8% in
FY 1977. To ensure that internal cash generation is sufficient to meet
the requirements of the financing plan, make an adequate contribution to
future expansion, and pay interest on Government Equity, P&T will be
required to earn an annual rate of return on net telecommunications
assets of no less than 10% by FY 1975 and 12% thereafter. The Adminis-
tration has undertaken to approve any tariff changes needed to ach.ieve
these rates of return and to consult with the Bank before reducing tariffs
during the project period.
Future Financial Position
6.14      Postal tariffs were revised and increased in April 1971, and
the postal service is expected to generate operating surpluses sufTicient
to meet its future development requirements and to contribute its s3hare
to the dividend to be paid on Government Equity. The service has nlo
outstanding debt liability.
6.15      Actual and forecast balance sheets for P&T covering the liscal
years 1970-1977 are given in Annex 17, and explanations and assumpnions
in Annex 18. The projections show the rapid expansion of telecominiwdca-
tions, with the value of net fixed assets increasing to more than i'ive
times the FY 1970 figure. Retained earnings are expected to build up at
an even greater rate and by FY 1977 should make up more than a third of
the total equity.
6.16      The debt/equity ratio in 1971 was 7/93 and borrowings over the
forecast period will raise it to only 28/72 in 1977. Debt service cover-
age is not expected to fall below 5.1 times during the period under review;
nevertheless, it has been considered prudent to include in the loan agree-
ment a covenant prohibiting the incurrence of further long-term de'bt
without Bank approval unless annual net revenues cover maxinrun future debt
service at least twice.

7.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  The Borrower shall ensure that its Posts and Telegraphs
Department obtains Bank's agreement before cowmitting
itself to any non-proJect capital expenditure exceeding
Us$0.5 million in any one fiscal year (paragraph 3.02);
(b) The Borrower will employ engineering consultants
acceptable to the Bank (paragraph 5.03);
(c) Telecommunications tariffs will be set to yield a rate
of return on net telecommunications assets in operation
of at least 10% by Fr 1975 and 12% thereafter (paragraph
6.13); and
(d) No debt will be incurred in respect of P&T unless debt
service is covered at least 2.0 times by annual net revenues
(paragraph 6.16).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$10.0 million for a term of 20 years including a four-year
grace period.

Internal Economic Rate of Return
1.        The table below shows the cost and benefit streams for the
proposed project over a period of 20 years, the assumed life of the
project.
2.        Construction costs are based on current equipment prices which
are not expected to vary significantly. Income and expenditure fore-
casts have been analyzed to extract costs and reveuies attributable to
the project. Operating cost figures exclude depreciation.
3.        The 20-year period is based on the average service life of
the various types of equipment and a residual financial value at the
end of the period has been assessed for plant items with longer service
lives.

economic rate of return of 17.3%.
5.        Assuming the possible, but unlikely, event of a delay of one
year in completing the project and a reduction of 10% in attributable
revenues, the rate of return would be 14.8%.

Notes on Income and Expenditure Forecasts
Installation Fees - Based on new installations during each year.
Rentals            - Based on average subscribers for each year but with
rental per subscriber reduced as manual exchanges are
phased out.
Local and Trunk Calls - Based on average subscribers per year but with
calling rates increasing with introduction of STD and
extension of network.
International Calls - Based on traffic and circuit provision forecast.
Average minutes per call assumed to fall from 5 to 4
with introduction of STD to Australia in 1973/74.
Terminal charges assumed to continue at 30 cents per
minute originating calls and 25 cents per minute
terminating calls.
Telegraph          - Growth assumed in the period 1972-1975 with opening
of new offices. Thereafter the expansion of telex
service will limit growth of telegraph traffic.
Telex             - Rentals (including installation fees) based on Tore-
casts of subscribers by years. Call charges based on
traffic and circuit provision forecasts.
Miscellaneous      - Includes repayable works, radio call rentals, maintenance
of broadcasting equipment and minor items. A small rate
of growth is assumed for these works.
Operation         - Assumed to increase by 10% in 1972, 4% per annum in
1973-1975 as STD and automatic exchanges replace manual
working, and 8% per annum thereafter.
Maintenance        - Assumed to rise 10% per annum.
General and Administration - Assumed to rise 8% per annum, but A$50,000
added in 1973 to cover extra costs of changing from
quarterly to monthly billing.
Provision for Pensions - Reduces as expatriate officers are replaced by
local officers on lover scales or by contract officers.
Net Income - Postal - Represents the forecast operating surpluses from the
postal services. Growth is based on planned expansion
of rural services and increasing use of the service by
indigenes.

ANNEX 18
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS DEPARTMENT
Notes on Balance Sheet Forecasts
Assets under Construction - 1971 figure is inflated by the Bougainville-
Rabaul-Lae microwave route which was almost ready for
service at the and of the year. Other forecasts are
based on expected cut over dates for major installations.
Stores             - Expected to increase, but at a slower rate than the
expansion of the system.
Debtors            - Telephone debtors decrease in 1973 and 1974 with the
phased introduction of monthly billing instead of
quarterly as at present.
Government Equity - This is made up of past and proposed Treasury Advances
for capital development. No further advances are
expected after 1973. As of the end of FY 1971 the
Government Equity figure was divided:
Telecommunications  A$17,382,000
Postal                  1X,1 56,ooo
A$18,538,ooo
Advances after FY 1971 are in respect of telecommuni-
cations development.
Provision for Long Leave - The provision was introduced in the first
commercial accounts to cover accrued entitlement to
bonus periods of home leave for expatriates after each
six years of service. The provision is gradually
reduced as the numbers of expatriates on permanent
terms declines.
Pension Fund       - No provision or fund for pensions is shown since
annual provisions are remitted to the Australian
Treasury which funds all Territory pensions.
Future Loan        - A further Bank-type loan of about A$8 million is
assumed to assist in the 1976-1978 further development
program.
