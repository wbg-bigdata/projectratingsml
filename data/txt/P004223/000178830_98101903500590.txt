NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD
SUMrARY
i.        At the request of the National Electricity Board (NEB) an
electric Dower project has been appraised which consists of: the Second
Stage of the Prai Steam Station; the Second Stage of the Port Dickson
Steam Station and, transmission lines and associated substations to
deliver the power to the load centers.
ii.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$29 million.
The generating plant for the Port Dickson station is expected to be financed
from US$10.1 million of bilateral credits.   The proposed Bank loan to NEB
would cover the foreign exchange costs of the Second Stage of the Prai Sta-
tion, miscellaneous items for the Port Dickson Station, the transmission ex-
pansion, and interest during construction, to give a loan amount of USt11.5
million. The remainder of the project financing would be provided by about
US$7.4 million from TEB's own resources.   All orders for equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
iii.      The Project is needed to meet the growing demand for power on
IWEB's interconnected system and it is the most economic means of meeting
this demand.
iv.       NEB is organized as a modern public utility corporation and has
a high degree of autonomy. Its stock is almost entirely owned by the
M4alaysian Government. The financial record of NEB is good and its present
Position is sound. The financing plan for the period covering the pro-
nosed Project is satisfactory. Net internal cash generation is expected to
finance about 45% of its capital requirements during the next five years.
Contributions towards construction by the Government and consumers would
raise the financing from sources other than borrowings to almost 53%. NEB
is expected to earn a satisfactory average return of 8.5% on net fixed assets
in operation during the next five years.
v.        The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$11.5 million for a
period of 20 years, including a grace period of four years.

PORT DICKSON AND PRAI EXPANSION PROJECT
(FOURTH POWER PROJECT)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project of the National
Electricity Board of Malaysia (NEB), consisting of the Second Stage of the
Prai Thermal Station with a capacity of 30 Mw, the Second Stage of the
Port Dickson Thermal Station with a capacity of 120 Mw, and the construc-
tion of associated transmission facilities.
1.02      The estimated cost of the Project is about M$87 million (US$29
million). The estimated foreign exchange cost, including interest during
construction, is M$72.6 million (US$24.2 million). The Bank has been re-
quested to finance M$34.5 million (US$11.5 million) of the foreign exchange
cost. The remainder is to be financed from bilateral credit sources and
from NEB's cash generation.
1.03      The Borrower would be the NEB to which the Bank has made three
loans amounting to US$117.5 million. The first loan (210-MA) of US$28.6
million, net of cancellations, was made in September 1958 for the first
stage of the Cameron Highlands hydroelectric scheme. A second loan (350-MA)
of US$51.9 million was made in July 1963 for the second stage of the Cameron
Highlands scheme, the first stage of the Prai Thermal Station, and the ex-
pansion of transmission facilities. In July 1966 a third loan (458-MA) of
US$37 million was made for the first stage of the Port Dickson Thermal Sta-
tion, the installation of additional generating units at the Cameron Hiigh-
lands hydroelectric scheme, the second stage of Johore Bahru and the exnansion
of transmission facilities. Projects covered by the first two loans have
been completed and are operating satisfactorily. Construction of the project
covered by the third loan is proceeding very well and completion is expected
to be on schedule.
1.04      The Project is the next logical step in the expansion of the NEB
facilities. It was first discussed with the NEB in Mtarch 1968 during a
project supervision inspection in connection with previous Bank loans. An
application for a loan was received in May 1968 and Mr. R.V. Sear visited
Malaysia in July 1968 to appraise the Project. This report is based on his
findings and on information supplied by the NEB and its Consultants, Messrs.
Preece, Cardew & Rider of London. It has been prepared by Messrs. R.V. Sear
and C. de Beaufort.
2. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
2.01      Malaysia consists of the peninsula of Malaya (West Malaysia)
which lies between Thailand and the equator, and the States of Sarawak and
Sabah on the Island of Borneo (East Malaysia). The aggregate area of



Malaysia is about 145,000 square miles and it has a population of about 10
million.
2.02      Malaya (West Malaysia) which is the part of Malaysia with which
this report is concerned covers an area of some 68,000 square miles and
has a population of about 8.3 million. A mountain range which divides the
country over almost its entire length runs parallel to and about 50 miles
from the west coast to form a continuous watershed from the Thailand border
to Malacca. The population and commercial life of the country is concen-
trated mainly in coastal areas on the western side of the mountain range.
2.03      Malaysia has no significant deposits of fossil fuels but it has
an abundant rainfall and a number of water resources which could be de-
veloped to provide hydroelectric power. Most of these are situated on the
eastern side of the mountain range in areas remote from load centers. There
are however resources which can be developed to supply load centers on the
western side of the country, and one of these is the Cameron Highlands
which has been developed with Bank assistance. A number of water resources
are currently being studied.
2.o4      Historically the exports of tin and rubber have been the major
source of growth for the economy of Malaysia. In the first half of the 1960's
the Gross National Product maintained a rise averaging 6-1/2% a year mainly
because of rapidly expanding public expenditures. Sharp drops in Malaysia's
major export prices, especially of rubber and tin slowed down the growth rate
considerably in the past two years to slightly below four per cent a year.
The outlook for the immediate future is for a slight improvement, though still
for a slower growth rate of GNP than in the first half of the 1960's. Public
expenditures are expected to rise less fast. However, the development of
manufacturing industries which has been moving forward rapidly during the
last few years is likely progressively to make a significant contribution
toward com=ensating for loss in the rubber and tin industries.
2.05      Electric power in Malaysia is provided principally by the NEB
which serves the whole peninsula of Mlalaya with the exception of Penang
Island which is supplied by a municipally owned plant and part of the State
of Perak which is supplied by the Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company
(PRHE). The two States on the Island of Borneo are supplied by the Govern-
ment owned statutory authorities, the Sabah Electricity Board and the Sarawak
Electricity Supply Corporation. The installed capacity of the entities is
shown below.

Facilities of the NEB
2.06      NEB's total generating capacity of 564 Mw is made up of 264 Mw
of hydroelectric plant and 300 Mw of thermal plant. Details of the plants
are given in Annex 1. An additional 150 Mw of thermal plant is under con-
struction under Loan 458-MA and is scheduled to go into service in 1969.
This will bring the total installed capacity to 714 Mw. The proposed
project would add another 150 Mw by 1973 and bring the total installed
capacity to 864 Mw.
2.07      Nearly all of NEB's generating capacity supplies the Intercon-
nected System which covers most of the western side of the peninsula and
the Southern System around Johore Bahru (see Map). About 50 small isolated
systems in other parts of the country are supplied by diesel generating
plants with an aggregate capacity of about 60 Mw.
2.08      The Interconnected System is connected to the PRHE System.     Under
the terms of an agreement recently signed PRHE will purchase power in bulk
from the NEB to meet its requirements in excess of that produced by its own
generation plants (see Paragraph 2.11). The NEB interconnected system is
also connected to the Penang City Council System but power is only exchanged
in an emergency.
2.09      The NEB's hydroelectric plants have only limited storage capacity.
Because of this the firm capacity of the Interconnected System was reduced
during the 1968 dry season from the plant rating of 444 Mw to 309 Mw.
Annex 2 shows the existing and proposed system installed capacity, dry sea-
son capacity and dry season firm capacity.
2.10      NEB's main transmission system, some 450 route miles in length,
operates at 132 Kv. It also has about 300 miles of 66 Kv and 435 miles of
33 Kv transmission lines. Distribution is carried out at 22 Kv and 11 Kv
by some 1,600 miles of overhead lines and underground cables. Substation
capacity is in excess of 1,700,000 Kva.
Perak River Hydroelectric Company (PRHE)
2.11      This Company supplies part of the State of Perak under a con-
cession granted in 1926 which extends until 2006. The Malaysian Government
holds 51% of the shares of the Company and has the option to acquire the
CDmpany in 1976 or at ten year intervals thereafter. The Government has
not yet declared whether or not it will acquire the Company in 1976 but if
it does the Company would probably be handed over to the NEB in exchange
for an issue of NEB shares. The Company is NEB's largest customer and a
long-term contract was recently signed for a bulk supply to enable it to
meet its requirements in excess of that produced by its own generating
plants. The Company's generating plant is old and inefficient and only
produces about 640 million kwh per year. At the present time about 260
million kwh per year are purchased from the NEB and it is estimated that
this will increase to about 800 million kwh per year by 1975-76.



Penang City Council
2.12      Special provisions were made in the Electricity Ordinance of 1949
for the Penang City Council to continue to operate its own electricity
system to supply the Island of Penang. It has a 40 Mw thermal generating
station which was constructed in 1967 and which is interconnected with the
NEB system by 33 Kv and 11 Kv submarine cables.
3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be the NEB, which was established in 1949 by
the Government under the provisions of the Electricity Ordinance enacted
that year.
3.02      The NEB is organized and functions as a modern public utility
corporation and has a high degree of autonomy. It is both a regulatory and
operating agency. It is charged with the operation of the electric instal-
lations under its jurisdiction and the establishment of such new facilities
as may be required. It regulates the production and use of electric energy
in Malaya and grants licenses for the installation and operation of independent
electricity works to be used for public or private purposes. The NEB has the
power to set electricity tariffs without reference to other authority (see
paragraph 3.09).
3.03      The Board of Directors of the NEB consists of a Chairman, Deputy
Chairman and not more than ten or less than five other members. At the
present time there are nine members. All members, with the exception of
the Deputy Chairman who is also the General Manager, serve in a part-time
capacity. Members are appointed by the Minister of Commerce and Industry
for terms and subject to conditions, as he may determine. The present
members are prominent in the political, labor and business communities and
have been associated with the NEB for from three to five years.
3.04      Over the course of time the NEB has developed into a well or-
ganized and operated utility. In the past, most key positions were occu-
pied by foreigners, chiefly of British nationality. Following independence
in 1957, the Government established the principle of Malayanization and by
the end of 1967 all key positions were held by Malaysians. Only four for-
eigners remain in advisory appointments which are expected to be terminated
by the end of 1968.
3.05      Although most of the senior staff now in key positions have only
held such posts for a relatively short period their performance to date has
generally been satisfactory. It is, however, too early to make a meaning-
ful judgment and the matter should be given special attention during project
supervision visits. During negotiations assurances were obtained that dur-
ing the life of the loan the Bank will continue to be consulted before
appointments are made to the positions of General Manager, Chief Engineer
and Chief Financial Officer.



3.o6      The policy of Malayanization was accompanied by a program of in-
tensive professional training. Many potential officers and supervisory
personnel were sent abroad, principally to the United Kingdom, for train-
ing and have since assumed their new responsibilities. The Board has its
own training center which has recently expanded its activities to include
training programs for senior supervisory staff which terminate in a period
of training abroad, as well as training programs for technicians, clerical
staff, trade apprentices and plant operators. About 84 technicians, 40
clerks, and 220 trade apprentices and plant operators are presently under-
going training. The training programs are comprehensive in scope and well
administered. The NEB has approximately 8,700 employees which may be clas-
sified as follows:
(a)  Management, professional engineers and accountants        305
(b)  Technical monthly paid staff                            1,632
(c)  Non-technical monthly paid staff                        1,858
(d)  Semi-skilled and unskilled workers                      4,902
Total               8,697
During the negotiations NEB confirmed that it intends to continue the train-
ing program.
3.07      The ratio of consumers per employee is low, mainly because NEB's
activities cover the whole peninsula of M4alaya which has many isolated com-
munities supplied by their own diesel generating plant and also because of the
amount of construction work carried out by the NEB's staff. The NEB is well
aware of the situation and is taking steps to improve the ratio by keeping
the number of new posts approved to a minimum and by increasing efficiency.
The expansion of transmission facilities now taking place which will eliminate
a number of diesel generating plants will help to improve the ratio. During
the negotiations the matter was discussed with the NEB and an assurance was
obtained that it will continue to improve the situation.
3.08      On the basis of its past performance the NEB, with the assistance
of its Consulting Engineers, Preece, Cardew & Rider of London, is considered
fully capable of carrying out the construction of the Project. The Board
is also considered to be fully capable of operating the Project efficiently
after its completion.
Tariffs
3.09      Under the Ordinance the NEB has power to fix tariffs without
reference to any other authority. In practice the Minister of Commerce
and Industry is consulted and he has the right to give the Board directions
of a general character not inconsistent with the provisions of the Ordi-
nance. These provisions require that total revenues must be sufficient to
meet total outgoings Droperly chargeable to revenue, including depreciation
and interest on capital, taking one year with another. This provision is
regarded as determining the minimum level of tariffs. The NEB's stated



policy is to produce a return on its average net fixed assets in operation
of at least eight per cent per annum and to endeavor to finance about 40% of
canital requirements out of internal resources.
3.10      Under Loan 458-MA, the NEB is required to maintain tariffs suffi-
cient to yield, together with revenues from other sources, a return of not less
than eight per cent on its average net fixed assets in operation. The return
is calculated by relating "net income" from operations to average net fixed
assets in operation after deducting accumulated depreciation, Government con-
tributions for rural electrification, and consumers' contributions towards
construction. During negotiations agreement was reached on a continuation of
this requirement under the proposed loan (see also paragraph 6.10).
3.11      There have been only two tariff changes since 1960.    The first oc-
curred in 1964 when tariffs were lowered after the completion of the Cameron
Highlands hydroelectric scheme (Loan 210-M4A). This resulted in a reduction in
revenues by about M$1.3 million per annum or about two per cent. In 1967 the
'4inister exercised his right under the Ordinance and directed the NEB to in-
troduce a new tariff for large industry to assist the Government's efforts to
promote industrial development (paragraph 5.04). The NEB engaged a tariff
specialist, D.C. Bolton of England, to make a study of its entire tariff struc-
ture. As a result of this study and recommendations by the consultant a spe-
cial tariff (known as Tariff R) was introduced in August 1967 for large indus-
try. At the present time only six consumers qualify for this tariff. Sales
to these consumers represent only 3.2% of the NEB's total sales and 1.7% of
gross revenue.
3.12      The other recommendations of the consultant's report refer to sim-
plification of the tariff structures and these are now being studied by the
NFB. No changes in tariffs are expected for at least two years and any that
are made are not expected to result in any loss in total revenue.
Accounting and Audit
3.13      The NEB has a modern and efficient accounting organization with an
adequate and well qualified staff. The NEB's auditors since its inception in
1949 have been Price Waterhouse & Co. Besides carrying out the annual audit,
the firm has from time to time been engaged to advise on accounting methods
and procedures.  The Board in 1966 appointed a t4alaysian firm of auditors,
Mlessrs. Hanafiah, Raslan, Ong and Mahomad, to carry out the audit of about 23
ont of a total of 60 isolated locations on the NEB system. The audit as a
whole continues to be done by Price Waterhouse & Co. who have been reapnointed
for the 1968 audits. During negotiations an assurance was obtained that the
NEB will continue to emDloy independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Canital Structure and Financial Position
3.114     Summaries of the NEB's audited balance sheets as of the end of August
1963 through 1967 and of the Dreliminary 1968 balance sheet are given in Annex 3.



3.15      The NEB's capital structure and financial position are generally
sound and its negative current position is manageable (paragraph 3.20).

3.17      With the exception of M$3 million held by the Pahang State Govern-
ment, the ordinary stock of the NEB is owned by the Malaysian Government.
The stock pays dividends which under the Ordinance cannot exceed six per cent
per annum on its face value.   The dividend has been set at five per cent since
1962/63.
3.18      Reserves comprise the General Reserve and Capital Development Ac-
count, which represent the accumulated earned surplus to date.
3.19      Details of the long-term debt are given in Annex 4.    Of the total
debt 63% is owed to the Bank under the following loans:
(i)  Loan 210-MA for UJS$28.6 million, net of cancellations, at an inter-
est rate of 5-3/4% made in 1958;
(ii)  Loan 350-MA for US$51.9 million at an interest rate of 5-1/2% made
in 1963;
(iii) Loan 458-MA for US$37.0 million at an interest rate of six per cent
made in 1966.
3.20      At the end of August 1968 the current ratio was 0.8:1.0, current
liabilities exceeding current assets by M$14.3 million. But in view of the
composition of the current liabilities which include M$14.9 million of cus-
tomers' deposits and M$11.3 million of long-term debt maturities which are
spread evenly over the fiscal year 1968/69, no serious cash problems are
expected.
3.21      At the end of August 1968 the overdraft included under Current Lia-
bilities amounted to only M$t million, as compared with a peak of M$13 million
reached in 1965. The overdraft facilities consist of M$9 million from the
Chartered Bank and M$6 million from the Chase Manhattan Bank, both secured by
a Government guarantee. In order to prevent an excessive use of these fa-
cilities the NEB undertook, in connection with Loan 458-MA, not to use bank
overdrafts or other short-term money to finance capital expenditures except as
an interim measure pending receipt of long-term finance. The NEB again agreed
during the negotiations not to draw in excess of M$10 million against the
overdraft facilities without advising the Bank and stated that it was NEB's
policy to keep overdraft drawings to a minimum and not to use them to finance
capital expenditures.
Earnings Record
3.22      Income statements for the six fiscal years 1962/63 through 1°67/68
are included in Annex 5 and the annual percentages for the Return on Net Plant
and the Operating Ratio for these years are included in Annex 6.
3.23      The average return on net fixed assets in operation for the six-year
period was 9.4A well above the minimum rate of eight per cent agreed upon be-
tween the Bank and the NEB under loans 350-TMA and 458-MA. Depreciation is
calculated on a straight line basis and the provisions made are adequate.



- 9 -
3.24      The Operating Ratio shows a steady decline from 78.0% in 1962/63
to 68.1% in 1966/67 and, mainly because of increased fuel costs, an increase
to 69.0% in 1967/68.   The improvement in the Operating Ratio is largely due
to the coming into operation of Cameron Highlands' hydro plants in 1963 and
1967. These ratios show that operating costs are reasonable.
3.25      Revenues during the last year of the Deriod were 91% above those
during the first year. Because of the improvement in the operating ratio net
income from operations showed an even larger increase of 170%.
4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project proposed for Bank financing constitutes 14% of the
NEB's 1968-1972 expansion program. It consists of the construction of:
a)   The Second Stage of the Prai Thermal Power Station with an
installed capacity of 30 Mw. Scheduled for service in 1970.
b)   The Second Stage of the Port Dickson Power Station with an
installed capacity of 120 Mw. Scheduled for service in 1972.
c)   Transmission lines and associated substations to deliver the
additional power generated at the two stations to the load
centers.
The remainder of NEB's expansion program consists of, (a) the completion of
works now under construction under Loan 458-MA (paragraph 2.06), (b) distribu-
tion system expansion and (c) the addition of small diesel generating units at
some isolated localities.
A.   Prai Thermal Power Station
4.02      The first stage of the Prai Station, with 2-30 Mw generating
units was financed by Loan 350-MA. It was planned for an ultimate capacity
of 270 Mw but initially foundations and buildings were only provided for
3-30 Mw generating units, two of which have been in satisfactory service
since May 1967.
4.03      The Second Stage consists of the installation of the third 30 Mw
generating unit on the existing foundations and the construction of asso-
ciated cooling water and control facilities. The unit would be identical
in specifications to the two existing units, and consists of a 300,000 lbs
per hour boiler designed to operate with steam conditions of 925 psi and
925°F and a turbo-alternator with a maximum continuous rating of 30 Mw.

4.04      The estimated cost of the Second Stage is based upon the known cost
of the First Stage plus allowance for price increases.   A summary of the cost
estimates, which are realistic, is as follows:

B.   Port Dickson Thermal Power Station
4.05      The First Stage of the Port Dickson Station which is being finan-
ced by Loan 458-MA and is now under construction will consist of 2-60 Mw
generating units which are scheduled to be in service by mid-1969. After
some initial delays due to piling difficulties, construction of this project
is progressing satisfactorily and the completion date is expected to be met.
This station was planned for 4-60 Mw units and the site is adequate for fur-
ther extensions to accommodate 4-120 Mw units.
4.o6      The Second Stage of this station comprises the construction of an
extension to the power house with the necessary foundations for the plant,
a smoke stack and the installation of two boilers and two turbo-alternator
sets with associated cooling water and control facilities. The units would
each have a capacity of 60 Mw and would be identical in specifications to
the two units now being installed. Each unit would consist of a boiler with
a maximum continuous rating of 550,000 lbs per hour and with steam condi-
tions of 925 psig and 9150F. The turbo-alternator will have a maximum con-
tLnuous rating of 60 Mw.
4.07      The estimated cost of the Second Stage is based upon the cost of
the First Stage now under construction plus allowances for price increases.

C.   Transmission Lines and Substations
4.o8      In order to transmit the power generated by the additional plant
at the Prai and Port Dickson Stations it will be necessary to extend and
modify existing transmission lines.
4.09      This work consists of constructing the second 132 kv circuit be-
tween Prai Station and Papan and the conversion of the 132 kv circuits be-
tween Port Dickson and Kuala Lumpur south to 275 kv operation. These lines
are shown on the MaD.
4.10      The cost estimates for this work, based upon the known costs of

Bilateral Financing
4.ll      The borrower has agreed to obtain the financing for the generating
plant for the Port Dickson Second Stage from bilateral sources. The borrower
intends to invite international tenders for all goods whether financed from
Bank funds or from bilateral sources. The invitations to tender for goods to
be financed from bilateral sources will stipulate that financing terms must
be stated along with the offer to supply the goods. Discussions were held
during the appraisal mission with a representative of the Malaysian Government
Treasury, the NEB and their Consultants Preece Cardew & Rider of London to de-
termine the most suitable division of financing between bilateral sources and
the Bank. The following was accepted by all parties concerned:
Approximate Foreign Fxchange Cost
(i)  IBRD Loan
Prai Plant, Transmission system                    T-634.5 million
expansion and miscellaneous items for             (US$11.5 million)
Port Dickson Plant
(ii)  Bilateral Financing
Port Dickson Turbines, Boilers and Steel           '4$38 million
Structures                                        (US$12.7 million)
Tt is assumed that NEB would pay about lO{ down and the
interest during construction from its own resources.
Therefore the actual credit amount received would be
M$30.3 million (US$10.1 million) and NEB would finance
T4t7.8 million (US$2.6 million) from its cash generation.
4.12      The criteria used were to provide financing for offshore or
foreign costs only and assume that the WEB would meet all local costs and
the down payments and interest on the bilateral credits; then to seek
easily identifiable large items which could be financed as a unit or
package by the bilateral lenders. However, there is insufficient time left
to negotiate bilateral credits for the Prai Thermal Plant extension and its
offshore cost is therefore to be financed entirely by the Bank. Finally, the
transmission system expansion and the miscellaneous items at Port Dickson were
included in the proposed Bank loan because they consist of a number of com-
Daratively small items or units unsuitable for bilateral financing.
h.13      On the basis of the above, the breakdown of the cost estimate for
the Port Dickson Plant Second Stage would be as follows:

4.14      In order to avoid a partial completion of the Port Dickson project and
since the major pieces of equipment are to be obtained through bilateral financ-
ing, the loan agreement requires the securing of supplementary financing sat-
isfactory to the Bank, before disbursements are made from the Bank Loan for
this portion of the Project.
D.   Summary of Cost Estimates
4.15      The cost estimates for the various items in the Project and a break-
down for the financing of the foreign costs, are summarized below:

Foreign exchange costs assumed to be met out of NEB's cash generation consist
of down payments (US$1.2 million) and interest during construction (US$1.4
million) on the bilateral credits.
E.   Engineering, Construction and Procurement
4.16      The NEB has retained its principal consultants Preece, Cardew & Rider,
of London (PCR) for the project under arrangements previously found satisfac-
tory to carry out engineering, construction supervision and evaluation of bids.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that the NEB will continue to
use consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
4.17      Construction will be carried out by contractors and the suppliers of
equipment. The transmission line work will be done by NEB crews which are
capable of undertaking the work. These arrangements are satisfactory.



- 15 -
4.18      All orders for equipment would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding. Some tenders are to be invited before the proposed
loan is made in order to meet construction schedules, but no contracts are ex-
pected to be awarded before the loan is signed. Any expenditures made prior to
the date of the loan signing will not be eligible for reimbursement. Exceot
for interest during construction, disbursements would be made against presen-
tation of the usual documents evidencing the expenditure of foreign exchange
for equipment, materials and services. If savings are made any excess loan
funds will be available for cancellation.
4.19      The construction schedule is designed to achieve completion of the
project in time to meet the forecast system demand, shown in Annexes 2 & 7.
The schedule is reasonable and calls for completion of the Prai Second Stage by
the end of 1970 and the Port Dickson Second Stage by mid-1972. In both cases
the transmission lines extensions would also be ready by the completion dates
of the respective plants. It is expected that this schedule will be met.
Future Expansion Program
4.20      Future expansion beyond that contemplated under the present program
has been continuously studied by the NEB and it has engaged consultants to
continue this work and to pay particular attention to specific projects.
4.21      One of the projects is the Upper Perak Hydroelectric Development.
This scheme would consist of an initial hydroelectric plant of 192 Mw installed
capacity with a dam to create a storage reservoir which would regulate the river
downstream and facilitate further hydroelectric developments. This scheme has
been studied by the Shawinigan Engineering Company Ltd., Canada, and up to the
present the power benefits have been considered marginal by the Bank. However,
further studies are being carried out by the consultants and NEB to determine
if other benefits, such as flood control could be attributed to the project.
It is unlikely that a decision will be made before 1970 and if NEB then de-
cides to construct the project the earliest completion date would be 1975-76.
4.22      As the proposed project for Bank financing would only meet forecast
power demand until about 1973, NEB's consultant, PCR, have tentatively recom-
mended the third stage of the Port Dickson Thermal Station which would consist
of 2-120 M4w units (Nos. 5 and 6) as the next development to meet forecast de-
mand up to 1975-76 when the Upper Perak Hydroelectric Development or some other
power expansion project would be in operation. Until the studies on system
Jevelopment now being carried out are completed it is impossible to say pre-
cisely what the next stage of development should be.
5. J1JSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
A.   Estimate of Sales
5.01      The power market served by NEB, has had a long history of steady and
substantial growth. Since 1960 the average annual increase in total power sales



- 16 -
has been 13.5% and during the past five years the rate has been 14.1%. The an-
nual rate of growth in sales for the next four years may be somewhat lower as
explained in paragraph 5.06.
5.02      In 1966-67 NEB had total sales of 1,373 million kwh, divided among
the various categories of consumers as follows: Domestic 14.8%, Commercial
34.4%, Industrial 25.7'^ and Mining 25.1%.
5.03     IWEB, with the assistance of consultants, PCR, has made very complete
studies of its load statistics and based on the trends shown in the past along
with known new developments for the next four years, has prepared a realistic
forecast of future sales and system demand to 1976. See Annex 8 for details.
5.04      Power sales to the general industrial section have been increasing
at an annual rate of about 17% during the past five years.    The Map shows the
location of industrial zones which have been established by the Government
to encourage external investment in industrial facilities and which are ex-
pected to foster industrial growth. During the past five years industry's
share of NEB's total sales has risen from 22.5% to 25.7% and is forecast to
increase to 27% by 1976.
5.05      Tin mining is a very important activity in Malaysia.    During the past
five years its share of the total power sales has dropped from 30% to 25%.
While the present demand is expected to remain about constant, its share of
total sales would decline to about 11% by 1976. From NEB's point of view this
is a helpful trend because the tin mining demand is very sensitive to fluctua-
tions in tin prices.
5.06      Total sales for 1967/68 show an increase of about 29% over 1966/67.
This is largely due to the agreement reached during the year with the PRHE to
sell it power in bulk, representing an increase of over 11% in NEB's total
sales. (See paragraph 2.11.) For 1968/69 and 1969/70 annual increases in
total sales are forecast at about 13%, which is close to the average growth
rates achieved during the past ten years. In 1970-71 some decline in the an-
nual growth rate to about 10% is forecast to reflect the anticiDated economic
slowdown caused by the withdrawal of the British forces from Malaysia. From
1971/72 to 1975/76 annual growth rates are forecast at a conservative level of
about 12%o. These forecasts are considered realistic and if economic activity
in Malaysia continues at the level of the past 5 years, the sales achieved
could well be about 10% higher than forecast.
5.07      In order to assess the probable effect of a simultaneous drop in tin
and rubber prices along with the withdrawal of the British forces, a low or
pessimistic forecast was made. See Annex 9. This shows that the growth rate
in 1969-1970 could fall from 13'0 to 10% and to 9% in 1971. However, after that
the growth rate is forecast to recover to the conservative level of 12% given
in the higher forecast. In the long term the measures being taken by the
Government to foster industrial development and the diversification of agri-
cultural products - palm oil and other crops are now being cultivated in some
areas nreviously given over exclusively to rubber production - will help to
offset adverse trends resulting from tin and rubber price declines.

Estimate of System Demand
5.o8      Climatic conditions in Malaysia give rise to a very steady system
load throughout the year. The use of air conditioning and the twenty-four
hour per day tin mining load combine to reduce the difference between holiday
and workday demands. Annex 10 shows a typical load curve. The factors men-
tioned above give rise to an exceptionally high system load factor of about
73%. This would tend to decrease with the growth of the percentage of total
sales going to industry. However, it is forecast to remain at about 70% for
at least the next eight years.
5.09      The forecast of system demand has also been prepared based on the
"normal" and "low" sales forecasts, discussed in paragraphs 5.06 and 5.07.
Annex 7 shows the demand forecasts along with the proposed additions to gen-
erating capacity. It shows an average increase in peak demand during the next
four years of 12.4% for "normal" growth and 11.4% for the "low" growth rate.
Based on the detailed study made by NEB it is considered most unlikely that
growth in demand would fall below the "low" forecast during the next four years.
C.        Plant Operations
5.10      The NEB Interconnected System, shown in the Map and Annex 2, consists
at present of 264 Mw of hydro plants and 180 Mw of thermal plants. Another
120 Mw of thermal plant is under construction at the Port Dickson Station which
will bring the thermal plant capacity to 300 Mw by 1969 for the interconnected
system.
5.11      The hydro plants are generally used for peaking purposes and the
thermal plants supply the base load. However, during periods of plentiful
water supply, hydro plants are used to supply base load to save fuel and to
enable thermal units to be taken out of service for essential maintenance work.
5.12      NEB has made detailed studies and schedules for the operations of
its plants to meet system demand during dry and wet periods and to enable plant
maintenance to be carried out. On the basis of these studies and the experi-
ence in operating the system the dry season firm capacity of the interconnected
system has been established as shown in Annexes 2 and 7. It will be seen from
this that the proposed additions of generating plant capacity are essential to
meet forecast system demand for either the normal or the low forecast. During
1969 and 1970 the dry season firm capacity is just sufficient to meet the nor-
mnal load forecast if Port Dickson units 1 and 2 and Prai unit 3 come into serv-
ice on schedule. In 1971 the situation again becomes tight until Port Dickson
units 3 and 4 come into service in 1972 and 1973. The forecast also shows that
construction of units 5 and 6 at Port Dickson should be started before the
present project is completed if power shortages are to be avoided in 1974 and
1975.



- 18 -
D.   Choice of New Generating Capacity
5.13      The major load center of the Interconnected System is at Kuala Lumpur,
hence the Port Dickson Station is being developed as the major thermal station.
However, due to the length of the Interconnected System and the increasing
PRHE load the 30 Mw unit proposed for Prai is required to maintain a stable
system and reduce spare generating capacity to a minimum.
5.14      The two additions to generating plant capacity in this project both
consist of the expansion of existing stations where some of the facilities re-
quired for the plant additions already exist and would be used in common with
existing generating units. Indeed, the two stations were planned on the as-
sumption that they would be extended, they are the latest thermal stations
to be constructed by the NEB and they are efficient and up-to-date for the
size and type of equipment installed. The extension of these stations by
adding units of similar specification to those previously installed is the
most economic compared with any other alternative thermal plant expansion.
There are no immediately available hydroelectric sites which could be de-
veloped in time to meet the forecast demand. The next potential hydroelectric
project, the Upper Perak Hydroelectric Scheme (see paragraph 4.21) is still
being studied. It would not be in operation before 1975 or 1976 if work was
started in 1969.
E.   Rate of Return
5.15      The part of NEB's system affected by the project is the intercon-
nected network along the west coast. This network is supplied by both thermal
and hydroelectric plants, as shown in the Map. Therefore the output of each
plant on any particular day of the year to meet system demand will vary in
accordance with the amount of water available to the hydro plants. Preference
is always given to using water in hydro plants instead of im-ported fuel in
thermal plants so as to keep the cost of producing electrical energy to a
minimum. It is therefore not nossible to segregate the Droduction which can
be assigned to a particular plant during its life time in any meaningful way
because the entire combination of plants supplying the Interconnected System
is operated as a group and each plant is assigned functions from time to time
to achieve the maximum of efficiency for the entire system. Some idea of the
relative value of each plant may be obtained by comparing the cost of energy
generated.  It should, however, be kept in mind that even this is not an exact
comparison because the plant factor which varies during the year, influences
1-he cost per kwh of energy produced. The following table, based on a plant
factor of 605', shows that both Port Dickson and Prai stations produce power
at lower cost than the older thermal stations.
Cost of Kwh Produced
Station                     Cents of 'Malayan $  US$ cents
Port Dickson Units 1 & 2               1.5737            0.5246
Port Dickson Units 1 - 4               1.5259            0.5086
Prai [Jnits 1 - 2                      1.7307            0.5769
Prai Units 1 - 3                       1.7307            0.5769
Connaught Bridge                       2.4675            0.8225
Malacca                                2.5497            0.8499



- 19 -
5.16      It will be seen that some slight reduction in overall cost of power
produced is expected at Port Dickson when units 3 & 4 go into service. This
is principally due to the allocation of capital costs between the 4 units as
against the 2 units initially. There is no appreciable change to Prai Station
costs with the addition of the third unit.
5.17      Since the overall rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation for the NEB system as a whole is expected to average about 8.5% dur-
ing the period under consideration (1969-1973), it would be reasonable to
assume that the rate of return on the generating plant added to the system by
the project would be somewhat above the system average of 8.5%, because of its
lower production costs. This return values kwh sales at prevailing prices.
VI. FINANCING PLAN AND FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION
Financing Plan
6.01      A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the period August
31, 1968 - August 31, 1973 is given in Annex 11. The projections are based on:
(a) Sales of energy in accordance with the estimates given in paragraph
5.06.  (It should be noted that the last column is based on sales
under the lower forecast mentioned in paragraph 5.07.)
(b) Tariffs at the present level.
(c) Operating, administration and maintenance expenses based on present
costs for each method of generation, adjusted for fuel consumption
and increases in labor costs.
(d) Depreciation calculated by the straight-line method on principal cate-
gories of plant. The average annual charge is equivalent to between
three per cent and four per cent of the value of gross fixed assets.
(e)  Interest of 6-1/2% and commitment charges of 3/4% on the proposed
Bank loan which is assumed to be for a period of twenty years in-
cluding a grace period of four years. In view of the very substan-
tial contribution to the financing of the program from NEB's own
funds and the already existing tight cash position interest and
other charges during construction totalling US$1.2 million have have
included in the loan. Interest on the proposed bilateral financing
and on the overdraft has been assumed at seven per cent and on the
future loan at 6-1/2%. It has also been assumed that the bilateral
financing would be repaid in ten equal annual installments.
(f) Dividends at the present annual rate of five per cent.
(g) Transfer to the reserves of the entire surplus after interest and
dividends.
6.02      During the five-year period from August 31, 1968 through August 31,
1973 NEB should complete the developments financed by loan 350-MA, loan 458-MA
and the present project. It has been assumed that the construction on the third
stage of the Port Dickson plant would be started in 1971. Investments will also
have to be made in the diesel generating plants to supply isolated localities,
and the distribution system will require annual investments which have been
assumed to increase at the rate of five per cent per year.

- 21 -
6.o4      Internal cash generation, net of debt service and dividends, would
finance 45.3% of the application of funds. This is satisfactory and in accord-
ance with NEB's stated policy that its internal resources will finance 40% to
50% capital expenditure. Contributions by the Government and consumers to-
wards construction would raise the financing from sources other than borrowings
to 52.7%. The Financing Plan is satisfactory.
6.05      Borrowings totaling Mt274.8 million (US$9l.7 million) would consist
of:
(a) the undisbursed balances as of August 21, 1968 totaling us$44.8 mil-
lion of IBRD loans 350-MA and 458-MA.
(b)  the proposed Bank loan for US$ll.5 million which would finance 39.7%
of the total cost of the project.
(c)  bilateral financing of a part of the foreign costs of the project
estimated at M$30.3 million (US$10.1 million). This would cover
34.9% of the total cost of the project.
(d)  disbursements totaling M$75.8 million (US$25.3 million) under a fu-
ture loan which has been assumed to finance the third stage of the
Port Dickson plant.
6.o6      The bilateral financing mentioned under (c) has been discussed in
paragraph 4.11. The items of equipment to be financed by it are of a kind for
which satisfactory bilateral financing is normally available.
6.07      It is expected that NEB's current position will be quite tight dur-
ing the next three years so that increasing use will have to be made of the
overdraft facilities (naragraph 3.21). The projections show that a peak over-
draft of M8 million in 1971 would be fully renaid within two years.
6.o8      Under the lower forecast for energy sales as discussed in paragraph
5.07 operating revenues during the six-year period to August 31, 1973 would be
14t69.7 million lower than under the forecast on which the Financing Plan is
based. Lower operating costs, mainly through a reduction in fuel consumption,
would reduce the difference between the two forecasts as regards the internal
cash generation to M$14.7 million. Under the lower level of sales there would
be no need to increase the annual investments in the distribution system at the
rate of five per cent per year. Assuming that a rate of increase of three per
cent would be sufficient, the investments could be reduced by M$9.3 million.
6.09      As shown in the last columns of Annexes 5 and 11 the reduction in
operating costs and investments mentioned in the previous paragraph, would
compensate for all but MT5.4 million of the expected loss of revenues under
the lower forecast. There would still be a small but sufficient cash surnlus
over the six-year period and the financing of the project would remain secure.
Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.10      The income statement projections (Annex 5) and the table of financial
ratios (Annex 6) show that future earnings during the six years to August 1973



- 22 -
should be satisfactory. The rate of return which is expected to be 9.2% in
1967/1968 and 8.8% in 1968/1969, may decline to 7.6% during 1969/1970 and 1970/
1971. This development which is partly due to the addition of sizable amounts
of new construction to the rate base, will be rectified in 1971/1972. In view
of the temporary nature of the decline of the rate of return under the required
level of eight per cent, it may not be necessary to revise the tariffs. In
1972 the rate would improve to 8.3% and in 1973 to 9.80%. The average rate for
the whole period would be 8.5%.
6.11      Interest would be covered more than two times by income before in-
terest and debt service would be covered more than two times by internal cash
generation throughout the neriod. The debt/equity ratio which would remain at
59/41 during the first half of the period, would gradually change to 56/44 in
1973.
6.12      Loan 458-MA requires NEB to obtain the Bank's approval before incur-
ring any long-term debt if internal cash generation for a recent twelve-month
period is less than 1.5 times maximum future debt service. During negotiations
satisfactory assurances were obtained that this requirement will be continued
under the proposed loan. NEB should be able to meet this test as regards the
proposed loan and the bilateral financing.
6.13      As already mentioned in paragraph 6.07 the current nosition would be
tight but manageable with the use of the overdraft facilities.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND CONDITIONS OF LENDING
7.01      The Project is technically sound, the cost estimates realistic and
the arrangements for construction satisfactory (paragraphs 4.14, 4.15 & 4.16).
7.02      The generating capacity which the Project would provide is necessary
to meet the forecast demand and the proposed installations would be the most
economical means of doing this (paragranhs 4.15, 4.16 & 4.17).
7.03      The power demand and sales forecasts are realistic and have been
based upon a careful evaluation of the effect of future changes in the growth
patterns of the area served (paragraph 5.07).
7.04      NEB's financial position is sound and promises to remain so in the
future. A tight current position expected during the next three years will be
manageable with the use of overdraft facilities (paragraphs 3.15 and 6.07).
7.05      The proposed financing plan for the period August 31, 1968 through
August 31, 1973 is satisfactory. NEB would earn a satisfactory return, achieve
an adequate coverage of interest and debt service, and would generate more than
40% of its capital expenditure (paragraphs 6.04, 6.10 and 6.11).
7.06      During negotiations satisfactory undertakings were obtained that the
N'TEB will:



- 23 -
1.   Consult the Bank before making apDointments to the positions of
General Manager, Chief Engineer and Chief Financial Officer (para-
graph 3.05).
2.   Continue to employ independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (para-
graph 3.13).
3.   Continue to maintain tariffs at a level to yield not less than eight
per cent on its net fixed assets in operation (paragraph 3.10).
4.   Keep its bank overdraft and short-term borrowings to a minimum.
(paragraph 3.21).
5.   Only incur long-term debt without the approval of the Bank, if its
maximum annual debt service shall be covered at least 1.5 times by
net revenues (paragraph 6.12).
6.   Continue to engage consultants satisfactory to the Bank for the
engineering, supervision of construction and evaluation of
bids (paragraph 4.16).
7.07      During negotiations discussions were held to insure that the NEB
intends to continue the following activities:
1.   The staff training program (paragraph 3.06).
2.   Measures to imDrove the ratio of customers or employee (paragraph
3.07).
7.o8      Disbursements under the portions of the proposed Loan allocated for
Port Dickson and related transmission system are conditioned on the prior
conclusion, satisfactory to the Bank, of supplementary financing (paragraph
'l.14).
7.09      The Project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$11.5 million equivalent
for a period of twenty years including a grace period for amortization pay-
ments of four years.
