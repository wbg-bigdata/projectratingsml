                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is being implemented satisfactorily from the development impact, fiduciary and safeguards perspectives. TSKB disbursements stand at 58 percent under the additional
                         finance approved in 2011 and are expected to continue rapidly in the next six months. TE disbursements stand at 97 percent under the original finance, with 61 percent of the total
                         taking place since November, 2011 (following restructuring to include new sectors). The project exceeds expectations as measured by the PDO indicator on export performance by
                         participating firms, which exceeds their peers by 14 percentage points, and as measured by the absence of non-performing sub-loans in the project portfolio.

                         Upon request of TSKB in August 2012 and the Bank team's review, the Bank provided one procurement waiver to allow the use of the established private sector or commercial
                         practices for the procurement of raw material-primary unalloyed aluminum under a contract exceeding the US$10 million threshold.
