                         (i) Support exports by providing medium and long-term working capital and investment finance to private exporting enterprises; and (ii) Improve the ability of

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is being implemented satisfactorily from the development impact, fiduciary and safeguards perspectives. Disbursements, still ahead of projection, have been slow in
                         recent quarters as Component 1 was completely disbursed, and Component 2 was awaiting a restructuring, but these impediments have been resolved. Subsidiary loan agreements
                         with PFIs are expected to be completed in September, and substantial disbursements are expected in the 4th quarter of 2011.

                         A mid-term review was not formally undertaken, but the additional loan preparation and supervision efforts in FY11 materially exceeded what is normally undertaken in a mid-term
                         review, which is therefore now viewed as redundant. In FY11, an additional loan was given for Component 1, and Component 2 was amended to include new sectors. The
                         environmental frameworks were updated based on past experience not only in EFIL IV, but also with other projects, which were thoroughly reviewed in FY11.

                         New CEOs have been appointed for both borrowers (and implementing agencies). In neither case is it expected to lead to material shifts in the banks' strategies, and the team is
                         engaging well with the new management.

                         In Eximbank, organizational changes have led to a new project manager, but most of the PIU team remains in place.
