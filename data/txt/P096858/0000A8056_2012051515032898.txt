                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is being implemented satisfactorily from the development impact, fiduciary and safeguards perspectives. Disbursements remain ahead of projections and have
                         accelerated as expected after the effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs) under the additional loan (component 1) and realization of the pipeline under the
                         component 2.

                         In FY11, an additional loan was given for Component 1, and Component 2 was amended to include new sectors. The environmental frameworks were updated based on past
                         experience not only in EFIL IV, but also with other projects, which were thoroughly reviewed in FY11.

                         Under Component 1 SLAs has been finalized with nine PFIs, and the World Bank has given its no-objections. Seven already participating PFIs as well as two additional leasing

                         companies joined the project for the additional financing. SLAs have been signed for the full additional loan amount after the mission during the months of November and December
                         2011.

                         Under component 1 disbursements are expected to accelerate in the next 6 months period with a strong pipeline having been built in the new sectors as a result of the strong
                         marketing activities for the new sectors.
