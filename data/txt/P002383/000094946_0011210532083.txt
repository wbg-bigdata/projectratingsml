3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project grew out of the World Bank's involvement in the preparation of the Environmental
Management Plan of Seychelles (EMPS). At the request of GOS, certain projects of the EMPS were
incorporated by the World Bank into an integrated Environment and Transport Project. Of the EMPS
programs, actions to protect biodiversity and to limit the pollution of the international waters around
Seychelles were identified as the most consistent with the goals of the Global Erivironment Facility (GEF).



The Environment and Transport project was financed by a Bank loan of USD 4.5 million and by a
Government of Seychelles (GOS) contribution of USD 0.7 million equivalent, in addition to a Global
Environment Facility (GEF) grant of USD 1.8 million.
The loan part consisted of activities for improved resource management, such as potable water supply
schemes and improvements in the transport sector including road rehabilitation, airport improvement and
action plans for road traffic safety. The grant part consisted of actions to reduce marine pollution and
several measures to protect biodiversity. Complementary financing for biodiversity conservation activities
was provided through a Dutch Trust Fund in 1994 which was also administered by the Bank. An
Implementation Completion Report for the Dutch Trust Fund TF23465 SEEEY was also prepared in 1998
and is available for reference with the Bank and GOS.
The objectives of the Environment and Transport Project as defined in the SAR of December 2, 1992 were
to:
1. Assist with implementation of the Environmental Management Plan of Seychelles (EMPS)
2. Support enviromnental programs in resource management, biodiversity conservation, and marine
pollution control
3. Improve the basis for sustained tourism growth by facilitating tourist access, while preserving or
restoring environmentally sensitive areas
The design, production and launching of the EMPS was the most significant environmental policy move of
the Government of Seychelles since Independence, and the Bank played a pivotal role in the overall success
of this process. The Banks experience in assisting the Seychelles with the EMPS led to linkages with other
donors involved in implementing EMPS projects. The loan project components were all developed by the
Government agencies concerned and some of them part of the EMPS. The Government has had identified
these projects as high priorities in national planning exercises.
The Project objectives supported the Seychelles commitment to development in a sustainable manner. The
physical Project Objectives are considered to be appropriate and realistic.
3.2 Revised Objective:
There was no formal revision of objectives, but they were re-formulated as follows during implementation
in order to take into account the decisions on components that are described below.
"To improve the basis for sustained tourism growth while preserving or restoring environmentally sensitive
areas through (a) rehabilitation of main road network; (b) reinforcement of urban water supply system and
(c) implementation of the environment management plan."
In practice, the linkage to tourism was never reflected into specific outcome/impact indicators, and thus is
not reflected in the data presented in annex 1. Project components were linked to the extend that they all
contributed in part to the implementation of the EMPS, but de facto they were implemented as independent
activities and not part of a logical framework supported by corresponding indicators. Monitoring
information generated by the project is thus only component or activity specific.
3.3 Original Comnponents:
The project comprised of the following main components:
- 2 -



A. Resource Management Program
Praslin Water Supply Phase Il: To improve dry weather lows and the overall reliability of water provision,
through enlargement and renovation of downstream barrages, at existing water installations at the Fond B'
Offay and Nouvelle Decouverte rivers on Praslin Island.
Water Resources Study and Management Plan for Outer Islands: To develop water resources
management plans for 7 outer island in four different steps.
Marine Resources Management Plans: To prepare and carry out plans for the management of marine
fisheries resources, especially tuna, reef fishes, demersal fishes and lobster.
Organizational Study of Division of Environment (DOE): A review of the organizational set-up of DOE
aiming at proposing an improved structure for the Division, assessing co-ordination and monitoring
requirements for environmental programs, and preparing staffing and training proposals.
B. Biodiversity Conservation and Marine Pollution Abatement Program (GEF)
Restoration and preservation of the Aldabra ecosystem: This was to be achieved by the rehabilitation of
the scientific research station; strengthening of scientific and managerial personnel; and eradication of feral
goats and preparation of a long-tenn management plan.
Conservation of biodiversity: This was to be achieved by the preparation of comprehensive management
plans to prohibit the exploitation of two species of marine turtles, a Green Turtle protection program and a
Hawksbill Turtle protection program. Two important modifications were made subsequent to the Appraisal
report, namely the removal of a turtle ranching component and the inclusion of a Giant Tortoise protection
and management plan component.
Actions to limit pollution of international waters: This was to be achieved by a feasibility study and
engineering designs for the construction of facilities to receive and dispose of waste from commercial and
fishing vessels at the port of Victoria. The purchase of oil spill tracking and control equipment,
subsequently added to this component, was made possible when additional funds were made available
following exchange rate fluctuations between SDR and USD.
C. Transport
Praslin Road Improvement Program: To improve 13.3km of earth road on Praslin Island
Praslin Airport Improvements: To resurface the runway and extend the parking apron
Road Traffic Safety Program: Consisted of a diagnostic and evaluation study, which identified priority
areas for actions to improve road safety. The project also supported the installation of road sings and
markings, crash barriers, street and traffic lights as well as the road widening of Cascade road.
Overall, the project physical objectives were realistic and appropriate.
- 3 -



3.4 Revised Components:
Two components were shelved during implementation, namely the Water Resources Study and
Management Plan for Outer Islands and the Marine Resources Management Plans. The first component
was dropped from loan financing based on the assumption that it should have been taken up by recurrent
budget activities of agencies responsible such as SFA and MAMR. The latter was dropped in 1996 based
on GOS decision that it is not a priority for loan financing. Plans for 4 out of the 7 outer island have in the
meantime been prepared and implemented by the private sector.
A new component was added in 1997 replacing those that had been shelved:
Baie Lazare Water Supply: To augment availability of treated water, increase coverage and level of service
to the Baie Lazare area situated in South Mahe.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The objectives were part of an overall Government commitment to
sustainable development. In retrospect, it could have been foreseen that the use of IBRD loan was not
optimal for the financing of some of the proposed activities, hence the quality at entry cannot be rated
highly satisfactory.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objectiv,e:
Overall, the outcome of the project is satisfactory. All of its physical objectives have been achieved and in
some cases (Road Traffic Safety Program, preparation of giant tortoise management plans and
reconstruction ofAldabra research station) they have surpassed the original project expectations. Sector
policies, financial, physical and environmental objectives were met. Project implementation was highly
beneficial for several national organization through addressing much needed infrastructural development
and through re-enforcing national capacity in the water and land transport sectors. The Project has as well
benefited the international community, by addressing issues of global concern, and the Seychelles by
assisting it to protect key components of its biodiversity.
The two components dropped (Water Resources Study & Management Plan for Outer Islands and Marine
Resources Management Plans) were replaced by the Baie Lazare Water Supply component. The first
component dropped from loan financing based on the assumption that it should have been taken up by
recurrent budget activities of GOS agencies such as SFA and MAMR. The latter was dropped in 1996
based on a GOS decision that it is not a priority for loan financing. Plans for 4 out of the 7 outer island
have in the meantime been prepared and implemented by the private sector.
Global Environmental Objectives: Global environmental objectives are deemed to have been achieved
satisfactorily despite the fact that the Marine Resources Management Plans component has been dropped.
The turtle shell industry is now illegal, and turtles and tortoises protected and monitored. Even more
important, large stocks of turtle shell have been bumed publicly in a highly symbolic ceremony, and
perception as well as behavior of population have changed. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) were
produced and implemented for all infrastructure components, namely the water supply and roads
improvement projects. The implementation of the EIA's ensured that threatened biodiversity, sensitive
habitats and environmental health were protected, especially in the Vallee de Mai, one of Seychelles World
- 4 -



Heritage Sites.
Overall Implementation and Objectives: Overall implementation and operation under the Project are
considered to have been highly satisfactory. The respective project co-ordinators in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs have facilitated the process locally and the various GOS staff in implementing agencies such as in
SIF, PUC and LTD have further improved their abilities to implement and manage projects.
4.2 Outputs by components:
*   Praslin Water Supply Phase H1: additional water is being collected to meet development demands for
Praslin up to the year 2000 by tapping of water at lower elevations from the Nouvelle Decouverte and
Fond B'Offay Rivers providing additional safe yield of 120 kl/day and 2 1Okl/day respectively.
*   Water Resources Study and Management Plan for Outer Islands: component was shelved.
*  Marine Resources Management Plans: component was shelved.
* Organizational Study of Division of Environment (DOE): study completed but recommendations have
not been implemented within the framework of the component.
*   Praslin Road Improvement Program: 13.3km of earth road on Praslin Island improved to paved
standard; installation of drains and culverts and provision of off-site bus lay-byes.
*   Praslin Airport Improvements: runway strengthened by an asphalt overlay of 15mm thickness and the
parking apron extended by 400 m2.
*   Road Traffic Safety Program: diagnostic and evaluation study carried out; installation of road sings
and markings, crash barriers, traffic lights, cat eyes and mirrors; acquisition of breathalyzers; driving
instructor/testing training provided; traffic counters and other training provided; construction of 3km
road-widening and footpath in Cascade completed.
*   Baie Lazare Water Supply: supply of an additional safe yield of 1 100kl/day of treated water, coverage
and level of service to the Baie Lazare area of South Mahe increased by construction of 4 boreholes,
laying over 1 Okm of pipelines, upgrading of existing intake structure, construction of two pump houses
and construction of filter house. This component was added in 1997 replacing those that have been
shelved.
* Restoration and preservation of the Aldabra ecosystem: The Aldabra component has been
instrumental in establishing a working environment that is conducive to scientific work as well as long
term management of the Aldabra World Heritage Site. The new research station will permit future
generations of scientists to build on the already existing body of work that has been conducted on
Aldabra. The implementation of the management plan will ensure that the long term objective of
preserving Aldabra for posterity will be accomplished.
The restoration of the fragile ecosystem of Aldabra through the removal of on of the main introduced
threats has been completed, although the eradication of goats on most of the atoll remains somewhat elusive
due to the existence of a few remaining animals. Though strong signs of inbreeding have been noted on the
most recent goats eradicated, there remains a risk that the population rebuilds itself over time. The
Seychelles Island Foundation (SIF) recognizes that threat and has decided to undertake a continuous goat
-5 -



eradication campaign to address the problem. The goat eradication campaign is now combined with the
effort to eradicate cats and rats on Aldabra.
4.3 Nret Present Value/Economic rate of return:
During the appraisal of the project, a cost benefit analysis was only partially prepared.
The following items are major benefits as projected in the appraisal report:
In-country benefits:
1. Socio-economic development through provision of infrastructure on Praslin Island
2. Environmental health improved
3. Reduction in vehicle operating and road maintenance costs
4. Additional sales of potable water
5. Increased air traffic to Praslin Island
As stated in the staff appraisal report, it is a necessary exercise to review the EMPS (Environmental
Management Plan of Seychelles 1990 - 2000) programs, including those funded by the Environment and
Transport Project, to determine its impacts on the country's ability to manage its natural resources
efficiently on completion of the plan by the year 2000. Ideally, the impacts will be quantified as costs and
benefits and one or more valuation techniques will be applied to them. The World Bank is presently
financing an IDF grant for Seychelles were this activity is being undertaken.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development has been substantial. The re-enforcement of the Division of Environment has
taken place, although outside the framework of the organizational study for DOE, that was not
implemented. The project has resulted in improvements in legislation, policy, scientific and enforcement
skills. Environmental Impact Assessment of investrnents is not only provided for by the legal framework, it
has also become an accepted practice. Overall, the Project has resulted in improvements in managerial
abilities and engineering skills in the land transport and water sectors, respectively. Financial information
systems used at the Directorate of Civil Aviation (DCA) have been improved.
Achievements could have been higher though, as it is still necessary to develop the managerial capacity at
the Seychelles Island Foundation (SIF) which manages Aldabra and Vallee de Mai World Heritage Sites.
Hence the impact is rated Substantial and not High.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
The unavailability at time of construction material induced delays in the implementation of certain
components, in particular the Baie-Lazare water supply scheme, hence requiring extension of the closing
date.
-6-



5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Country did not have a National Co-ordinator with adequate experience with procurement and
disbursement procedures of the Trustee for a period of two years and this delayed communication and
certain procedural operations. Disbursement bottlenecks between the Ministry of Finance and the
implementing agencies occurred. This concerned the inactivity of special accounts at the Nouvo Banque.
The Project Accountant and National Co-ordinator experienced difficulties in receiving World Bank
monthly statement of accounts through the Ministry of Finance and requested that these statements be sent
directly to the project unit. In one or two instances, audit reports for the project account did not follow the
standard terms of reference agreed and presented in the project Implementation Handbook. Discussions
between the Bank and the Borrower ensured that further reports were in line with the accepted format. This
partially affected achievement of project objectives.
The road segments improved under the project, all located in Praslin, are deteriorating faster than they
should, in particular along the Anse Kerlan road where hotel construction induced heavy movements of
trucks. The increase in traffic by large trucks (up to 25 tons) was not foreseen in the design of the roads.
Work is under way to amend current regulations in order to be able to restrict such traffic. Such restrictions
be made effective as soon as possible.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Delays in disbursement by certain national agencies, in particular the SIF, led to delays in achievement of
certain project activities.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Costs and Implementation Timetable: The Project closing date for the loan funded part was extended from
June 30, 1997 to December 31, 1999 based on the inclusion of a new project component - Baie Lazare
Water Supply. The component was included in replacement of two other components - Water Resources
Study and ManagementPlanfor Outer Islands and Marine Resources ManagementPlans. The loan
agreement was amended accordingly in October 1997. Budgets of the shelved components were
re-allocated to Baie Lazare Water Supply. All original project components were completed within the
program's budget with the exception of the Road Traffic Safety Program which had an actual cost overrun
of some 30% as compared to original estimates. This cost overrun is was due to additional specifications
within the Cascade road-widening and footpath project. The Project closing date for the grant funded part
was extended from December 31, 1996 to December 31, 1997, based on the availability of additional funds
in the budget from exchange rate fluctuations between SDR, in which the grant was made available, and
USD, in which the grant was disbursed. All original project components were completed within the
program's budget with the exception of the Study of Waste reception facilities which had an actual cost
overrun of 43% in USD terms compared to the appraisal estimates. This cost overrun was due to
underestimation of the scope of the study during project preparation and to exchange rate fluctuations
(between USD and NGL) during implementation and not caused by poor management.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Overall, it is likely that the Recipient will sustain general project achievements. Despite certain capacity
constraints, typical of small island states, all the implementing agencies are committed to sustaining and
- 7 -



furthering project components. Since the project has resulted in progress in infrastructure development,
scientific knowledge and skills, institutional building including in policy and legislation, public awareness,
project planning and monitoring, and management skills in key organisations, the country's interest in
sustaining the project is high. Turtle and Tortoise monitoring for example have become routine activities
undertaken by staff of the Ministry of Environment, the Marine Park Authority and islands such as Cousin,
Cousine and Aride.
The sustainability of marine pollution abatement is uncertain at the moment. Although this project
component has been achieved successfully, the actual construction of the ship reception and waste
management facilities that were studied under the project is still pending. It is uncertain whether
Government can initiate construction within the short term unless it receives assistance to do so.
The sustainability of the Praslin roads improvement component will depend on the ability of Govemment to
contol / restrict trafic by large trucks on the island.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Project activities have been implemented within the regular activcities of the corresponding institutions (e.g.
roads by LTD, water supply by PUC, Aldabra by SIF) and thus no transition arrangement was required.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Identification and preparation. The identification and preparation of the project grew out of Bank
involvement in the preparation of the EMPS. During this period, as a Seychelles team of staff and
consultants prepared the EMPS, Bank advice was sought on specific topics, such as protection of sea
turtles and waste management. Together with other donors, the Bank analyzed the EMPS at the donors
meeting in February 1991 and indicated its priorities for support.
Appraisal. The Appraisal Mission worked closely with the then Ministry of Economic Planning and
External Relations as well as the staff of the former Department of Environment. In particular, the role of
the National Co-ordinator was discussed. The Mission was hampered by the lack of technical capacity
within the DOE since at the time only one Seychellois graduate specialist was in post.
7.2 Supervision:
From 1993-1995, the first three years, supervision focused mainly on progress toward achieving specific
objectives, such as works and study completion, and on monitoring the performance of implementing
agencies. Towards 1996 and 1997 the emphasis shifted more fully toward evaluation of results and
follow-up. The Bank continued a policy of open, two-way exchange of information with all
environmentally related agencies in Seychelles.
The Bank did not always have a counterpart system to its Task Manager. In certain cases when the Task
Manager was not in-office in Washington, the Borrower had difficulties in communicating with the Bank
regarding project-specific issues. Overall, smooth and excellent liaison between the present National
Co-ordinator and the Task Manager has been the norm throughout the project.
- 8 -



7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Satisfactory
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Project preparation was highly satisfactory. As mentioned previously, the projects were prepared for the
EMPS, an exercise which was facilitated and encouraged by the Bank as part of the National Environment
Action Plan (NEAP) process ongoing in many parts of the world. The relevant sectors' views were sought
on the different priorities and gaps within their respective mandates and projects formulate to implement
these priorities and bridge the gaps. A Seychelles team of staff and consultants then prepared the projects.
The advice of the Bank, other donors and technical agencies were sought during this process as well as at a
(pre-donor's conference) Technical Seminar where working groups analyzed and refined the project
proposals.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Due to staff turnover, five persons have served in the capacity of project Coordinator to date. Despite a
substantial period where coordination was weak, the overall objective of having one focal point with the
responsibility of supervising the progress of EMPS execution, providing advice to implementing agencies,
and exchanging information has been a success. The last two holders of the post were well trained,
knowledgeable, and highly motivated.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Inspite of problems and implementation delays (in particular with SIF for the GEF-funded components),
overall performance of implementing agencies is deemed to have been satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory
8. Lessons Learned
Several of the lessons learned relate to the specific conditions of Seychelles:
*   For projects involving other islands than the main island of Mahe insufficient inter-linkages between
project design, availability of material, supervision and project management are detrimental to
successful implementation, and thus more effort need to go into detailed planning.
*   Given the small size of the economy and its financial difficulties, Individual studies - other then those
being part of projects with physical objectives - should not form part of an expensive financing scheme,
such as a Bank loan.
*   In countries with limited human capacity such as Seychelles, a project co-ordinator with experience in
project management and a good understanding of the sectoral issues is key to successful project
implementation and smooth co-operation between implementing agencies and the Bank; high tum-over
of the co-ordinator position was a source of difficulty. High staff tumover during project
-9-



implementation can be detrimental to the successfil implementation of projects with a large number of
individual technical components.
*  For a small, far away and costly to reach country like Seychelles, it can be difficult for the Bank to
mobilize the full range of expertise that such a complex natural resources and infrastructural project
would ideally require.
*  For components involving strong socio-economic elements, such as eliminating industries based on
endangered turtles, a socio-economist or environmental economist should be involved in project design
and implementation. Adequate resources should be in place to ensure close supervision of such a
project by a multi-disciplinary team. The Bank needs specific mechanisms, as recognized by special
initiatives dealing with Small Island States.
*   Visible commitment of high level officials and strong media coverage of symbolic operations such as
the burning of turtle shell stocks go a long way in helping change people behavior.
Other lessons are more generic in nature:
*   Stakeholders and implementing agencies have to be consulted and brought into the planning process in
an early stage to ensure commitment to project implementation.
-   Infrastructural projects in sectors with clear Government policy and commitment, in particular projects
serving strategic sectors such as tourism, have high probability of implementation success.
