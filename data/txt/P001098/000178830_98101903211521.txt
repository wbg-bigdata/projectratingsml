APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATIO! PROJECT

Coast of technical. vocational, ag:ricultural, teacher training and general
secondary schools End an in,tructional1 television (TV)         -    center
for which a Bank- loan of US:$1ll.O rLillion is recoc:ended.

level manoower needs have had to be met through recruitment of high-cost
f%orian nFtitAnn-ls  both in the orivate and in the nublic sector.  To pro-
duce the necessary output of skilled national manpower, the education
system requires quantitative expansion.
iii.      Thc education system also requires improvement, especially with
regard to:
(a)  Primary education which is inadequate in content
and suffers from high repetition rates and a leck
of qualified teachers; and
(b) Recurrent costs per student which are high at all
levels, but especially in secondary education.
iv.       As modified after appraisal, the proposed project would contrib-
litA tAvn AwC t)i,QP nhipttps- hv thA o  t,-t,pt4,n  e
(a)  Five institutions to meet the needs for (i) skilled
workers; (ii) lover and upper le-rel technicians in
industry, co=rerce and agriculture; and (iii) engi-
neers and business administrators;,
(b)  Three teacher training institutions and an ITV pro-
duction center, to be associated with a fundamental
reform of primary education aimed at improving its
quality, efficiency, and relevance to the country's
needs; and
(c)  Three pilot secondary schools, together wiLh relat-
ed technical Essistance and two planning studies,
to assist currics Ua refo-.  -:4 to reduce the cost
of secondary education.       z btudies would also

of 10 years, which includes construction and equipment of an ITV production
center and the nflPqtr,rr -nluinmPnft for trnn-miqsion, mantenance aind recep-

than the -roduction center being finenced under the proposed Baik loan.
vi.       The 11 project; schools would have an enrollment capacity of 6,500
including 6,o50 new olaces. The construction standards to be developed for
these schools - partly on the basis of an earlier Bank-financed study in
Tuaisia - would have la.ting effects on future school building techniques
and costs in the Ivory Coast. Implementation of the project would require
appoitizent of consultinLg architects an-d establishment of a special urit
within the Ministry of Education. Avard of construction contracts a=d pro-

be completed within four years of signing of the loan agreement.
viii.     The government is able to meet its share of the capii.al cost of
the proposed project and the resulting recurrent expenditures.
ix.       The proposed project is suitable as a basis for a Bank loan of
US$11.0 million equivalent, for a period of 30 years including a 10-year

The Renuest
1.01      Following el IBRD/Unesco/FAO reconnaissance mission in Januanr
1967 and a Bank/Unesco identification mission in May 1968, the Goveruiment
of the Ivory Coast approached the Bank in December 1968 with a request,
prepared vith the help of Unesco, for the financing of general, vocational,
technical and teacher training institutions and an instructional televisirn
production center (IT'l).  An appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. F.
Lethem (economist), B. Braithvaite (general education and planning), S.
KadlJigh (architect); A. Apodaca (FAO, agriculture education); L. Carrier
(consultant, technical education); and S. Futagemi (consultant, educational
television) visited the Ivory Coast in February/march 19o0. Messrs. Leth:em.
and Futagemi also visited Niger to exaaine an ITV program which has been in
o1eratirs there for thoe l3t Lth4rcee years,

secondaLrv education.  It nov consists of:
(a) construtction and equipment of:
- one vocational school for adult accelerated
training;
- two secondary tectxical schools;
- two post-secondary technical schools, one for
agriculture, and one for industry and commerce;

1.04      The literacy rate is only about 9%, with wide disparities betwcen
urban (25%) end rural areas (4%), nales aid femnlcs (13:1), and south and
north. Of the 2.2 raillion total active population in 1965, 75,Z was still
in the agricultural sector.  In the modern sector of the econo!n4, total wage
employment, esti!ated at 232,QO in 1965, was distributed ac.ong co=nerciUl
plantations (50r4, indu3try (11;), transportation (9H), const.uction ( lh),
and adzinistration, commerce and other services (23fl). About 35% of the
total wage bill is paid -o government ueployees, Tae majority of wage
labor is foreign, with 65% of the imakilled coming from neighboring African
uo-tmtries, an.u  IJ'   representing  ly 20 U£ te t-chn,c.     LI-per.- o-

mwnt in IndAitry Pnd sertvicet_ W-r- thmn ';3% of the nublin n.c-tnr and 70To
of the industrial wage bill is paid in Abidjan; the high cost of education
is partly due to the fact that teachers' salaries are based on the high price
levels prevailing there.
The Education and Training System (See also Appendix A)
1.06      The structure of the education syrstem follows the French pattern
(Annexes 1 and 2) and provides for (a) a six-year primary level course; (b)
a secondary level course w-hich basically comprises a four-year first cycle
and a three-year diver3ified second cycle and (c) a tertiary level of imi-
versity and non-universityr ;u    .     -LLs courses are taugh  in French only.

After 6 vears of prim-rv education, -rnruils usanlly acq re few besie
skills and little understanding of simple concepts; their knowledge of
French is too elementary for use outside the classroom. These deficien-
cies combined with a system of rigid grading result in a high proportion
of repeaters, up to 41% in the sixth grade, witb a drop-out of 43/ of
the pipils en route. The increase of 147% in the roll during the last
decade has magnified the problem. Half the classes contain a ten-year
age scatter. At the lower levels class sizes are in the 60s, often
taught by unqualified teachers.  Enrol1ments in Drivate schools are 26v
of the total.

2.03      Ministry of Agriculture manpower estimates for the agricultural sec-

corpot-l  oYt' lrl ±JD ustrla&. puantatioa5 and are Inc±uueu Al LL11: 1tUIA:
above. ThrouFh 1975, modern agriculture would require annually about 40 agro-
no .sts, 50'.' agric'.ur 1, technallogists and 2l0A tehic-.    A iigher Jchool of
Agronomy is being built with the help of the Juropean Development Fund, and

should satisfy the needs for a--onomists and technologists. Since the annual
outpult from the Bingerville School, the only technician school, is 50, a crit-
icaA gap would remain at the technician level.   It is, therefore, planned to
transfer progressively the school to a more appropriate location at Bouske
(in terms of soil, climate and availability of farming Jand), to increase its
output to about 100 per year, ard to upgrade its curriculum to two years at
the post-secondary !evel (against the pr':sent fi.'e years after the Erevet lev-
el).  The Bingerville school would then provide 2nd cycle general education
with a  agric-0-ral bias, ari feed into thie post-secoday co-arse and 1the
Higher School of Agronomy.

pntrpnrpnia-rS is nletArlxv innriidniinte - A sPerinlq .rrh1Prn At thlii  s tne of
the Ivory Coast's economic development, when it is the government's inten-
tion to meet additional manpover requirements bv nationals.   The annual
needs by 1975 are estimated a; follovs:
Diploma Level     Degree Level
Engirneering                   90                70
Cor- erce                      90                60
The industries have collaborated with the university in setting up diplorm
courses in engineering e-nd connerc.!, with curricula and output geared to
ti':exr iieeks, ndt4dl they  re -Uso planJtL:ig : U to start c degre  eveLUUcour   sLi
engineering and business administration. The capacity of the Higher lation-
Techl~-Csl Instit++1 4 -o be 4ulti Abi4d14.  as been letermined b-, the
above estimates.  The other needs for high level manpower require a 1505
in_- *a<  in thc intAke Of th. Ivorinn students by the uiniversitv nver the
next five years.
2.05      Of the total 1120 needed annually at technician level outside the
education sector itself (para. 2.02)! 350'will be trained in the institutions
mentioned in paras. 2.03 and 2.04 and about 770 will come from secondary
technical and commercial education or sirilar studies.   As the existing sec-
ondary technical school in Abidjan vill concentrate on academic studies,
leading to the Technical Baccalaureat, other technical institutions are need-
ed to train technicians in the required number. One such institution would
be located in Abidjan., the other in Bouake, the two major towns. Tae needs
vor clerical workers would be met uy the general secondary education system.
2.06      Tco meet the need for skilled workers, est-imuted at about 2,100 per
year, the government proposed the construction of one accelerated vocational
trsiningr cnter in Abid1iRn in   n     toe the. e.s1:ingoa+inr e y £nro rnf' f   two-
year post-primary "rural" vocational training centers.   A majority of the
skilled workers would continue to be trained on the lob, which is economical-
ly and technically Justified a; long as a large European sipervisory force is
available.  In view of the high cost per worker trELined O.t the ten existing
"rural" vocational centers, the government intends to further study the pro-
blem and has agreed to delay construction of the new centers, initially part
of the request to the Bank.



2.07      Tne remainder of the educational development p'eans ar:. geared to
producing (a) adequate inputs of qualified students for university, post-
secondary, and techn;cal studies, and (b) the required teacher supply.
This implies stabilization of annua.i inteake into public secondary schools
(Grade 7) at about 13,000, while an increase of enrollment from 590 in
31968/69' to 2,u50  by 19Th4/,r 75 wulUd be ac-hieved at  acc Vlaureat level X'Aie

2.83      Develo_-ent Needs of SecondasayvFducation.  Qualitatively, the first
cylc of q.secondary educat;ion ruqt be qr+-ged to prov-%fide a rred practicnl nnil
scientific: hase essential to prepare students for further training in indus-
try. nqricultuve- services, as well as for one of the second cycle streams
(classicRl., modern, technical). UNIP has decided to finance a pedagogic re-
search ce.ater to improve the curriculu= of first cycle secondary schools.
2.09      Present school location, bsarding and scholErships policies need
adaptstion. to tajke account of the hig& urban gro.-th (paras. 1.03 and 1.12)
in order to reduce eroendiLtures on bearding students. Savings should also
result from better utilization of the existing schcols and the setting up
of school building standards IIow under_-.v with Unesco's help. These mea-
sures are essential for a. rational develcpment of- general secondary educa-
tion.
2.10      Annual needs for additicnal secondary school teachers over the
period 1069-7r5 are estimated at about 1 0pe   ye- for the first ,l
(100 for the public sector only), and 40 for the second cycle. Up to now,
most additional needs have been net thrmicn recruitn±,nt Of Poreian teach-
ers.  Every additional foreign teacher costs the counatry about 3 million
CFAF per year (twice that for an Ivorien teachier).  In view of the limits
of bilateral aid, the strategy should be to increase the output of Ivorian
first cycle teachers in order to meet the additional annual needs, and pro-
gressively to replace foreign teachers who would then be transferred to the
second cycle.  The government has given assurances that it will follow this
policy and reach from 1973 onwards an output of at least LL0 first cycle
teachers. A doubling in :1969 of the intake of the Secondary Teacher
Training College is proposed, but the new building to be built with assis-
tpnce from the European Development Fund has a cepecity of only 255 against
312 enrolled at present.  Tne Ministry has already taken the steps neces-
sary to find accom=odation for additicrl studlents. In technical education,
forei-  techers will --'Iso continue to be needed, al houg. a proposed-A scfholh
arship program for training secondary technical teachers may yield results

2.11      Develonment Needs of Primarw Education. To exnend enrollments to
about 70  Or the O-Ul age group by 19715 and to improve the cuality and ef-
ficiency (para. 1.07) of primary education-the government proposes a number
of educational reforms. They include inrovemient of the teaching force both
in quality and quantity, a reformed curriculum, new teaching methods, more
and better teaching materials, smaller class sizes, automatic promotion and
ins"ructional television (ITV). Appendix B gives a brief account of the. ITV
scbeme, together with the proposed arrangements for its financing.

2.12      It is expected that wnile at present it takes on the average 16.5
pupil-years (Annex 9) to produce one prirary school leaver (account being
taken of repeaters cad drop-outs ), asainst the theoretical 6 years, ITV and
the above mentioned reforms will allow pupils; to reach the academic standards
I-Ur the prima-y school lea-i ng cerflce.te inrL FLb.-ult fiv years. ;nn_ --
duction of ITV would, in pzarticular:  (a) allow continued teacher upgrading
through tele-lesscns (th.rce years of tele-le,ssons, are as M.ed the equ1i v _-en t
of one-year teacher training), thu3 r.Aaching all teachers simultaneously and
iinin or.1v - Pnd re-u.rino the e'rnlo-=ert of fe-.er teche'r-trainers- (b) &C-
celerate th_ tntroduction. of nev" content and new pedagogicEaL techniques, and
enable tesachers to a?ply thcse technicues i=ediately at the appropriate
stage in the ccursc; and (c) provide, in th. teaching of French particularly,
both for t;achers end students, a quality of instruction Ohich could not be
achieved in rny other waY. Thus, introduction of the use of I.T.V. would be
the key elcncnt in the government ,orogra= to improve the quality of primary
education In the Ivory Coast.
2.13      Tlhe experimLat in Niger is nw in its third year of operation with
840 pupils.  it wazS started with unqualified classroom tce^hers. However, it
bana alrcady deronstrated conclusiAvelv that a combination oi I.T.V. andL content

"Ls sies     coLd   ing about 4~-_-e_date and :Js r it-pr o-;->e.cnts iin teer.s o f
academic achievement and pereonality development.  Considerable reduction in
the cost per priry ari ~-% I Ive   is also eIr peAted since there have been n I
most no repeaters and drop-outs.
2.14      Annual trained teacher requirements for grovth and replacement (3'
per year) would be 960 by 1975 cnd vould re uire the addition of a primary
teacher training s--hool with a&n output of 240 by 1973 (Annex 10).  In the
vhole syetme, the! pronort:Lon of qualified teachers, taking accownt of upgrad-
ing courses, could then increase from 55^ in 1968 to 79% by 1975.
2.15      In addition, 100 primary school beadmasters and pedagogical ad-
visers per year have to be trained to assist the primsry inspectors, parti-
cularly in the use of new media. To provide this training, a new senior
primary teacher training institute vith a capacity of 240 students is re-
quired.

Financial Projections
2.17      Forecasts of expenditures have been prepared by the Ministry of Plan--
ning on the basis of the foregoing educational plans and on the assumptions
that (a) about 25% of the additional secondary teachers and all the additional
teachers for secondary technical end higher education are recruited abroad;
and (b) no change is effected Dn the schol.arship3 allocation policy.  About
20% of the increased expenditures vould represent quality improvemenit, and the
other 80%, the coat o,- increased enrollments   Overall, bet-ween 1967 and 1975
recurrent expenditures' on education would grow by 13% annually as an average
to reach eventun-ly CFVF 23.5 b'    1 - CZ.II  11) orI.C I. 1'! ,-P r.:fp .Tho- ,^II A

2.18      By the end of the nlonnine Deriod. substantial decreases in average
unit costs for secondary and technicel1 education can be expected as (a) in-
creased numbers of Ivorian secondary level teachers become trained annually
(para 2.10); and (b) the presently too high proportion of boarders and schol-
arships starts to decline - the result of improved planning and policies
(para. 2.09). In addition, primary school reforms will effect a considerable



- 10 -
decrease in the total cost per primery school leaver (Appenaix B, para. 5.
Thus the magnitude of tbe increase forecast in education recurrent expendi-
tures between 1967-191, results from the urgency to meet national manpower
needs and from the present high unit recurrent coats.   As both factors are
not, ex-ectVed' to persi'st, thUe projected share of go-Mrn"ment current reven-ues
to be devoted to education, up to 1975, is acceptable.
2.19      On the basis of the sane educational plans, capital expenditures

emphasis on general secondary (24'), technical (28`0), end higher education
(including azrLculture) (259).  The proJect Proposed for Bank financing
would represent 30% of the total program, with itc major impact on technical
education.
Strategy of Educational Development

weekly schedule would be devoted to practicEl classes.   A direct relationship
between the Institute euad the Higher School of Agronomy, and a close colla-
boration with the research stations and similar orgardzations in the area are
planned.  The institute would also provide in-service training to 30 techni-
cian trainees.
3.10      Hligher Nlational Technical institute.  (Institut leational Superieur
de l'Enseignement Technique - 1l;SET) The Iustitute would be part of the Uni-
versity of Abidjan and wtould ofier nipiona ELnd degree studies in engineering
and business administration.  It would also provide engineering courses for
c>entss Inz othe,: mUwvrsi;sty,         andS=elv   t1nvereb,y inc;rease the ut_w_-iza%.LU
factor of its teaching areas to a high level.  Diploma students would be al-
loved, in exceptional cases, totrnser to dege studies.        The Institute's
capacity has been determined on the basis of manpower needs for the Ivorians,
since. unlike in other nivernitv denrtTnPntn, rorei.n studpnts nre not ex-
pected to be attracted by these studies. The diploma courses are already in
operation in pruvisional buildings, in close collaboration with the industrial
and business community.
3.11      Teaching Staff. Most of the teaching staff-for the new institu-
tions would have to be recruited abroad.   The Ivorian government is pre-
pared to do this on a ccontract basis, but action is being taken to increase
output of Ivorian first cycle secondary teachers (para. 2.10). In technical
education, 50 scholarships are needed to train potential secondary technical
tercbers from among the holders of a tecbnical Baccalaureat. The government
intends t;o }ae its best; efforts to obtain external aid for this purpose and
has given the assurance that qualified staff will be available for all project



schools. To minimize recurrent costs, the government has given assurances
that teacher-student ratios in the project schoole will not be greater than
those shcvn in Annex 12. These ratios are high by international standards
but the situation may inprove us ivorian teachers replace expatriates and
carry a larger teaching l.oad.
3.12      TecbnicEJl Assistance.  The proposed project would include the cost
oxf the folV1r4Dg techic^l~~ r.qslsrnce:
(a) 4 man-trears eouivalent- for a survev of rethods:
(i) to iimprove the utilization of existing secon-

locations which vould cntii ze school sizes at
both first and second cycle3 in order to Jaxi-
mize the utilization of s;ecialized staff' and
spaces, and to mlnimize boarding and  tarff

Ir addition, the govern=ent has given the as-
surance that by October 1970 it will appoint two
supervisors, one for co-rce and one for build-
ing construction;
(d)  17 fellovs'hips of 18 months' duration for the
training abroad or teachers for the urban vo-

3.13      Project InDlementation Unit. The cost of the unit, estimated at
US$200,000 over the implementation period would cover the purchase of ve-
hicles and office equipment, the salaries of the staff (Chapter IV), and
other running costs.

3.15      Introduction of the ITV s-heme, wiith associated educational reforms
will raise the overall costs of prina-     education, but it should reduce the
unit cost of educating students to a given starndard.  The measure of the pro-
ject's profitability is based on a coumarison of costs under alternative edu-
cational technologies; thus the rate of return measures the profitability of
using the ITV technology (and associated reforms) a8 compared uith conventional
methods. The calculations made on that basis shcy that the new technology
should result in unit cost sayings which, depending on the number of classes
covered (Annex 13), would represent earnings or Detween 14 and 35 per cent on
the larger outlays required (Appendix B, II).
3.16      Because the usefulness of the ITV production center and associated
item-n is devendent uporn success    i 4_lementatin of the othe_r1 como-nt  of
the ITV scheme, the government has Egreed that it vlll execute by 1980 a pro-
zram to provide. at lea_st 2.860 elassrocrs with ITV  i.e.; a program large
enough to permit a valid test of the educationaLl results of the ITV scheme.
The government has alsco given assurances to the Bank on the following points:
(a)  FAC, UNDP, Unesco and UNICEF together are expected
to contribute about USS5.7 million toward the total
cost of the ITV scheme. Satisfactory evidence of such
financial contributions Is a condition of disbursement
of the proceeds of the Bank's loan allocated to the ITV
scheme;



(b) the actual pace of expansion of the program would be varied
from year to year depending on the results achieved in sol-
ving the potential probleizs related to the country-wide
coverage of the schools (Anrex 13);
(c) the recruitment and training of the Ivorian staff for the
production center and the assig7nzsnt of responsibility to
themo vould be accelerated;
(d)  the managing director of the IT'V sche-e would be assisted,
initially, by mansagment consultants t(ara. 3.L4 ) whose ap-
point-ent io a conditicn of signing of the pi-oposed loan;
(e)  full-tine specialists with suprorting stafi vould be aDSoiut-
ed vithin one year after s4ignture of thl-e Blan-1 loar to ^w
continuous pedzgogical, technical and organization evalua-
tionz- of the p--rformam-ce of the MU' sch-ee and to zr%s.e recc--
mendations to the rAnaging director as to the futuire rate of
exnansion of the achool coverage:
(f)  appropriate rights would be granted to ITV to use the na-
tional television trarsmission netwcrk as needed for the
programs listed in para. 3.14.  Evidence that suitable ar-
rangements have been made for this purpose is a condition of
disbursement of the proceeds of the Bank's loan allocated to
the ITV scheme; and
(g.) the national television agency (RTI) would be entrusted
with responsibility for technical maintenance of the ITV
Costof -t h  Pr4oject
t_17      The cost estirPtet for buildings in the proifrt werf hnbei en the
governments' assessment of 1969 unit area prices from typical examples of
school building contracts recently ccmleted.  Thev were subseouently reduced,
except for the Higher lintional Technical Instituxte and the Instructicnal
Television Center, by the Unesco project preparation mission to reflect more
economical building standards. Tne proposed method of project implementation
which twould provlde strict technical control over revised standards nay fur-
ther reduce costs. The cost of construction is exDected to average about 4-3O
per m2, whiclL is reasonable in view of heavy taxes, especially the value added
tax (i85).

taken in addition of the high cost of technical assistance (US"12,OCO per
