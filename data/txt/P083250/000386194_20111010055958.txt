SUMMARY
1.       This is to seek the Regional Vice-President’s (RVP) approval for a second-order restructuring,
which includes an cumulative extension request of over two years of the Kenya Financial and Legal
Sector Technical Assistance Project (FLSTAP), which requires RVP approval. The restructuring covers:
(i) revision of the Project’s Development Objectives (PDO)-level outcome indicators and intermediate-
level indicators, which will include replacement and modification of a number of indicators in the
Project’s Results Framework, but not the PDO, and with no effect on the likelihood of achieving the
objectives; (ii) the second extension of the project’s closing date by 18 months, as anticipated in the 3-
year plan presented during the first extension request; (iii) re-allocation of funds from a number of
categories to other categories in order to ensure sufficient funds are available in each category of
expenditure; and (iv) an upward revision of the percentage of expenditures to be financed by the
International Development Association Credit (IDA) to ensure full funding of committed and anticipated
expenditures. Given time constraints, the team, on the advice of AFTOS, will subsequent to this
restructuring prepare a Level I restructuring package that will formally adopt the PDO which is
articulated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).

2.      The project’s Mid-Term Review (MTR) was completed in February 2010, at which time, given
the level of progress for a project seen as important to the country’s development agenda, the Government
of Kenya (GoK) requested for an extension of the project’s closing date by 36 months. The agreed
implementation plan had suffered significant delays as a result of several compelling circumstances.
These ranged from the post-election crisis in 2008 that effectively contributed to a 6-month
implementation delay as operations of a number of project implementing agencies and governance
structures stagnated, to, among others, initial project management shortcomings when internationally-
hired project managers under-performed. Therefore to address project implementation and management
shortcomings, processes were started to overhaul and strengthen project coordination and governance;
which were completed when the project coordination unit was strengthened in late 2007. However, the
unanticipated length of time it took to process the requested first extension) of the closing date also
contributed to implementation delays as newly-recruited staff who were to coordinate and manage the
project resigned to take up other positions on account of the delayed approval of the extension. The
process to strengthen the project unit therefore had to be re-started. The cumulative effect was effectively
a 2-year implementation delay leading to a significant lag on disbursement forecasts as progress on
implementation of agreed activities suffered causing the project to be rated “Moderately Satisfactory? on
Implementation Progress. Given recent progress, it is likely implementation would be upgraded to
“Satisfactory?. The likelihood of achieving the PDOs is however rated “Satisfactory? based on
implementation of the recommendations from two key strategies in the financial and legal sectors which
were financed with Credit proceeds. While approval for the closing date extension was provided, it was
for an initial 18-month period, with a further extension of the remaining 18 months to be considered
contingent upon confirmation of significant implementation progress and a clearer indication of increased
likelihood of achieving the PDOs.
3.       Based on the findings of a review during the June 2011 implementation support mission,
significant implementation progress has been made over the last 15 months, For example, (a) while the
disbursement ratio increased from 25 percent to about 34 percent, disbursements during this period were
over 25 percent of the total disbursed amount, an additional 25 percent have been committed; and close to
40 percent of the total credit is being processed under on-going procurement activities; (b) the
strengthened project implementation unit is providing highly satisfactory services to the implementing
agencies and is very proactive in its interactions with IDA; and (c) the agreed governance structures are
now in place and fully functioning. All of these are in line with expectations outlined at the time of the
previous closing date extension request. Also, the likelihood of achieving the PDOs is now substantially
increased (with most outcome indicator targets having been met). As such, project implementation is fully
on track, i.e. performance has been satisfactory and PDOs continue to be achievable.

4.       The project team’s assessment is that:
     •   The project continues to be one of the main and only comprehensive facility for addressing
         Kenya’s on-going financial and legal sector reforms, and continues to show relevance in
         addressing reform issues thrown up by the global financial crisis;
     •   These sector reforms are relevant and critical to achieving Kenya’s priorities, as outlined in the
         country’s Vision 2030 document (aimed at achieving middle-income status).
     •   An extension of the project closing date would provide adequate time to fully consolidate the
         progress realized from improved implementation over the last 15 months, as envisaged in the 3-
         year plan submitted in 2009, enable completion of all of the on-going reforms being financed
         under the project and substantially contribute to their sustainability, particularly of the relatively
         weak supervisory agencies that have been created;
     •   A re-allocation of credit proceeds between categories would be necessary in order to fully finance
         committed and anticipated expenditures under two categories. This is necessary in view of the
         estimated cost of ICT equipment and other goods and equipment proposed to be procured for a
         number of financial sector regulatory agencies and Judicial institutions;
     •   The GoK is seeking to cover the remaining counterpart funding requirements by utilizing a larger
         proportion of funds from the IDA Credit for each of the disbursement categories currently split
         among DFID, IDA, and GoK counterpart funds. This has become necessary due to the slower
         than anticipated disbursement of the categories of expenditure which has proportionately more
         IDA funding, such as goods. The change is in line with the new Country Financing Parameters
         for Kenya. DFID’s co-financing ratios still remain as originally agreed and had reached the 50
         percent disbursement level as at June 2011, well above IDA’s. The proposed change will not lead
         to a revision of the PDO; and
     •   The Results Framework needs to be revised slightly to ensure (i) continued relevance of the
         performance indicators; (ii) better consistency in indicators in various project documents, and (iii)
         project outcomes can be more clearly attributed to the project’s interventions.

5.     Based on the above, a second-order restructuring of the project is proposed. Specifically, the
proposed modifications to the Credit are:

     (i) Extension of the project closing date for an additional 18 months from September 30, 2011 to
           March 31, 2013 to assure completion of a number of key activities;
     (ii) Revisions to the Project’s Results Framework involving minor modifications of a number of
           outcome and intermediate-level indicators and targets, with a view to improving their attribution
           and measurability;
     (iii) Re-allocation of funds between categories to assure availability of sufficient funding for planned
           expenditures (see Table 2 below for details);



                                                       2
    (iv) Revisions upwards of the percentage of Expenditures to be financed by IDA (see Table 2
         below);
    (v) GoK will provide all required counterpart funding when the Department for International
         Development (DFID) funding is exhausted, and will also cover any tax related costs (which the
         Credit does not cover) and;
    (vi) The revision of the percentage of expenditures financed by IDA and the re-allocation of funds
         between categories, are expected to significantly increase the likelihood of achieving the PDOs.

6.      We also confirm that the remaining amount after the revision to percentage expenditures financed
by the IDA credit is sufficient to fully finance the remainder of the agreed activities, though DFID’s co-
financing ratios will remain as originally agreed. In order to assure adequate financing for activities under
procurement for which contracts are yet to be signed, and anticipated activities that are well advanced, it
is proposed to only re-allocate a portion of the unallocated category, allowing the remainder to serve as
contingency during the remaining implementation period.


PROJECT STATUS

7.       The project was approved on October 14, 2004, has been extended once and is currently
scheduled to close on September 30, 2011. The original IDA credit amount was SDR 12.2 Million,
equivalent to US$18 Million, with DFID providing additional co-financing of US$10 Million
equivalent, and the GoK expected to contribute US$2 Million equivalent as counterpart funds. The
PDO in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) is: “to support the Borrower in carrying out
reforms to create a sound financial system and strengthened legal framework necessary to implement
the Borrower’s program. This PDO is not fully aligned with the PDO in the PAD, which the team
will address subsequent to this restructuring with a Level I restructuring package that will formally
adopt the PDO articulated in the DCA. The program involves enhancing the capacity of the financial,
commercial and judicial institutions, promoting reforms within the financial and legal sectors so as to
deliver services effectively and efficiently.

8.       The project currently complies with all legal and financial covenants, and is rated as “Moderately
Satisfactory? on implementation progress and “Satisfactory? on likelihood to achieve the PDO. Despite
implementation shortfalls at inception, the introduction of a new project team in 2007 has contributed
significantly to the current level of implementation progress, and as at August 31, 2011, a total of US$6.1
Million equivalent to about 34 percent of the original IDA Credit amount, had been disbursed (compared
to 50 percent for DFID). Approximately 25 percent of this amount was disbursed during the last 15
months alone when project implementation activities were fully re-started.

9.      Commitments, anticipated activities (activities for which procurement processing have started
and most of which are at very advanced stage) and proposed activities (activities for which procurement
processing has started after having concluded the initial consultancy/advisory phases and for which
crucial follow-on phases can only be concluded subject to extension of closing date) amount to an
additional US$9.7 Million.

10.      The significant progress to date points to the increased and sustained commitment of the GoK and
of implementing agencies and partners to assure the project meets its targets and that the credit is also
fully disbursed by the proposed revised closing date.

11.     On Financial Management, the current Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) rating is
“Satisfactory?; there are no outstanding audit reports, with the last audit report for the fiscal year ending
30 June 2010 received by the 31 December 2010 deadline. The project has been submitting quality

                                                     3
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) within the requisite 45 days after the end of each quarter due date. These
have been certified up-to date. The project has also been submitting regular Statement of Expenditures
(SoE) and Withdrawal Applications and the Designated Account is active. The project currently complies
with all fiduciary arrangements.

12.    There are no outstanding procurement issues and the procurement plan for the remainder of the
implementation period was reviewed and cleared. The project is rated as Category C on Safeguards and
remains as such, and is currently in compliance with all Legal covenants.

13.     We have listed here some of the key activities financed under the Credit completed in the last
15 months, that have led to significant reforms in the financial, and legal sectors, including key
reforms that are in the process of being completed. A more comprehensive list is provided in Annex
2:
        (i)     Ongoing preparation of a Comprehensive Financial Sector Reform and Development
                Strategy (CFSRDS), which will inform 2012 -16 mid-term plans of Vision 2030; and
        (ii)    Development and ongoing implementation of the Judiciary Service Strategic Plan for the
                period 2009-12, which reviews and builds on earlier reform activities and proposes
                various judicial reform measures in critical areas, such as, drafting of new Civil
                Procedure (CP) rules that promote alternative dispute resolution (ADR), and introduces
                provisions on court-mandated mediation Improvements to the lending environment by
                supporting preparation of Banking Act(Credit Reference Bureaus) Regulations that
                ushered in credit information sharing in Kenya and has seen two Credit Reference
                Bureaus (CRB) licensed.

14.      As previously noted, in order to consolidate the gains realized from the reforms supported to date
and to complete the pipeline of existing/ongoing activities, and new but related initiatives, a number of
activities, some of which are listed here would require additional time to complete. Consequently, the
GoK and the World Bank team have agreed on an action (work) plan for implementation of the remaining
activities. These have been translated into a procurement plan to support implementation for the
remainder of the proposed extension period, which has been reviewed by the Procurement Unit. These
include procurement and installation of ICT equipment for several regulatory agencies, in line with the
2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations; and other key advisory services.

15.    We estimate the costs of these activities to be at a minimum of about US$5 Million, but more
importantly, that their completion/success is at risk if not supported by this project.

16.    We have documented in the table below progress on key aspects related to the PDOs, which
had been recorded since 2007, and reported regularly by Government of Kenya.

PROPOSED CHANGES
17.     Key Performance Indicators: While the PDO will not be revised and remains as: Support
the Borrower in carrying out reforms to create a sound financial system and strengthened legal
framework necessary to implement the Borrower’s Program (DCA), it will be important to restate in
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) the PDOs to be in tune with the DCA, which will be done in
another restructuring after this one is processed, due to time constraints. The Program involves
enhancing the capacity of the financial, commercial and judicial institutions, promoting reforms
within the financial and legal sectors and deliver services effectively and efficiently. However, a
number of Key Performance Indicators at the PDO-level and the intermediate-level and their targets
will either be replaced or modified in order to assure reconciliation of differences in project
documents, ensure clear linkage to the PDO, captures the project interventions more clearly and
recognizes the project’s focus more clearly. All changes to the indicators tighten the target, except the
one related to spreads, which is more conservative partly due to the financial crises effect and overly
ambitious estimates at design. Project outcomes are largely unchanged.

18.      Components: There are no changes proposed to the components as originally designed,
however as part of the comprehensive financial sector strategy, GoK proposes to use part of the
Credit proceeds for financing the purchase of equipment to be installed in the proposed Nairobi
International Financial Center.

19.      Financing Plan: Based on activities already undertaken, and activities proposed to be
implemented during the requested extension period, and in view of the financing arrangements agreed
during the design phase, going forward the remaining uncommitted IDA credit proceeds will be re-
allocated and the percentage of expenditures to be financed by IDA revised upwards. This will allow
full financing of agreed activities and coverage of 100 percent financing of the proposed GoK
counterpart contributions (therefore, GoK contribution now reduced to 0 percent). The DFID co-
financing ratios remain unchanged, and the GoK will take up any lingering counterpart funding
requirements when the DFID funds have been exhausted, which we estimate will happen around June
2012.

20.     Variations from the original project allocations as described above reflect the anticipated
impact of the components, and current developments in the financial and legal sectors, requiring
commensurate responses. This is notably the case for goods and equipment, as well as operating costs
accounting for the longer period of the project.

21.     Financial Management: There will be no revisions to the financial management and
disbursement arrangements.

22.     Closing date: The closing date is extended for the second time and for a period of 18 months
to March 31, 2013. This is in line with anticipated additional extension noted during the first
extension, in the context of three year plan and implementation progress since the first extension.

             A- Key Reforms in the Financial and Legal Sectors in the Last 15 months

(i)      Establishment of a Privatization Commission and engagement of a transaction adviser to
         support privatization of NBK and creation of a Public Private Partnerships (PPP) Unit at the
         Ministry of Finance that has submitted a new draft PPP law and Policy to Cabinet, as well as
         assessing the PPP pipeline with IDA support;
(ii)     Preparation of a Development Finance Institutions (DFI) Strategy (now in progress after
         having stalled for several years) and Shareholder strategy for reform of Kenya Post Office
         Savings Bank (KPOSB) completed, resulting in GoK’s approval for introduction of new
         business model at KPOSB.
(iii)    Strengthening of Financial Sector Regulators including preparation and revision of the legal,
         regulatory and institutional frameworks of key financial sector regulators; support for risk-
         based supervision; improvements in their operational processes; provision of ICT equipment;
         and extensive training and capacity building. Examples of reforms and positive outcomes
         from project support include preparation of a new Banking Bill/revisions to the Banking Act
         that overhauls the existing Banking Act; enactment and ongoing revisions to the Insurance
         (Amendment) Act 2006 that created an autonomous insurance regulator, the Insurance
         Regulatory Authority - (IRA); enactment of the SACCO Societies Act 2008 that created an
         autonomous regulator, the Sacco Society Regulatory Authority (SASRA); ongoing
         demutualization of the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)                 and publication of the
         Demutualization Bill that introduces far reaching reforms in the governance of the NSE. In
         addition there are ongoing revisions to the legal and regulatory framework of the capital
