                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the project is satisfactory, particularly given that a number of transactions that were planned to be procured towards the end of the project, were undertaken. These
                         include a series of ICT related activities, which are crucial to the project development objectives. Overall the project development objective has been achieved, while facing some
                         Monitoring and Evaluation challenges. Efforts to document achievements related to judicial reform have been consolidated with encouraging data, with additional information received
                         for the first time in Kenya (enabled by some of the reforms supported) This will serve as the basis for future reforms, some being supported by the newly approved Judicial
                         Performance Improvement (JPIP) project.

                         Among items in the confirmation of delivery stage in the next few days at some agencies is the design and purchase of audiovisual system and visual recording of court proceedings
                         and production of associated transcripts and digital records, set up in several (commercial and financial) courts . These are expected to set the basis for the completion of the long
                         overdue automation of courts and improving case management and records management, which will eventually reduce time of proceedings and costs of legal services, as well as the
                         transparency of the processes. These reforms will continue to be supported with the JPIP project, among others. In addition, crucial incipient reform efforts at the Ministry of Lands
                         are helping the transformation of its manual systems of land records to a digitalized recording and storage system through the ongoing supply and installation of ICT equipment and
                         software (servers, networks, storage, licenses; IT work stations, and other equipment). Earlier work had supported the Ministry of Lands in Mombasa to safeguard land records in
                         appropriate digital archives for easy access to land records (complementary to efforts being supported for Nairobi and elsewhere with other donor funds). This set the stage for
                         ongoing work to develop an appropriate legal framework for the use of land as collateral, expected to be completed shortly. Additional bills have been approved by Parliament and
                         assented by the President during this period, including on Counter-Financing of terrorism and on Public Private Partnerships (PPP), to be supported further by the newly approved
                         Infrastructure Finance and PPP project; other bills are being reviewed. Overall prudential (focusing on risk based supervision), regulatory and supervisory capacity as well as
                         governance has continued to improve at all supervisory entities to help enhance the resilience of the financial sector and ultimately broaden access to financial services, including at
                         SASRA, the newest institution supervising cooperatives. All financial sector supervisors have enhanced their ICT capacity, with the last set of these processes (at the insurance,
                         capital markets, and SASRA, in the confirmation of delivery stage). Debt and capital markets continue to be developed, while the framework for PPPs to address long term financing
                         for infrastructure is being further supported on pipeline development and safeguards frameworks developed, as well as a specialized website designed and being tested. In addition,
                         key elements to further enhance broader access to financial services are being implemented, including on e-banking, payments systems, credit bureau (with regulations being
                         finalized on credit information sharing for non-bank credit providers), and consumer protection. Strategic aspects at both financial and legal sectors have also been developed,
                         complementing comprehensive strategies being implemented. The World Bank has also supported several key topics with technical missions to provide hands on advice to help
                         achieve project objectives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The implementation of the project in line with restructuring in September 2011 and as expected during last ISR period is on track, with crucial procurement of ICT finalized, some at
                         last stage of delivery and some lingering activities in the last few days of delivery (notably on legal and judicial sector and ICT). All costs are expected to be covered by the FLSTAP
                         since delivery is on-track per contracts (confirming delivery etc) and the team doesnt expect any delays at this point. In the very unlikely event there is any delays, the GOK is aware

                         that the project will not pay, reason why very close monitoring of each of the contracts is ongoing confirming they are ahead of time, or right on time.
