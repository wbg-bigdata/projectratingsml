MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ZIMBABWE
FOR A SECOND RAILWAYS PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Loan to Zimbabwe
for US$38.6 million are submitted for your approval. The proposed Loan would
be repayable over 20 years, including a grace period of five years, at the
standard variable interest rate. It would help finance a program to improve the
efficiency and management of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ).   The
project would be cofinanced by USAID for US$39.4 million, KfW (Germany) for
US$7.6 million, Austria Lor US$ 1.8 million, FINNIDA (Finland' for US$4.7
million, Switzerland for US$2.3 million and DANIDA (Denmark) for U:$3.7 million.
2.    Backaround. Since independence in 1980, Zimbabwe has ma--',tained per capita
incomes and achieved significant improvements in the social sectors while keeping
inflation moderate and satisfactorily managing external indebtedness. However,
growth has been dependent primarily on the agricultural sector while output and
investment in the industrial sector, accounting for about 40% of GDP, has been
stagnant over the period. There is now a consensus in Zimbabwe that a framework
has to be laid for an increase in the investment rate in industry a.d for the
diversification of agricultural output and exports to form the basis for
employment generation for the rapidly growing labor force. The restructuring
of the National Railwals of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to improve its operating efficiency
and financial performance is of particular relevance to this process. Firstly,
NRZ is a major contributor to the size of the public sector deficit, a reduction
of which would be necessary to free private savings for investment in industry.
In 1989, the subsidy to NRZ to cover its losses (Z$120 million) accounted for
about 3% of central Government recurrent expenditures or the equivalent of 1.2%
of GDP. Secondly, the effective performance of the railways, which currently
accounts for over 90% of domestic and international trade freight traffic
movements in Zimbabwe, is a sine qua non for maintaining and supporting the
performance of the industrial and agricultural sectors. However, the railways'
operating performance has deteriorated progressively since independence to the
point where it is unable to meet the demand for rail transport efficiently and
effectively, thereby causing significant economic losses to the country.
Thirdly, future growth will require improving the country's weak export
performance.   This will require improving the competitiveness of traditional
exports, which are dominated by bulky commodities of relatively low unit value,
while diversifying the export base. The railways has a crucial role to play in
enabling the economy to generate substantial savings in foreign currency in the
land transportation cost of exports. The potential savings from the rerouting
of Zimbabwe's seaborne exports from the transit corridors through RSA to the
shorter railways corridors to the ports of Beira and Maputo in Mozambique were
estimated at US$65 million in 1988.   Only about 20% of these savings were
realised due to ongoing rehabilitations of the ports and railways in the corridor
and NRZ's inability to provide adequate capacity to cater to the demand for rail
transport on this route.



- 2 -
3.    The major causes of NRZ's poor financial and operating performance have
been: (i) its inability to manage the maintenance of its locomotive fleet due
to the fleet's diversity, inexperienced artisans and ineffective maintenance
planning and management systems; (ii) inefficient management and inadequate
control of train operations; (iii) inadequate accers to foreign exchange for its
recurrent maintenance requirements since 1986; (iv) a fixed cost structure
significantly greater than warranted by its current levels of operations; and
(v) distorted tariff levels and structure.   Weaknesses in NRZ's internal
organization have been exacerbated by a regulatory framework for its operation
under which: (a) managerial autonomy for staffing and pricing decisions has been
severely circumscribed by Government regulations; and (b) NRZ has enjoyed
unconditional government subsidy support for its losses, providing little
incentive for it to utilize its assets efficiently or to be cost-effective in
its operations.
4.   In November 1989, faced with 'he collapse of NRZ operations due to severe
congestion on the system as a result of the cumulative effect of operating
ineificiencies, Government appointed a task force headed by the Vice President
of the country to undertake a review of the problems affecting NRZ operations
and propose measures for their long-term solution. The task force recommended
a radical change in the regulatory framework for NRZ operations which Government
has adopted as its Framework for NRZ Operations (the Framework).  The Framework
provides for, inter-alia, the following: (a) strengthened government oversight
of NRZ performance including the setting of explicit operating a-id financial
performance objectives for NRZ and changes in the selection procedures of members
of the Board of NRZ to enhance its professionalism; (b) rescinding of unsuitable
management appointments made in the past and clear delegation of future personnel
decisions to NRZ management; (c) NRZ's General Manager to be subject to a
performance contract with the Board of NRZ; (d) full delegation to NRZ management
of powers to a'just tariffs to compensate for inflationary operating cost
increases and sufficient tariff increases to be implemented to correct structural
distortions in commodity tariffs within a year; (e) NRZ's foreign currency
requirements for maintenance spare parts to be incorporated under an open general
import license system or be allocated directly by Cabinet in the interim; (f)
NRZ's capital structure to be rationalized and the substantial backlog of unpaid
subsidies, financed with short-term debt guaranteed by Government, eliminated.
The Framework addresses most of the Bank's concerns about NRZ's regulation.
5.    Government has already taken a number of measures to implement the
provisions of the Framework.  A new Board was appointed in May 1990 with a
clearly defined mandate to increase the railways' operating efficiency and to
realise positive rates of return on its total capital emplcyed as opposed to the
traditional mandate of implementing the general provisions of the Railways Act.
A budgetary appropriation of Z$ 255 million was made in the Government's budget
for 1990/91 to fund the backlog of unpaid subsidies to NRZ (Z$ 283 million as
of June 30, 1990)and Z$ 160 million of this has already been paid to NRZ.
Cumulative increases in freight tariffs and passenger fares of an average of 58%
and 54%, respectively, have been approved by Government and implemented by NRZ
since the appointment of the Task Force. Further tariff increases averaging 20X,
to be implemented by NRZ in January, 1991, have been approved by Government.
6.    Past Bank involvement in the railways subsector in Zimbabwe (Transport



-3-
Rehabilitation Imports Program - Loan 1994-ZIM and Railways Development Project
- Loan 2342-ZIM) has been within the context of the old system of regulation,
and although successful in stemming a collapse of the railways when faced with
the massive exodus of skilled staff in the early post-independence period, has
not been able to arrest the downward decline in NRZ's operating efficiency and
financial performance. KfW and ODA (UK) have been active in providing assistance
to the railways in the past. USAID, KfW and DANIDA participated in the appraisal
of the proposed project.
7.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank, through its sector work and the
supervision of the recently closed Railways Development Project Loan, has been
instrumental in assisting Government and NRZ in mapping out a coherent framework
for the operational and financial restructuring of NRZ.   This restructuring
program is viewed by Government as the model for the restructuring of the other
major parastatals, the subsidies to which are one of the major underlying causes
of the large public sector deficit. Assisting Government to reduce this deficit
and to ensure the effective performance of the country's economic infrastructure
are important facets of the Bank's country assistance strategy for Zimbabwe.
Therefore, the Bank's continued involvement in the sector, primarily as a
catalyst for change, is essential to easure successful implementation of the
proposed restructuring.  Government and participating donors view the Bank's
coordination and active supervision of the proposed project as critical to its
success.
8.    Prolect Objectives.  The objective of the project is to support NRZ to
implement a restructuring program to improve its operating and financial
performance.
9.    Prolect Description.  The project comprises the following four principal
components: (i) organisational restructuring: manpower study to set the basis
for   improved  manpower   planning,   staff   regrading,   remuneration   and
rationalization; (ii) operations improvement: technical assistance to support
a management and supervisory staff development program and training; improvements
in operating information systems; (iii) as its rationalization: support for
streamlining of the locomotive fleet, rationalization of the electrified track
structure and replacement of other life-expired or obsolete assets; (iv)
financial management: modernisation of financial and management accounting and
budgetary control systems.   The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$263.4 million, with a foreign exchange component of about US$161.7 million
(61%).  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule of the proposed
Bank loan are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events is shown
in Schedule C.  The status of Bank Group operations in Zimbabwe is presented in
Schedule D. Two maps (IBRD Maps 22111 and 22112) are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8526-ZIM dated November 9, 1990 is also attached.
10.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government
on the following actions to be taken by NRZ: (a) earn a rate of return on its
total capital employed of 4% in 1990/91 and a rate of return to be determined
by Government in consultation with the Bank for each fiscal year thereafter, with
the objective of reaching a return of 12% on capital employed from 1993/94 and
onwards; (b) furnish annually to the Bank projections of its operating and



- 4 -
financial performance for the following fiscal year; (c) take all necessary
measures to limit its domestic accounts receivables to no more than 45 days of
revenues by June 30, 1992; (d) review its investment plans with the Bank annually
and not undertake investments outside of these plans costing more than an
aggregate of US$2 million without prior consultation with the Bank; (e) prepare
a statement of policy on the disposition of its financial surpluses by March 31,
1991; (f) not take any procuremert action on eight of the locomotives provided
for in the project without the prior approval of the Bank; (g) adjust its
passenger tariffs each fiscal year to cover the amortization of coaches procured
during such fiscal year; (h) disclose separately in its annual accounts the
financial performance of its passenger services.  The following actions were
agreed with Government as conditions of effectiveness of the Bank loan: (a)
Government has taken all actions to implement the substantive provisions o. the
the Framework for NRZ Operations. These actions would comprise, inter-alia: (i)
the detailed definition of the tariff adjustment mechanism to be adopted by NRZ;
(ii) the execution o a performance contract between the Board and the General
Manager of NRZ; (iii) the detailed definition of the monitoring arrangements for
the operatioa of the Framework; and (iv) enabling legal actions to allow NRZ to
issue equity-type securities; (b) NRZ's ta:if fs have been Increased in accordance
with the relevant provision of the Framework; (c) the execution of a subsidiary
loan agreement between Government and NRZ; and (d) the execution of the USAID
grant agreement covering the financing of locomotives. The USAID grant agreement
has already been signed.
11.   Justification and Risks. The NRZ   structuring program to be supported
under the project would lead to a sign5' int reduction in the economic cost of
rail transport.  It would enable NRZ t  teet fully the prospective demand for
rail transport thereby avoiding costly _version of long-distance bulk traffic
to roads and reduced output in indust-'s wholly dependent on rail transport.
The project would also benefit Zimbabwe's landlocked neighbors using NRZ for
transit of their international trade to and from coastal seaports as well as
Mozambique which would benefit from great-r Zimbabwean transit traffic.  With
the regulatory changes already in place and successful implementation of the
restructuring strategy, NRZ will be transformed from an entity requiring large
operating subsidies from Government to one generating considerable returns on
its capital employed and capable of making a substantial contribution to
Government revenues. The major project risk would be that NRZ management would
not be able to realize and sustain the improvements in operating efficiency
envisaged under the project. This risk would be mitigated by the program of
technical assistance support and training and the demonstrated commitment of
Government to ensuring the effective operation of the Framework.
12.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan complies with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
