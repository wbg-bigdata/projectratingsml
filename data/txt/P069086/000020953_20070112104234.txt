I.Introduction

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide
additional financing in an amount o f SDR 16.7 million (US$25 million equivalent) to the
Federal Republic o f Nigeria, Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP),
(P069086), (credit number 3447). The CPRP has been successful indelivering results on
the ground despite challenges in the area o f governance. As a result, community-driven
initiatives have gained tremendous popularity and momentum and there i s great
ownership and support by all the stakeholders involved.

2.       The proposed additional financing would help finance the costs associated
with a financing gap for microprojects that are underway and are therefore
prerequisite in fulfilling the expectations of the poor communities. The current
uncompletedmicroprojects and those that are already appraised but not fundedwere to be
financed through a new project (a National Community Driven Development Program) -
whose preparation i s now delayed due to discussions concerning the government reform
agenda and the impending political transition in the first half o f 2007. The additional
financing o f US$25 million to the current participating States to complete the original
project activities will therefore: (i)ensure that all micro-projects are completed at the
close o f the project; (ii)
                         increase the project's impact and development effectiveness; and
(iii) asabridgingfund-pendingthecommencementoftheNationalCommunity
     serve
Driven Development Program (National CDD) as a follow-on to the CPRP. The National
C D D would build on the CPRP, scaling it up both geographically to cover other states,
and thematically to cover additional activities.

3.      As requested by the Government o f Nigeria, the additional financing will finance
the completion o f the same activities at the state level, such as: social infrastructure
microprojects identified, designed and implemented by the poor communities.
Implementation, financial and procurement arrangements will remain the same. The
indicators for the additional financing will be the same as in the current project but the
targets are to be revised as a result o f the increased funding for micro-projects (see
section vii). The National Planning Commission (NPC) and the State Poverty Reduction
Agencies will continue to be the responsible agencies for overseeing the project. NPC
will retain its current coordinating role, but will rely on government funding rather than
project financing to carry out its functions. As such, the expected outcomes from the
additional funding will be: (i) improved services and infrastructure in participating poor
communities; (ii)   increased capacity o f government to support, monitor, and evaluate
poverty reduction activities; and (iii) increased capacity at state level for implementing
community-driven development, and for financing community-generated projects.

4.      The additional financing will not have any partnership arrangements. CPRP will
continue to finance the activities o f the following eight states: Abia, Cross River, Ebonyi,
Ekiti, Kebbi, Kwara, Kogi, and Yobe. The four states currently financed by the African
Development Bank (AfDB) will continue through 2007.


11.BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancinginthe amount of US$25
million.

5.      Nigeria has the largest population in Africa with a GDP o f about US$56 billion
(2005) and a population o f about 130 million. It is highly dependent on oil although the
majority o f the people are involved inand dependant on the agricultural sector. Per capita
income is estimated at about US$300 (2004). Recent preliminary estimates from the
Living Standard Survey (2004) put the poverty incidence at 57.8 percent or about 75
millionpeople.

6.      A largepercentage o fthe population o fNigeriais vulnerable to poverty (about 90
percent based on 1996 data) and therefore prone to becoming poor or falling deeper into
poverty when exposed to a variety o f risks'.       Limited access to basic social services,
unemployment and other labor market issues coupled with limited economic
opportunities - due to a dearth o f supportive infrastructure especially in the rural areas -
are the major challenges that the poor people face inNigeria.

7.       The CPRP was approved on December 20, 2000 for a total credit amount o f
US$60 million. The credit became effective on September 28, 2001.              The project's
original development objectives were to improve access o f the poor to social and
economic infrastructure and to increase the availability and management o f development
resources at the community level. The design focused on two components: (1) Federal
level capacity building, policy formulation and dissemination, and (2) Community-based
initiatives in basic social and economic infrastructure implemented in twelve States and
managed by legally established State Agencies. Four o f these States are being financed
by AfDB, while the remaining eight are financed by IBRDADA. The objectives, design,
and scope o f the project remain the same.
8.      Project implementation, which was slow at the start, improved significantly and
project performance has been rated satisfactory for the past three years and highly
satisfactory in the last one year. Although all the development objectives have been
largely achieved as indicated inthe Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) after
the May 2006 Supervision Mission, and the disbursement rate i s actually 100% as at end
July 2006, there are a large number of unmet demands and requests by community
groups for micro-projects in virtually all the States currently implementing the project.
There i s a high level o f expectation and yearning for the CDD approach. There are no
unresolved fiduciary, environmental, social or safeguards problems with the project.

Status of Project Implementation


'See WB. 2004. Poverty andVulnerability: A preliminarydiagnostic.

9.     Despite the historical difficulties o f implementing projects and programs in
Nigeria, project implementation according to the last ISR i s highly satisfactory. This i s
the result o f the successful completion o f some microprojects and the impact on the
welfare and positive changes in livelihood o f people in the communities. There i s also
adequate execution o f environmental assessments carried out by communities. Currently
there are more than 1800 benefiting communities in the eight states that have active
projects supported by the World Bank. The relationship with the relevant public sector
agencies at the Local Government and State Government level i s also improving,
therefore promoting sustainability o f the microprojects inthe future.

10.    As indicated in the last ISR - the project has produced many positive human
development impacts including higher school attendance, rural mobility, reduced cost and
time required for fetching water, increased water volume usage, increased health centre
attendance, increased rural area electricity coverage, and rural market activities.
According to a review conducted by the Nigeria Institute for Social and Economic
Research and discussions with communities, the following improvements were identified:
       The incidence o f water borne disease has declined as a result o f water projects to
       buildboreholesandhand dugwells;
       Distances children travel to schools were reduced after the project helped build
       classrooms inthe communities;
    .. Travel to farms and availability o f farm produce to markets improved because o f
       improvements insome rural roads;
       Communities' access to health centers has improved; and
       Poverty levels have been perceived to have decreased in some households as a
       result of the construction o f commercial markets where female heads o f
       household are managing businesses.

11.     Social capital has also improved in most of the beneficiary communities as there
are more social groups, meetings and financial contributions. Interaction o f community
groups with the Local Government Authority has also improved. Community groups
managed more than 70% o f the original credit which implemented more than 2000
micro-projects. Providing additional financing to the project will enable the greater
than anticipated demand to be met. Close to 250 microprojects are active but not
completed and about 350 microprojects have been appraised and not yet funded.

111.ProposedChanges

12.    There are no changes proposed to the project's development objectives, design,
and scope. The same performance indicators will be used though their target values will
be revised to reflect the higher momentum that the project has created. The credit terms
and conditions will remain the same.

13.    The project credit agreement was amended in 2005 after the Mid-term review to
reflect the changes in the Country Financing Parameters - indicating 100 percent
financing in all categories, and the closing date has been extended twice for a total o f



                                             4

twelve months. The extensions in both cases were to ensure completion o f project
activities - especially given the slow takeoff.

14.     The total project costs o f the additional financing will amount to US $28 million
over a period o f 22 months beyond the current closing date (February 2007). A new
closing date of December 31, 2008 is proposed to accommodate the financing of the
microprojects underway, pendingthe commencement o f the National CDD. The financial
management, disbursement arrangements and procurement methods will follow those of
C P W . Funding outside IDA will be comprised o f contributions from beneficiary
communities over the period, amounting to US$3 million. Communities may contribute
both incash and inkind(e.g. labor and materials).

15.      Changes in the allocation of project resources to States. Based on the request
from Government, a total o f US$24.7 million would be notionally allocated as
supplementary amounts to the eight states o f Abia, Cross River, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Kebbi,
Kwara, Kogi and Yobe. US$0.3 million would be retained as unallocated amounts and
will be earmarked for monitoring of the utilization and reporting o f the additional
financing, and for a planned impact assessment.

17.     Implementation mechanisms. Implementation arrangements would be the same
under the additional financing as for the ongoing project, as they work well. At the
federal level, the project will be coordinated by the NPC. It will carry out the same
coordinating function except that NPC will rely on govemment funding, rather than
project financing. At the state level, microproject financing will continue to be based on
the social fund mechanism that has worked exceptionally well.             The autonomous
agencies will continue to be exempted from public sector civil service rules, and will be
overseen by boards o f directors with representatives from civil society and will operate
like private firms,     employing staff based on perfonnance criteria,         competitive
remuneration and higher performance standards. As such, these agencies will continue to
operate under strict accountability and transparency criteria through independent audits
and intense public scrutiny, as they have during the project's lifetime. However, in the
future the activities o f this project will be mainstreamed into the public service system,
particularly to ensure sustainability. Finally, the M&E and M I S system that is inplace in
the project unit will continue to collect data on micro-project construction,
disbursements, etc. to ensure effective and efficient implementation and to inform
decision-makers if corrective action is needed. The last impact assessment was carried
out in 2004 by an external body - the Nigerian Institute for Social and Economic
ResearchNISER. An update will be conducted inmid2007.

18.     Financial management arrangements:          In accordance with Bank policy and
procedures, the financial management arrangements o f the project have been reviewed
and, as there are no proposed changes, the documents preparedfor the previous credit are
still binding and acceptable. The project FM performance for the CPRP is satisfactory.
All external audit reports for the year ended December 31, 2005 were duly submitted.
These have been reviewed by the Financial Management Specialist and the issues noted
inthe last FMsupervision havebeencleared bythe project entities.

19.     Procurement arrangements:         The arrangements for the proposed additional
financing will be the same as the arrangements under the CPRP, however, the updated
Guidelines o f 2004 will apply. Procurement o f goods and works to be financed out o f the
proceeds o f the financing shall be governed by the "Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credit" published by the Bank in May 2004. Procurement o f
consultants' services shall be governed by the "Guidelines for the Selection and
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the Bank in M a y
2004. Community Participation in Procurement would be based on the Afkica Region's
Guidelines - Simplified Procurement and Disbursement Procedures for Community-
Based Investments.       For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification,
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are outlined in the Project
Agreement, the Operational Manual and the Procurement Plan. A separate procurement
planfor the additional financing has been prepared, reviewed and approved by the Bank
procurement team, reflecting the actual project implementation needs.

V. Consistencywith CountryPartnershipStrategy

20.      The additional financing for CPRP supports the current Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) in Nigeria.         The strategy recognizes that Nigeria faces considerable
human development challenges, with very poor human development indicators and high
regional disparities. The CPS stated that literacy is low, infant mortality is among the
highest in Africa, HIVAIDS prevalence i s high and access to basic infrastructure -
especially water, health services and usable roads - i s very low. It i s in agreement with
the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) that it i s
crucial to empower people for poverty reduction. This empowerment should involve
access to human development related services (basic social services and an environment
that is sustainable). The CPS has three main pillars, one o f which is improvedservices
for human development. Under the Human Development priority, the strategy o f the
World Bank i s to use the community-driven development (CDD) approach to support the
financing o f social infrastructure and environmental management practices and engaging
communities and local level governments intackling the key MDG issues. The CPRP has
proven to be a particularly successful intervention inthis respect.

CPRP:

VI. EconomicAnalysis of FinancingGap

22.       Based on the economic analysis documented in the Background Study for the
Mid-Term Review of the Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project in 2004, an
 extension o f CPRP remains economicallyjustified.

 23.      The study takes into account all construction and administrative costs and the
 quality o f the end-products, in which the CPRP i s about 26 percent more cost effective
     .
than similar alternative government agency projects o f the same specification.
 Specifically,
          CPRP generally uses higher quality materials and better construction methods,
     .    covers very diverse geographic areas, and contracts out all o f its construction
          work.
          Incomparison to other agencies, CPRP has a more positive impact on the private
          and public sector, by setting points o f reference, such as prices and procedures,
          for the buildingindustry.




                                                                           Alternative Cost




 Source: Background Studyfor the Mid-Term Review of the Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project (Study by the
Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research, November 2004)

24.       CPRP uses detailed technical criteria, standard designs, and simple economic
 criteria to determine sub-project economic viability.                This includes application o f a
comprehensive list o f unit costs by type o f sub-project. CPRP's design also fosters
greater allocative efficiency in public expenditure.                     Through the promotion o f
participatory decision making at the local level (the participatory community planning
process), CPRP empowers communities to allocate scarce resources across sectors,
thereby ensuring that such resources are applied most efficiently in response to local
priorities. Broad-based participation creates local ownership which, combined with other
complementary activities that CPRP provides (such as capacity building, etc.), makes the
sub-projects sustainable and extends the life o f the investment's benefits.

VII. ExpectedOutcomes
25.       The expected outcomes o f the project remain the same as CPRP. The project's
outcomes address pillar Io f the Country Partnership Strategy, improved sewice delivery
for human development by improving educational outcomes and access to safe drinking



                                                        8

water, and reducing maternal and child mortality rates. The expected outcomes, as stated
inthe PAD are (1) an improved access of the poor to social and economic infrastructure
and (2) an increased availability and management o f development resources at the
community level. Thus the performance indicators for the additional financing that will
be utilized to monitor the project's further progress are:
    ... Increased number o f poor with access to social and economic infrastructure
        Number o fmicro-projects operational and maintained one year after completion
        Increased funding controlled by poor communities.

    ...
Outputobjectives are:

        Improved services and infrastructure inpoor beneficiary communities
        Increased capacity of government to support, monitor and evaluate poverty
        reduction activities
        Increased capacity at the State level for implementing community-driven
        development projects.

26.     The last output objective, establishment o f effective agencies in twelve states for
financing community-generated projects, has been achieved, and would be strengthened
further inpreparation for their appropriate role inthe National CDD.

27.     The additional financing will finance the same types of activities as CPRP but
will increase its projected targets as approximately US$18.95 million will go into
community grants, directly benefiting the poor communities.

VIII. BenefitsandRisks

28.     Benefits.   The benefits remain as described in the original Project Appraisal
Document. These include better targeting and design o f community basic service delivery
interventions. The main beneficiaries o f the project will be poor communities through an
increased local control o f funds and decision-making processes. The additional financing
o f CPRP will ensure that: (i)   about 600 micro-projects that are underway are completed,
(ii) theproject's impactontheimprovement ofhumandevelopment outcomes is
    that
greater as more micro-projects are financed, and (iii)it will help to maintain the
momentum o f CDD in the country until the new project begins. Additionally, the
learning-by-doing experience that local stakeholders have gained under CPRP will
leverage their management          capacity and allow more efficient and effective
implementation o f microprojects.

29.     Risks. Most o f the risks are linked to the political environment in Nigeria and
some associated project risks mentioned in the PAD remain valid, but they are assessed
as less apparent than compared to the beginningo f the project.

        Political risk (substantial risk).Nigeria may face a degree o f political uncertainty
        inthe run-upto general elections, which are scheduled for first half of 2007. This
        reflects the nature o f the political system, where competition for office i s intense.
        These elections are anticipated to be more open and more closely contested than
        the last two ones. Ifthe rulingparties at the Federal level andinthe States where
        the project is implemented are not re-elected, there may be a greater needto show
        the positive impacts of CPRP to obtain the same political commitment as under
        the current administrations. Despite the ongoing unrest inthe Niger Delta, CPRP
        implementation should not be affected. Only one State inthe Niger Deltaregion i s
        involved inthe project - Cross River State - but it i s not a major oil drilling State
        and has not had insurgences inrecent times.

        New political tensions interfere with project implementation (modest risk). A
        new Government in place may confirm its commitment to the project objectives
        but it may also want to revisit project implementation mechanisms and seek to
        have greater control over the project entities. This risk i s considered to be modest.
        The institutional arrangements at the State level are the product o f legal statutes -
        bills passed by legislature and signed by Governors. The Bank will continue to
        monitor the political situation and closely supervise implementation o f the




                                               10

        project, in accordance with the Operational Manual and the project's annual
    .   operational plans.

        Weak capacity at State Agency level (low risk). The weak management and
        implementation capacity by the implementing agency, envisaged at the start o f the
        original credit has been resolved through the recruitment o f appropriately
        qualified and competent management staff at the State agency level. During
        implementation, on the job skills have been developed. Training programs in-
        country and study tours to similar projects in other countries have helped the
    .   project staff to learn to better manage the project.

        Transparency andfiduciary risks (low risk).         The implied risk is that Credit
        proceeds may not be used for their intended purposes, financial transactions may
        not be properly accounted for, and control and procurement procedures may not
        be properly applied. During the implementation o f the CPRP local skills have
        been developed and procurement and financial management training undertaken
        by Bank staff. A consultant has assisted inkeeping project staff up to date. The
        Financial Management Assessment, as well as audit report o f the project, i s
        satisfactory. Close supervision o f financial management and accounting practices
        o f the project will continue as under the CPRP additional financing. Details o f
        risk assessmentandmitigationmeasures are providedinSchedule C.

IX. FinancialTermsAnd ConditionsFor The AdditionalFinancing

30.     The financial terms and conditions for the additional financing are the same as the
original credit, including the changes due to the Country Financing Parameters which
allow for the various categories to be funded at 100%. The original credit allocation has
also been revised to accommodate current disbursement o f all implementing entities. As
this is, in effect, an extension o f the ongoing project without any modifications, the
government o f the Federal Republic o f Nigeria has accepted to adhere to the same terms
and conditions as those under the CPRP.
