F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The program objectives of the PRSG series were to support the Government of Malawi's (GoM)
efforts to undertake the critical policy and institutional reforms for the successful implementation of
the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). In particular, the PRSG program was
designed to support the Government in pursuing a development strategy that aimed at accelerating
growth while at the same time ensuring that the vulnerable were adequately protected from shocks.
Therefore, the PRSG series supported policy and institutional reforms in the following four policy
areas: (1) improving the functioning of agricultural output and input markets, with a focus on
improving Government intervention in maize and tobacco markets, improving Government
involvement in fertilizer markets, and strengthening the operation of land markets; (2) improving
the business climate, focusing on reforms to improve the legal and regulatory environment,
particularly with regard to the access to commercial justice and the business licensing regime; (3)
dealing with vulnerability to shocks, particularly supporting reforms to improve the coordination,
funding, and coverage of social protection programs in Malawi and improve the national response
to climatic shocks; and (4) improving economic governance, targeting reforms for improving
Malawi's budget process, payroll and debt management, timeliness and follow-up of external audit.

1.         Program Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1        Context at Appraisal

1.      Malawi is a small landlocked agrarian economy, which is poorly
integrated into the region, both in terms of trade and physical infrastructure.
The 1994-2004 represented a decade of generally dismal economic performance
characterized by growing food insecurity, widening macroeconomic imbalances, a
strong build-up of external and domestic debt, high and variable inflation, and a
deterioration of physical and social infrastructure.

2.     At appraisal, agriculture was the dominant sector, which contributed
about 38 percent of GDP, supported over 80 percent of population and
accounted for more than 80 percent of the country’s exports. Being one of the
most densely populated countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an average of about
180 persons per km2 of arable land, the pressure on land was significant. Smallholders
made up about three quarters of agricultural production, mostly engaged in rain-fed
maize production and over 50 percent of rural households were living with less than
one hectare of land with about a third of cultivable land not being in use.

3.     The country was ranked 160th out of 182 countries surveyed in the UN
Human Development Index of 2007 and its social indicators were poor,
compounded by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Poverty headcount ratio was high at 52.4
percent1, hardly reflecting any change since the last household survey undertaken in
1997/98. The country was vulnerable to shocks, particularly given its undiversified
production and export structure, and was prone to droughts and frequent food
shortages. The country’s exports were also highly concentrated on few primary
commodities, with tobacco being the main foreign exchange earner. The impact of
these vulnerabilities on the economy was compounded by weak public finance
management and weak macroeconomic environment, which stifled private sector
growth in the late 1990s.

4.     In spite of these structural challenges, the Government was able to get
economy back on a sound macroeconomic footing at the time of appraisal. The
year 2006 marked a return to macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence from an era
of weak macroeconomic performance and lackluster economic growth, averaging at 2
percent. 2 The strong stabilization policy since 2004 and the debt relief from the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative in 2006 brought about a rapid
turnaround in government finances, through better management of public spending,

2
  The volatile and weak economic growth during the decade prior 2004 was attributed to adverse weather and
terms of trade shocks (given the country’s high dependence on rain-fed agriculture) and very weak public
expenditure management.


                                                      1
and created the fiscal space needed to generate the momentum for the resumption of
growth.3

5.      Favorable weather conditions and the expansion of the Farm Input
Subsidy Program (FISP) contributed to a bumper maize harvest in 2006, which
in turn eased pressures on food prices and as such inflation declined to 7.9 percent in
2007, from 15.5 percent in 2005 (Annex 1, table 1). A combination of tightened fiscal
and supportive monetary policies and a stable exchange rate also contributed to lower
inflation rate. Real GDP growth averaged at 6.1 percent between 2006 and 2007,
slightly above the 6 percent benchmark for poverty reduction set in the 20006/07-
2010/11 Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS).4 With the debt relief,
the country’s debt sustainability was significantly strengthened, interest payments on
domestic debt were brought down and domestic interest rates started to decline in
response to prudent fiscal policy.5 Social spending also increased to 5 percent of GDP
and above in the post-2007 period.

6.     Current account balance had registered improvements from a deficit of -
14.6 percent of GDP in 2005, to a surplus of 1.0 percent of GDP in 2007, reflecting
improvements in the trade account balance from -22.3 percent of GDP in 2005, to -
10.5 percent in 2007. Similarly, improvements were registered in the fiscal account
with the narrowing of the fiscal deficit from -4.86 percent of GDP in 2004, to -4.5
percent of GDP in 2007, largely on account of improved fiscal discipline. The deficit
was largely financed through a combination of foreign and domestic financing.
Overall, as reflected above, the PRSG program was supported by sound
macroeconomic policy framework with clear set of identified risks to the medium
term macroeconomic outlook.

7.      The country had also managed to hold three successful general elections
at that time since the return to multiparty system of Government in 1994. The
current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government led by President Bingu wa
Mutharika government took over in 2004 (as a minority government in Parliament),
after 10 years under the leadership of President Bakili Muluzi and the United
Democratic Front (UDF). However, political stalemate between the President and the

  These measures included actions to strengthen fiscal discipline, particularly public financial management and
expenditure control to arrest budget overruns and the build-up of domestic debt; rationalization of public
enterprises to halt the leakage of budget resources and enhance service delivery; an upgrading of critical economic
infrastructure in the transportation, power, and telecommunication sectors, designed to crowd in private sector
investment and raise productivity; institutionalization and expansion of the farm input subsidy program (FISP) to
achieve sustainable food and nutrition security; adoption of an exchange rate peg to the US dollar to help lower
inflation expeditiously; and steps to foster private sector development in part through an expansion of bank credit
to the private vector.

 The domestic debt to GDP ratio dropped from 24.8% in June 2004 to 19.9% in June 2006. Reduced government
borrowing combined with lower interest rates reduced crowding out of private sector borrowing.

8.     The second generation poverty reduction strategy paper, the 2006/07-
2010/11 Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) was approved by the
Government in November 2006. The MGDS sought to achieve the aspirations of
Malawi as defined in the Vision 2020 and the Millennium Development Goals.
Specifically, the MGDS aimed to achieve high economic growth rates of at least 6
percent a year, with strong focus on agriculture as the driver of growth.

9.      In their Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on the MGDS, presented to the
Board on January 16, 2007, the IMF and World Bank staffs concluded that the
MGDS broadly provided a comprehensive framework for growth and poverty
reduction in Malawi. Staffs noted that the key strength of the MGDS was its
emphasis on growth as a necessary condition for poverty reduction, and the strong
government ownership of the Strategy. Staffs noted, however, that the Strategy’s
result framework was not underpinned by a comprehensive list of indicators for
monitoring and evaluation, and that it underplayed the role of social expenditures and
social protection in supporting growth.

10.     The fourth Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of February 2007 for
FY07-FY10, was designed to support the implementation of the PRSG program.
The CAS was fully aligned to the MGDS priorities and was designed to help the
Government achieve four key outcomes: improving smallholder agricultural
productivity and integration into agro-processing; put in place a foundation for long-
term economic growth through improved infrastructure and investment climate;
reducing vulnerability at the household level to HIV/AIDS and malnutrition; and
sustaining improvements in expenditure management, transparency and accountability.
In achieving these outcomes, the CAS provided for a programmatic development
lending operation every year over the CAS period.

11.     Bank-financed projects/programs, which were linked to and/or
complemented the policy reforms under the PRSG series, included the
Community Based-Rural Land Project (CBRLR) approved in April 2004, the
Irrigation, Land and Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP) approved in
November 2003, the Rural Infrastructure Services Project (RISP) approved in June
2006, and the Financial Management, Transparency and Accountability Project
(FIMTAP) approved in March 2003. The program also leveraged on the Business
Environment Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP) approved in May
2007.

12.    IMF support. At appraisal, the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF), approved in August 2005, was under implementation following the
successful implementation of the July 2004 Staff Monitored Program (SMP). Budget
support from the Common Approach to Budgetary Support (CABS) Development
Partners (DPs) had also resumed in 2005, following suspension in early 2002 due to
poor economic management. The PRGF was successfully completed in July 2008 and
the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) was agreed upon and approved in December
2008 to help the Government contain balance of payments pressures and rebuild
external reserves in the wake of the 2008 global food and fuel crisis.

1.2    Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

13.     The program objectives of PRSG 1, PRSG 2, and PRSG 3 were the same:
to support the Government of Malawi’s (GoM) efforts to undertake the critical
policy and institutional reforms for the successful implementation of the MGDS.
In particular, the PRSG program was designed to support the Government in pursuing
a development strategy that aimed at accelerating growth while at the same time
ensuring that the vulnerable were adequately protected from shocks. Therefore, the
PRSG series supported policy and institutional reforms in the following four policy
areas: (1) improving the functioning of agricultural markets, with a focus on
improving Government intervention in tobacco and maize markets, improving
Government involvement in fertilizer markets, and strengthening the operation of land
markets; (2) improving the business climate, focusing on reforms to improve the
legal and regulatory environment, particularly with regard to access to commercial
justice and the business licensing regime; (3) dealing with vulnerability to shocks,
including supporting reforms to improve the coordination, funding, and coverage of
social protection programs in Malawi and improve the national response to climatic
shocks; and (4) improving economic management, targeting reforms for improving
Malawi’s budget process, payroll and debt management, timeliness and follow-up of
external audits.

14.    By the end of the series, the reforms supported by the program would
have contributed towards increased economic growth and poverty reduction
through increased agricultural productivity, increased private sector investment,
improved household resilience to shocks, and sustained improvements in fiscal
management. Annex 7 provides the program’s Monitoring and Evaluation
Framework, showing the indicators that were going to be used to track the program’s
progress towards achieving its stated objectives.

15.     The development objectives and key indicators were not revised during the
series.

1.4    Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:



Policy Area 1: Improving the Functioning of Agricultural Markets

16.     Under improving the functioning of agricultural output markets, reforms
targeted tobacco and maize markets.

17.     Tobacco market. The 2004 Malawi Agricultural Policy Options Study and
the 2006 Tobacco Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) identified
weaknesses in the marketing and institutional arrangements for tobacco hindering the
efficiency the sector and limiting the pass-through of international prices to




                                         4
smallholders. 7 For instance, it was noted that tobacco growers had to travel long
distances to the three main tobacco auction floors in Lilongwe, Blantyre and Mzuzu,
and this eroded profitability as transport cost was quite significant at all levels along
the value chain.

18.     The PRSG 1, therefore, focused on the establishment of the three satellite
auction floors to help improve accessibility to markets by tobacco farmers as well as
reduce domestic market costs (see Table 1 on Prior Actions).

19.     Maize market. Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation
(ADMARC), the Government’s agricultural marketing parastatal, was facing
significant financial and operational difficulties and the withdrawal of its markets in
the remote areas in the mid-1990s affected many rural communities. This
notwithstanding, the continued presence of ADMARC’s markets and warehouses
hampered private sector participation in the maize trade - marketing and storage, and
created inefficiencies in the market. The 2004 PSIA on ADMARC therefore
recommended that its role in maize trading be limited to rural areas only, where
farmers did not have access to well-functioning markets, and on refocusing
ADMARC’s activities to its core business.

20.     PRSG 1 supported a Prior Action on strategic refocusing of ADMARC by
winding down non-core business interests, as part of a broader restructuring
strategy, which would see ADMARC reduce its presence in urban and semi-urban
markets and foster private sector growth in these markets.8 Whereas, PRSC 2 focused
on actions that saw the establishment of Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and
Trading Company (MAWTCO) to foster private sector entry into
storage/warehouse leasing business.

21.   Under improving the functioning of input markets, the PRSG series
supported reforms in the fertilizer and land markets.

22.     Fertilizer market. Limited access to affordable inputs, especially for poor
smallholder farmers, was identified in the 2006 Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment,
as a major constraint towards improved agricultural growth and poverty reduction in
Malawi. To respond to this need, the Government transformed its subsidy program
into a targeted fertilizer and seeds program (Farm Input Subsidy Program - FISP) in
2005/06 agricultural season and significantly ramped up the program (to about 2
percent of GDP). However, the dominance of ADMARC and Smallholder Farmers
Fertilizer Revolving Fund of Malawi (SFFRFM) in the distribution of the subsidized
inputs to farmers led to a substantial fall in commercial sales of inputs through private
sector outlets.



7
 The liberalization of the sector during the early to mid-1990s resulted in a massive entry of smallholder farmers
into tobacco production. While the income from production was hitherto concentrated among a limited number of
commercial estate owners, such income was now spread among some 350,000 households, with powerful
multiplier effects in rural areas. Malawi’s Tobacco Sector: Standing on One Strong Leg is Better Than on None

    FIMAG operation (FY04) had started ADMARC restructuring process.




                                                        5
23.     The PRSG 1 reform agenda was therefore designed to support the process
of creating a level playing field by ensuring deliberate efforts were made to
increase private sector participation in the distribution of subsidized fertilizers
and seeds. The prior action required involvement of the private sector in the
distribution of fertilizer with a targeted participation rate of at least 28 percent. The
indicative target for PRSG 2 focused on performance assessment of private sectors
involvement in FISP whereas, the indicative target for PRSG 3 was to focus on
further improvements in the functioning of fertilizer markets through the development
of a medium term plan for FISP.

24.     On land market, the problem that the Fiscal Management and Accelerating
Growth Program (FIMAG 1 & 2) and PRSG series tried to solve was related to the
need to improve access of cultivable land. This was based on the fact a third of
cultivable land was unused partly because the land taxation and rental system did not
discourage large landholders from leaving land idle.

25.     PRSG 1 focused on the recruitment and deployment of 24 Land Officers
and 55 Land Clerks to support the implementation of land rents and tax policies,
whereas, the indicative trigger for PRSG 2 was to support the Cabinet approval of an
equitable land taxation structure for freehold land and an equitable rent structure of
agricultural leasehold land (this indicative trigger was subsequently replaced).

Policy Area 2: Improving the Business Climate

26.     The 2006 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and the 2006 Doing
Business Country Profile for Malawi identified cumbersome business licensing
requirements, weak contract enforcement and limited access to commercial
justice as among constraints to improving the business climate in Malawi. 9 Poor
macroeconomic performance characterized by high levels of interest rates and high
fiscal deficit (1994-2004) had also affected the overall business environment.

27.     PRSG 1 therefore focused on improving access to commercial justice through
the establishment and operationalization of the Commercial Division of the High
Court so as to relieve the large backlog of commercial cases in Malawi courts that
existed in 2007 as well as to strengthen contract enforcement. Follow-up actions were
also supported in PRSG 2 and 3. On business licensing reforms, the indicative trigger
for PRSG 3 was to support the process of gazetting and approval of the revised
Malawi Investment and Trade Center (MITC) bill, by both the Cabinet and Parliament,
to foster Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and support private-sector led growth.

Policy Area 3: Dealing with Vulnerability to Shocks

28.    Given the country’s vulnerability to various types of shocks (weather,
terms of trade, HIV/AIDS etc.), there was clear emphasis in the 2006 Poverty and
Vulnerability Assessment and the 2007 Status Report on Malawi’s Social Protection
on the need to improve coordination and the funding of Malawi’s social protection
programs and its targeting. The 2004 Weather Based Insurance Study on Malawi also

                                                 6
identified schemes such as weather insurance and irrigation as means of mitigating
weather related risks ex-ante.

29.    PRSG 2-3 was intended to support reforms aimed at improving social
protection, including the formulation of a social protection policy that could guide
the social protection programs in the country, improving targeting of the FISP and
improving the national response to weather shocks through weather insurance scheme.

Policy Area 4: Improving Economic Governance

30.    Budget Processes: The 2005 and 2006 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Framework Assessments (PEFA) highlighted existence of a weak
linkage between the MGDS and the financial planning and budgeting systems,
absence of comprehensive budget classification structure that could facilitate that link
between the MGDS priorities and the budget, and the overall weaknesses in the
budget calendar. Prior actions in PRSG 2 therefore focused on the establishment of
the budget calendar, whereas, prior actions in PRSG 3 focused on the improvements
in alignment between the budget and the MGDS through the Chart of Accounts
(COA).

31.    Debt Management: The 2007 Public Expenditure Review (PER) identified
weak fiscal discipline and weaknesses in the debt management as a major source of
poor fiscal performance in the past. Identified weaknesses in debt management
systems and institutions included absence of debt management policy to guide debt
contracting decision; weak coordination between the Reserve Bank of Malawi and the
Ministry of Finance; weak staff capacity in Debt and Aid Division of the Ministry of
Finance, which was supposed to coordinate all debt and aid related transactions. Prior
Actions in PRSG 2 therefore supported the approval process for the Debt and Aid
Management Policy, whereas, PRSG 2 supported the operationalization of the Debt
Management Committee.

32.    Payroll Management: Weak management of the civil service payroll was
another important source of poor fiscal performance in Malawi as highlighted in both
the 2007 PER and 2006 PEFA. Weak wage bill forecasting was identified as one of
the major contributing factors to the over-expenditure problem during 1999-2004,
which was translated into increased domestic debt. Weak payroll management also
contributed to the persistent ghost workers problem. PRSG 1-3 supported actions
aimed at addressing variations in the wage bill and the ghost workers problem
through reforms in Human Resource Management Information System
(HRMIS) and personnel audits.

33.    External Audit and follow-ups: PEFAs conducted in 2005 and 2006, and the
2004 HIPC Assessments and Action Plans identified weaknesses in Malawi’s external
auditing system, including long delays in the submission of audit reports to
Parliament for legislative scrutiny, and lack of follow-up by the executive branch on
audit recommendations. This was a very important area of reform especially
considering that HIPC and the resumption of growth had afforded a much larger role
for public resources in the country and setting mechanism for its more effective use a
very high priority. PRSG 1-3 reform agenda was therefore designed to address the
audit backlog problem and improve the follow-up on audits.



                                           7
1.5    Revised Policy Areas

34.     The four policy areas were not revised, although the component on
reducing vulnerabilities to shocks modified its initial focus. The initial focus was
on improving both the national response to climatic shocks and the Government’s
coordination of social protection programs, but the aspect covering coordination of
social protection was modified at PRSG 2 due to budgetary pressures in the wake of
2008/09 global crisis. Instead, the focus was on supporting the Government to
improve the targeting of beneficiaries of its subsidy program, the FISP, being the
most important social protection program in terms of fiscal costs -averaging 3.8
percent of GDP during FY2007/08-FY2009/10-and its direct impact on the poor.
Meanwhile, the weather insurance program was retained and remains under
implementation to date.

1.6    Other Significant Changes

35.     PRSG 3 included US$14 million as additional financing under the Bank’s
Crisis Response Window to assist the Government of Malawi in dealing with the
spillover effects of the 2008 global food and fuel price hikes into the 2009 global
financial and economic crisis. The impact of the global crisis was felt through the
terms of trade channel, as the rise in fuel and fertilizer prices led to an estimated
deterioration in the balance of trade of US$280 million, representing close to 7
percent of GDP. Specifically, the increase in fertilizer prices in 2008 alone was
estimated to have contributed to an increase in import cost of US$120 million (about
3 percent of GDP).



2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Program Performance


36.     The PRSG series had three single-tranche operations, which disbursed on
effectiveness. PRSG 1 was approved on October 30, 2007, and became effective on
November 28, 2007. PRSG 2 was approved on May 28, 2009, and became effective
on June 22, 2009. PRSG 3 was approved on June 8, 2010, and became effective on
June 21, 2010. Originally, four single tranche operations with a total amount of
US$110 million were planned but only three operations delivered with the total
disbursement of US$104.7 million.

37.    The PRSG series was implemented within the harmonized framework for
the provision of budget support in Malawi, the Common Approach to Budget
Support (CABS). The reform areas covered in Section 1.4 were jointly agreed with
the Government in close consultations with the CABS development partners (DPs).
The PRSG program aimed at supporting the Government’s efforts to accelerate
growth while at the same time ensuring that the vulnerable were adequately protected
from shocks.



                                         8
38.    A total of 24 prior actions for the three operations were met prior to
Board presentations. The PRSG policy matrix was part of a larger reform program
contained in the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) monitored by CABS
DPs through joint annual reviews. The list of prior actions for each of the three PRSG
operations is reflected in Table 1.

39.     PRSG program also had a total number of eight indicators related to
Prior Actions reflected in the M&E framework, but there were a number of other
indicators related to Prior Actions, which were not included. Annex 1 provides tables:
Table 1 on key economic and financial indicators; Table 2 on Performance indicators;
Table 3 on PRSG M&E framework.

40.     The operation was designed in such a way that the PDOs focused on
outcomes for which the PRSG series was contributing to. A total of 24 prior
actions for the three operations were met prior to Board presentations. These covered
four policy areas of the program development objectives (PDOs), namely improving
the functioning of agricultural markets, improving the business climate, dealing with
vulnerability to shocks, and improving economic governance. These reform areas
were jointly agreed with the Government in close consultations with the CABS
development partners and represented critical building blocks for poverty reduction
and growth promotion in Malawi.

41.     Quality of entry was moderately satisfactory as the project design was too
optimistic with respect to the possibility of achieving the performance indicators
on time, particularly with respect to the very ambitious and sweeping reforms in
the agriculture sector. This was, especially so, since some of the reforms involved
politically sensitive institutional changes (i.e. restructuring of ADMARC, land
rents/taxes and fertilizer market reforms supported also under FIMAG), which
required more time and a clear understanding of the political economy dynamics and
the intensity of dialogue to ensure success. There were a number of legislative
amendments and adoption of new/amended policies, which also required Parliament
and Cabinet approvals, respectively. There were also weaknesses in the M&E
framework (partly reflecting weaknesses in the MGDS results framework) and the
general view that indicators used were more process oriented rather than outcome and
as such they presented a challenge of attributing their direct contribution to outcomes
in support of the PDOs.

42.     In spite of the challenges above, good progress was made towards the
achievement of the four PDOs. In some areas the progress was very significant.
Under improving the functioning of agriculture markets, progress was mixed. The
indicator on ratio of ADMARC markets in urban and semi-urban areas to markets in
rural areas was met in 2008. However, this was the same year the Government’s
resolve to pursue reforms in the sector changed due to the 2008 crisis and
ADMARC’s role in the maize market was again re-enforced. Meanwhile, on the
indicator on medium term plan for FISP, the role of private sector in seeds subsidy
was met, but the private sector’s role in the distribution of fertilizer was partially met.


                                                            10
The land rents/tax reforms supported by the program did not make significant
progress. Reforms in the tobacco sector contributed to the establishment of satellite
auction floors and helped to reduce transport costs to farmers, although the reforms to
operationalize contract farming were slow. Under improving business climate, the
establishment of the Commercial Division of the High Court has contributed to the
reduction of days to resolve cases to 96 from 337 days in 2006, but the reforms to
improve business licensing were slow. Under dealing with vulnerability to shocks, the
weather insurance program was successfully launched and continues to remain
operational. However, the social protection policy still awaits Cabinet approval.
Under economic governance, reforms performed well, with the exception of domestic
debt. While the Government was able to reduce the debt to GDP ratio from 20 percent
in 2005/06, to 14.5 percent in 2009/10, the combination of the general fiscal loosening
during the May 2009 Presidential elections and weakening macroeconomic policy
environment in 2010/11 has started to put upward pressures on domestic debt.

43.     The period under which the PRSG series was implemented (2007-2010)
coincided with the period of strong economic performance in Malawi, thanks to
the strong macroeconomic management (since 2004), the debt relief from
HIPC/MDRI, increased donor funding, FDI inflows and the very positive response by
the private sector to improved economic environment. Specifically, real GDP growth
averaged at 7.3 percent, amid single digit inflation and narrowing of the fiscal deficit
(average of below 3%).10 The strong economic growth has been on account of strong
growth in agriculture (particularly smallholder agriculture) following several
consecutive years of bumper tobacco and maize harvests (2007-2009), good weather,
and availability of fertilizer and seeds through the FISP. 11 Stable macroeconomic
conditions and bumper harvests contributed to inflation deceleration to 7.4 percent in
2008, from 15.5 percent in 2005.

44.     GNI per capita has also registered an improvement from US$ 240 in 2006,
to US$ 33012 (WDR 2012). This notwithstanding, poverty remains deeply entrenched
with rising inequality and unemployment.13 From a historical perspective, what seems
clear is that incomes of smallholder tobacco farmers increased in recent years, with
good tobacco prices and high production, and the food security situation at national
level has also improved. According to the 2010/11 evaluation of the FISP, the



10
   Fiscal discipline was however relaxed in late 2008/09 due to a combination of high global fertilizer
prices, over spending on fertilizer imports and the budgetary overruns related to May 2009 Presidential
election spending. This resulted in a fiscal deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2009/10, but with the ECF
fiscal discipline was restored to register a marginal surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP.

   Based on the 2004/05 Second Integrated Household Survey, 52.4 percent of the population was
living below the poverty line. New poverty numbers from 2010/11 IHS3 are expected to be released
during the third quarter of FY12.

economy-wide effects of the subsidy from higher ganyu14 wage rates, reduced time
spent on ganyu, availability of maize at local level and lower prices of maize have
enabled poor households to access maize when they run out of their own production.
As such, the subsidy is said to have helped poor households to be cushioned or
resilient against agricultural-related shocks. 15 Social spending has averaged at 6.2
percent of GDP between 2007 and 2010, from just about 5 percent of GDP prior to
2007.16

45.     PRSG 1 had 7 prior actions covering three of the four policy areas
supported by the series, namely, improving the functioning of agricultural markets,
improving the business environment, and improving economic governance. All the
prior actions were met satisfactorily before the Board date.

46.     PRSG 2 had 8 triggers at PRSG 1 covering all the four policy areas, all of
were implemented as prior actions during the operation with some
modifications. The operation supported two reforms under improving the functioning
of agricultural markets, one reform action under improving the business climate, one
action under dealing with vulnerability to shocks, and four actions under improving
economic governance. However, the reform dealing with vulnerability to shocks
changed at PRSG 2 from supporting improvements in the coordination of social
protection programs, to supporting the Government to improve the functioning and
targeting of beneficiaries of the FISP which is by far the largest social protection
program in the country.

47.    There were 9 prior actions under PRSG 3, a reduction from the 10 PRSG
3 triggers proposed at PRSG 2. The indicative trigger under improving the
functioning of agricultural output markets (a maize grain REPO or call option is
implemented)17 was changed and replaced with a more relevant prior action (a macro
weather insurance is implemented) to reflect the fact that the initial trigger was no
longer relevant as a risk-management tool given the changed conditions in the
country.

48.     In the area of improving the functioning of agricultural markets, the PRSG
series focused on improving interventions in the maize and tobacco markets, which
represented a continuation of reforms initiated in the Fiscal Management and
Accelerating Growth (2004-2006).

49.     Under improving the tobacco markets, the program supported efforts to bring
tobacco markets closer to farmers through two reform actions. PRSG 1 supported the
establishment of three satellite tobacco auction floors, which Government

successfully established, and opened three more satellite auction floors. Since their
opening, the satellite auction floors have been used to market over 12 percent of
tobacco per annum. However, only one has been used to conduct auction sales.

50.     Reforms in the maize markets aimed at supporting private sector
development in the maize markets and improving smallholder incomes by bringing
the market closer to the farmer. The focus of prior actions were on (1) strategic
refocusing of ADMARCs operations to its core function of providing ready markets
where there are market failures (typically in rural areas), and (2) establishing Malawi
Agricultural Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO) as a warehousing
commercial entity that would provide efficient storage facilities for farmers and
traders. While concrete steps were taken to roll out reforms in ADMARC, including
the establishment of MAWTCO, the 2008 global food and fertilizer price crisis
affected the Government’s resolve to proceed with these liberalization plans,
especially amid soaring domestic maize prices. While ADMARC still remains
dominant in the maize market, the involvement of the private sector players has
gradually increased, taking advantage of inefficiencies in ADMARC and its fragile
financial position, especially in the purchase of maize from farmers.

51.     Under improving the functioning of agricultural input markets, the
program supported the development of the input markets by supporting private sector
participation in the distribution of subsidized farm inputs, and improving smallholder
farmers’ access to land. The program envisaged to support input market development
through following reforms: (1) Implement the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP)
with 28% private sector participation in distribution; (2) Start performance assessment
of private sectors involvement in FISP based on agreed performance indicators; (3)
Improved functioning of fertilizer markets based on performance-based monitoring
indicators. Reform actions to support the development of land markets included (1)
recruitment and deployment of 24 Land Officers and 55 Land Clerks to strengthen
implementation of land rent and taxation policy changes, and (2) Cabinet approval of
an equitable land taxation structure for freehold land and an equitable rent structure
for agricultural leasehold land. Only three of the five triggers were adopted as prior
actions.

52.      Under improving the business environment, the PRSG program supported
reforms to improve access to commercial justice and the business licensing regime.
With regard to access to commercial justice, the reforms focused on the settlement of
commercial disputes. There were 3 prior actions for this sub-component: (1)
Establishment of the commercial division of the High Court; (2) Average number of
days to settle commercial disputes is 290 or less; and (3) Completion of audit of
commercial cases that are still at the General Division of the High Court to determine
which ones should be transferred to the commercial court. All the three prior actions
for this reform area were implemented.

53.     The rationale for the business licensing reforms was to simplify the
procedures required to open a business by establishing a one-stop investment
shop for business licensing. The initial PRSG 3 trigger for this was to reduce the
number of days to get a business license to 90 days or less. This was, however,
changed at PRSG 2 to reflect the required institutional changes that would lead to the
targeted objective; and a new trigger was introduced in PRSG 2 to have the Malawi



                                          13
Investment and Trade Centre (MITC) Bill gazetted. This trigger was dropped as a
PRSG-3 prior action because the MITC Bill was yet to be enacted.

54.     Under dealing with vulnerability to shocks, the reform program initially had
two triggers aimed at supporting improvements in the design, targeting,
implementation, and coordination of social protection programs. The trigger for
PRSG 2 was in support of the Cabinet approval of a new Social Protection Policy,
while the trigger for PRSG 3 related to improved allocation of FY08/09 budget for
social protection based on the approved policy. However, the Government realized
early on in the program implementation the timing constraints that would be involved
to have a Cabinet approval of a policy. There was agreement to refocus the support in
this policy area to improving beneficiary targeting under the Farm Input Subsidy
Program (FISP)-the largest government social protection program in terms of fiscal
costs and potential to reach out to a huge number of beneficiaries. Consequently, both
PRSG 2 and PRSG 3 prior actions focused on improving the beneficiary targeting
guidelines based on lessons learnt from implementation of the FISP in the preceding
year. This notwithstanding, the Social Protection Policy, was resubmitted to the
Cabinet in May 2010, following revisions in response to concerns raised by the
Cabinet in 2008. To ensure that the country was more systematic in hedging against
food price volatility, smooth maize availability in throughout the year, and to
minimize resorting to distortionary price interventions, the PRSG 3 supported the
implementation of macro-weather insurance.

55.     Under improving economic governance, the program supported 11 reform
actions aimed at improving the budget process, payroll management, timeliness and
follow-up of external audit, and debt management. In the area of improving budget
processes the program initially had two prior actions, both of which were met on time
and without modification. PRSG 2 supported the introduction of a budget calendar
that incorporates all budget related activities, while PRSG 3 supported the revision of
the budget structure and classification and the associated Chart of Accounts.
Following the fiscal slippages in 2008/09, especially in the FISP, a new prior action
was added under PRSG 3 (procurement review of the 2008/09 and 2009/10 FISP) to
strengthen institutional arrangements and efficiency in budget implementation.
Although this new prior action was not in the PAF, it was included after consultations
with Government and CABS DPs. There were 3 triggers for improving payroll
management, with a focus to strengthen the control of civil service payroll and
minimize the variance between projected and actual wage bill, all of which were
implemented on time. Similarly, the 3 triggers relating to the timeliness and follow-up
of external audit and 2 triggers on debt management were all implemented on time.



2.2    Major Factors Affecting Implementation

External Factors

56.    The 2008/09 global food and fertilizer price shocks impacted Malawi and
the implementation of the PRSG series as it led to increased in domestic food
(maize) and hikes in fertilizer and oil prices. This had an important impact on the
country’s political economy, which affected the pace of reforms. While the increase in
maize production supported by FISP along with better rainfall conditions effectively


                                          14
buffered the country from the worst effects of the global food price crisis of 2008, the
sharp rise in domestic maize prices reduced the Government’s resolve to continue
with the market liberalization agenda. Instead, the Government’s reaction (which was
similar worldwide) was to take stronger control of the market so as to shield poor
farmers (net buyers) from price hikes through setting up of minimum prices for maize
and tobacco. To contain pressure on the balance of payments and rebuild external
reserves, Malawi sought access to the IMF’s 12-months Exogenous Shocks Facility
(ESF), which was approved by the IMF Board in December, 2008.18

57.     High global fertilizer price hikes affected the country’s trade account as it
led to an increase in fertilizer import cost of about 3 percent of GDP and the
Government’s decision to increase the amount of fertilizers imported for the FISP at
the peak of the global prices (doubling the cost of the program that year), resulted in
an overshoot in the FISP budget to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2008/09, from an average of
3 percent of GDP. The external current account deteriorated to -5.5 percent of GDP in
FY2008/09, from a surplus of 1.0 percent of GDP in 2006/07. As such, the fiscal
deficit widened to -5.7 percent of GDP in FY2008/09, from a surplus of 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2005/06, due to expanded outlays on input subsidies and other government
purchases. Domestic debt also shot up from 12 percent of GDP in 2007 to 17.1
percent of GDP in 2008.

58.     The impacts of the global financial crisis were felt in the balance of
payments, through trade and remittances channels. To restore the external and
internal equilibrium, the Government got access to a three year Extended Credit
Facility (ECF), approved in February 2010, which also helped to unlock donor
funding directly through the budget. Through the PRSG 3, the Bank provided an
equivalent of US$53 million, including US$14 million additional resources from the
Crisis Response Window (CRW) to help Malawi cope with the impact of thee rise in
world fuel and fertilizer prices in 2008/09 and decline in international prices for some
main export commodities i.e. cotton, tea and coffee during the same period. However,
the ECF went off-track in April 2011 and efforts are underway to resuscitate the
program.



Internal factors

59.      Fiscal policies loosened significantly in the run up to the May 2009
general elections. Following several years in which government prudently retired
domestic debt whilst maintaining small fiscal deficits, significant budget overruns on
fertilizer and general expenditures in goods and services in early 2009 led to high
domestic borrowing. The targets of the ESF program for end June 2009 were missed
by a large margin. The overrun on fertilizer expenditures reflected in part high
international markets, but also shortcomings in the procurement practices as well as
unbudgeted purchases of fertilizer that was not eventually used for the 2008/09



18
  ESF expired in December 2009 without completion of any reviews due to program slippages,
especially in public spending.

planting season. 19 The maintenance of a de facto fixed exchange rate in an
environment, where the kwacha become increasingly overvalued, also exerted
negative pressures on the balance of payments as the demand for non-tradables and
imports increased and with shortages in the forex supplies, domestic importers started
accumulating external payment arrears and the country’s credit lines started to
contract.



Adequacy of government’s commitment

60.     Government was committed to the reforms supported by the PRSG, as
they closely reflected the government’s medium-term development agenda. The
objectives of the PRSG series were clear and in line of the Government’s requirement
and development priorities and there was effective consultation process with key
stakeholders. In particular, policy area on improving the functioning of agricultural
markets aligned with key priority area number 1 of the MGDS-Agriculture and Food
Security; sub-theme 2-agricultural productivity. The policy area on improving the
business environment aligned with MGDS Theme 1: Sustainable Economic Growth;
Sub-theme 2: Enabling Environment for Private Sector Led Growth. The third policy
area on improving social protection was aligned with MGDS Theme 2: Social
Protection, Subtheme 1: Protecting the vulnerable, Strategy 1: Providing efficient and
effective support to the most vulnerable with limited factors of production. Finally,
the policy area on improving economic governance aligned with MGDS Theme 5:
Improved Governance, Sub-theme 2: Public Policy Formulation, Fiscal Management,
Public Sector Management and Corruption.

61.     However, commitment to some of the reforms in the agriculture and
social protection changed during implementation. What is clear from the
Borrower’s ICR is that although the Government had signed up to reforms the
agriculture sector, ownership was not strong across all areas of Government. As such,
the Government’s resolve on direction and pace of reforms was tested in the wake of
the 2008 global food and fertilizer crisis as the crisis threatened the sustainability of
achievements in food security. The Government therefore stopped the reform agenda
of gradually increasing the participation of the private sector in the distribution of
subsidized fertilizer, leaving the whole exercise to just two parastatals-ADMARC and
SFFRFM. This may have been due to uncertainty with regard to the political
implications of undertaking some of the policies at a time when world food prices had
skyrocketed. As a result, some reform commitments stated in the Letter of
Development Policies on agriculture sector reforms, were not fully implemented.




19
   Due to economic governance concerns, the Bank reduced the funding for PRSG 2 to US$30 million
(from US$40 million provided for in the CAS).



                                               16
Effectiveness of Donor Coordination

62.     As stated earlier in the text, beginning 2007, development policy
operations are being prepared in the context of the harmonized general budget
support framework of the CABS. In line with the Paris agenda on aid effectiveness
and harmonization, and as envisaged in the CAS, the Bank joined the CABS group in
2007, and PRSG 1 was its first disbursement under the CABS. In this context, the
identification of the PRSG’s prior actions and triggers was done jointly with existing
CABS members, and the program was fully aligned with the PAF. Further,
monitoring and evaluation of the program was also conducted in the context of CABS
annual reviews (see Section 2.3 below). The CABS process thus helped in several
ways in implementing the PRSG program: it enhanced the depth and coverage of the
policy dialogue; helped the Bank to be more selective in the number of policy areas to
support, whilst ensuring that the other key policy areas in the PAF are covered by
other Development Partners who have the comparative advantage in the area; helped
to leverage more predictable and coordinated financing; and provided the political
leverage to ensure good governance.



Soundness of Background Analysis

63.     The preparation of the PRSG program, including the selection of the
policy areas and specific reform actions to be supported, was informed by an
extensive set of analytical studies. (See PRSG 1 program document, par. 50-58). The
component on improving the functioning of agricultural markets benefited from the
2004 PSIA on ADMARC reforms, the 2004 Malawi Agricultural Policy Options, the
2006 Tobacco PSIA and the study on options for restructuring ADMARC prepared in
2006. Further, limited access to agricultural inputs was identified in the 2006 Poverty
and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA) and earlier studies as a major constraint towards
improved agricultural growth, and poverty reduction. The 2006 Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA) and Doing Business Country Profile for Malawi provided the
analytical underpinnings for reforms under improving the business climate.

64.     The 2006 PVA also analyzed in detail the extent to which Malawian
households are vulnerable to exogenous shocks and the coping mechanisms
employed. The PVA and the 2007 Status Report on Malawi’s Social Protection also
highlighted the fact that Malawi’s social protection program suffered from many
deficiencies, including poor coordination of existing programs, inadequate
Government funding, and poor coverage of programs. Finally, the economic
governance component was informed by several analytical studies, including the 2003
Malawi Country Financial Accountability Assessment, the 2004 HIPC AAP report,
the 2007 Public Expenditure Review (PER), as well as the Public Expenditure
Financial Accountability Framework (PEFA) reports financed by the EU in 2005 and
2006.




                                          17
Assessment of the Operation’s Design


65.     The PRSG program design benefited from donor harmonization through
the CABS. The PRSG prior actions were a subset of a comprehensive PAF jointly
agreed upon between Government and the CABS Development Partners. This
ensured that the PRSG program was selective enough in the policy areas to be
supported while at the same time being part of a comprehensive reform program
within the PAF financed by several Development Partners.

66.     Project design was however, too optimistic with respect to the possibility
of achieving the performance indicators on time. Specifically, the design of
agricultural reforms was highly ambitious with respect to the speed with which they
could be implemented. Since the reforms tackled politically sensitive areas like
ADMARC, land and fertilizer markets, they required enough time for consensus
building before expecting any effective implementation.


Relevance of Risk Analysis


67.     The PRSG I Program Document identified five major risks that could
affect the program’s outcomes and the risk analysis was fully relevant. (1)
Political/governance risks which related to lack of ability to implement a strong
reform program as a minority government and the influence of the 2009 general
elections on macro-fiscal prudence. (2) Vulnerability to external shocks, including an
uncertain international environment and drought; (3) risks to macroeconomic stability,
arising from the impact of terms of trade/weather shocks and fiscal slippages in the
run-up to general elections; (4) Utilization of funds: A risk that the composition of
public expenditures may not be fully consistent with MGDS priorities. (5)
Administrative capacity and coordination: Malawi’s relatively limited Government
administrative capacity and coordination among relevant line ministries and
departments, compounded by the impact of HIV/AIDS on human capacity in general,
could lead to delays in the implementation of key measures. To mitigate these threats,
the PAF included indicators and targets aimed at improving the composition of
expenditures. Further, the PRSG supported a reform agenda aimed at improving the
budget process, and strengthen the linkages between the budget and the MGDS.
Further, IDA relied on the CABS partnership whose implementation arrangements
include high level policy dialogue between CABS Heads of Missions and the Minister
of Finance to discuss critical policy issues that could affect donor support.

68.     PRSG 2 identified the risk of the impact of the global crisis on economic
growth, in addition to the political and capacity risk identified at PRSG 1. PRSG
2 was prepared and implemented in the midst of the global financial and economic
crisis, and this posed a risk to the country’s growth prospects through reduced
exports, remittances, foreign investment, and foreign aid from bilateral donors. To
mitigate this risk, IDA and other CABS development partners intensified the policy
dialogue with the Government to ensure that the momentum of the reform program is
maintained.




                                         18
69.     The risks identified in PRSG 3 were essentially the same as at PRSG 1
and 2. They included uncertainty in the international economic environment-
including the impact of the global economic crisis; policy shift in the Government,
resulting in delays or abandonment in some of the agreed reforms; capacity risks; and
impact of drought on food security and fiscal management. Again, policy dialogue
and ensuring aid predictability among the CABS partners was key to mitigating most
of these risks.

70.    Several risks materialized, and had varying degrees of impact on
program implementation. While some of the risks that actually occurred were
largely contained by the mitigation measures in place, the others had significant
impact on the program as earlier discussed.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
Utilization:

M&E Design

71.    The Program Document for PRSG I established a Results Framework
and the M&E mechanism for which progress to the end-series outcomes would
be assessed. There were 8 monitoring indicators for the four policy components,
although some prior actions could not be linked to any monitoring indicator. Most of
the indicators were also more of output/process indicators than outcome indicators.
For example, the monitoring indicator for the component on improving the business
environment was “the number of business licenses issued per month,? and the
monitoring indicator for improved coordination of social protection programs was
“number of programs being directly coordinated by the Social Protection Unit.? Focus
on process outputs has its inherent weaknesses as it is not always easy to trace or
quantify the outcomes and/or impacts.

72.    There was also insufficient alignment between the PRSG/CABS
monitoring indicators and the MGDS monitoring indicators. This is in part due to
the weakness of the M&E framework for the MGDS. The UNDP-financed
independent review on the MGDS pointed out that the M&E framework as one of the
major weaknesses of the MGDS 1.



M&E Implementation and Utilization

73.    Program monitoring was done within the context of the CABS Annual
Reviews. As mentioned earlier, the CABS group undertakes two annual reviews, one
during February/March and another during September/October. It is during the
February/March review when then undertakes a comprehensive assessment of
performance against the targets, and the findings of the assessment provide a basis for
making disbursement decisions. Where feasible, results from the MGDS annual
reviews are also used for monitoring progress in the PAF.

74.   There were two main weaknesses to the monitoring process through the
PAF. First, as already pointed out, the MGDS monitoring indicators were not
comprehensive enough for the M&E system to provide data that could also be used


                                          19
for assessing the indicators in the PAF. As such, data on some of the indicators still
had to be collected on an ad hoc basis, outside the MGDS Annual Review process.
Secondly, although cast in a three-year horizon, the PAF only contains a list of prior
actions/triggers and their targets, but does not contain monitoring indicators. As such,
the focus of the Government and CABS members is mainly on the progress in
achieving the targets for the prior actions, rather than on assessing their impact on the
broader sector outcome. This is the case more so because the PAF is a combination of
process and output/outcome indicators, so that certain components of the PAF could
well be used as outcome indicators while others relate to processes to achieve targets
(which may not have been defined within the PAF).



2.4    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

75.     A stand-alone DPO is currently under preparation, to serve as a bridge
between PRSG I-III series and a potential new programmatic series. This stand-
alone is meant to give room for the finalization of the MGDS II formulation, which
has faced delays due to the current political economy as well as allow for policy
dialogue building process, especially in sectors like agriculture. The focus of the
stand-alone DPO would be on public finance management reforms, which reflects a
continuation of the economic governance reforms under PRSG series. It would also
complement the Government’s medium term Public Finance and Economic
Management Reform Program being finalized, which is expected to be financed
through the Multi-donor Trust Fund to be administered by the Bank.



3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Program Rating: Highly Relevant

76.      The PRSG program’s objectives and design remain highly relevant to the
country’s development priorities and the Bank’s corporate goals. All the four
policy areas were directly aligned to the MGDS themes. The program’s development
objectives and the four policy areas remain as relevant today for achieving Malawi’s
growth and poverty reduction agenda, as they were at appraisal. Moreover, the
thematic areas they supported also appear in the draft MGDS II (2011-2016). Further,
the program aligned well with the Bank strategy as reflected in the 2006/07-2010/11
CAS, and complemented Bank investment operations in various sectors (see
paragraph 11). Most prior actions/triggers were sequenced from PRSG 1 to PRSG 3
as critical incremental steps towards achieving the program development objectives.

3.2    Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Program Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.   The broad objectives of the series were to support sustained economic
growth and poverty reduction through implementation of the MGDS, and


                                           20
progress towards these goals was overall moderately satisfactory. Despite severe
shocks associated with the global food and fuel price hikes in 2008 and the global
financial crisis of 2009, which affected the implementation of some of the reforms
supported by the PRSG series and weakened the external sector, the economy
remained resilient, registering high rates of economic growth. Without the PRSG
program, progress in the four reform areas, especially in agriculture, would have been
much slower.

78.     Real GDP growth averaged at 7.3 percent, amid single digit inflation and
narrowing of the fiscal deficit (average of below 3 percent).20 Stable macroeconomic
conditions and bumper harvests contributed to inflation deceleration to 7.4 percent in
2010, respectively, from 15.5 percent in 2005 (Annex 1-Table 1). The strong
economic growth was on account of strong growth in agriculture (particularly
smallholder agriculture) following several consecutive years of bumper tobacco and
maize harvests (2007-2009), good weather, and availability of fertilizer and seeds
through the FISP. 21 This notwithstanding, poverty remains deeply entrenched with
rising inequality and unemployment.

79.     However, macroeconomic performance weakened in 2011 and if not
addressed threatens to reverse gains attained through this operation. External
imbalances are affecting the private sector’s ability to access foreign exchange
leading to reduced economic activities and low economic growth. This is
compounded by uncertain and complex global environment and deteriorating
domestic governance. Table 1 in Annex 1 provides key economic and financial
indicators.



Objective 1: Improve the Functioning of Agricultural Markets

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.    PRSG 1 supported the establishment of satellite auction floors in outlying
markets with the goal of reducing the waiting time for sellers, reducing farmers
transport and marketing costs and improving the overall efficiency of tobacco
markets in the country. These reforms led to the establishment of three satellite
auction floors and it also influenced the Government’s decision to establish additional
three satellite auction floors over the PRSG series. As a result, more smallholder
farmers are now able to access the depots and carry out transactions and in so doing
reducing the time they would have otherwise spent traveling as well as the cost of


20
   Fiscal discipline was however relaxed in late 2008/09 due to a combination of high global fertilizer prices, over
spending on fertilizer imports and the budgetary overruns related to May 2009 Presidential election spending. This
resulted in a fiscal deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2009/10, resulting into an off-track ESF. But the ECF program
restored fiscal discipline and the external sector registered some improvements. However, currently the ECF is
currently off-track.

21
   The recent structural transformation in the agricultural sector saw a rapid growth in the smallholder farming
sector strongly involved in the tobacco sector. Malawi’s smallholder farming sector is dynamic, contributing over
80 percent of Malawi's agricultural production.




                                                        21
transporting tobacco to sale points. Transport and other logistical costs to smallholder
farmers have now been reduced from over 10 US cents per kg before the satellite
depots were introduced to about 5 US cents per kg. 22 Anecdotal evidence also
suggests that incomes of smallholder tobacco farmers have increased in recent years,
from good tobacco prices and high production, and the food security situation at
national level has also improved. Although the M&E framework had no monitoring
indicator for tobacco reforms, available statistics show that the six markets have
constituted an average of over 12 percent of the total annual volumes of tobacco sales.
Of the six satellite depots, only Chinkhoma operates full-time auction sales; other four
operate as mini-floors where auction sales are conducted on set dates.23

81.      One lesson that has emerged is that in the six satellite auction floors,
buyers use their market power to pass on to farmers their added transport costs
of auctioning tobacco in more remote areas and transport it to processing
centers. Moreover, not all capacity and operational requirements to operate these
satellite floors are in place. In particular, the Tobacco Control Commission (TCC) and
Auction Holdings need to station staff in all these satellite auction floors, but have
financial constraints. Other capacity and operational constraints include inadequate
storage infrastructure and security at the auction sites, and lack of the necessary
technology to enable efficient auctioning e.g. weighing machines, data processing and
transmission, and quick payment modalities to farmers. Government is already
actively seeking to expand this number, and has concluded feasibility studies on
establishing three more satellite in Chitipa, Luchenza (Thyolo), and Kamwendo
(Mchinji).

82.     Based on the objective of reducing the marketing, logistical and
transaction costs associated with tobacco marketing, there is anecdotal evidence
that congestion and waiting time at the three main floors has also been reduced
considerably. However, to further reduce the marketing costs, there is need to further
improve the management of the Satellite system by involving the Auction Holdings
Limited more in the management of the depots, as well as improve the services in the
depots. A comprehensive evaluation of the satellite auction system is critical in order
to determine the nature and scope of the improvements. Furthermore, there is need to
consider reviewing the Tobacco Act to provide for complete review of the auction
system, and provide for other players in market, as is practiced in other countries in
the region.

83.    Reforms to operationalize contract farming were rather slow and as such
the indicative trigger to improve contract farming arrangements was replaced.
However, the process of coming up with a draft contract farming policy was most
helpful however in fostering dialogue between Ministry of Agriculture and key
players in the sector, including tobacco buyers and growers. In the absence of the
reforms supported by the series, some of the reforms would have still been
implemented but not in a very focused and deliberate way. These reforms represented


22
     Information from Tobacco Association of Malawi.

23
 The Lilongwe floor facilitates trade of 50% of the national crop, while the Limbe floor accommodates 17%. The
Mzuzu and Chinkhoma floors make up the remainder of the national crop at 25% and 8%, respectively.




                                                       22
a continuation of reforms initiated under FIMAG and needed to be sustained in order
to achieve the intended objectives.

84.     Despite the poor performance from the just ended 2011 tobacco
marketing season, reforms supported by the PRSG program remain sound. The
2011 tobacco marketing season was characterized by low prices and high rejection
rates from poor quality tobacco leaf, which has affected incomes of smallholder
tobacco farmers. The crisis in the tobacco market has however brought back the
contract farming debate on the table. Efforts are underway to revisit the draft policy
with a view of expanding its scope beyond tobacco to cover other crops as well.
Government has expressed its desire to see at least 50 percent of tobacco in the
2011/2012 Agriculture season under contract marketing arrangement (80 million kg)
and its intensions to regulate tobacco production by introducing quota system as well,
in view of the global ban on burley tobacco in compliance with an international
agreement on tobacco control global demand.24 Despite the international push to ban
burley tobacco, the sector’s dominance in the economy is expected to remain in the
medium term.

85.   The outcome in the area of improving tobacco markets is therefore rated
moderately satisfactory.

86.     Under the maize markets, PRSG 1-2 prior actions made possible the sale
of ADMARC Investment Holding Company (AIHC) and the establishment of
MAWTCO as a warehousing company. This being said, the reforms were not fully
implemented. The objective of creating a level playing field between ADMARC and
other players partly worked. While some of the reforms were reversed (ADMARC’s
presence in some urban markets) following the maize price hikes during the 2008
global food and fuel crisis. MAWTCO’s establishment and the transfer of six
ADMARC’s warehouses to MAWTCO aimed at enhancing private sector
participation in maize markets. Unfortunately, the company is yet to become fully
operational, as the appointment of its Chief Executive Officer has been delayed for
over a year.

87.     Despite the fact that ADMARC reforms were not completed, private
sector activity in output/inputs markets has nevertheless improved because of the
momentum built by reforms under PRSG 1-3. The indicator on the ratio of
ADMARC markets in urban and semi-urban areas was achieved mid-way through the
program (by PRSG 2, the number of ADMARC markets in urban and semi-urban
areas was 8 percent from 74 percent). Even thought the ratio of ADMARC markets in
urban and semi-urban areas picked up slightly to 14.5 percent following the
Government’s decision to reverse some of the politically sensitive institutional
reforms, especially in the aftermath of the 2008 global food and fuel crisis,
ADMARC’s share of the market still remain below the 20 percent end of program
target. The Government continues to use ADMARC to purchase maize and distribute
inputs.


24
   Malawi is the world's largest producer of burley tobacco, supplying about 10.5% of the world tobacco market.
Tobacco exports are the main driver of economic growth in the country and 2 million smallholder farmers depend
on this sector for their livelihood.




                                                      23
88.      The withdrawal of ADMARC from some markets has also created room
for the establishment of other players such as, for example, the Grain Trade and
Processors Association (GTPA) and other commodity groupings which have obtained
increasing market shares. Since not all ADMARC markets are operational, private
traders are involved in the buying of maize at harvest (at lower prices), and end up
selling the same maize back to consumers at higher prices because ADMARC
markets do not usually have enough stocks to supply to consumers in many places of
across the country. Although some of these developments are due to ADMARC
liquidity challenges, some of this is due to the space that was created through the
initial policy reforms. ADMARC now no longer enjoys the same level of dominance
as it used to before the reforms. What is evidently clear is that reforms in this policy
area did not have a broad based ownership within the Government, which is an
important lesson for future operations.

89.     In terms of the achievement of the overall objective of improving
agricultural productivity, this was positive but attributed to a combination of
factors. These included the use of improved maize seed varieties among smallholder
farmers through FISP, impact of incremental fertilizer application, favorable weather
as well as complementary role played by both the development partners, including the
Bank, and the private sector. The end of program target for maize yield was set at
1.60 metric tons, from 1.45 metric tons per hectare in 2004/05 (three-year average).
There were clear indications that the target would be surpassed, as mid-way through
the program the three year average was 1.78 metric tons per hectare. By the end of the
program, the three-year average productivity for 2008/09-2010/11 was 2.29 metric
tons. As such, the impact of reforms on improving input market played a
complementary role in the achievement of the program outcome on improving maize
productivity, with FISP playing a much stronger role.

90.     The outcome in the area of improving maize markets is therefore moderately
satisfactory.

91.     Performance in the area of improving the functioning of agricultural
input markets was mixed. In the sub-area of improving fertilizer markets, the
program objective of protecting and nurturing the development of input markets by
supporting private sector participation in the distribution of subsidized inputs under
the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) was partially achieved. Government
implemented the prior action for PRSG 1, which pushed up private sector
participation rate in fertilizer distribution under FISP to 28 percent, but these reforms
stalled during the implementation of PRSG 2 (Table 1). In November 2008, the
Government, in the wake of the 2008 food crisis, rescinded the private sector’s
authorization to distribute subsidized fertilizer in return for vouchers, leaving the
distribution to ADMARC and SFFRFM. This notwithstanding, prevailing conditions
were such that private sector activities in the marketing of subsidized seeds and
procurement and transportation of subsidized fertilizer to ADMARC and SSFFRFM
depots have gradually increased.

92.      Although the program’s M&E framework had no monitoring indicator
for the development of the input markets, available reports show some
improvement’s in the private sector’s involvement in the FISP. Various evaluation
reports financed by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) of the
FISP between 2006/07 and 2009/10 indicate that there have been improvements in


                                           24
tendering procedures and increased private sector involvement in importation of the
subsidized fertilizers. The Government of Malawi/World Bank joint procurement
review for the 2010/11 FISP also shows that all the fertilizers under the FISP is now
procured through an open and competitive tender, and over 80 percent of the quantity
is provided by the private sector, although there is room to improve on some of the
procurement procedures. Through 2007/08 the private sector also expanded its
participation in subsidized seeds sales, expanded its distribution networks and was
developing innovative partnerships with independent agro-dealers. Private sector seed
markets have improved whereby 100 percent of the seed vouchers are redeemed
through the private sector and as a result the capacity of the Seed Traders Association
of Malawi (STAM) has improved. The private sector has also responded to the
financial incentive provided by government to expand geographic coverage to include
remote locations.

93.      According to the 2010/11 evaluation of the FISP, the economy-wide effects
of the subsidy from higher ganyu25 wage rates, reduced time spent on ganyu,
availability of maize at local level and lower prices of maize have enabled poor
households to access maize when they run out of their own production. As such, the
subsidy is said to have helped poor households to be cushioned or resilient against
agricultural-related shocks.26 As the country has now entered into the lean season as
of November 2011, maize prices rising, especially in the Southern region where there
are food shortages and as such ADMARC is now rationalizing maize prices. The rise
in the global fuel and fertilizer prices in during the first half of 2011 saw the
Government taking prudent measures to maintain the fertilizer program at the same
nominal level as in the previous year’s budget. Instead, the Government scaled down
fertilizer imports under FISP by about 17 percent to 140,000 metric tons as a way of
containing the price effect on the budget. 27 Of the total quantity of subsidized
fertilizer imports, 64 percent was allocated to the private sector and the remaining 36
percent split between ADMARC and SSFFRFM. All transport contracts under FISP
are awarded to the private sector. Reforms in this sector will likely continue to move
in a gradual manner.

94.   The outcome in the area of improving fertilizer/seeds market is therefore rated
as moderately satisfactory.

95.     The objective of increasing the area of cultivated land and strengthening
the operation of land markets was not achieved. While through PRSG 1 the
Government was able to hire and post 24 District Land Officers and 55 Land Clerks
to all the districts to support the decentralized land administration services, non-

approval by the Cabinet of the new land taxation structure28 meant that these officials
could not operate. The recruitment of land officers was meant to strengthen the local
assemblies’ capacity to collect land rent, which Government had increased as part of
the previous DPL (FIMAG) from MWK50 per hectare to MWK1,000 per hectare.
However, following outcries from mostly smallholder farmers, Government
suspended the implementation of the rate adjustment and it is unclear whether the
recruited officials were deployed at all. It is likely that there were insufficient
consultations with all stakeholders to ensure the much needed buy-in into the reforms.
The Government has since undertaken another review of the land rental structure with
a view to introducing a graduated rental structure commensurate with the value and
use of the land, as opposed to the current blanket structure.

96.    The outcome in the area of improving land markets is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

97.    In light of the performance in both the input and output markets, the outcome
in improving agricultural markets is rated moderately satisfactory.

Objective 2: Improved Business Environment

98.    The PRSG series supported reforms aimed at improving the legal and
regulatory environment for businesses. Three prior actions supported improving
access to commercial justice and one supported improving the business licensing
regime.

99.     Good progress has been made towards improving access to commercial
justice and its respective contribution to the PDO. PRSG 1 supported the
establishment of commercial division of the High Court in Blantyre and Lilongwe,
which have contributed to improved efficiency in the clearance of commercial
disputes. This has in turn resulted in a significant reduction in the average number of
days taken to settle commercial disputes from 337 days in 2006, to 125 days against
the PRSG 2 target of 290 days. These commercial courts are being run by four highly
trained judges, three of whom are based in Blantyre. The average number of cases
registered between 2007-2011 stands at 164, with an average of 72 consent and
default judgments issued and pending conclusion averaging 25 cases. As a result, the
number of days to settle commercial disputes has been significantly reduced to 96
days by September 2010 (BESTAP ISR no. 7) from 337 days in 2006. The target at
end of the BESTAP program in 2012 was set at 180 days.

100. PRSG 3 supported the completion of the case audit at the High Court
whose objective was to isolate all cases that were commercial in nature from
general cases. Following the audit, it is now up to the two interested parties whose
cases were classified as commercial in nature and are at the High Court General


28
   The Land taxation structure was drafted by the Special Law Commission and submitted for Cabinet approval in
2006. It was referred back to the Special Law Commission with a recommendation to make it more comprehensive
and in line with other related pieces of legislation such as the Chiefs Act, the Town and Country Planning Act, and
the Local Government Act, among others. The Special Law Commission revised the Draft Bill and has now sent it
to Cabinet for review and approval, before sending it to Parliament for enactment. To date, the policy has not yet
been approved by Cabinet.




                                                       26
Registry to take their cases to the commercial court. In view of increased confidence
in commercial courts and demand for this service, plans are underway to establish
another Commercial Division of the High Court in Mzuzu. Apart from completing all
the three prior actions related to this sub-component, Government has continued to
implement other related reforms outside the PRSG program e.g. supporting the
introduction of a Masters degree in Commercial Law at the University of Malawi. It is
worth noting that the successful implementation of this reform was also partly due to
the presence of complementary/supportive technical assistance project in this specific
sector (BESTAP). These reforms are fully owned by the Government and remain
sound even in the current environment where weak macroeconomic management is
impinging on private sector operations in the country.

101. The outcome in improving access to commercial justice is therefore highly
satisfactory.

102. Reforms to simplify the business licensing regime are advancing but very
slowly. The PRSG series supported reforms to simplify procedures by opening a one-
stop investment shop for business licensing. A revised Malawi Investment and Trade
Center (MITC) Bill was drafted in 2008 (PRSG-3 trigger at PRSG-2), but has not yet
been approved by both the Cabinet and Parliament and thus the delay in the
establishment of a one-stop investment centre. This PRSG-3 indicative trigger was
dropped, as it became clear that it would not achieve its intended objective i.e. to
facilitate institutional reforms that would lead to the establishment of the one-stop
centre.29 Limited progress has also been made in the process of introducing a Single
Business License, which has also been on the table before the PRSG series was
launched. The Single Business License Bill was drafted in 2009, but awaits Cabinet
approval. This notwithstanding, there are a number of reforms recently undertaken
aimed at increasing investor confidence by making it easier and cheaper to wind-up
business.

103. The expected outcome under the component of business environment was
an increase in the number of businesses registered per month. The plan was to
reduce the number of days to obtain necessary licenses and permits from 185 days to
30 days by 2012, but it currently takes 200 days (2012 Doing Business Report).
However, Ministry of Industry and Trade has reported that the number of days to
register a business has narrowed to 16 days in 2011 (but no means of tracking
progress), which could reflect definitional and methodological differences. The
indicator in the M&E framework was on the number of business licenses issued per
month and the target was to move from the baseline of 60 licenses per month to 70
per month at the end of the series, but data to track this indicator has been difficult to
obtain. Malawi’s performance on the number of days it takes to start a business has
worsened from 37 days in Doing Business 2007 to 39 days in DB 2011 (compared to
about 46 days for the Sub-Saharan Africa region) and has remained at that level to the




29
  The merger of MIPA and MEPC has already been approval. In 2011/12 the two institutions have got one budget
and the Government will shortly appoint Directors as well fill key positions. The MITC was incorporated in
December 2010 and the acting Head has recently been appointed.

current period (Doing Business 2012).30 There are other on-going initiatives such as
electronic business registration, recently launched by the Government, aimed at
improving access to business information.

104. The PRSG 1 Program Document noted that support for this policy area
was derived from the BESTAP, “ … which supports the achievement of the
Government’s strategy of facilitating private sector led economic growth through four
mutually reinforcing components: (i) Strengthening property rights institutions and
business facilitation; (ii) strengthening private sector development support institutions
and services; (iii) promoting access to finance and productivity; (iv) capacity Building
and Implementation Support. While the PRSC program specifically supports key
reforms under components (i) and (ii) of BESTAP, progress towards the PRSC
outcomes is dependent on the implementation of the overall reforms program
supported by BESTAP.? In this context, the latest ISR for BESTAP (ISR no. 7,
October 2010) rated the performance of components (i), (ii), and (iv) as satisfactory,
and component (iii) as moderately satisfactory.

105. The overall implementation progress for the project was accordingly rated as
moderately satisfactory.

106. With regards to the objective of increasing private sector investment,
progress has been encouraging driven by a combination of factors. Private sector
investment has shown a steady increase, averaging at 15 percent of GDP between
2006-2010, with a high of 19.1 percent of GDP registered in 2009. Growth in the
credit to the private sector has also been on a rise, with the highest growth of 45.5
percent registered in 2008, slowing down to 25 percent in 2010. This notwithstanding,
business environment has started to deteriorate with persistent shortages of foreign
exchange supply, unreliable power and water supplies, fuel shortages and high
transportation costs.

107. The outcome in the business environment component is therefore rated
moderately satisfactory.

Objective 3: Improved Household Resilience to Shocks

108. In the area of social protection, reforms have also been rather slow
despite the clear realization on the importance of having an effective social
protection and safety net program given the country’s vulnerability to shocks
(i.e. adverse weather condition, HIV/AIDS, terms of trade shocks etc). The PRSG
program aimed to support improvements in government’s coordination of social
protection programs through the Social Protection Unit. The program planned to
support the development of a Social Protection Policy, which would have helped to
rationalize the various social protection programs in the country (PRSG 2 indicative
trigger). This would have been followed by allocation of budget for social protection
programs in accordance with the new policy (PRSG 3 indicative trigger). A draft



30
  The country's rank on the Doing Business Index fell from 141 st out of 183 countries in 2011 to 145th in 2012.
This reflected a lack of progress in alleviating the constraints that hold Malawi back the most, notably dealing with
construction permits, getting electricity, trading across borders and obtaining credit.




                                                        28
Social Protection Policy submitted was to Cabinet in 2008 but was not approved. A
new draft Social Protection Policy was resubmitted to Cabinet in May 2010. The
Government is still unsure how to proceed with this reform.

109. Meanwhile, the focus changed at PRSG 2 from supporting the design and
implementation of a coherent national social protection policy to supporting
improvements in a specific social protection program-the Farm Input Subsidy
Program (FISP).31 The justification for this change was that since its introduction in
2005/06, the FISP has been the most important social protection program in the
country, taking over 60 percent of the Ministry of Agriculture’s budget, and has
potential to impact the poor and vulnerable if properly targeted. 32 The FISP has
helped poor households to be cushioned against agricultural-related shocks. A DFID-
financed evaluation report on the implementation and impact of the 2009/10 FISP33
indicates that there have been improvements in the beneficiary targeting since
2005/06, leading to improved efficiency and economic returns of the program. The
PRSG 3 PAD (par. 89) also reported that there have been clear improvements on the
targeting of beneficiaries in the FISP to the poor and vulnerable groups.

110. On reforms related to weather related shocks, there was strong buy-in and
the Government has been actively working with the Bank and DFID to explore
options of hedging against adverse weather shocks. The weather insurance scheme is
now under operation for the past four years and has been indirectly funded by DPs.
While the Government makes a provision in the budget for the purchase of weather
insurance, they get reimbursed afterwards. For 2011, the funding came through a
Bank funded project (Agriculture SWAP). With regards to the sustainability of the
reforms, the Government has made efforts to build its in-house capacity to determine
and assesses insurance coverage needs at both macro and micro level, but is yet to
develop in-house capacity to negotiate weather insurance contracts and as such
continues to rely on the Bank’s technical assistance.

111. The outcome on improving Social Protection Programs is moderately
unsatisfactory.

Objective 4: Improved Economic Governance

112. The objective of improving budget processes to strengthen the alignment
between the budget and the MGDS, was achieved. PRSG 2 supported the
introduction of a budget calendar incorporates all budget related activities. As a result,
starting with the 2008/09 budget process, allocation ceilings are determined early and


31
   Although the main objective of the farm input subsidy programme was to increase productivity and food
security, it has played multiple roles and has influenced influence other social economic indicators of well-being.
Apart from productivity and maize production and self assessment of poverty, there are other socioeconomic
indicators that can be influenced by the availability of food through the subsidy programme. These other indicators
include food consumption, schooling and health and resilience to shocks and stresses.

32
   However, this being a departure from the initial objective, the Results and M&E framework were not changed to
reflect this departure.

of its Implementation and Impact.

communicated in good time to line ministries and departments. This has given line
ministries and departments enough time to prepare their budgets in line with Malawi’s
PRSP (the MGDS) priorities. The PRSG 3 prior actions contributed to the
establishing a stronger link between the budget and the MDGS and improved
structure of the budget classification based on international fiscal reporting standards.

113. The reforms in the budget processes have also led to a better monitoring
framework and linkage between the budget processes and the MGDS. The new
budget structure now comprises 19 standardized programs and sub-programs in line
with the 2001 GFS classifications, from 52 program classifications in previous
budgets. The 2011 PEFA assessment shows improved scores in the areas of
classification of the budget and comprehensiveness of information included in the
budget documentation, from a rating of B in 2008 to a rating of A in the 2011 PEFA.

114. The monitoring indicator for this area was the variance between budgeted
and actual expenditure. This indicator was measured in the PAF using a
modification of the PEFA methodology. In particular, the indicator required that
government in-year expenditure reallocation between 25 primary votes for 2009/10 to
amount to less than 10 percent of the total approved budget. This target was set
against the baseline of a variance equivalent to 10 percent of the budget in
FY2006/07. The Aide Memoire for the CABS March 2011 Annual Review indicates
that the target was achieved because the actual deviation for FY2009/10 was 6.8
percent (outcome of PEFA 2011 indicates that the target was 7.8 percent). This also
compared favourably against the over-expenditure of 19 percent in 2008/09. Wastage
in public spending is a big problem and is largely evidenced in the procurement
contracts of goods and services. The joint fertilizer procurement reviews under FISP
have therefore contributed to improved focus on value for money and the overall
management of this budget line (refer paragraph 55). Overall, these reforms have
improved the credibility of the budget.

115. The component on improving budget processes is therefore rated highly
Satisfactory.

116. The reforms in payroll management are progressing well. The objective of
strengthening control of the payroll and reducing variances between budgeted and
actual payroll was fully achieved. Significant payroll reforms undertaken by the
Government in recent years have resulted in improvements in payroll controls,
reductions in payroll leakages and fraudulent activities. Personnel records and payroll
data are now generated and managed within HRMIS and these processes are being
carried out by both the line Ministry and the Department of Public Service
Management (DPSM). Concurrently, an audit of the entire civil service database was
carried out in 2008. The personnel audit verified genuine employees but also found
that around 700 employees were on the payroll who were removed from the payroll.

117. Overall, there is significant improvement in wage bill monitoring, and
while variations in wage bill still exist, these are on a decreasing trend. The indicator
target for this reform area was to reduce the variance between budgeted and actual
wage bill from 5 percent in 2004/05 to 3 percent by the end of the program. The
variance in the budgeted and actual wage bill for FY2009/10 and FY2010/11 are
estimated at 2.9 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. However, the size of the wage



                                           30
bill continues to grow, reflecting the Government’s wage policy which granted 15
percent salary increments per year (2004-2010), on average.34

118. The introduction of payments through the banking system for all
government transaction in January 2011 has also helped to address the issue of
ghost workers. In FY2010/11 alone, 4,878 ghost workers were deleted from the
system, and 8,868 other possible ghost workers had been identified. Reforms in this
policy area therefore remain on sound footing, despite the current crisis and fiscal
challenges facing the Government.

119. The outcome on improving payroll management is therefore rated highly
satisfactory.

120. In the area of external audit, Government has made significant
improvements in the timeliness of submission of the audit reports to Parliament.
This has been made possible by the rollout of Integrated Financial Management
System (IFMIS) at the central government level and to the 17 district councils, which
has enabled the Account General to timely compile financial accounts by 31st October
as required. While the 2008/09 audit report was submitted in August 2011 (14 months
after the end of the fiscal year, the 2009/10 audit report was submitted within six
months of the year-end for the first time since the enactment of the Public Finance
Management Act in 2003.35 The program targeted a reduction in the time between end
of fiscal year and submission of audit report from 24 months in FY2004/05 to 10
months at the end of the program. But with still a number of transactions taking place
outside IFMIS, the challenge of preparing the Financial Statements will still be there
until all transactions taking place outside IFMIS are brought on board.

121. Follow-ups on audit queries still lag behind despite efforts to push for the
preparation of Treasury Minutes. The existing system of following up on audit
(internal and external) recommendations remains ineffective in terms of timeliness of
completing the accountability process, largely due to the non-functioning of Internal
Audit Committees, as evident in lack of responses from some Controlling Officers to
the management letter recommendations. As such, a number of recent sector
procurement audits (health, roads, Malawi Electoral Commission etc) continue to
reveal weaknesses in the procurement system, expenditure controls as well as
insufficient execution of audit functions, especially internal. The PRSC 3 supported
reform measures that were geared towards clearing Treasury Minutes backlog, but
this was not achieved given the fact that the Treasury Minutes are based on PAC
discussions on audit reports, which until recently had a backlog of up to two years.36


34
   Since 2004, salaries and wages for employees in the public sector have gone up by more than 186 percent on
average. The Government however reduced the annual salary increment in FY2011/12 to 7 percent due to
deepening fiscal pressures.

35
  The IFMIS roll-out at the central government level through FIMTAP contributed to the performance of this
component.

36
   The huge delays in the preparations and submission of audit reports to Parliament meant that discussions at the
PAC level were also delayed and Government’s responses (Treasury Minutes) for the respective audit reports were
also delayed.




                                                       31
The quality of Treasury Minutes has been criticized as well as their relevance since
there is a lag of over five years, with a number of controlling officers responsible no
longer in office and with non-functioning Internal Audit Committees in some
ministries to discuss the queries or make follow-ups.

122. The outcome on improving the timeliness of external audit is therefore rated
satisfactory.

123. Good progress has also been made in the area of public debt management
as the country’s debt remains sustainable. PRSG 2 and PRSG 3 policy actions have
contributed to the improvements in the Government’s overall debt management
capacity and policy formulation. Substantial progress has been made in improving,
particularly in the areas of debt policy formulation, the managerial structure, and debt
reporting. The capacity of Debt and Aid Division of the Ministry of Finance, in terms
of staff and Information Technology system, continues to be strengthened and the
Division has started to issue the semi-annual debt reports, which are being shared with
the broader public to promote transparency, and is also conducting Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA) in-house with support from MEFMI.

124. As a result, domestic debt declined from 20 percent of GDP in 2005/06 to
17.8 percent in 2008/09. This reflected good progress on fiscal consolidation efforts
made by the Government, although fiscal slippages in FY2008/09 and the current
economic crisis has pushed up the domestic debt to 16.1 percent in FY2010/11.
Suffice to note that this target was more ambitious than the medium-term target of the
Government’s macroeconomic program, which set to reduce domestic debt by 1.5
percent of GDP per annum. In line with this target, domestic debt would have been
expected at around 14 percent of GDP from the baseline of 20 percent in 2005/06.
While the country’s debt situation is currently within sustainable levels, the weakened
macroeconomic environment characterized by central bank financing and increase
borrowing from the market could push domestic debt outside the thresholds of
sustainability.

125.   The outcome on improving debt management is therefore rated satisfactory.

3.3    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Overall Program Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

126. Taking into account of both relevance and efficacy in achieving the
objectives of the series, the program’s outcome is rated “moderately
satisfactory.? The table below (Table 2) combines this information using the
outcome ratings for each specific objective. The objectives of the PRSG series were
highly relevant, and the design and implementation was moderately satisfactory.
Meanwhile, efficacy in achievement of the program’s specific objectives in the four
policy areas was also moderately satisfactory.

3.4         Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)         Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


127. The Program orientation towards addressing various structural and
institutional vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the economy aimed to reduce
poverty and improve the livelihoods of the people of Malawi. Improvements in the
indicators on agricultural productivity, functioning of output and input agricultural
markets, among others, provides clear evidence of the contributory role played by the
PRSG program in the country’s economic and social developments. With the support
from donors, including additional resources from the Crisis Window, the Government
implemented a series of measures to protect the population from the impact of the
2008 food and fuel crisis.

128. Improvements in budget allocations to social sectors have also
contributed to the improvements in the living conditions for the poor. Actual
social spending has exceeded the approved allocation for the past three fiscal years,
averaging at about 6.6 percent of GDP, from below 5 percent of GDP prior to 2007.
The country has been able to register improvements in infant mortality from 76 deaths
per 1000 live birth in 2004, to 66 deaths per 1000 live birth in 2010. 37 Under 5
mortality has also improved from 133 deaths per 1000 live birth, to 112 deaths per
1000 live birth. The country’s HIV/AIDs prevalence is also reported to have gone
down to 10.6 percent from 12 percent. Suffice to note, however, that targets on social
indicators are monitored in the CABS Performance Assessment Framework, of which
the PRSG prior actions are a subset. These indicators measure progress in the areas of
education, health, and gender. In this respect, implementation of the PRSG in a
harmonized framework helped the Bank to contribute to the close monitoring of these
social indicators and policy dialogue on improving the social outcomes.

129. However, it is difficult to directly assess the contribution of the PRSG
series to these outcomes. The outcomes were a result of a number of activities
supported by several Bank projects-including the PRSG, support from other
Development Partners, and Government’s own activities. What is clear however is



37
     2010 Demographic and Health Survey, National Statistics Office.




                                                        33
that the reforms supported by the PRSG series and the Bank’s direct contribution to
the Government’s budget plus complementary lending operations by the Bank have
helped them fund poverty reduction and growth promotion initiatives in Malawi.


(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

130. The reforms supported under PRSG 1-3 have helped to improve
Government’s capacity in public finance and economic management, as it re-
enforced capacity building activities by the Bank through on-going technical
assistance projects (e.g. BESTAP, FIMTAP). Improvements in the IFMIS, HRMIS,
restructuring of the budget processes, and the debt management framework have led
to long-term improvements in the institutional capacity, transparency and efficiency
(linking budgets to strategic objectives in the MGDS) in budget preparation,
implementation, and monitoring.

131. The series also successfully supported the establishment of the commercial
division of the High Court (complemented by BESTAP), which has helped to reduce
the time it takes to settle commercial disputes; and the restructuring of ADMARC and
establishment of MAWTCO, although the impact has been modest due to
Government delays in implementing the other supporting activities to achieve the
intended goals.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

132.   There were no unintended consequences.

3.5    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
       Workshops

133.   There were no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops.



4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Overall Rating: Substantial

134. The overall risk of policy reversal in the areas supported by PRSG 1, 2
and 3 is substantial. In agriculture, the risk of reversal in reforms in the maize
markets is high. Though MAWTCO was established under PRSG 2, Government has
delayed to let it become operational. Further, the current political economy is now
largely tilted towards bringing back the greater presence of ADMARC markets.
Several Members of Parliament have been asking Government to re-open the
ADMARC markets in their constituencies. ADMARC is also heavily involved in the
distribution of subsidized fertilizer under the FISP, and in recent years Government
has been issuing directives on minimum prices and for ADMARC to buy certain
crops (e.g. cotton in 2008/09 season, maize etc). Implementation of the recent draft
ADMARC Strategy (2010-2015), which was submitted to Cabinet early 2011, would
assist in minimizing this risk. Meanwhile, in the tobacco sector, the reforms are now
entrenched and as such the risk of reversal of the reforms in the sector is low. The


                                         34
established satellite auction floors have been functioning every year, and Government
plans to expand the network to other parts of the country.

135. The risk of reversal in the area of improving the business environment is
moderate since the reforms undertaken were institutionalized within the country’s
legal and regulatory system and are being further strengthened through the BESTAP,
which closes in 2012.

136. The risk of reversal in the progress achieved in economic management is
overall moderate. Government has shown strong ownership and leadership in
advancing these reforms, and there is strong support from the Development Partners.
Government has developed a medium-term PFEM reform program (2011-2016),
which aims to build on the reforms already undertaken in the past four years, and
several donors under the Group on Financial and Economic Management (GFEM) are
supporting this initiative. Furthermore, the Bank is administering a new Multi-Donor
Trust Fund to support the Government’s PFEM reforms. However, the current
economic crisis could affect the overall fiscal and debt sustainability.

137. The risk to macroeconomic stability from endogenous and/or exogenous
shocks is substantial. Already, the country macroeconomic performance has
weakened, adversely affected by the juxtapositioning of significantly reduced donor
inflows and tobacco proceeds, combined with higher fuel/fertilizer prices and other
supply bottlenecks. This has contributed to a widening of balance of payments and
budget gaps. The Government has increasingly been relying on central bank financing
and this has resulted in the widening of spreads between official and black market
rates and liquidity overhang. If sustained, these will have a negative impact on the
overall program development objective and could be compounded by the current
global environment.



5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Program Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

138. The Bank followed several good practices in designing the series. The
PRSG program was highly relevant to Government priorities in that it was aligned
with the MGDS, the Bank CAS and lessons learnt from previous operations. The
operations were also based on adequate analytical work to identify the priority policy
and institutional reforms to be supported by the program. However, selection of
certain reform actions, especially in the agriculture and social protection, could have
benefitted from an analysis of the political economy of implementing certain reforms
and investment on time to reach political consensus. Specifically, what would have
been required was more ground work in terms of analytical work (plus PE) and a
change in approach to policy dialogue to ensure a political buy-in and ownership of
the reforms. This is especially the case for reforms under improving the agricultural
input markets (fertilizer and land) and in the areas that required involvement of


                                          35
cabinet/parliament for the reform actions to be completed (social protection policy
and single business licensing regime). Further, the design of the M&E framework
could also have paid more attention to the development of adequate monitoring
indicators covering all the components supported by the series.

139. The program design also benefited from deep knowledge of sector issues
by the project team and adequate analytical work on all the policy areas
supported by the program. The task team involved in the program design included
key sector specialists, which was informed by sound analytical work (see section 2.2),
so that the selected policy and institutional reforms complemented the investment
operations in the sectors.

140. The decision to implement the PRSG program within the harmonized
CABS framework was sound. The decision to join the CABS group was fully
consistent with the Paris declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action. It helped to
minimize transaction costs to both Government and the Bank in terms of appraisal
and supervision of the three operations, enhanced close and consistent policy dialogue
with the authorities and other development partners under the CABS. The
participation by the Bank in the CABS grouping also ensured that the Bank was more
selective in the policy areas it supported through the PRSGs, whilst supporting a
comprehensive reform program that covered broad areas of Malawi’s economic and
social development.

(b)    Quality of Supervision
       (including M&E arrangements)

Program Rating: Satisfactory

141. The design and supervision of the PRSGs are closely linked, to the extent
that the supervision of operation n occurs side by side with the preparation of
n+1. In this connection, the institutional arrangements for supervision of the PRSGs
were part and parcel of the overall CABS procedures as set forth in the Joint
Framework for Budget Support. The CABS review process is continuous with two
main reviews per year, March and October. The March review looks at performance
in the preceding year and prepares the program for the following fiscal year (July-
June), while the October one reviews performance during the current year. To ensure
full and regular participation, the PRSG TTL and other core specialists are based in
Lilongwe. The Bank also participates regularly in IMF program review and technical
assistance missions.

142. Throughout the program implementation, the Bank showed flexibility to
proactively identify and resolve threats to the achievement of the development
outcomes. For example, when it became clear that the intended reforms under
reducing vulnerability could not be implemented due to timing constraints, the Bank
immediately re-focused its support to another area within the same component.
Flexibility was also reflected in the economic governance reforms when, at PRSG 2,
Government and the Bank agreed to include joint procurement reviews of the FISP as
a PRSG 3 trigger, after noting fiscal costs and PFM risks that the FISP presented the
overall achievement of the program development objective.




                                         36
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

143. The Bank team worked diligently and contributed to a number of
achievements. Though rather complex, the PRSG operations were appropriately
designed to support the country’s growth and poverty reduction agenda, although the
choice of certain prior actions and design of the M&E framework could have been
improved. One blemish on the Bank was on being overambitious in its determination
to push forward difficult reforms in the agriculture, which mostly represented a
continuation of reforms supported by the FIMAG operation. Overall quality at entry
was therefore moderately satisfactory. The quality of supervision was found to be
satisfactory and the team made good use of the CABS harmonized framework.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory


144. The Borrower expressed strong committed to the reform program
supported by the series as they reflected the Government’s own development
priorities articulated in its medium term strategy. However, commitment to
reform in the agriculture and social protection policy areas did not enjoy widespread
support across Government during implementation. As revealed in the Borrower’s
ICR, although there was insufficient buy-in on the agriculture reforms from the onset,
the Government still signed up to the reforms. Despite having a committed team, the
Government’s team did not have sufficient technical capacity or political mandate to
engage with the Bank in such a complex operation and as such performance was sub-
optimal in some areas.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

145. Not rated. In this case, Government and the implementing agency are
indistinguishable.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

146. The Government prepared a second generation PRSP (the MGDS), which
clearly spelt the country’s development priorities. The MGDS emphasized the
need for the country to promote export-oriented growth as a way of fighting poverty,
and clearly identified priority areas through which budget implementation would be
linked to the MGDS. However, the MGDS M&E framework could have been more
SMART, so as to enable meaningful measuring implementation progress and helping
to make decisions on how best to achieve the MGDS goals.

147. The Government's commitment to prudent macroeconomic management
and to the CABS processes provided an enabling environment for PRSG


                                         37
operations. Further, the enhanced policy dialogue within the CABS framework also
ensured strengthened policy dialogue throughout the series. This provided an enabling
environment for CABS Development Partners, including the Bank, to ensure
predictability of their budget support. Government’s performance with respect to the
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) also improved during the period.

148. During the implementation of the PRSG series, an improved level of
coordination was achieved (and partially achieved) on a variety of reforms.
Performance was particularly strong in the implementation of economic governance
reforms as this was the area the Government was putting most of its efforts to
improve prudence in fiscal management as well as improve their PFM systems to
push forward the Paris Declaration agenda of harmonization and use of country
systems. Improvements were registered in the overall budget process, timeliness in
external audit, and payroll management. The establishment of commercial division of
the High Court and the satellite auction floors were other such examples of progress
made by the Government. However, performance was not the same in other reforms
supported by the PRSG 1-3. Reforms related to the restructuring of ADMARC to
improve the level playing field in the maize market, involvement of private sector in
the fertilizer markets, contract farming as well as those in social protection, did not do
as well as envisaged.

149. Between 2004 and 2010, performance with the IMF programs was
satisfactory, with the exception of 2009 and 2011, where the ESF and the ECF
went off-track. However, the pace of reforms was slowed down in the run-up to the
May 2009 general elections. In late 2008 and early 2009, Government went off its
planned expenditure on the FISP, purchasing 40 percent more fertilizers than was
planned. This was despite the significant increases in international fertilizer prices that
translated into high local prices. Further, other recurrent expenditure in the 2008/09
budget-especially expenditure on other goods and services, also increased
significantly. Government also decided in late 2008 to withdraw the use of the private
sector in distributing subsidized fertilizer, against the spirit of reforms under the
PRSG series. As a result, Government missed its 2008/09 fiscal objective of reducing
domestic debt by a wide margin. Government also missed all the end-June 2009 IMF
quantitative targets under the one-year ESF, leading to an expiry of the program
without any review.

150. The Government restored fiscal prudence, leading to a new IMF
program, the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in February 2010. However, the
ECF program went off-track in June 2011 due to failure to complete the Second ECF
review. This notwithstanding, efforts by the Government are underway to get the
program back on track. Suffice to note that the going on-and-off track on the IMF
programs did not necessarily mean that the country’s macroeconomic policy
framework was a total disaster, but rather was partly a reflection of impact of external
shocks and external imbalances.

6.     Lessons Learned


151. Key lessons pertain to: (i) the importance of Government ownership, taking
the time to nurture it, through dialogue and analysis of the political economy of
reforms; (ii) the need to have a good understanding of political economy of sensitive


                                            38
reforms; iii) merits of working within the harmonized framework for the provision of
budget support; (iv) flexibility in the PAF to emerging issues should be encouraged;
(v) the need for a good and robust M&E framework for tracking progress and; (vi)
ambitions and complex reforms should not be avoided completely.

152. Government ownership, political will and commitment proved to be the
key determinant in the successful implementation of the institutional and
structural reforms under PRSG series. The PRSG program achieved many of its
intended objectives, especially where there was strong Government ownership.
However, in areas where Government ownership was less broad based, many of its
intended objectives were partially met. For example, performance was particularly
strong in economic governance reforms, reflecting very strong commitment by the
Government, especially Ministry of Finance, but ownership of reforms in the
agriculture sector were less broad based. Therefore, the Bank should also invest more
in terms of staff time and other resources at the preparatory stage to ensure adequate
client capacity and ownership of reforms is built. In addition, the authorities should
also be given the time and the space to prepare credible and sustainable reforms in
sensitive areas.

153. Progress has been slower in reform areas where the political economy
context was critical, yet not adequately understood. In terms of the reform areas
supported by the PRSG series, progress has been slower in reform areas such as
agriculture and social protection, where the political economy realities appeared to
have been little understood and underestimated. For example, in agriculture, there
were conflicting views within Government on whether to liberalize the sector or retain
the Government’s control. Eventually, a decision was made to liberalize the sector but
the pace of reforms was slower. The pace of reforms was also generally slower when
the reform actions involved political decisions (Cabinet/Parliament) for
implementation and as such all the indicative triggers whose implementation required
going through Cabinet approval were replaced. Clearly more rigorous political
economy analysis is needed to inform selection of program components as well as the
approach to policy dialogue for politically sensitive reforms in DPOs.

154. Working within the harmonized framework for the provision of budget
support, the CABS, has enhanced the quality of policy dialogue across donors,
notwithstanding the inherent coordination challenges. The enhanced policy dialogue
within the CABS framework ensured strengthened policy dialogue throughout the
series and provided the political leverage to ensure good governance. The CABS
framework also created an enabling environment to ensure predictability of budget
support and harmonized the donors reporting and review process. It also helped the
Bank to be more selective in the number of policy areas to support, whilst ensuring
that the other key policy areas in the PAF are covered by other DPs who have the
comparative advantage in the area. Continuous dialogue with the Government is
therefore critical in keeping up the momentum on reforms and this was enhanced by
the CABS framework.

155. Flexibility in the CABS PAF should be encouraged to enable it to adapt to
unforeseen external shocks and changing government priorities and programs.
Despite the rigidity of the PAF, the Bank was able to introduce a new prior action
outside the PAF related to the fertilizer program under FISP aimed at controlling this
budget line in response to fiscal slippages in 2008/2009. This was done in


                                         39
consultations with the Government and CABS DPs. Going forward, this flexibility
should be encouraged as it allows the Government and the DPs to respond to
emerging issues in the country.

156. A good and robust M&E framework is important in tracking progress
towards PDO outcomes. The M&E framework did not have sufficient monitoring
indicators to monitor progress in the implementation of the reforms under the series.
For example, there was no monitoring indicator for the tobacco market reforms and
commercial justice. Moreover, no monitoring indicator was added to the M&E
framework when, at PRSG 2, the FISP was included in the component improved
household resilience to shocks. It is therefore important to ensure that the M&E
framework is robust and any change of focus during the implementation of the
programmatic DPOs is reflected in the M&E framework to help in tracking progress
in the reform areas concerned. Additionally, in the selection of indicators effort
should be made to strike a good balance between process and outcome indicators,
with much stronger leaning towards outcome indicators.

157. The Bank should not shy away from supporting ambitions and complex
reforms critical for assisting client countries advance towards a higher growth
trajectory. Despite the fact that the PRSG 1-3 program was seen as ambitious, risky
and complex operation, a significant amount of reforms were advanced. Although the
Bank’s and Government’s ambition in advancing a number of politically sensitive
reforms was not fully achieved, it did create the moment for change and attained some
important results.

Project Development Objective: The program objectives of the PRSG series to support the Government of Malawi's (GoM) efforts to
undertake the critical policy and institutional reforms for the successful implementation of the MGDS. In particular, the PRSG program
was designed to support the Government in pursuing a development strategy that aimed at accelerating growth while at the same time
ensuring that the vulnerable were adequately protected from shocks. By the end of the series, the program will have contributed
towards increased economic growth and poverty reduction by supporting implementation of policy and institutional reforms that will
lead to increased agricultural productivity, increased private sector investment, improved resilience by poor households to shocks, and
sustained improvements in fiscal management.

Annex 3:       Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

I.     Introduction

1.      The World Bank has been supporting the Government in the implementation
of its budget through provision of General Budget Support Grant since the 2007/08
financial year. The Bank has been providing budget support within the harmonized
budget support framework of the Common Approach to Budgetary Support (CABS).
The CABS is a group of donors that have a joint approach to the provision of
budgetary support to the Government of Malawi. In September 2005, the Government
and CABS group agreed on a Joint Framework (JF) for budget support cooperation
designed to formalize their relationship. The JF is an agreement on principles
governing budget support cooperation in Malawi. Some of the principles governing
this cooperation include alignment to the country’s poverty reduction strategy, joint
reviews, and predictability of funding. It comprises of a multi-year Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) and a review process aimed at reducing transaction
costs for all parties involved. Through the PRSG operations the Bank sought to
support the Government of Malawi’s (GoM) efforts to undertake the critical policy
and institutional reforms for the successful implementation of the MGDS.

2.       In particular, the PRSG series aimed to support policy and institutional
reforms in the following four policy areas: (1) improving the functioning of
agricultural output and input markets, with a focus on improving Government
intervention in maize and tobacco markets, improving Government involvement in
fertilizer markets, and strengthening the operation of land markets; (2) improving the
business climate, focusing on reforms to improve the legal and regulatory
environment, particularly with regard to the business licensing regime and access to
commercial justice; (3) dealing with vulnerability to shocks, particularly supporting
reforms to improve the coordination, funding, and coverage of social protection
programs in Malawi; and (4) improving economic governance, targeting reforms for
improving Malawi's budget process, payroll and debt management, timeliness and
follow-up of external audit

3.      Overall most of the focus areas of the PRSG series were fully met and that
government’s overall reform program was moderately satisfactory. Out of the four
policy areas progress was very slow in implementation of the agriculture related
reforms. The reason for poor performance of the agriculture reforms was due to the
perception by the Government that the reforms in agriculture would make poor
section of the population worst off since they depend on agriculture for their
livelihood. Additionally the agriculture reforms were viewed as politically sensitive as
such they proved difficult to implement because there was little buy-in from
stakeholders within the Government. Although the Government signed up to a reform
program that included some of these reforms, the general view is that there was little
ownership and sensitization on what was required. Since the proposed areas of
reforms/triggers are perceived to have undesirable social consequences there is need
for wider consultations, negotiations and sustained dialogue between the Government
and the CABS development partners. It should be pointed out that the triggers/reforms
on ADMARC, which were the focus of the PRSG series, were also part of another
reform program agreed between the World Bank and the GoM (through FIMAG,
FRDPI and II) where results/outcome were not as strong.


                                          46
II.    Assessment of the Outcome:

4.      Implementation of the PRSG series: Notwithstanding the difficulties
experienced with some of the triggers, overall there have been notable improvements
in the business environment/climate, functioning of agriculture markets and improved
economic and public finance management. For instance, budgeting processes and
systems; strengthened, payroll management and; debt management systems have been
strengthened.

5.     Malawi has implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving budget
planning and execution. Reforms supported by PRSG 1-3 included the introduction of
the budget calendar and budget guidelines with budget ceilings for sectoral ministries;
improvements in the budget consultation process; and changes in the structure of the
budget in line with the international standards of budget classifications, including
introduction of the new Chart of Accounts (COA) consistent with GFS 2001.
However, monitoring of the budget implementation has hitherto been conducted
through the Mid-Year Budget review, which allowed for inefficiencies in the budget
implementation to continue unchecked well into the second half of the fiscal year.
Moreover, lack of an effective monitoring tool made it also difficult for the public to
monitor closely the budget implementation. To address this issue, Government
decided to introduce quarterly monitoring reports of budget implementation as a
management as well as accountability tool for tracking budget implementation
progress.

6.      Prior to the budget systems review, the Government budget was very difficult
to understand and not user friendly. It was also very difficult to compare budget lines
across countries. Through the review the budget systems and structure are easy to
understand, which makes it easier for Government to control areas of wastage and
help in targeting to achieve better impact. The Ministry of Finance is reviewing the
budget systems and structures to make it more responsive and ensure efficient
allocation of public resources. The Ministry of Finance is continuing to implement
reforms in the budget preparation in order to bring Malawi in line with certain
international standards, and to improve the manner in which the Government of
Malawi uses its resources.

7.      Government Financial Statistics and changes to the Chart of Accounts:
The Government also restructured its budget to suit international standards for
financial management by adopting some of the principles contained in the
Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFS 2001). This resulted to adopting a new
classification of economic activities within the Malawian budget process.

8.      With the implementation of the GFS 2001, government has standardized the
coding for programs, sub programs and sub-sub programs. This means program are
not specific to certain Ministries of departments but rather each Ministry is mandated
to choose the appropriate program, sub program and sub-sub program according to
the nature of the activities they want to implement.

9.     Improving Payroll Management: Payroll volatility has been one major
challenge facing the Government recently, the PRSG was thus formulated to help the
Government address these challenges. In order to address these challenges the


                                          47
Government first carried out a personnel audit and reviewed its Human Resource
Management Information System. At the end of the PRSG series the Government had
done audit trails on the validity of the payroll data; and commencement of the project
to link the HRMIS to the government’s financial management system IFMIS. Further,
in line with the jointly agreed CABS targets for March 2011, Government has
activated all the functional modules of HRMIS, which include Establishment,
Employee & Payroll modules are up and running and up to date in terms of
information. The additional four HRMIS modules of Training, Loans, Pensions and
Terminal Benefits are operational and parameter data capturing is in progress. As
regards the review and streamlining of personnel events reporting procedures, the
Department of Public Service Management (DPSM) conducted consultative meetings
with various Ministries and Departments to review the reporting of personnel events
in the civil service. Following the report from these meetings, DPSM has now issued
a Circular to all Government Ministries and Departments, requiring controlling
Officers to report personnel events within a month of occurrence. The review and
streamlining of personnel events reporting procedures is part of the HRMIS re-
engineering process to improve efficiency and make it much more reliable.

10.      Improving Public Debt Management: As a post HIPC Country, the
Government of Malawi has taken a keen interest to build strong debt management
institutions that would check against un-sustainable borrowing. The starting point for
the Government was to have the Debt and Aid Management Policy in place. The
policy which was approved by Cabinet in April 2009 provides guidelines on the
contraction and management of public and private sector debt in order to achieve the
Government’s debt objectives. As one way of operationalizing this policy, in 2010
Government established a Debt Management Committee composed of representatives
of the RBM, the Treasury, and the Accountant General’s Office, and Ministry of
Justice which meets quarterly to recommend to the Minister of Finance on whether to
contract any external loans/guarantees, among other things. Further, the Ministry of
Finance has this year published a medium term Debt Management Strategy with
technical support from the World Bank and IMF.

III.   Evaluation of the Borrower’s Own Performance:

a.     Preparation for the PRSG series started within the CABS harmonized
performance framework where the Government of Malawi lead with the full
involvement of the sector Ministries. The challenge though has been the government
capacity to clearly identify and articulate the reform agenda.

b.      In the absence of clearly developed sector indicators it was difficult to agree
on the unit of measurements. The absence of comprehensive sector
investment/development strategies in some ministries created problems when it came
to choosing indicators for measurement.

c.     In certain instances the reform program that was agreed did not have adequate
budgetary provisions by the sectors, as such the sectors could not implement the
agreed activities because they were under-budgeted. In future there is need to ensure
that any PRSG trigger/CABS PAF trigger are adequately budgeted for by the
Government.



                                          48
d.      Lack/weak Government capacity to effectively engage with the Bank when
developing the PAF/reform program. This often resulted in a reform program that is
not realistic and not wholly owned by higher authorities.

                    V.      Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank:

11.     To ensure that there is consensus and ownership of the reform agenda the
Bank should spend more time in preparing the triggers to be included in the PRSG
series. The choice of the triggers should be based on the existing Government reform
program. However, in the event that there is none, the Bank should work with the
authorities to establish one. The Bank should be careful not to be seen to be imposing
the reform on to the Government as was perceived with some of the agriculture
reforms.

12.      Implementing of the non PFEM related reforms was sluggish due to little buy
in from the sectors concerned. For example the trigger related to the establishment of
the MAWTCO and the reforms in the agriculture input and output markets were not
popular within the Government. Going forward there is need for the Bank sector
specialists to work with various sectors in terms of the specific sector reforms. Only
when there has been consensus on the sector reform program, then the indicator can
be part of the PRSG reform program. Experience has shown that in sectors with
clearly defined program of work/SWAP it was very easy to agree on a reform agenda
and achieve results unlike in sectors where there was no clearly defined program of
work. Misalignment of the World Bank GBS Triggers with the sector plan and
priorities. Despite agriculture being the Bank focal area in Malawi, most of the
triggers that were the focus of the PRSG in agriculture were not part of the sector
strategy. It is recommended that future prior actions should be in line with what the
sector intends to do either from the sector strategy or MGDS. This will encourage
ownership of the reform process unlike the current practice where ownership is
compromised resulting in low pace of reforms.

13.     Timeliness of the disbursement is another issue which the Bank should
consider: The Bank has been disbursing on the last month/week of the financial year;
this makes budget implementation very difficult resulting in domestic borrowing and
may spill over to the next financial year leading to Government future targets and
triggers.

14.     The Governments proposal is that the Bank should seek a onetime approval
from its Board of Directors for the entire series rather the seeking Boards approval on
a yearly basis which results in late disbursements. This arrangement has been used by
the African Development Bank in its budget support operations. We feel the yearly
approvals contribute the delays in disbursement dates. Once the Bank obtains a
onetime approval from its Board of Directors for the entire series what the Bank needs
to do is to monitor on a yearly basis the fulfillment of the triggers in order to make
disbursements. The Government and the Bank could agree on the means/type of
evidence to be provided. The Bank will also be doing its regular implementation
support missions during the CABS review to check if the program is on course.




                                          49
15.    The World Bank should endeavor to align the prior actions for GBS with the
Performance Assessment Framework. Selection of indicators outside the PAF puts
pressure on Government both in terms of human and financial demands.

16.   The number of prior actions should also be minimized and proportionate to the
amount of the GBS to be disbursed.

VI.    Proposed arrangements for future operations of the PRSG

17.     Planning for future operations should be based on a clearly agreed set of
indicators which are backed by well defined sector program of work/sector
development strategies based on a clear M+E plan. The Government should ensure
that the results matrix for second MGDS is strengthened so that future PAF indicators
are based on the M+E framework of the MGDS – II.

18.    Ensure that the PAF indicators are adequately budgeted for at the sector levels.
Past experience has shown that sectors would commit to implement certain triggers
but would not properly budget for this activity in their annual budget;

19.    There is need to strengthen capacity of the Government statistical systems;

20.     Since one of the focal areas of the Bank in Malawi is agriculture, there is need
to strengthen the M+E framework of the agriculture SWAP so that it can be used as a
source of some triggers for the PAF. The current practice where the choice of
indicators for the PAF is outside the ASWAP creates implementation problems and
reduces ownership. It is being proposed that future prior actions should be in line with
what the sector intends to do either from the sector strategy or MGDS. This will
encourage ownership of the reform process unlike the current practice where
ownership is compromised resulting in low pace of reforms. Where there is no
concrete sector strategy the Bank should work with the Government to formulate one.

VII.   Provision of Information

21.     Providing feedback: preparation for the CABS PAF, from which the Banks
selects its triggers, is done jointly with Government and CABS DP. Implementation
supervision and support is done jointly which is a very welcome arrangement.

22.      Participating in ICR discussions: This being the first ICR after a PRSG
series, the Government team was not fully aware of its role, however with explanation
from the Bank there was limited involvement of key government stakeholders. Going
forward the ICR presents an important feedback/self assessment session for the
recipient to influence future operations.

23.    Commenting on the Bank’s ICR: The Bank was able to share the draft ICR
for Government’s comments. This is a very positive innovation which should be
encouraged.

Part Two: Comments on Bank’s ICR

Paragraph 52: The merger of Malawi Investment Promotion Agency (MIPA) and
Malawi Export Promotion Centre (MEPC) to form MITC has already been approved.
In 2011/12 the two institutions have got one budget and the Government will shortly
appoint Directors as well fill key positions.
