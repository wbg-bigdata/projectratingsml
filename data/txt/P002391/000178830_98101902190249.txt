INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOME NDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO SIERRA LEONE
FOR AN INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Sierra Leone for the equivalent of US$4.3 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a project to assist 2,500 small-
holders in growing rice, cocoa and oil palm; to construct a palm oil mill
and 20 small rice mills and to prepare an-agricultural development project
in the north and a forestry project in the central region of Sierra Leone.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission was in Sierra Leone in November and December,
1969 and its report entitled "The Current Economic Pbsition and Prospects
of Sierra Leone" (AW-20a), dated October 9, 1970, was distributed to the
Executive Directors. Discussions on the economy were held in Sierra Leone
in November 1971 and again in March 1972. Country data and an economic
memorandum are given in Annex II.  The main conclusions of this memorandum
are summarized in the following paragraphs.
3.        The basic development need in Sierra Leone is to broaden economic
growth outside, the export-oriented enclave mining sector. In the past
decade, this sector, which consists largely of diamond mining, accounted
for almost all of the economy's growth, which averaged about 4 percent
per year. In order to devise an appropriate development strategy, the
Government has obtained assistance from the UNDP.   Recent Government state-
ments have given priority to agriculture, education and transport, all of
which are of key importance to economic and social development. The main
emphasis on agriculture is appropriate not only because Sierra Leone has
good agricultural resources, but also because about 75 percent of the
population is engaged in agriculture. The expansion of manufacturing is
limited by the size of the market and should become more important when
possibilities for economic integration in West Africa improve. Some encouraging
discussions on this subject between Sierra Leone and Liberia have recently
taken place.
h.        The development of agriculture will provide foreign exchange savings
through import substitution and the expansion of exports. In addition, it
can help reduce the migration from the countryside which is already causing



'2-
mounting urban unemployment. Improvements in transport are an important
corollary to agricultural-development.  In recent years, some progress
has been made by dismantling the outdated and uneconomic railway system.
Meanwhile, construction has begun on important road links between the main
agricultural areas and coastal population centers, which are also the main
export outlets. Progress is being made in education, where the system is
being reformed to help provide manpower requirements and to serve develop-
ment needs. The main constraints to development are the absence of develop--
ment planning and the shortage of identified and prepared projects, and
of managerial and technical skills and the limited public savings.
5.        In 1969 and 1970, Sierra Leone's economic position deteriorated,
because of a depression in the diamond market, difficulties in fiscal and
debt management, and political problems. Government revenues dropped
sharply while extra budgetary recurrent expenditures increased and a
substantial amount of new eiternal debt on commercial terms was incurred.
In September 1971 the Government introduced measures to limit external
commercial credits, mobilize government revenues, reduce recurrent expenditures,
and prepare guidelines for economic development. Significant progress has
been achieved since then in implementing these measures, which together with
a recovery in the diamond market at the end of 1971, and a stabilization
of the political situation, has improved the economic situation substantially.
(See Annex II).
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SIERRA LEONE
6.        The Bank Group has loaned US$17.9 million for power, roads and
education. Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of April 30, 1972 as well as notes on existing 'projects.
7.        The principal objective of Bank Group lending in Sierra Leone will
be to help Government develop and modernize agriculture. The Government
plans to diversify and expand smallholder production of export crops and
to initiate agricultural development in new areas.  The Bank can help
promote these goals through the financing of relatively small but high
priority projects embracing a variety of components -- research, infra-
structure, provision of credit and extension services for smallholders,
training of Sierra Leonean nationals for key administrative posts and for
the management of future agriculture projects. The proposed project contains
some of these elements and is designed to provide a foundation for further
assistance in this sector.  Fbr example, it includes studies that should
lead to project proposals within the next two years for forestry development
in the central region and for an integrated agricultural development scheme
in the north.
8.        Assistance for education will also play a larger role in Bank
Group lending ,o Sierra Leone. Under the education project (Credit 170-SL),
Government is preparing an educational development plan and an associated



-3-
manpower survey. These are expected to provide the basis for future projects.
Some lending for transport will continue and the Government has indicated
that it might request Bank financing for part, or all, of the Freetown-
Waterloo road. Feasibility studies for this road are being financed under
the First Highway Project.
9.        An important feature of Bank Group operations is to relate lending
to continued improvement in economic policies. When Sierra Leone's financial
position deteriorated in 1970 and 1971, understandings were reached with
Government on the corrective measures to be taken. Further Bank Group
lending was made dependent on the implementation of these measures (see
Annex II, page 6).
10.       The financing of development in the next several years is expected
to require external assistance averaging US$14 million a year. Germany and
the United Kingdom, Sierra Leone's two major donors, can be expected to
provide assistance in transportation and agriculture, but the current shortage
of viable projects is a constraint for any significant expansion of aid.
This underlines the need, which is recognized and provided for in the proposed
project, for expediting project identification and preparation. Sierra
Leone's external assistance requirements, past and future, are detailed in
Annex II, pages 8 and 9.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN SIERRA LEONE
11.       Sierra Leone has two major agricultural zones; the northern with
a long dry season where cattle and annual crops predominate and the southern
with rainfall and climate suitable for cocoa, coffee and oil palm -- its
main export crops. The south also contains all the known diamond, timber,
titanium and bauxite reserves. This uneven development has accentuated
the country's political and tribal differences.
12.       Agriculture contributes about one-third of GNP and about 16
percent of exports. Of the estimated one million acres under crop each
year, only about 23,000 acres (2.3%) are large farms and plantations. The
remainder are farmed by about 250,000 families. Over 95% of cultivated
holdings are under 10 acres, and the average is about four. Only about a
quarter of all farmers receive signifioant cash income; the majority are
engaged in subsistence farming.
13.       Rice is the staple food, and until the early 1960's the country
was self-sufficient. With the onset of the diamond boom in the early 1950's
and the associated movement of workers from their farms, rice production
fell. In 1970 rice to the value of about US$6 million was imported and
this was equivalent to more than a third of the value of agricultural exports.
The principal exports are palm kernels, coffee, cocoa, piassava and ginger.
14.       Government policy is to increase production of crops for domestic
consumption and for exports by diversifying and expanding smallholder cropping;



it is also aimed at strengthening support for agriculture in the northern
region.  Past efforts to encourage smallholder farming through cooperatives
have been unsuccessful owing to inadequate management and the failure of
the Sierra Leone Cooperative Marketing Federation in 1967. The primary
responsibility for government support in agricultural development, research
and extension services lies with the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources. Its impact on the sector has not been very significant so far,
largely owing to the dispersal of its limited staff and financial resources
and its lack of planning and management capability. Government has now
recognized these weaknesses and has decided to strengthen the institutions
and the management of its agricultural program. The U.K. Government has
recently provided six technicians to help reorganize and strengthen the
Ministry and to prepare projects. Agricultural research has been initially
insignificant, apart from certain rice research programs in the early 1960's.
UNDP is now considering assistance in this field, based on a plan prepared
by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture.
15.       An important obstacle to agricultural development has been past
failures of agricultural credit schemes in Sierra Leone. At present there
is no official source of agricultural credit, and farmers are forced to
depend either on their own savings or borrowings from non-institutional
sources of credit. New development projects in agriculture, therefore, will
have to include full provisions for credit facilities in order to be effective.
16.       The marketing of Sierra Leone's main export crops is handled by
the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board, which is responsible, in conjunction
with the Government, for fixing cocoa, coffee and palm kernel producer prices.
It is required to maintain a price stabilization fund, which, since 1967,
has contributed Le 500,000 annually from its operating surplus to Government
for development purposes. The Board operates through licensed buying agents;
its marickting arrangements are satisfactory.
17.       Sierra Leone's future economic prospects depend largely on develop-
ment of its agriculture. Major emphasis is now being placed on institution
building in this sector. Further assistance must be directed to weaknesses
in public administration, particularly with respect to project management,
and also to providing better coordination of agricultural policies.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
18.       The proposed project is based on a plan prepared for Government
by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (U.K.) under contract to the
'Bank.in 1970. It was'appraised in February/March 1971, but was delayed by
the Government's financial difficulties. By early 1972, measures taken
by the Government brought about considerable improvement. Negotiations
were therefore held. in Washington on May 22 and 23. Mr. A.G. Sembu Forna,
the Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources, headed the Sierra Leonean
delegation.



- 5 -
19.       The proposed project will largely be carried out within an
area of about 1.5 million acres in eastern and southern regions--involving
nearly 2,500 near subsistence smallholders. This area has good agricultural
potential, adequate rainfall and extensive uncultivated land with good
soils. The farmers are receptive to change and have experience in growing
cocoa, rice and oil palm, but the yields which they obtain are far less
than those which could be obtained with better farming methods. An important
constraint to higher yields in cocoa and rice has been the absence of farm
credit to purchase important inputs, such as fertilizer and pesticides,
and the absence of effective extension services. The proposed project
builds on the experience of an oil palm estate established in 1968 by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, which has encouraged small-
holder oil palm plantings in the surrounding area. The project will complete
palm plantings on this 2,000 acre nucleus estate and will at the same time
encourage and diversify the smallholder farming.
20.       The project would be carried out over a three year period, 1973-
1975, as the first phase of a program designed to raise the living standards
of the smallholders. It would include:
(a) completing the establishing of a 2,000 acres oil palm
plantation by planting 510 acres, and constructing a
palm oil mill to service the estate and associated
smallholder plantings;
(b) providing smallholders with credit for labor, pesticides,
fertilizers and improved high yielding planting materials
to:
(i) clear and bring into production up to 6,000
acres of inland swamp rice;
(ii) plant up to 750 acres of cocoa; and
(iii) plant up to 1,830 acres of oil palm;
(c) constructing up to 20 small rice mills;
(d) training project farmers in efficient rice, cocoa and
oil palm production techniques;
(e) carrying out studies to prepare an agriculture development
project in the Northern province, a commercial forestry
project in the Tama forestry reserve, and detailed studies
of Sierra Leone's domestic oil palm requirements, the
marketing and processing of domestic rice, and the
marketing of imported rice;
(f) establishing an Agricultural Development Authority (ADA)
to own and operate the oil mill and nucleus estate;
(g) establishing a project management unit in the Ministry
of Agriculture and Natural Resources.



-.6 -
21.       At full development, the project would produce 1,239 tons of
cocoa and 860 tons of palm kernels for export annually.  In addition,
import substituting crops would increase as follows: palm oil, by 4,300
tons and rice, by 2,900 tons, annually. The net value of foreign exchange
benefits over the life of the project would be US$21.8 million. The average
annual incremental net farm income per famnily at Lull development Nould be '
about: cocoa, Le 132 (US$172); oil palm, Le 462 (US$602); rice, Le 143
(US$186). The.econ6mic return, assuming a project life of 2-5 years and
when hired labor is shadow priced, is about 15 percent.  Costing hired
labor at its actual-price would reduce the rate of return to 13 percent.
2?.       Project paddy would be milled at the small village mills to be
set'up by the project management unit (FMU). PMU would retain rice to
cover milling costs and eredit repayments; the remainder would be returned
to farmers. The milled rice would be sold domestically on the open market.
Project cocoa would be 'sold through SLPMB licensed buying agents.
23.       The project would be managed by a project unit responsible to
the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The oil palm estate
and outgrowers'scheme would require a plantation manager; a managing
director would be required for the Agricultural Development Authority.
Consultants would be needed in connection with construction of the oil palm
mill, and for studies related to'integrated development in the north,
forestry, domestic palm oil requirements and the marketing of rice.
24.       The Agricultural Development Authority (ADA) would be a statutory
board established'-by Act of Parliament no later than March 31, 1974 or one
month prior to the expected commissioning date of the oil mill, whichever
is the earlier.  At first, ADA's only responsibility would be to own'and
operate the oil mill and nucleus estate.  Eventually, it would be responsible
for providing c'redit, technical and managerial services generally to agri-
cultural projects and for preparing 'agricul-tural projects. ADA would be
appointed a licensed buying agent of the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing
Board and would make deliveries of palm kernels produced by the project mill
direct to SLFMB in Freetown.
25.       An important feature of the project is the training of local
counterpart staff to' help provide experts 'needed to prepare and manage
future agriculture projects. Suitably qualified and experienced persons
would be sought for senior management positions. Some of these posts would
be filled by expatriates, but provision has been made for Sierra Leoneans
to be trained to assume their responsibilities in 'due course.
26.       Loans to project farmers would be made by PMU for cocoa, oil
palm and swamip rice'development. These loans would bear interest at 8%,
which is 1% below commercial bank lending rates for short-term loans.
While this rate would be sufficient to cover the costs of loan administration,
including-bad debts, it is somewhat below prevailing rates of interest in



Sierra Leone. However, since under the present SLHMB pricing policies,
farmers receive substantially less than the market value of their produce,
the agreed rates seem justified. A review of interest rates generally is
planned as part of the Bank's economic work.
27.       Estimated project costs amount to US$5.6 million equivalent, of
which the foreign exchange component would be US$3.0 million, or 53 percent.
The proposed credit of US$4.3 million would meet 77 percent of total project
costs and would cover all foreign exchange costs and half of local expendi-
tures. Given Sierra Leone's limited savings capacity and the signs of
improved economic management, this proportion of local expenditure financing
is reasonable. The remaining 50 percent of local costs (US$1.3 million)
would be met from budget allocations of US$0.9 million, and from borrowings
of US$234,000 from the Bank of Sierra Leone and'US$156,000 from the Sierra
Leone Produce Marketing Board. Government would, in addition, have to make
available a further US$0.4 million over the three years after completion
of the three-year project development period so as to bring all cocoa and
oil palm acreages and cleared swamps into full development. The project
is exempted from taxes on imports.
28.       Procurement and construction of the palm oil mill, rice mills,
vehicles, tractors, spraying machines and fertilizers valued at about US$2.0
million would be subject to international competitive bidding.   Other
purchases including buildings, fuel, spare parts, amounting to about US$0.5
million, would be subject to local competitive bidding. The Government is
not a party to any preferential tariff arrangements.
29.       Conditions of effectiveness would be establishment of the project
unit and appointment of the project unit manager and the financial controller.
A condition of disbursement for the oil palm component would be that Govern-
ment would present the Association with a plan for the satisfactory marketing
of oil produced under the Project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Sierra Leone and
the Association the recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section 1 (dS of the Articles of Agreement of-the Association, and the
text of a draft resolution approving the proposed dral't Development Credit
Agreement will be distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The
provisions of the Draft Development Credit Agreement conform substantially
to those of similar agreements for agriculture projects.
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTICK
1.        Serious,problems of execution and delays in disbursements have
arisen with the First Highway Project (Loan 710-SL, Credit 218-SL). Dif-
ficulties of a less severe nature have also occurred with the Education
Credit (170-SL) and a power project (553-SL).

Effective Date                           s February 12, 1971
3.        This project includes construction of the Bo-Kenema road and
purchases of road maintenance equipment, to be financed under the loan
and Credit. It also iincludes a feasibility study and detailed engineering,
for a future highway project as well as technical assistance'to the 'Ministry
of Works for improving road maintenance; these are being financed by U1WP5
with the Bank acting as Executing Agency.
4.        Implementation of the project has been substantially dela;-qd follow-
ing the receipt on March 29, 1971 of bids for the Bo-Kenema road const^iction,
the lowest of which was more than 60% above the Consultants''(Italconsult-
Italy) original estimate and about 50% above the Bank appraisal estimate.
In September 1971 the Bank commissioned a study by an independent consulting
firm (Jacobs Associates-USA), specializing in contractor-type cost estimates.
This report was ready in March 1972 and recommended either: (i) negotiating
with the two lowest bidders to obtain lower prices, or (ii) carrying out the
works under a management-type contract, similar to the contract under which
the Crown Agents (UK) are directing the construction of the adjoining road,
Taiama-Bo, with U. K. financial assistance.
5.        The Government, in agreement with the, Bank, has notified the bidders
that no contract will be awarded on the basis of the bids received in 1971
and has instructed Italconsult to prepare by the end of June,1972 new
documents including some changes in design, on the basis of which it'can
obtain proposals in July for a management-type contract from the two lowest
bidders and the Crown Agents. Should the cost of these new proposals subs-
tantially exceed the financing already secured, the Government will have to
seek additional external financing. The Government considers it'imperative
for construction to start by the beginning of the next dry season --
October-November 1972 -- since in accordance with a Bank recommendation,
the railroad, part of which runs parallel to the Bo-Kenema road, is being
dismantled.



Annex I
Page 3 of 4 pages
6.        Delays have also occurred in the purchase of highway maintenance
equipment, for which $1.5 million was included in the project. The Govern-
ment received bids in January 1971 but no contracts were awarded because
the evaluation procedures were in substantial conflict with Bank Guidelines
for Procurement. In April 1972, the Government agreed to rebid for the
highway maintenance equipment. One of the first tasks of the consultants
to be engaged urder the UNDP-financed technical assistance program will be
to assist the Government in preparing new bid documents for this equipment
and in evaluating new bids when received.
7.        Consultants for the UNDP-financed part of the project have
already been. selected and are expected to start field work as soon as UNDP
has signed the Project Document.
Education Project
8.        Amount of Credit                          : US$3.0 million

Effective Date                            : May 8, 1970
9.        This project is being executed satisfactorily, but in April
-1972, an issue arose over the award of a contract for construction of school
buildings. International bidding, following prequalification, was very keen.
The lowest bid, by an Italian firm, was 6,890 Leones (US$8,307) lower (less
than 2.5%) than the second lowest bid which was by a local firm.   The
Government sought the Association's agreement to awarding the contract to
the local firm, given that the difference in bid prices was small. It
could not however be established that the second lowest bidder was capable
of executing the work more efficiently than the low bidder and in these
circumstances the Association reluctantly informed the Government that a
contract awarded to other than the low bidder would not be eligible for
financing under the credit. A local firm is the lowest bidder for the
third phase of the school construction work.
Power Project'

Closing Date                              : December 31, 1971
11.       The Sierra Leone Electricity Corporation, which is the Borrower
under the project, encountered a series of managerial, labor and financial
difficulties in 1971. These occurred largely because of political inter-
ferences in the management of the Corporation and because of a certain
militancy on the part of labor unions. The financial difficulties arose



Annex I
Page 4 of 4 pages
partly because of growing arrears on government accounts. These matters
were discussed with representatives of Government and the Corporation
and by early this year some of the problems were on their way to being
resolved. Government intervention in the Corporation's affairs had
ceased and union difficulties had greatly subsided. However, arrears on
government accounts still remain large.   On May 16, 1972, in a letter to
the Bank, the Corporation's general manager reported that the financial
position remained serious, due mainly to losses incurred on foreign ex-
change held by the Corporation as a result of changes in exchange rates,
as well as increases in import prices. The general manager requested
that the Bank consider a supplementary loan of $600,000 to meet what he
termed inadequate funds to cover offshore costs under the project. A pro-
ject supervision mission is planned during the next two to three months
and the problems will soon be discussed with Government.

PART II - CURRENT SITUATICN AND PROSPECTS
1.        Sierra Leone has a dual economy with an enclave export-
oriented mining sector and a large under-developed agricultural sector.
The. mining sector contributes 17% to GDP (at factor cost), and about
78% to exports while agriculture contributes 34% to GDP but sustains
75-80% of the population. GNP per capita for the country's 2.5 mil*lion
population is estimated at about $160 (1969/70). Income distribution
is very uneven. A recent study shows that 34% of national income goes
to the highest 5% of the population. Diamonds contribute more than 62%
of total exports. Others (iron ore, bauxite and rutile) contribute
about 16%. Agriculture provides another 16% of exports. During the
last decade, GDP grew at an average annual rate of about 4% in real
terms. Most of this growth has originated in the foreign-owned mining
sector. Growth outside mining has been slow.
A. Development Strategy and Constraints
2.        An official development strategy has not as yet been formulated.
However, economic policy statements by the Government have emphasized the
priority of agriculture, education and transport. In addition, the
Government has decided to play a more active role in the development of
mineral resources, and has adopted a policy of acquiring majority owner-
ship in foreign-owned mining companies.
3.        Agricultural development is indeed of high priority.   Not only
is this sector moderately rich in potential but it encompasses the vast
majority of the population and significant expansion and employment
creating opportunities outside it are limited. Manufacturing in parti-
cular is limited by the small size of the domestic market, and the pros-
pect for economic integration in West Africa is distant. Furthermore,
in the long run, the development of agriculture can save foreign exchange
through import substitution, contribute to export proceeds, and serve as a
check on the migration from the countryside which is causing mounting
urban unemployment.
4.        The need for developing education derives basically from the
fact that the population is still largely illiterate -(73% in 1968/69).
Primary and secondary school enrolment is about 26% of the school-age
population. Moreover, the country's education system is not oriented
towards its development needs. Secondary schools.lack facilities for
teaching science and practical subjects, and technical schools are defi-
cient in quantity and quality of facilities and teachers. The present



Annex II
Page 3 of 9 pages
system of secondary education prepares 95% of high school graduates for
"white collar" jobs while the requirements are increasing for persons
with training for non-clerical jobs in industry and agriculture. The
educational system is, however, being examined intensively, for the pur-
pose of adjusting it more closely to manpower requirements and develop-
mental needs. (See para. 9.)
5.        Improvement in the transportation system is closely linked with
the prospects for agricultural development. A five-year road program
was prepared in 1970 following a land transport survey financed by UNDP,
with IBRD as the executing agency. This program involved the dismantling
of the outdated and inefficient railway, and the building of road links
in its place between the main agricultural areas and the population centers-
along the coast, which are also the main outlets for export crops. Con-
struction of several of the roads in this program has already started and
road development has absorbed about half of budgetary development expend-
itures in the past three years. It is expected to continue absorbing
about the same proportion in the next few years.
6.        The mining sector has few-linkages with the rest of the econony
and its development so far has contributed little to the general develop-
ment of the economy. The Government policy to acquire majority ownership
in the foreign-owned mining companies is designed to increase this contri-
bution mainly through an attempt to integrate mining development with the
development in the rest of the economy, increasing the pace at which
Sierra Leoneans are being trained for managerial and technical positions,
improving social services, rehabilitating abandoned lands in the mining
areas, and obtaining a larger share in the mining profits for financing
development.
7.        The main constraints on development in Sierra Leone have been
the scarcity of trained manpower and the lack of effective institutions to
prepare for development. As a result, there has been little by way of
systematic development planning and there is a shortage of well-prepared
development projects especially in agriculture and education. In addition,
the saving potential is rather limited. Government savings in particular
are vulnerable to world price market fluctuations -- especially for
diamonds -- as 60% of Government revenues derive through custom duties
from external trade. Foreign exchange has been a less constraining factor
in recent years.
B. Recent Developments
8.        To deal with the planning problem, a UNDP/SF project for assist-
ance in planning was put in operation in July 1970. The project is to
assist in formulating a development strategy, preparing sectoral programs,



Annex II
Page 4 of 9 pages
identifying and preparing projects and eventually preparing a comprehen-
sive development plan. 'However, the project has been moving slowly,
partly due to problems of recruitment of experts, and partly due'to in-
sufficient Government support. Both the UN (Development Planning
Advisory Services), which is the executing agency, and the Government
are considering action to resolve the projects' problems. In agriculture, a
UNDP/FAO agricultural sector survey conducted between 1967 and 1970 iden-
tified types of crops and an estimated size of the acreage that could be
developed over a ten-year period. This should be helpful for preparing
project feasibility studies.   A 6-man team from the UK has just arrived
in Sierra Leone to help in identifying and preparing projects and assist
in the institutional aspects of agricultural development.
9.'       Increasing the pool of skills naturally takes a long time.   A
beginning is being made with a comprehensive manpower survey which is
currently being conducted with UNDP/ILO assistance. The survey is expected
to identify the existing stock of skills and prepare projections of future
needs of'skilled manpower. When completed, it will provide the basis for
a plan for the development of the education sector (including a revision
of the present secondary school curriculum) and for establishment of
training programs. An IDA-financed project signed in January 1970,
provided for improving eleven existing general secondary schools and pro-
viding them with facilities for teaching of agricultural, commercial,
scientific and industrial subjects.   Also two technical institutes and
trades schools are being extended and better equipped.
10.       In accordance with the Government decision to enter as a majority
owner in the foreign-owned mining companies,1/ a settlement agreement was
reached in September 1970 with SLST, the diamond mining company. The
National Diamond Mining Company was established in which the Government
has 51% ownership. SLST received negotiable sterling bonds for the share
acquired by Government repayable over eight years, carrying 5.5% annual
interest rate. SLST will continue to manage the new company. The transfer
of ownership was orderly and there was no disruption in production or
investment. Negotiations have just started with DELCO, the iron ore
company. The Government does not intend to enter as a part owner in the
relatively smaller bauxite and rutile companies at the present time.
1/ Sierra Leone Selection Trust (UK), which produces about 50% of Sierra
Leone diamonds (the other 50% being produced by independent diggers
under the Alluviale Diamond Mining Scheme); Sierra Leone Development
Company (UK) producing iron ore; Sierra Leone Metal and Ore Company
(Swiss) producing bauxite; and until April 1971, Sherbro Minerals Ltd.,
(predominantly US) producing rutile. A new company, Sierra Leone Rutile
Ltd., (US) took over Sherbro Minerals' concession lease early this year.



Annex II
Page 5 of 9 pages
11.       To cope with the financial constraint, the Government requested
assistance from the IMF in 1970 to study the tax system and prepare a
tax reform plan. The IMF study emphasized the need first, to improve the
enforcement and administration of existing tax laws, and second, to reform
the tax structure. Moreover, sizeable income tax arrears have accumulated
over the years.
12.       In the past two years Sierra Leone's fiscal position deteriorated
significantly partly due to depression in the diamond market, but also
because of difficulties in fiscal and external debt management, and of
political problems.  From mid-1970 till the end of 1971, the diamond mar-
ket suffered a severe slump and the value of Sierra Leone diamond exports
dropped by about 16% in 1970 and levelled off in 1971. The drop in diamond
activity was exacerbated by political unrest (between September 1970 and
April 1971), leading to a general slowdown in economic activity.   The
economy received an additional setback in April 1971, with the temporary
suspension of the relatively new rutile mining operations, due to tech-
nical difficulties. An agreement was reached with a new company last
February to take over the lease area, and output should resume before the
end of this year.
13.       The slump in the diamond market caused a drop in recurrent
Government revenues. At the same time there was an increase in extra-
budgetary expenditures, mostly for civil service and teachers' salaries
(the last salary increase was in 1957) and for military expenditures.
As a result budgetary savings were negative. This compares with budgetary
savings of about Le 6.0 million annually (11% of recurrent revenues) in
the preceding two years -- which, however, were exceptionally good years
due to a boom in the diamond market. With no budgetary savings, the
Government had to rely heavily on internal and external borrowing to
finance its capital outlays. Government Development Securities (medium
term Government bonds) increased by 36% in the past two years and Treasury
bills outstanding increased by 63%.
14.       There was much pressure on the Government to take action to
promote development. With the shortage of projects eligible for financing
by official donors, the Government resorted to inadequately justified
and hastily prepared projects financed on commercial terms. In 1970 and
1971 such new credits amounted to about Le 9.5 million equivalent (three
times as much as those contracted in the preceding two years), and
contributed to the budgetary difficulties. Down payments and debt servicing
on these credits increased external debt service payments to 1i% of recur-
rent revenues in 1970/71 and 1971/72.
15.       While the fiscal situation deteriorated significantly, the over-
all balance of payments position remained essentially sound although, some-
what less favorable. The trade deficit in the past two years was about
twice as large as it was in 1969, but net foreign capital inflow including



Annex II
Page 6 of 9 pages
a substantial amount of suppliers credits and SDR allocations obviated
the need to draw significantly on the country's foreign exchange
reserves. The level of foreign exchange reserves of the Bank of Sierra
Leone at the end of March 1972 stood at Le 35.6 million (US$46.4 million)!!.,
equivalent to more than-four months' imports which is a comfortable
position. This position was helped by the recent recovery in the diamond
market and new SDR allocation in January 1972.
C. Corrective Policy Measures
16.       To arrest the deterioration in the financial situation, last
September the Government agreed to a package of policy measures. Most
important of these were: (a) the establishment of a National Economic
Advisory Committee to help co-ordinate decision making in respect of
economic policy, and foreign borrowing in particular; (b) a six-months
freeze on new external public borrowing on commercial terms. This was
followed by the establishment of, a ceiling on such borrowing during the
period April 1, 1972 to June 30, 1973; (c)- mobilization of additional
revenues through improved tax enforcement and introduction of new tax
measures, taking into consideration a 1971 IMF report on tax reform;
(d) curbing extra-budgetary expenditures; and (e) formulation of develop-
ment policy guidelines and establishment of effective planning machinery.
17.       Significant progress has been achieved in the past few months
in implementing these measures.   In particular, the Economic Advisory
Committee was established, the freeze on short and medium term credits
was observed, and extra-budgetary expenditure subsided. These measures,
together with the gradual recovery in the world diamond market and the
normalization of the political situation, helped improve the economic
and financial situation. Furthermore, a Government-appointed Committee
reviewed the IMF report on tax reform last March and submitted recommend-
ations for action to the Cabinet.
D. Prospects
18.       Sierra Leone's economic and financial prospects in the next
several years are at best moderate. Continuation of the recent recovery
in the diamond market and of the sound fiscal policies followed in the past
few months would enhance these prospects. GNP may be expected to grow at
about 3% per annum in the next few years, but most of this is expected
1/ At the new exchange rates.



Annex II
Page 7 of 9 pages
to originate in the enclave sector. Growth of this magnitude is in-
adequate, particularly since population is now expected to increase
at a rate of 2.4% per annum. This emphasizes the importance of deve-
lopment planning, project identification and the preparation and mobi-
lization of domestic savings. It is recognized, however, that it will
be some time before such efforts can produce substantial results.
19.       Exports are projected to grow at about 4% per annum in the next
few years compared to a drop in 1970 and practically no growth in 1971.
In addition to the recovery in the diamond market, rutile exports are
expected to resume at the end of this year at a time of. rising world
prices. On the other hand, agricultural exports which contribute about
16% to total exports may be set back by depressed world prices for palm
kernels, cocoa and ginger. While exports are projected to grow at about
4%, imports are projected to grow at about 5%, which would result in a
growing deficit on the trade account.
20.       The budgetary position is expected to improve, but will continue
to be a major constraining factor to development. Even with a projected
growth rate of 6% in current revenues and a reasonable restraint in the
growth of current expenditures, projections show that public savings on
current account will remain negative over the next two to three years.
The Government has expressed its intention to revive public savings,
through measures to improve tax enforcement and administration, and the
introduction of new taxes.
21.       In the past three years public development expenditures averaged
about Le 12.0 million per annum. Assuming improved project identification
and preparation, public development expenditure is expected to rise to an
annual average of about Le 14-15 million (US$18-19 million) in the next
several years. If the recovery in the diamond market continues and if
revenue can be increased and expenditure restrained, the budget may be
expected to finance about 5% of the projected development expenditures.
Financing of another 10% may be secured from other domestic sources. This
would leave an average of about $15-16 million a year to be financed from
external sources. The World Bank Group and other traditional donors are
expected to finance the bulk of the needed assistance. Efforts will be
made to interest other donors in joint or parallel financing arrangements
for Bank and IDA projects.
E. External Assistance and Public Debt
22.       Commitments of total capital assistance in the past three years
(1969-1971) totalled $36.7 million. Of this total about 60% ($21.5
million) was from official sources and the remaining part ($15.2 million)
constituted suppliers' credits and contractor financing. Official capital



Annex II
Page 8 of 9 pages
assistance (an average of about $7.0 million a year) was almost double
the amount received in the preceding three years (1966-1968) which was
a period of economic stabilization. Suppliers' credits and contractor
financing were mostly used for purchase of buses, ferries, tractors,
telecommunications and military equipment, and continuation of a water
supply scheme. Official capital assistance was mostly for financing
road construction projects.
23.       Official capital assistance over the past five years has pre-
dominantly been extended for infrastructure, reflecting the shortage of
viable projects in other sectors. As the table below indicates, 56% of
this assistance was for roads, 12% was for power and 10% for education.
In addition, about 22% was for general development purposes (including
commodity loans). There has been no official project financing assist-
ance for agriculture. The World Bank Group contributed 45% of official
capital assistance (24% IBRD and 21% ID&), the UK 25%, Germany 20% and
the US 4%. The People's Republic of China contributed about 7% and
became a new donor in 1971, by extending an interest free convertible
foreign exchange loan of $2.1 million for general purposes. Except for
IBRD loans, all other official lending to Sierra Leone has been on con-
cessionary terms.

24.       Ebcternal public debt outstanding (including undisoursed) at the
end of 1971 was $97.0 million. Official government loans -- mostly from
UK and Germany -- account for about 42% of this amount. Suppliers' credits
and contractor financing accounted for 31% of total public debt oustand-
ing, about one-third of which is owed to a French contractor (Degremont)
for a multiphase water supply scheme which was started in 1964. Bank
Group lending amounts to 18% of total public indebtedness. In the past
two years, external debt service payments averaged about $10.5 million,
absorbing 9% of export earnings and about 14% of budgetary revenues.
The contraction of a substantial amount of supplier credits in the past
two years postponed a sharp drop in external debt service payments which
was expected as of 1971 (based on debt outstanding at the end of 1969).
Instead, external debt service payments are now expected to peak in 1972
at $12 million (based on debt outstanding at the end of 1971), and to
average at about $10.0 million in the following five years. On certain
assumptions of new capital commitments between 1972 and 1977 and projected
4% growth in export earnings, debt service ratio is estimated at about 9%
between 1972 and 1977. If recurrent budgetary revenues grow at about 6%
per annum, external debt service payments would absorb about 15% of
budgetary revenues during the same period.
25.      Against this background, it would be desirable to avoid a sub-
stantial increase in the debt service burden, especially on the budget,
considering Sierra Leone's poverty and low savings potential. This is
the more important because Sierra Leone requires a substantial inflow of
capital over a long period. Thus, the bulk of Sierra Leone's needs for
external assistance ought to be met on concessionary terms. Furthermore,
given the expected shift in development emphasis to agriculture and
education, sectors in which projects tend to have a relatively low foreign
exchange component, some financing of local expenditure will be required.
