SIERRA LEONE
APPRAISAL OF AN
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an agricultural project in the Eastern and
Southern Provinces of Sierra Leone, for which an IDA credit of US$4.3 million
equivalent is proposed. It would be the first agricultural project under-
taken by the Bank Group in Sierra Leone.
ii.       Sierra Leonets economv is based on an export oriented mining
sector producing about 85%o or total exports, of which diamonds contribute
about 80%, and a mainly subsistence agricultural sector, producing about
16% of total exports and employing about 75% of the population. Diamond
reserves are declining, however, and the country's future economic prospects
depend largely upon the development of the agricultural sector, in which
little has been achieved so far mainly because of Government's uncoordinated
agricultural policies and weaknesses in public administration. This project
is straightforward in concept involving simple and proven technical methods,
and its success depends entirely on efficient project management.
iii.      The project area comprises some 1.5 million acres of the Eastern
and Southern Provinces, with a population of about 242,000. The project,
which would be carried out over a three year disbursement period, would include:
establishing a Project Management Unit within the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources (MANR); planting 510 acres of oil palm to complete a 2,000
acre estate; providing smallholders with credit for bringing 6,000 acres of
inland swamp into rice production, planting 750 acres of cocoa, and planting
1,830 acres of oil palms; constructing a 9 ton/hour palm oil mill and 20 rice
mills each capable of processing 500 tons paddy/annum; training project
participants in modern agricultural techniques; preparing an agricultural
development project in the North of the country and a forestry project in the
centre of the country; and the establishment of an Agricultural Development
Authority (ADA) to own and operate the oil palm nucleus estate and mill, and
to take over the management of project credit operations after project dis-
bursements of the IDA Credit are completed.
iv.       Project costs are estimated at US$5.6 million equivalent.  The
proposed credit would finance 77% of project costs, covering foreign exchange
costs estimated at US$3.0 million, and 50% of local currency costs. The
balance of US$1.3 million would be met from Central Government revenues -
US$0.9 million, and subscriptions to ADA's equity of US$234,000 and
US$156,000 by the Bank of Sierra Leone and Sierre Leone Produce Marketing
Board respectively. Project procurement valued at about US$2.0 million would
be by international competitive bidding; procurement of other goods and
services would be subject to satisfactory local competitive bidding procedures.
v.        The project manager would be responsible to the Permanent Secretary
of MANR . The project manager, financial controller, credit manager, land
planning officer, mill engineer, and plantation manager, would probably be
expatriates.



- ii -
vi.       By full development project produced exports would total:  cocoa
1,230 tons and palm kernels 860 tons annually, and import substitutes: palm
oil 4,300 tons, and rice 2,900 tons annually. Net foreign exchange benefits
would be substantial, amounting to a value of US$21.8 million over the life
of the project. Based on the Bank Economics Department's current long-term
cocoa, rice, and palm produce price forecasts, and using a shadow price for
hired labor justified because of unemployment, the estimated rate of return
from investment in the project is 15%. Costing hired labor at its actual
price decreases the rate of return by 2%. The project would increase sub-
stantially the incomes of some 2,500 farm families, and create an institution
to obtain and provide finance, planning, and management for agricultural
development projects.
vii,      The Government recognizes the current weaknesses in public administra-
tioni and gave assurances during negotiations that a plan for improving the
markleting of domestic and imported rice would be prepared, and that suitably
qualified and experienced persons would be employed to fill key project posts
SO c1S to provide satisfactory management.
viii.     The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$4.3 million to the
Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone.



SIERRA LEONE
APPRAISAL OF AN
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Sierra Leone Government has asked IDA to help finance a project
to increase the agricultural production and living conditions of about 2,500
near to subsistence farm families in Sierra Leone's Eastern and Southern
Provinces.
1.02      The project is based on a plan prepared for Government by the Com-
monwealth Development Corporation (U.K.), under contract to the Bank. It
would comprise completing the planting of a nucleus oil palm estate, and
constructing a modern palm oil mill; and assisting farmers to plant cocoa and
oil palm and to develop inland swamps for rice cultivation. The project
would include the establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) within
the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) to manage the
project and provide credit to farmers; the improvement of farmer training
facilities; feasibility studies for an agricultural development project in
the north and a commercial forestry project in the centre of the country;
and the establishment of an Agricultural Development Authority, which would
manage the nucleus estate and palm oil mill when constructed.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission,
composed of Messrs. A. Denness, A. Stoneham, A. Cole, J. L. Ropiteau of IDA,
and F. Hughes (Consultant), which visited Sierra Leone in February/March 1971.
1.04      The project would be the Bank Group's first agricultural lending
operation in Sierra Leone.
II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      The Republic of Sierra Leone has an area of about 28,000 sq. miles,
and a population of about 2.5 million increasing at an estimated annual rate
of about 2.4%. GDP for 1969/70 was estimated at Le 347 million (US$416 mil-
lion) equivalent to Le 139 (US$163) per capita. The economy has two main
sectors: a well developed, export-oriented mining sector employing 5% of
the economically active population and producing 20% of GDP and about 80% of
total exports; and an undeveloped agricultural sector, providing a livelihood
for about 75% of the population, and producing about 30% of GDP and about
16% of total exports.
2.02      The mining sector is dominated by the diamond industry.  In 1971,
this accounted for Le 50 million (US$60 million) or about 77% of all mineral
exports. For the years 1964 through 1969, licensed alluvial diggers produced



- 2 -
58% of total diamond production. During the first quarter of 1969, 44,000
registered workers were employed in this way, together with an unspecified,
but substantial number of unregistered workers working for illegal operations.
Since 1969, however, the number of registered workers has declined dramati-
cally to about 14,000 during the first quarter of 1971 as easily accessible
alluvial diamond areas have been worked out and mining has become increas-
ingly difficult and expensive. Alluvial diamond production has fallen with
the decline in the work force.
2.03      Agricultural Sector.  Sierra Leone has two major ecological zones:
the northern half of the country with a long dry season where cattle and
annual crops predominate; and the south with a rainfall and climate suitable
for the production of cocoa, coffee and oil palm, which are Sierra Leone's
ma:Ln export crops. Because of the better cash return from these three crops,
agricultural development has proceeded further in the south which also con-
taiLns all Sierra Leone's known diamond, timber, titanium and bauxite re-
serves. This uneven development has accentuated the political and tribal
differences which are a major cause of the existing unrest within the
cotmtry.
2.04      Rice is the country's staple food, and until the early 1950's the
cotntry was self-sufficient in this commodity. With the onset of the diamond
boom in the early 1950's and the associated movement of workers away from
their farms rice production fell, and imports became necessary; these
totalled 48,000 tons valued at about Le 5.0 million (US$6.0 million) in
1970 (see Annex 1, Table 1). Agricultural exports in 1971 were worth
Le 13.3 million (US$16.0 million) of which palm kernels contributed Le 5.9
million (44%); coffee Le 3.5 million (26%); cocoa Le 2.7 million (20%) and
piassava 1/ and ginger Le 1.2 million (10.0%).
2.05      Government's agricultural development policy aims to increase the
production of crops for import substitution and for export, by diversifying
and expanding smallholder cropping; and to develop agriculture in the north.
This project would increase the smallholder production of cocoa and palm
kernels for export, rice, and palm oil for import substitution; and would
prepare an agricultural development project in the country's northern region,
and a forestry project in the center of the country.
Institutions
2.06      Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).  MANR is
primarily responsible for agricultural development, research and extension,
but its impact on the sector is insignificant due to the wide dispersal of
its limited staff and financial resources, its lack of planning and manage-
meni: capability, and the pressure to implement politically motivated decisions
made with little or no consideration for technical and economic factors.
Government is aware of the reasons for the past failures of MANR and other
institutions, mentioned below, and of the need to strengthen the institutional
infrastructure and management of its agricultural development programs, but
is finding it difficult to effect improvements in the absence of well prepared
1/   A coarse fiber made from the raffia palm and used in broom heads.



- 3 -
development projects. However recently the Government of the United Kingdom
has seconded six technicians to assist in the reorganization and strengthening
of MANR, and in the preparation of development projects.
2.07      Little agricultural research is carried out.  The MANR rice station
at Rokupr achieved some good results in the early 1960's, but since then lack
of funds and staff has curtailed effective operation.  The station is now
being considered for 'LUP assistance on the basis of a plan prepared by the
International Institute of Tronical Agriculture (IITA). If provided, this
would finance the staff needed to implement a breeding and selection program
for the development of high-yielding, fertilizer-responsive, short-duration
rice hybrids to replace varieties produced at Rokupr in the 1960's. For-
tunately these older varieties are suitable as the initial basis for viable
rice development programs until higher-yielding varieties become available.
Since it is essential that Sierra Leone's rice development programs are sup-
ported by efficient research, assurances were obtained from Government
during negotiations that it would pursue and implement the plan for upgrading
rice research at Rokupr. Little cocoa and oil palm research is carried out,
but the results of research in other West African countries on both crops
can be applied. High-yielding Amazon cocoa selections introduced in the 1950's
and 1960's are available for seed production, and hIgh quality oil palm seed
can be purchased from the Ivory Coast. No research work of importance has
been carried out on the problems of farming in the North. Other agricultural
research is carried out by the University of Sierra Leone at Njala, although
the best of this has been economic work which can only be utilized in the
context of well prepared and managed projects. Njala University College
provides degree and diploma courses in agriculture, and its graduates form
the senior and middle levels of MANR. While the academic standard of grad-
uates is satisfactory their potential is quickly vitiated in the unproduc-
tive climate of the Ministry. Two Rural Training Institutes provide farmer
training courses: one in Kenema, the administrative center of the Eastern
Province; and one in the Northern Province. Both institutes are inadequately
staffed, training courses are too long, and the training inappropriate to
farmers' requirements.
2.08      Development Financing and Agricultural Credit.  The problems of
financing agricultural development among predominantly subsistence farmers,
and the failure of past agricultural credit schemes in Sierra Leone are dis-
cussed in Annex 2. Overall, institutional credit has failed due to poor loan
appraisal techniques, lack of credit supervision, and failure to enforce debt
collection. Currently there is no official source of agricultural credit,
and farmers are forced to borrow from each other, relatives and traders, at
high interest rates.
2.09      The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPM), established in
1949, is responsible for marketing the country's main export crops, and fix-
ing, in conjunction with Government, cocoa, coffee and palm kernel producer
prices. SLPMB is required to maintain a price stabilization fund; and since
1967, has contributed Le 500,000 annually from its operating surpluses to
Government for development purposes. SLPMB's present marketing arrangements
are satisfactory. It operates through licensed buying agents (LBA), who are
responsible for purchasing, grading, storing and evacuating produce to the



port of shipment, and through the Sierra Loone Produce Marke-ring Company
(SLPMC), a London subsidiary, for overseas sales.  Agents receive a cou=ission
on purchases, and SLPMC charges a fee of 1/2 of 1V% to meet its costs. Further
deitails are given in Annex 3.
2.10      Until 1963 SLPMB operated efficiently and was relatively free from
adverse political interference. In 1963, however, SLPkOl launched a large,
technically unsound, and politically motivated program of plantation and
crop processing development; entered into direct crop purchasing; and began
malcing direct overseas sales on unfavorable terms. The development program
failed, about Le 10.5 million was lost and by December 1966 SLPMB was vir-
tually bankrupt. Since 1967, all production activities have stopped except
for the operation of five small palm oil mills, and SLPMB has resumed market-
ing through LBA's and the SLPMC. Financial reserves have been rebuilt to
about Le 4.5 million, including Le 2.6 million in a price stabilization fund;
and loans totalling about Le 3.7 million have been repaid (Annex 3).
2.11      The five, small, virtually obsolete palm oil mills continue to incur
substantial operating losses (see Annex 3, Table 11), and while their current
operation probably can be justified due to a domestic shortage of palm oil,
they will not be required once the proposed project mill is in production.
It would be a condition of disbursement against the oil palm component of the
project that SLPMB had submitted to IDA a satisfactory plan for the phased
closure of its uneconomic mills.
2.12      The Rice Corporation (Corporation), established in 1965, has a
=~~~~~~. __,e  a
monopoly of rice imports and distributes such imports through agents and its
owia stores in major towns.  The Corporat'on  as required on formation to use
its profits from rice importing for the developmen  of ricp production.  Its
rice production ventures collapsed in 19S8, in: which year about Le 300,000
was lost on these operations.  The Corporation's activities are niow limited
to importing, and the milling and marketing of rice proAuced in Sierra Leone.
Substantial losses are incurred on milling and marKeting domestic rice pro-
duction, and the Corporation's three large mills operate at only about 25%
calpacity due to poor location.  Details of its mills and the Corporation's
opearations are at Annex 1. Better results would be obtained from smaller
mills located in production areas such as proposed under the project.
2.13      The introduction of a large rntmsr ui small rice m'119 Jln recent
years has been of great value .o the 13ca_ industn-;. as existIng production is
scattered. Small private mills are cxr:enrlv operated successfully at the
village level in contrast to the larvo m4lls owned by the Rice Corporation.
Consequently, the Corporation is increasnivy left anly with the responsibility
of rice importation and distribution - a dec2.ining responsibility as domestic
production approaches self-sufficiency.  Lt 4s quest4onr.ale, therefore,
whether a separate statutory body is necessary to perform this function. The
Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (ESLP1B) would be able to carry out the
function at substantially lower cost.  Satisfactor. por: handling and storage
facilities are available, and, in contrast to the Corporation, SLPMS account-
ing and management procedures are satisfactcy, and a chain of well-established
agents with approved storage facilities exists throughout the country.  In
view of the savings that would accrue if SLPMB assumed responsibility for



-5-
importing and distributing rice, Government could make SLPMB responsible for
importing rice. Government recognizes the need to improve the marketing of
imported and domestic rice,-as well as the need for locating improved
milling facilities in the rice growing areas. During credit negotiations,
assurances were given that a study to cover these necessary improvements,
including the disposal of the Corporation's uneconomic mills would be made
before the end of 1973 and would be submitted to IDA for comment (see para
4.14).
2.14      Cooperative Societies increased their activities during the 1950's
and 1960's until by 1967 cooperatives handled 55% of all cocoa exports.
Financial management of the movement was poor, however, and culminated in
the collapse of the Sierra Leone Cooperative Marketing Federation in 1967.
Today the movement is largely discredited, and complete rehabilitation is
necessary if farmer confidence is to be regained. This would only be
achieved over a number of years with good management.
III.  THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      General.  The project would be carried out in an area of about 1.5
million acres in the Eastern and Southern Provinces (see Map). The area has
good agricultural potential, its population is receptive to change and reason-
ably experienced in growing cocoa, rice and oil palm. Rainfall and insola-
tion are adequate for these crops, and extensive areas of uncultivated land
with satisfactory soils are available.
3.02      Climate, Topography and Soils.  Climate is tropical and character-
ized by a single wet season, April through November, in which rainfall is
about 100 inches, 92% of the annual total.  This is followed by a four-month
dry season.
3.03      Topographically, most of the area lies below the 500 ft contour
and comprises gently rolling countryside dissected by narrow swampy valleys.
Extensive areas of uniform soil are not common, and soils vary from stony on
the crests of ridges, to stonefree clay soils on the lower slopes, and to
swamp soils in the valley bottoms. All soils are acid and low in essential
plant nutrients, but the latter can be corrected by the use of fertilizers.
3.04      Population.  Population is about 242,000, with an average density
of 103/sq mile. About 37% are under 14 years of age, and 51% between 14 and
50 years of age, reflecting the high birth rates and short life spans in
the area. The average household comprises three working adults and two
children under 14 years of age.
3.05      Land Tenure and Farm Size.  There is no individual ownership of
land, and allocation of usufruct rights is vested in the traditional tribal
authorities. This is not a constraint on development since after a farmer
is permitted to establish a tree crop or clear a swamp, he retains the right
of usufruct until his death, when such rights are transferable to his
descendants.



- 6 -
3.06      Farming Systems.  Agriculture is primitive and consists mainly of
the production of upland rice and other food crops under a shifting cultiva-
tion system. This accounts for about 80% of cultivated land. Farmers pay
little attention, except at harvest, to their cocoa and coffee plantings,
which occupy the remainder of the cultivated land. Draft animals are not
used because of trypanosomiasis, all tools are locally made, and only small
amounts of fertilizer and pesticides are used. Yields are low, averaging
about 650 lb/acre of paddy rice and 350 lb/acre of cocoa and coffee.
3.07      A planned system of land use is required for the project area to
retain fertility of the uplands and use swamp areas more effectively. The
valley swamps are fertile, and after clearing and introducing some water
control, and using available Rokupr varieties with small amounts of phosphatic
fertilizers, they produce average paddy yields of 2,200 lb/acre. Paddy yields
of over 4,000 lb/acre can be obtained and sustained, when complete fertilizers,
pest control, and good water management are employed. The use of swamps for
rice production reduces the area of upland required for shifting cultivation,
and releases land for tree crops which grow well in the area.
3.08      The main constraint to expanding swamp rice farming is the cost
of clearing -- Le 36.00/acre (US$47). In 1967, Government began to
pay cash grants to farmers for swamp clearance provided they built water
control bunds and used fertilizer and improved seed. About 3,000 acres have
been cleared in this way but follow-up has been poor in that few farmers
received grants in full, credit was not provided for farm inputs, and suffi-
cieant extension personnel were unavailable. As a result, bunds were construc-
ted on only about half of the cleared area and only about 30% of farmers
have continued the cultivation of their swamps.
3.09      Since the late 1950's project area farmers have been planting im-
proved varieties of cocoa but, as with rice, they have been unable to obtain
credit and inputs, or to obtain assistance from an effective agricultural
extension service.
3.10      Oil Palm.  In 1968 MANR started to develop an oil palm estate in
the project area, and encouraged smallholder oil palm plantings. Technical
and managerial assistance and planting material were obtained from Institut
de Recherches pour Les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO); 1,490 acres of estate
paLms and 1,169 acres by 117 smallholders have been established satisfactorily,
indicating what is possible under a well managed scheme.
3.l1      Communications.  The project area is linked to Freetown, the cap-
ital, by 220 miles of road of which 180 miles are paved. The unpaved section
is often impassable in the wet season, but it will be replaced with a new
road, partly financed under Loan 710-SL and Credit 218-SL. A system of gravel
secondary and feeder roads satisfactory for project purposes exists within
the project area.



IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project, which would be carried out over a three year invest-
ment period, 1973 through 1975, would be the first phase of a program designed
to raise the incomes and living standards of about 2,500 near subsistence
smallholders in the Eastern and Southern Provinces of Sierre Leone. The proj-
ect would involve:
(a)  completing the establishment of a 2,000 acre nucleus oil
palm plantation by planting 510 acres, and constructing
a palm oil mill to service the estate and associated small-
holder plantings;
(b)  providing smallholders with credits for labor, pesticides,
fertilizers and improved high-yielding planting materials to:
(i) clear and bring into production up to 6,000 acres of
inland swamp rice;
(ii) plant up to 750 acres of cocoa; and
(iii) plant up to 1,830 acres of oil palms;
(c)  constructing up to 20 small rice mills;
(d) training project farmers in efficient rice, cocoa and oil
palm production techniques;
(e)  carrying out studies precedent to the preparation of an
agricultural development project in the Northern Province
of the country, a commercial forestry project for the Tama
forest reserve area, a detailed study of Sierra Leone's
domestic palm oil requirements and a study of the marketing
and processing of domestic rice and the marketing of
imported rice; and
(f)  establishing an Agricultural Development Authority that in
the first instance would own and operate the oil mill and
nucleus estate.
B. Detailed Features
4.02      The project planting program would be phased as follows:



-8 -
Project Year              1      2     3      Total
Swamp Rice              1,000  2,000 3,000  6,000
Cocoa                     -       250   500    750
Oil Palm:
(a) Nucleus Estate        510   -      -        510
(b) Outgrowers            200    800   830  1,830
Apart from oil palm planting which would be the continuation of the ongoing
program and for which nurseries are already established, the project planting
schedule is phased to coincide with the need for MANR to establish a project
management unit (PMU) to manage the project and to undertake farmer selection
an.d training. Thus year 1 would be devoted largely to the construction of
project buildings and facilities, the purchase of equipment, and the estab-
lishment of cocoa seedling nurseries for the plantings planned for year 2.
4.03      Project Administration.  A project management unit (PMU) would
be established within MANR. The project would provide funds to finance the
capital costs of establishing the management unit and its operating costs
dutring the three year development period.
4.04      Swamp Rice.  Farmers developing swamp rice would receive develop-
ment credits for swamp clearance and drainage, and seasonal loans for the
purchase of fertilizers and seed.
4.05      Cocoa Planting.  Farmers planting cocoa would receive credit
for crop establishment, fertilizers and capsid control. Crop establishment
credits would be provided in the form of cocoa seedlings, (produced in
project nurseries), insecticides, and a sprayer; and cash for part of the
labor required for farm development and maintenance until plantings are four
years old.
4.06      Oil Palm Planting.  Participants in the smallholder oil palm
scheme would be eligible for credits for crop and cover crop establishment,
fertilizers and insecticides. Crop establishment credits would be provided
in the form of oil palm seedlings, produced by the project management unit
in a centralized nursery, cover crop seed, fertilizers and insecticides, and
cash for part of the labor required for farm development and maintenance
until plantings are four years old.
4.07      Nucleus Oil Palm Estate and Mill.  The project would complete
the establishment of the nucleus estate described in paragraph 3.10 by
planting 510 acres of oil palm to bring the estate to 2,000 acres. Sufficient
land for the estate has been leased by Government for a period of 50 years.
4.08      At full development, nucleus estate and outgrower production
would total 21,000 tons of ffb 1/ annually. Assuming a peak monthly harvest
1/   Fresh fruit bunch (ffb) is the product of the oil palm.  Each ffb is a
large cluster of fruits and each fruit comprises a nut containing a
palm kernel which is surrounded by oily flesh from which palm oil is
extracted.



- 9 -
of 15% of annual production, the yields discussed in paragraph 7.02, and
400 mill working hours monthly, peak milling capacity required would be about
8 tons ffb/hour. MANR would hire consultants to prepare tender documents,
assist in bid evaluation, and oversee mill construction. During negotiations
assurances were obtained from Government that consultants for these purposes,
satisfactory to IDA, would be appointed.
4.09      Rice Mills.  The project would establish, at suitable locations,
20 rice mills with storage and drying areas. The mills, with a processing
capacity of 500 tons of paddy/annum, would be initially operated and owned
by MANR. Subsequent to its establishment ADA would assume mill ownership,
and be responsible for their operation, or for their transfer to private
enterprise.
4.10      Farmer Training.  MANR provides training at the Kenema Farmers'
Training Institute for a few selected farmers from the project area. These
farmers attend an 18-month residential course which covers a wide range of
agricultural activities. Under the project the staffing of this institute
would be improved, courses shortened to 2 or 3 weeks duration and confined
to teaching the production techniques of the crops for which the farmer
would subsequently receive project assistance. Courses would be followed
up by further training on the farmer's own land while he receives project
assistance.
4.11      Northern Province Project Study.  Previous development in Sierra
Leone has been concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of the country,
and this unequal development has accentuated tribal and political differences.
PMWA 1/ has tentatively identified a project in the country's Northern Province,
and, under the project, consultants would be employed by MANR with terms of
reference and under conditions satisfactory to IDA to assist MANR complete
the preparation of this project. Assurances to this effect were obtained
during credit negotiations. Draft terms of reference for consultants are at
Annex 9.
4.12      Forestry Project Study.  Although Sierra Leone has considerable
timber resources it is presently importing annually Le 600,000 of sawn wood
and wood products. Currently the Kenema District forest reserves are being
commercially exploited, and Government is considering the development of
the proposed Tama forest reserve (North Eastern Sierra Leone). Recently
Government and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
carried out a forest inventory of the area which projects an annual output
of 760,000 cubic feet of sawn timber.  Under the project consultants would
be employed by MANR, with terms of reference and under conditions satisfactory
to IDA, to prepare an economic feasibility study and investment plan for
the extraction of the timber, its processing and marketing; and if proven
viable, a plan for a phased replanting program.  Assurances to this effect
were obtained during credit negotiations.  Draft terms of reference for
consultants are at Annex 10.

4.13      Palm Oil Market Study.  In addition to project plantings at Daru,
Government has established an oil palm estate (1968) and outgrowers scheme
(1971), known as the Gambia oil palm plantations near Matru in the South of
Sierra Leone which, including the already committed plantings for the 1973
plmnting season, would total about 3,600 acres by July 1973. As Sierra
Leone would not be a competitive producer of palm oil on the world market,
any further expansion of the oil palm industry, including plantings on the
Gambia plantations and associated oil palm mill developments, should follow
a detailed market survey of domestic requirements. Currently, the African
Development Bank is investigating the domestic palm oil market in Sierra
Leone with the view to the possible financing of an oil palm mill for the
Gambia Scheme. Depending on the outcome of this investigation, consultants
would be employed by MANR, under the project, to carry out any additional
market studies that may be required, and during credit negotiations, assurances
were obtained from Government that it would not expand the Gambia oil palm
plamtations beyond the 1973 plantings, and neither would it initiate any
ner oil palm development schemes, additional to the project without prior
conisultation with IDA, and that consultants would be employed by MANR with
terms of reference and under conditions satisfactory to IDA.
4.14      Rice Marketing Studies.  Due to Government efforts to promote the
development of domestic rice, which should result in a decline in rice imports,
it is likely that the Rice Corporation (para 2.13) will face further annual
losses in the near future. Government is already taking a close look into
thhe activities of the Rice Corporation, and is exploring means whereby
the present substantial losses can be reduced and the efficiency of marketing
ancd milling undertaken by the Corporation can be improved. Under the project,
consultants would be employed by MANR to assist in the preparation of a plan
for rice marketing and milling (para 2.13) and during credit negotiations,
asE,urances were obtained that consultants would be employed by MANR with
terms of reference and under conditions satisfactory to IDA.
4.15      Agricultural Development Authority.  While a strengthened MANR
(para 2.06) would be able to successfully carry out the crop establishment,
farmers' training and planning component of the project, it would not have
the freedom of decision making required for commercial operation of the oil
mill and nucleus estate, and for providing agricultural credit on a national
scale. Thus, by the second year of the project, a statutory body, the
Agricultural Development Authority (ADA), would be established in the first
instance to be responsible for the palm oil mill and nucleus estate; and after
credit disbursements are complete, for the credit fund. Details of the proposed
organization and responsibilities of ADA are given in para 6.04 and in Annex 4.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Costs
5.01      Estimated project costs total LE 4.3 million (US$5.6 million) with
a foreign exchange component of Le 2.3 million (US$3.0 million) or 53% of total
costs. Costs are detailed in Annex 5 and sunmmarized in the following table.

5.02      Project costs include a 5% physical contingency and a price con-
tingency of 6% compounded per annum on all project costs. Project costs
exclude farm family labor to which a cash cost is not attributed. Costs are
based on Government salary and wage scales; up-to-date building costs;
recent quotations given by suppliers of vehicles and materials; and farm
input and labor data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and the University.



- 12 -
Pro,ject costs do not include taxes on imported goods, should Government
require payment of import taxes on items included in project costs, the cost
of such taxes would be additional to Government's contribution to project
costs. This issue was agreed with Government during negotiations.
B. Proposed Financing
5.0'3     A credit of US$4.3 million would be made to Government on
standard IDA terms to meet 77% of total project costs.  US$3.0 million or
70% of the credit would cover project foreign exchange costs, and the
balance of US$1.3 million (30% of the credit) would finance 50% of local
currency costs. The remaining 50% of the local costs totalling US$1.3
milLion would be met from Government budgetary allocations of US$0.9 million,
and from borrowings of US$234,000 from the Bank of Sierra Leone and US$156,000
from the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board, see para 6.06.  Government
wouLd have to make available a further Le 0.3 million (US$0.4 million) over
the three years subsequent to completion of the three year project development
period. These funds would be needed to bring all cocoa and oil palm acreages
and cleared swamps into full development. During credit negotiations an
assurance was obtained from Government that these funds would be made available.
Assurances were obtained that funds required for the project would be made
avaLlable two months in advance and in block form, on the basis of monthly
estimates prepared by the project manager and approved by the Permanent
Secretary of MANR.
5.04      Details of project financing would be as follows:

C. Procurement
5.05      Procurement of the palm oil mill and its construction, rice
mills, vehicles, tractors, spraying machines, and fertilizers valued at
about US$2.0 million (Le 1.5 million) would be through international competi-
tive bidding, and bids for imported goods would be evaluated on the basis
of their CIF cost free of all import and other duties. Government is not
party to any preferential tariff arrangements. Other purchases amounting to
about US$0.5 million would be subject to local competitive bidding. During
negotiations tender procedures for local procurement were agreed between
IDA and Covernment.



- 14 -
D. Disbursement
5.06      Disbursement of the credit would be against:
(a)  80% of loans disbursed to participating farmers and the cost
of oil palm estate field development. About US$0.85 million
(Le 0.65 million);
(b)  100% of the cif costs of the palm oil mill and rice mills;
and of the cif cost of imported vehicles, machinery, fuel
and spare parts, totalling about US$1.65 million (Le 1.3
million);
(c)  80% of the planning, building and furnishing of project
buildings, totalling about US$0.20 million (Le 0.1 million);
(d)  80% of the cost of local staff salaries, totalling about
US$0.35 million (LE 0.3 million);
(e)  80% of the cost of expatriate staff (including recruitment
costs) and of consultant and specialist services engaged by
MANR totalling about US$0.50 million (Le 0.4 million); and
(f)  80% of the cost of the Headquarters staff and services of
the Agricultural Develoiment Authority (ADA) totalling
about US$0.1 million (Le 0.05 million).
An tnallocated amount of US$0.65 million (Le 0.5 million) would meet
physical and price contingencies on the above items. Annual disbursement
of the proposed IDA credit by categories is detailed in Annex 6, Table 1,
and a quarterly disbursement schedule in Table 2. Expenditures would be
evidenced by contracts, shipping documents and certified records of expendi-
tuire. Any surplus credit amounts would be cancelled.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.07      Project accounts and records of disbursements made to individual
farners would be maintained by PMU, and individual loan accounts for all
farners receiving project credit for oil palm, cocoa and rice production
would be transferred to ADA at the end of the project disbursement period.
The estate and mill would maintain separate accounts and, in addition,
duplicate loan accounts for oil palm outgrowers. All accounts would be
kept in accordance with Government regulations governing the accounting
procedures of statutory authorities. The accounts of PMU, ADA, the oil
palm estate and oil mill would be audited annually by an independent
auditor, mutually acceptable to Government and IDA; and audited accounts
together with copies of the auditor's reports would be submitted to IDA
within four months of the closing of each financial year. During negotiations,
assurances to these effects were obtained from Government.



- 15 -
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Organization
6.01      The project would be carried out by a project management unit
(PMU) responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture. During credit negotiations
it was agreed as a condition of credit effectiveness that the unit had been
established, and that the Project Manager and Financial Controller had been
appointed and had taken up their duties. PMU would 1?e responsible for project
implementation during the disbursement period, but on the formation of ADA
would hand over to it the ownership and operation of the oil mill and nucleus
estate, and the supervision of the oil palm outgrowers. PMU would,
however, continue to administer project credit to the farmers and operate
the rice mills until IDA disbursements had been completed.
6.02      PMU, which would exercise overall project management and
financial control, would operate from a project head office at Kenema,
the administrative center of the project area. The unit would be staffed
with the following key personnel: Project Manager, Deputy Project Manager,
Financial Controller, Credit Manager, Land Planning Officer and a Rice/Cocoa
Officer. The oil palm estate and outgrowers scheme would be managed by a
plantation manager, assisted by a supervisor for the outgrowers scheme. After
the establishment of ADA, the plantation manager and his staff would be
responsible to the Managing Director of ADA.
6.03      Field management of the cocoa and rice schemes would be effected
through three main field offices, to be located by the Project Manager,
each staffed by an Agricultural Officer, a number of agricultural instructors,
and supporting staff. As far as practical, farmers would be formed into
operational groups which would facilitate cocoa planting, swamp clearance
and credit supervision. When disbursements are completed in 1976, the project
headquarters unit would be withdrawn, and all extension work would revert
to the district service of MANR; and the credit service would operate under
ADA.
6.04      The Agricultural Development Authority (ADA) (this name is used
for project purposes) would be a statutory body established by Act of Par-
liament before March 31, 1974. ADA would be responsible for providing credit,
technical and managerial services to agricultural projects; and developing
commercial agricultural projects on its own behalf. It would have a Board
of nine directors, seven appointed by Government and one each by SLPMB and
BSL, which would be responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources. Government would appoint one of the Board members, other than
the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, and the Board would appoint
a Managing Director as ADA's chief executive officer. Further details of
ADA's organization are given in Annex 4.
6.05      To assist Government in preparing suitable legislation for ADA,
and to assure smooth assumption of responsibilities, Government would appoint
a Managing Director designate not later than June 31, 1973. An assurance



- 16 -
to this effect was obtained from Government during credit negotiations.
Assurances were also obtained that ADA would be established before
March 31, 1974 or one month prior to the commissioning date of the
palm oil mill, or whichever is the earliest, with legislation and financial
structure satisfactory to IDA; that ADA would adopt a policy statement (see
Annex 4, para 2) satisfactory to IDA; that this policy statement would not
be changed without IDA's agreement; and that ADA would not undertake responsi-
bilities other than those assumed under the project without the concurrence
of IDA.
6.06      ADA's share capital would include Government equity of Le 1.9 mil-
lion, including Le 0.5 million representing the value of the oil palm estate
taken over at the beginning of the project and further developed during the
first two years of the project by PMU, Le 0.9 million representing the
foreign exchange cost of the oil palm mill constructed during the first two
years of the project, and Le 0.5 million ropresenting the value of the credit
fund at the completion of disbursements under the project. The Bank of Sierra
Leone (BSL) and SLPMB would make equity contributions to ADA of Le 180,000
and Le 120,000 respectively. These amounts would initially be in the form
of loans to Government to cover the local construction costs of the oil palm
mill, but would be converted to equity when ADA has been legally formed.
Assurances to these effects were obtained during negotiations.
6.07      While ADA's statutes would permit the payment of annual dividends
of up to 5%, it is proposed that dividends would be paid initially only to
BSL and SLPMB. This would allow ADA to accumulate the funds that it would
require to expand its activities.
6.08      Marketing Organization.  ADA would be appointed a licensed buying
agent of SLPMB; it would make deliveries of palm kernels produced by the
project mill direct to SLPMB in Freetown. During credit negotiations, an
assurance was obtained from Government that ADA would be appointed an
LBA for this purpose.
6.09      It is Government policy that SLPMB should be responsible for millgate
purchase and wholesale distribution of all project produced palm oil. SLPMB
already has experience in distributing and marketing palm oil from its own
mills (see Annex 3), but it has not prepared a marketing plan for project oil.
During credit negotiations it was agreed that a condition of credit
disbursement against the oil palm component of the project would be
that Government would present IDA with a plan, drawn up by SLPMB, for
the satisfactory marketing of project oil, and that a draft agreement,
to be signed by SLPMB and ADA prior to mill operation, would be prepared
setting out millgate pricing arrangements and guarantees that SLPMB would
purchase all project palm oil.
6.10      Project paddy would be milled at the small village mills set up
by PMU. The milled rice would be sold on the open market. PMU would retain
rice to cover milling costs and credit repayments and the remainder would
be returned to farmers. Project cocoa would be sold through SLPMB licensed
buying agents (LBA's).

B.  Staffing
6.12      Previous attempts by the SLPMB and Rice Corporation to carry out
large scale agricultural development have failed at a heavy cost to the
economy (see paras 2.10 and 2,12). There have been three main reasons for
these failures: poor planning, lack of management, and political inter-
ference. Satisfactory staff would be the key to the success of the
project, and unless Government agrees to employ expatriates in key posi-
tions, this project is likely to suffer the fate of previous development
efforts. During credit negotiations assurances were obtained from
the Government that these positions would be filled by suitably qualified
individuals mutually acceptable to IDA and the Government, until such time
as Sierra Leonean staff, who would be trained on the project, had gained
sufficient experience to replace them. As described in para 2.07 there
is no shortage of academically qualified agricultural technicians. For
project financial calculations it has been assumed that expatriates would
be required in the following positions for the periods indicated: Project
Manager - 3 years; Financial Controller - 3 years; Credit Manager - 4 years;
Land Planning Officer - 3 years; mill engineer - 4 years; Plantation
Manager - 4 years; and Managing Director of ADA for 3 years. Government
gave a further assurance to the effect that Sierra Leoneans appointed
as Deputy Manager of PMU and Deputy Manager of ADA would be mutually
acceptable to Government and IDA. During credit negotiations it was agreed
that a condition of credit effectiveness would be that the Project Manager
and the Financial Controller had been appointed on conditions, and with terms
of refere.nce, satisfaction to Government and IDA, and that they had taken up
their duties. It was also agreed that a further condition of credit
effectiveness would be that suitable arrangements had been made for the
appointment of the Deputy Project Manager, Credit Manager, Land Planning
Officer and Plantation Manager on condition, and with terms of reference,
satisfactory to Government and IDA.
6.13      The credit officer would be assisted by three qualified Sierre
Leone agriculturalists who would receive inservice training in credit
operations. They would ultimately be seconded to ADA to form the core of its
agricultural credit staff.
6.14      The cocoa/rice officer, three agricultural officers and fifteen
agricultural instructors would be selected by PMU from existing MANR
staff and would be transferred to PMU. Assurances to these effects were
obtained from Government during credit negotiations. Other project staff
requirements would be met from graduates from the university and secondary
schools.
6.15      Sierra Leonean staff would gain experience that would enable them
to follow up the works of expatriates on this project, and to hold more
important positions in the project that would be planned for the Northern
Province. In particular, it is expected that Sierra Leoneans would
be trained to replace the expatriate plantation manager, mill engineer,
and credit manager employed under the project.

C. Credit Arrangements and Terms of Sub-Loans
6.16      Loans to project farmers would be made by PMU for cocoa, oil
palm, and swamp rice development. These loans would bear interest of 8%,
which is 1% below commercial bank lending rates for short-term loans.
However, this rate would be sufficient to cover the costs of loan adminis-
tration including bad debts. Payment of interest on cocoa and oil palm
credits would be waived until the plantings, made with the credit, come
into production. This is justified, since under SLPMB pricing policies
farmers receive less than the market value of their produce and it is not
foreseen that this situation will change significantly in the short term.
6.17      During the project disbursement period, farmers would be eligible
for credits to develop the following maximum acreages: rice 3 acres; cocoa
2 acres, and oil palm 10 acres. Farmers would be allowed credit for only
one of the above crops, and it would be a condition of the credit that all
developments would be completed in a single year.
Cocoa Planting
6.18      Credit of up to Le 148/acre (US$192) to plant and maintain to
first harvest 2 acres.  The term of the credit would be twelve years at 8%,
interest which would be waived for the first five years. Development
credit repayments would not exceed 66% of the net cash return to the farmer
after repayment of the seasonal loans and would start in year 6 (Annex 2,
Table 1) .
Rice
6.19      Credit of up to Le 49/acre (US$64) to clear and drain, and bring
to first harvest up to 3 acres. Of the Le 49 75% would be for hired labor,
the amount to be determined by the availability of family labor which would
be considered during PMU's appraisal of each credit application. The term
of the credit would be six years with interest at 8% and a grace period of one
year. Development credit repayments would not exceed 29% of farmer's net
cash returns after the repayment of seasonal loans (Annex 2 Table 3).
Oil Palm
6.20      Credit of up to Le 105/acre (US$137) to plant and maintain to
first harvest up to 10 acres. The term of the credit would be 13 years; the
inl:erest of 8% per annum would be waived for the first three years. Repayments
would start in year 4 and would be so adjusted, together with the seasonal
loan repayments, not to exceed a total debt service equivalent to Le 8.5/ton
(US$11) for f.f.b.



- 19 -
6.21      Credits would be disbursed in annual installments of:
Le
Year             1       2          3        4    Total    US$
Cocoa 2 acres         172      43       35       45     295      874
Rice 3 acres          14A7      -        -        -     147      191
Oil Palm 10 acres    833    116        101        -    .o050   1,365
Credits would be disbursed in cashi and kici16 directly by the project unit,
subject to satisfactory completion of farm work.
6.22      To ensure satlsfactory yields from proJect cocoa, rice and oil
palm farms, following conclusion off development credit disbursement under
the project, ADA would make seasonal Loans available to project farmers for
fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides and hired labor. Seasonal loans would
be set, for up to Le 24Jacre (US$31) for cocoa; Le 'I/acre (US$14) for rice;
and Le 9/acre (US$12) for oil palm. Farmers would pay a service charge of
10% per annum on the value of all seasonal loans. This would be sufficient to
cover credit administration costs, a bad debt allowance and the costs of
supplying seasonal inputs to the project area.
6.23      Farmers' loan agreements would obligate the participants:  for
rice, to deliver paddy, equivalent to the value of their annual loan repayment,
to the nearest project operated rice mill; for fresh fruit bunches, to
deliver to the oil mill; and for cocoa, to arn LBA satisfactory to ADA. For
ffb and cocoa, loan repayments would be deducted from the proceeds of the
sales. All loans would become payable immediately if the participant ceased
to market produce through the agreed channels; and in the event of persistent
repayment default the agreement would allow ADA, when operative, to operate
a defaulter's farm until his loan had been repaid in full (See Annex 2).
6.24      Rice farming loan agreements would take a slightly different form
in that several farmers who would be grouped or. a single swamp (see para 6.10
and Annex 2) would be required to sign a loan agreement making them collec-
tively responsible for the repayment of the total credit extended to members
of the group. During credit negotiations it was agreed that a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be that Government had
agreed forms of farmers' loan agreements incorporating the above and
satisfactory to IDA.
VII.  PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARMER BENEFITS AND GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
A. Yields and Output
7.01      Cocoa:  Trials carried out bv 1ANR in the project area with hybrid
cocoa on the heavy clay soils of the lower slopes of the valleys have vielded



- 20 -
over 900 lb dried cocoa/acre in their fourth year after planting. Because of
the number of farmers involved, however, variations in farm management
standards and yields are inevitable. It is estimated that cocoa planted under
the project would begin yielding in its fourth year with an average yield of
,200 lb/acre, reaching an average mature yield of 700 lb/acre in its seventh
year, after which it is assumed that yields would remain constant until the
plantings are 25 years of age.
7.02      Oil Palm:  Oil palm yield estimates are based on a satisfactory
analysis of project area ecological conditions carried out by IRHO, and
growth and yield indications from estate palms planted in the project area in
May 1968. It is estimated that estate and smallholder's palms would begin
yielding in their fourth year, and would reach average mature yields of 5
tons ffb/acre, and 3.8 tons ffb/acre respectively in their seventh year. The
:Lower yields from smallholders' palms reflects the generally lower farm main-
itenance standards that are anticipated for smallholders. These yield estimates
are in line with yields experienced elsewhere in West Africa under similar
ecological conditions.
7.03      Swamp Rice:  Swamp rice trials in the project area have produced
yields in excess of 3,000 lb of paddy/acre, using the 1960 Rokupr varieties,
which do not respond well to fertilizers. It is assumed that project farmers
would continue to use such varieties during the early years in which a swamp
:Ls being cleared and brought into production, and while growers are learning
the techniques of swamp management; and that in this period yields would
Lncrease from 1,800 lb/acre in the first cropping year to 2,200 lb/acre in
ihe third year. After this time improved varieties should be available from
Government's UNDP assisted rice research program (para 2.07), and higher
yields attainable. Account is not taken of this possibility in project
evaluation.
7.04      At full development the project would produce annually about 230
tons of cocoa; 4,300 tons palm oil; 860 tons palm kernels; and 2,900 tons of
milled rice.
B. Markets and Prices
7.05      Cocoa:  Sierra Leone's average ar.nual cocoa production of 4,000
t:ons is less than 0.5% of total world production (Annex 3, Table 13).
Project production of about 230 tons at full production would not have a
measurable effect on the world cocoa supply situation, but would form part
of the estimated annual growth in world production of 3.5%. The Bank
Economics Department estimates that prices in 1980 are likely to be about
US$0.27/lb in 1971 dollar terms compared with about US$0.28/lb for the first
cluarter of 1971.
7.06      Palm Kernels:  Project palm kernel production of about 860 tons/
annum at full development would be exported by SLPMB, which would also handle
project produced cocoa. The Bank Economics Department estimates that by 1975,
t:he second year of this operation, world market price will fall to US$138/



- 21 -
ton cif Europe if palm kernels are to remain competitive with alternative
vegetable oil sources and this price has been used in calculating project
economic benefits.
7.07      Palm Oil:  Project palm oil would be produced for domestic consump-
tion only, substituting for a substantial part of Sierre Leone's increasing
vegetable oil imports. These totalled 3,200 tons costing Le 911,000 (US$1.09
million) in 1970 (see Annex 3, Table 17). Domestic requirements of vegetable
oil are expected to increase in line with a population growth of about 2%, and
may expand further because of income increases. Annual domestic consumption
of palm oil, the favored oil in Sierra Leone, is currently estimated at about
29,000 tons, of which 600 tons are produced by SLPMB mills, and the remainder
from wild palms processed by traditional methods. If consumption increases
only in line with population growth, annual requirements of palm oil in 1985
would increase by about 8,000 tons, by which time project production would reach
a maximum of 4,300 tons/annum. In view of this and the fact that the produc-
tion from wild palms is declining, no problem is foreseen in absorbing
project palm oil. In calculating project economic benefits, all oil palm
is treated as import substitution and valued at a price equivalent to
US$163/ton cif Freetown, which is equivalent to the Bank Economic Department's
forecast for palm oil cif Europe for 1975 (Annex 3, Table 18). In finan-
cial estimates, it is assumed that as project production increases mill-
gate prices will fall from about Le 200/ton when the mill starts operations
to about Le 128/ton in 1983. These prices compare with present SLPMB palm
oil sales prices of Le 224/ton, and soybean oil import costs of Le 300/ton.
7.03,     Rice:  Rice imports averaged 23,000 tons/annum from 1954 to 1969,
or 16% of annual consumption. They are growing, and cost about Le 5
million in 1970 (see Annex 1). At full production project rice sales
would total about 2,900 tons/annum and would substitute for imported rice.
In the calculation of economic benefits a price of US$125.7/ton has
been used. This price is equivalent to the cost of importing rice, forecast
to have a fob Rangoon price of US$81.3/ ton. This is based on the Bank
Economics Department's 1980 price projections for rice of quality that
is imported by Sierra Leone (see Annex 1, Table 13).
C. Farmers Benefits
7.09      Project area farmers are close to subsistence and their cash
incomes low; probably about Le 80/annum per family or Le 16/capita. Under
the project they would continue to produce most of their existing cash and
subsistence produce with the exception of upland rice for which a 50%
reduction is assumed. No project participant would receive credit for more
thian one project activity and therefore incremental net farm incomes would
vary according to crops, and after completion of debt service, would be
annually per family about: cocoa Le 132, oil palm Le 462, and rice Le 143
(The respective incremental per capita incomes would be Le 26, Le 92 and
Le 29). Individual crop budget details are given in Annex 2, Tables 1, 3,
and 5.



- 22 -
D. Government Benefits
7.10      Government direct revenue from the project would be small, since
project production would be directed to the domestic market, and Government
receives the bulk of its agricultural sector revenue from export duties in
the absence of an effective system of income taxation in rural areas.
Revenue from exported project cocoa and palm kernels would be about
Le 22,000/annum at full production. The project however, would generate
surpluses for ADA. These surpluses would be generated by the revolving
cretdit fund and by the palm oil estate and mill operations (see Annex 4),
would be used to finance agricultural development, and would reduce Govern-
merit budgetary support to this sector. Government's costs and revenues
including ADA surpluses are detailed in Annex 7.
VIII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project's primary benefits would be the increased production
of palm oil and kernels, cocoa and rice, and resulting foreign exchange
earnings and savings, and higher incomes for about 2,500 farm families compris-
ing about 13,000 people. The project would demonstrate the benefits of
i-mproved agricultural techniques, show the value of supervised credit, and
integrate agricultural production with essential processing and marketing
facilities. In addition the establishment of ADA would provide a permanent
organization for management of commercial agricultural operations and a
chatnnel for supervised agricultural credit after the project disbursement
period. Rural employment would be increased at a time when opportunities in
minLing, particularly alluvial diamond mining, are declining; and the project
wouild be an initial step towards diversification of the national economy
through agricultural development.
8.02      The return to the economy from the project is calculated in Annex
8. Based on yields, costs, and prices estimated in this report and assuming
a project life of 25 years, the rate of return to the economy is about 15%.
No cost is attributed to family labor, since under present circumstances
farmers lack the opportunity to do more than traditional and virtually
subsistence farming. Hired labor is costed at a shadow rate of Le 0.42
sirLce this probably represents the amount produced by an additional worker
engaged in subsistence farming and is justified in view of the levels of un-
employment in the project area (see para 2.02). When hired labor is costed
at its cash cost the rate of return falls to 13%. At full development the
prciject would provide annually about 3,000 man-years employment.
8.03      Project rates of return have been tested for their sensitivity to
an overall 10% reduction in estimated yields; and to a range of commodity
price estimates. The results of this sensitivity analysis are tabulated
in Annex 8, and show that only in the unlikely event of yields and prices
both falling below estimates that the returns would be marginal.



- 23 -
8.04      The project involves both additional foreign exchange earnings
from expanded exports and foreign exchange savings from the substitution of
domestic production for imports. The net value of foreign exchange benefits
over the life of the project would amount to US$21.8 million (Annex 8,
Table 5).
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  The Government would prepare, for comment by IDA, by the
end of 1973, a study for i proving the marketing and milling
of domestic rice, including the disposal of the Rice
Corporation's uneconomic mills and for the improved
marketing of imported rice (para 2.13);
(b)  Consultants satisfactory to IDA would be employed to assist
MANR complete the preparation of a project in the Northern
Province (para 4.11);
(c)  Consultants satisfactory to IDA would be employed to prepare
a feasibility study and investment plan for the commercial
development of the Tama Forest Reserve (para 4.12);
(d)  During the credit disbursement period, Government would
not expand the Gambia oil palm plantations beyond the
already committed 1973 plantings, nor would it initiate
any new oil palm development additional to the project,
except as recommended by a study undertaken by consultants
with terms of reference and conditions satisfactory to IDA
(4.13)
(e)  Government would legally establish ADA before March 31, 1974
or one month prior to the commissioning date of the oil
palm mill, whichever is the earliest (para 6.05);
(f)  During the credit disbursement period ADA would not under-
take responsibilities additional to the project, without
the prior concurrence of IDA (para 6.05);
(g)  Suitably qualified individuals mutually acceptable to IDA
and Government would be employed in the following positions
until such time as suitably qualified Sierra Leoneans are
available to replace them: Project Manager; Financial
Controller; Credit Manager; Land Planning Officer; Mill
Engineer; Plantation Manager; and Managing Director of
ADA (para 6.12);



- 24 -
(h) Sierra Leoneans appointed Deputy Project Manager and
Deputy Manager of ADA would be mutually acceptable to
Government and IDA (para 6.12).
9.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) Government had established a Project Management Unit
and that the Project Manager and Financial Controller
had been appointed and had taken up their duties (para 6.01);
(b) Suitable arrangements had been made for the appointments
on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to Government and
IDA of the Deputy Project Manager; Credit Manager; Land
Planning Officer; and Plantation Manager (para 6.12); and
(c) Government had agreed forms of farmers' loan agreements
satisfactory to IDA incorporating the conditions set out
in para 6.23 (para 6.24).
9.03      Conditions of credit disbursement against the oil palm component
of the project would be that:
(a) SLPMB had submitted to IDA, a satisfactory plan for the
phased closure of its uneconomic palm oil mills
(para 2.11); and
(b) SLPMB had submitted through Government to IDA, a plan
for the satisfactory marketing of project oil, together
with assurances that a draft agreement to be signed by
SLPMB and ADA, prior to mill operation, would be prepared
setting out mill gate pricing arrangements, and guarantees
that SLPMB would purchase all project oil (para 6.09).
9.04      The project would be suitable for an IDA Credit of US$4.3 million.

SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Arrangements for Rice Marketing
Background
1.        Although rice is the staple food of Sierra Leone, imports have
averaged 23,000 tons annually since 1954, and totalled 48,000 tons or about
16% of total requirements in 1970 (see Table 1). In 1965/66, the Agricultural
Statistical survey 1/ estimated local paddy production at about 394,000 tons,
of which about 10% was taken up for seed and by storage losses, and the bal-
ance consumed. During the same year, about 19,000 tons of clean rice were
imported, giving a total milled rice consumption of about 255,000 tons,
equivalent to about 250 lb per capita/annum. The population has increased
since 1965 by about 2.0% per annum to about 2.5 m in 1970, but domestic rice
production has grown more slowly. This has been reflected in increased im-
ports, which rose to an average of 30,000 tons for 1968-70, with an annual
average cost of about Le 3.3 million (US$4 million).
2.        It is Government policy that Sierra Leone should become self-suffi-
cient in rice production and the project would contribute to this objective.
Project incremental rice production at full development, after deducting
project farmers' subsistence requirements would be about 2,900 tons in 1978.
With a growth in consumption at a rate equal to the expected increase in
population, this would represent about 7% of the additional production
required by 1978 -- 35,000 tons -- to meet the incremental demand due to
population growth alone. Therefore, the project would contribute only to a
reduction in the rate of increase in import levels.
The Rice Corporation
3.        By 1963, Government intervention in the rice industry was consid-
erable, and a Commission was established to consider future arrangements for
rice production and marketing and, in particular, to examine the operation of
the Ministry of Agriculture's Rice Department. It recommended that a public
authority should be established to:
(a) engage in rice production;
(b) import, and distribute rice at controlled prices; and
(c) purchase, mill and market domestic rice at controlled
prices.
1/   Carried out by the Central Statistics Office, Sierra Leone.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Thte Rice Corporation was established in 1965 under the Ministry of Trade and
Industry to perform these functions.
Pzoduction
4.        It was envisaged that the Corporation would finance its own large-
scale rice production projects and a subsidized plowing scheme for small-st.-L.
rice farmers, from profits made on sales of imported rice at internal prices,
substantially above those on the world market. The Corporation inherited
tractors and other equipment from the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources (MANR), but this was insufficient for the planned expansion of
rice production and about Le 1 million worth of new equipment was acquired.
5.        The Corporation's programs failed to make an impact on rice produc-
tion and by June 1968 the Corporation's production losses amounted to
Le 303,000. Consequently, Government returned all rice production activities
to MANR. The Corporation's failures were caused by bad management and by
political interference, which prevented it from operating commercially.
Both the Government, which did not pursue a sound coordinated policy on rice
development, and the Corporation, which lacked managerial and technical abi-
ity, were responsible for the heavy financial losses sustained between 1965
and 1968, and for the external debts created by supplier credits, accepted
for machinery which was mostly unsuited to Sierra Leone rice production <oLi-
ditions.
Imports
6.        The Corporation has a monopoly for importing rice and estimates
annual requirements in consultation with MANR. Supplies are arranged by the
Corporation from the most favorable source. The Corporation appoints Licensed
Selling Agents (LSAs) for the distribution of imported rice and fixes selling
prices and trading margins in consultation with Government (see Table 9).
LSAs are given quotas, which are keenly sought by all traders, because the
retail prices at which the LSAs are supposed to sell imported rice are not
widely observed, and by selling rice at open market prices, LSAs realize
attractive profits. The Corporation's retail prices are of doubtful value
since they cannot be enforced on the large number of retail outlets that
exist throughout the country, and therefore do not provide consumer protec-
tion. Consumer protection can be assured better in future by channelling
supplies of imported rice into a competitive market, and a distribution of
profits reflecting costs more closely would follow the removal of the retail
prices determined annually by the Rice Corporation, which currently favor
the LSAs and petty traders to the detriment of the Corporation.



ANNEX 1

Marketing and Milling of Domestic Rice
7.        Only 20% of domestic rice production enters commercial channels,
the remainder being consumed. Trading is carried on mainly by private trad-
ers 1/, with less than 5% of paddy production being sold to the Corporation
for milling. The Corporation announces annually the prices at which it will
purchase and sell and in 1971/72 these are:
(a) Producer prices
(i)  dried husk rice (paddy)             -Le 2.30/bushel (60 lb net)
(ii) dried native cleaned rice (upland)-Le 7.00/bag (168 lb net)
(iii) dried native cleaned rice (swamp) -Le 8.80/bag (168 lb net)
(b) Corporation selling prices (Freetown)
(i) wholesale price - Le 10.80 (160 lb)
(ii)  retail price    - Le 11.40/bag (160 lb)
8.        The Corporation maintains a buying organization for husk rice and
native cleaned rice in the main surplus growing areas. It has Licensed Buy-
ing Agents (LBAs), who are responsible for buying from producers at fixed
prices and who receive an allowance of Le 3.33/ton. However, producer prices
are not enforced and rice is purchased in a variety of measures and without
quality controls. The Corporation has great difficulty in attracting substan-
tial supplies of paddy and in the Southern Province relied in the past on
cooperatives that were under Government pressure to supply it. There is gen-
eral dissatisfaction with the buying services of the Corporation, because
traders are able to offer higher prices. In these circumstances, the Cor-
poration's annual purchases of husk rice have fallen to less than 4,000 tons
annually (see Table 11). Inevitably, a fall in tonnage of rice handled in-
creases unit costs of the Corporation's buying organization.
9.        During 1970/71 paddy was purchased at a milled rice equivalent of
Le 124/ton, while milled rice was purchased at Le 117/ton. At this paddy
price and with the Corporation's milling and administrative expenses (Table
10), a ton of milled local rice costs the Corporation Le 162/ton, which was
Le 10.8/ton more than the maximum Government controlled wholesale price at
which it sold rice ex-Freetown in that year. In 1971 the Corporation offered
even higher paddy prices in an attempt to increase its purchases. These
prices will increase the cost/ton of rice by an additional Le 19, thereby
contributing to larger losses.
10.       The Corporation operates the following three rice mills:
1/   The Rice Corporation Act of 1965 restricts trade in rice to Sierra
Leone citizens.

Average milling costs in these mills from 1965/66 to 1968/69 are given i)
Table 10.  These are abnormally high for large mills and costs/ton milled
would not be reduced significantly by increasing throughput, because direct
expenses represent the larger part of total costs. It is unlikely also that
the mills could operate at full capacity even if adequate supplies of padd.,
were available, because of frequent breakdowns and their limited parboiling
and drying facilities. In view of the Corporation's losses on milling and
marketing domestic rice, and its low turnover, it is necessary to reconsider
both the need for these mills and the role of the Corporation in the market-
ing of domestic rice. Since the mills are old, poorly equipped, and in the
case of the Freetown mill, badly located, it is opportune to consider the:il
closure or sale to private operators, thereby eliminating losses from t1'Li
continued operation by the Corporation or by Government.
11.       Since its eatablishment, the Corporation has suffered from politi--
interference and its management has been unable to operate commercially as
envisaged by the Commission, which led to its establishment. Financial coi->
trol within the Corporation has been very weak, operations have not been
costed properly, stores have been lost, debts to the value of Le 288,00 had
accumulated by June 1969, and annual accounts have not been published since
the end of the financial year 1967/68 (see Tables 2-7 for the latest accounts'.
Accumulated losses up to June 1969 are estimated at Le 610,000, of which pad.y
production activities accounted for Le 303,000 by June 1968 (see Table 6),
when they were returned to MANR. Gross trading profits from imports totalling
about Le 1.2 m by June 1969 (see Table 8) had been absorbed by losses on pro-
duction projects, domestic paddy marketing and milling operations, and on ad-
mdnistrative overheads, while additional deficits have been financed by Gov-
ernment advances, details of which are not available.
Future Milling and Marketing Arrangement for Domestic Paddy and Rice and
Imported Rice
12.       The Corporation's and Government's failure to promote the domestic
rice industry is apparent from failure to substantially reduce imports and
the reduction in paddy offered for sale to the Corporation (see Table 11).
Changes are required to stimulate local paddy production, and improve milling
and marketing efficiency. A major step to creating such conditions would be
for the Corporation to handle wholesale distribution only, and not to set
prices for retail sale of its rice, and to control the release of imported
rice stocks so as to maintain reasonable domestic prices until local supplies
are sufficient to meet domestic requirements.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
13.       The introduction of a large number of small rice mills in recent
years has been of great value to the local industry. The unit cost of a
typical small mill is about Le 7.3/ton 1/ of husked rice milled compared with
an average of Le 26/ton in the Corporation's mills between 1967-69 (excluding
parboiling and drying). At the same time, the larger mills inevitably in-
curred heavy transportation costs and average transportation distances
would be shortened by the replacement of the large mills by small village
mills. However, it is recognized that the small mills may only have an
economic advantage over larger mills until large contiguous areas of produc-
tion are developed. Nevertheless, in the meantime, the scattered distribu-
tion of existing production and the planned development of rice so far favors
small mills, and in contrast to the large mills, private mills are currently
being operated successfully at the village level.
14.       The changes proposed above imply that the Corporation would be left
only with the responsibility of rice importation and distribution -- a de-
clining responsibility as domestic production approaches self sufficiency.
It is questionable, therefore, whether a separate statutory body is necessary
to perform this function. The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB)
is capable of importing and distributing rice without significantly increasing
its present reasonable overhead expenses (see Annex 3). Satisfactory port
handling and storage facilities are already available for crop export and
these could be readily adapted for rice imports. In contrast to the Corpora-
tion, SLPMB accounting and management procedures are satisfactory, and a
chain of well established agents with approved storage facilities exists
throughout the country. In view of the substantial savings that would accrue
to Sierra Leone's economy if SLPMB assumed responsibility for importing anld
distributing rice, Government should plan to dissolve the Rice Corporation
and make SLPMB responsible for importing rice. The annual savings on over-
head administration alone would be about Le 150,000 and after the disposition
of the large rice mills, would total about Le 200,000.
Project Paddy and Rice Marketing Arrangements
15.       The project includes rice production on 6,000 acres of inland
swamp. After deducting 1,250 lb of paddy per family for subsistence 2/,
and assuming a paddy to rice conversion rate of 60%, and an average holding
size of 3 acres, project rice sales at full development would be about 2,900
tons building up as follows:
1/   FAO - Integrated Development of the Agricultural Sector - Sierra Leone,
ESE:SF/SIL 3, Technical Report No. 3, Rome, 1970.
2/   The balance of family subsistence requirements would come from traditional
upland rice farming.

16.       The project would include credit facilities for paddy production
and for about 20 500-ton paddy/annum capacity mills with stores and sun drying
fac:Llities. The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, through its
project management unit, would establish and operate these mills, handing
thema over in year 4 to ADA who would continue to operate them, until local
entrepreneurs (farmers, traders, businessmen, or cooperatives) had shown
themselves technically able and creditworthy to purchase and operate them on
theiLr own. Operating costs for these mills are estimated in Table 12, based
on data collected by FAO 1/. Each mill would be located to handle annually
a minimum of about 300 tons of project produced paddy at full development.
Priority would be given to milling paddy collected in repayment for production
credit provided to farmers under the project, but the mills would be used also
for milling paddy for subsistence consumption and commercial sales by all
farmiers. The milling charge would be set by project management (probably
abotLt Le 0.20/ bushel). As the volume of paddy handled by village mills
increases, it may be necessary to install drying equipment, but this is
unlikely to be required during the project disbursement period.
17.       Project rice and paddy collected as credit repayments would be
stored at the units prior to sale through private traders at open market
prices, and farmers' accounts would be credited with the value of sales less
milling and handling costs. It is unlikely that the project would be left
withi stocks of rice, but should this happen, SLPMB would purchase these
stocks. Commercial sales by project farmers would be made through private
traders.
18.       There is an extensive network of existing SLPMB and Corporation
agents throughout the project area, and there are sufficient traders and
dealers to ensure a satisfactory degree of trader competition.
19.       Domestic rice prices are at present about 50% above the cif price
of current and projected rice imports (Table 13). This situation is caused
by the present low level of rice production technology and high cost of
internal marketing and milling. It is not a true reflection of the country's
production potential.

ANNEX 1
Table 12 (cont'd)
Notes
a/ Customers charged 20 cents per bushel of rice milled; no income is derived
from the bran produced since it is of low quality containing much husk and
is rarely sold.
b/ Labor charges based on a salary of Le 12 per month paid to the mill operator
and Le 8 per month for each additional man employed.
c/ Depreciation of 10 percent per annum on a capital investment of Le 700
(cost of huller and building) and 20 percent per annum on a capital invest-
ment of Le 700 (copt of engine and blots). Interest charge of 10 percent
per annum on one half the initial capital investment.
d/ Average of 18.1 bushels husk rice (paddy milled per gallon of diesel con-
sumed; 1 gallons engine oil changed every 250 hours).
e/ Repairs to diesel engine assumed to cost same as repairs to huller.
fl If a mill operator can find alternative use of labor when not processing
rice, he can reduce the charges. For example, a reduction of 50 percent
in labor char-ges at an output of 3,000 bushels should reduce total costs
.04 per bushel and result in a net revenue above costs of .02 a bushel or
60 Leones a y4ar.

SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Credit Arrangements
Background
1.        Of Sierra Leone's estimated million acres under crops each year,
only about 23,000 acres (2.3%) are large farms and plantations, the remainder
being farmed by about 250,000 families. Over 95% of cultivated holdings
are under 10 acres, and the average is about 4 acres. Only about a quarter
of all farmers receive any significant cash income, and the majority operate
on a near subsistence basis.
2.        Commercial banks make production loans to large farms and planta-
tions only, and finance some crop marketing. Institutional sources of
finance for farmers' production and marketing have ceased to function over
the past few years, and the only effective sources of credit for farmers are
relatives and friends, other farmers, and traders. A small pilot survey 1/
by the Bank of Sierra Leone in 1968 indicates the extent and methods of such
borrowing.
Pilot Survey
3.        The 273 farmers interviewed represented only about 0.1% of all
farm families. About one fifth of the sample did not borrow each year. Of
the remainder, one half borrowed from relatives and friends, one fifth from
other farmers, one fifth from traders (mostly African), and one tenth from
the institutional sources that were still operating in 1968. About one
quarter borrowed from two or more sources. Of the total sums borrowed, only
about one fifth was for long term purposes. Of the sums borrowed for
seasonal purposes, one third was for expenses during the "hungry season",
one tenth for social and religious reasons, one tenth for labor, and the
balance for seed, fertilizer, plowing, farm maintenance, house repairs, and
for litigation expenses.
4.        Of those who borrowed from relatives and friends, almost one
third paid no interest, one third paid 100% interest (irrespective of the
period of the loan), and the balance at rates varying from about 5% to 75%.
Of those who borrowed from other farmers and traders, the majority paid 100%
interest, and many sold their crops to these same people at around half the
prevailing prices. In the 1967/68 planting year, about two-thirds of these

Leone, January, 1969.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
loans were recovered after the harvest, and very few were outstanding more
than two years. The average amount borrowed per farmer was valued at about
Le 40, although in practice many loans were made and repaid in kind.
5.        On this basis, and assuming four fifths of the farmers took loans,
then the total value of loans throughout the country in 1967/68 would have
been of the order of Le 8 million, or about 10% of the estimated total value
oi farmers' production in that season.
Agriculturol LQans and Credit Scheme
6.        This scheme was started by the Government in 1961; and was adminis-
tered through the Chief Agriculturist in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources. Farmers received loans from plantation crops, livestock
and farm machinery. The annual interest rate was 5%, with a grace period to
ffirst harvest. Over a six year period to March 31, 1968, Le 133,000 was
diLsbursed to 278 farmers, an average of about Le 480 per loan. At that
d.ate three quarters of the repayments were in arrears. The scheme has been
abandoned.
Fisheries Loans and Credit Fund
7.        This revolving fund was established in 1961, and administered by
the Chief Fisheries Officer. Loans were made to individual fishermen for
mechanization of small craft and cold storage. At October 31, 1968, about
Le 103,000 was due, with only Le 14,000 recovered. Most of the borrowers
are untraceable. The fund is no longer operative.
Cooperative Societies
8.        Agricultural cooperative societies were formed mainly for market-
irig specific crops. There have been no production societies. At June 30,
1967, there were 277 marketing societies, of which two thirds were for cocoa,
almost a quarter for rice, and the balance for other crops. The average
number of members was about 60 per society. In 1950 the Registrar of
Cooperative Societies established a fund through which these societies could
bcirrow for seasonal and longer term purposes. Most of the finance was
obtained through the two commercial banks.  Interest rates to cooperatives
were 9%, and to farmers 12% to 18%. At June 30, 1968, Le 730,000 was due
for repayment but only 36% had been recovered. The position has deteriorated
since then.
9.        After the near collapse of the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing
Board (SLPMB) in June 1967, (see Annex 3), farmers lost faith in marketing
cooperatives, and negligible amounts of produce are now marketed through
them.
10.       The Government's Agricultural loans and Credit Scheme, and the
Cooperative loans failed because of unsatisfactory appraisal of loan
applications and lack of supervision; inevitably resulting in a high percent-
age of overdue and bad debts. The latter were particularly serious for the



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Cooperative movement, which depended upon the commercial banks for credit
funds, and its financial difficulties were compounded by the insolvency of
the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB) in 1967.
Project Credit
11.       Project credit would be based on a sound appraisal of farmers' re-
quirements, and the investment's earning capacity. It would be part of a
package of services which would include, farmer training, field extension,
farm planning, and assistance in marketing. The project would be an altern-
ative source of credit which would help to break the traditional hold of
traders over farmers' produce. Loan management would be strict, and
individual agreements would be made between PMU and each borrower covering
the terms and conditions of each loan. At the end of the project disburse-
ment period the credit fund established under the project would be trans-
fered to ADA, as would the obligations of the borrowers.
Management
12.       A project credit officer, qualified and experienced in handling
smallholder credit schemes, would be responsible to the project manager for
credit administration. He would operate through the field and administrative
staff at the Daru oil palm estate and mill for the issue, supervision and
collection of oil palm credit, and through senior field officers at
Kenema, Bandajuma, and Daru for cocoa and rice credit. An accounting unit
at Kenema would maintain central records of individual accounts. Ledger
records for rice and cocoa credit borrowers would be maintained by credit
clerks at each of the rice mill locations. The mill clerks would be respons-
ible for recording individual account receipts and debits, and for collecting
produce as payment in kind.
13.       Credit staff would be assisted by technical officers in assessing
the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, and loans would be issued under
an agreement between PMU for MANR and the borrower on terms to be agreed
between the Government and IDA. These would include assurances, that:
(a) borrowers do not have outstanding debts with Government
and Cooperative Societies;
(b) borrowers have sufficient land, suitable for the project
activity for which credit is required;
(c) borrowers have rights to use the land for the time required
to ensure repayment of project loans;
(d) outstanding debts would be settled by the inheritors of a
deceased participant's farm;
(e) borrowers would repay their loans by marketing all their
produce through the project unit or project authorised agent
- outstanding debts would become payable when a participant



AINEX 2
Page 4
sold produce through alternative channels and ceased to
sell stipulated quantities through the project;
(f) borrowers would attend project training courses when
requested;
(g) project rice farmers would accept collective
responsibility for the development of each swamp,
and would be responsible collectively for the re-
payment of the total credit extended to the group;
(h) After ADA assumes responsibility for credit it would
be empowered to make use of the land and standing crops
of a borrower in default of loan repayments, until
such time as either the debt was repaid, or ADA had
earned the equivalent plus costs from the use of the land
and standing crops; and
(i) borrowers would not obtain project credit for more than
one crop.
14.       The project would make arrangements necessary to supply the ferti-
lizers, insecticide and equipment to be issued on credit.
Cocoa Credit
15.       Credit would be provided for the planting and upkeep of 2 acres of
cocoa per farmer. The development credit would cover the cost of materials
and labor up to the value of Le 148/acre. Total credit for a farmer plant-
ing two acres would be Le 295 (US$384). This credit would be repaid over
twelve years; the interest of 8%/annum being waived for the first four years,
and repayments of principal beginning in year four. This is justified, since
under present SLPMB pricing policies, farmers receive less than the market
value of their produce and it is not foreseen that this situation will
change significantly in the short term future. After year 4 seasonal credit
would be provided for spraying materials and labor. This would be repayable
within 12 months and bear interest equivalent to 10% of the amount of the
loan. Details of credit requirements and the cash flow are shown at Table 1
of this Annex. Total credit fund requirements for cocoa production are shown
in the project cost tables in Annex 5, Table 1.
Rice Credit
16.       Credits of up to Le 49/acre would be provided to project rice
farmers for a maximum of three acres. Loans would be for six years at an
annual interest rate of 8%, with one year of grace. Seasonal credits would
be provided to cover the annual costs of fertilizers, seeds and for the
hire of labor during planting, weeding and harvesting. Such credit would
be for a maximum of 12 months and would bear an interest rate equivalent to
10% of the principal amount. The gross return after debt service and
including subsistence rice consumption of 1,250 lb paddy per family and



ANNEX 2
Page 5
based on a paddy price of Le 2.0/bushel, would increase from Le 94 per 3
acre unit in year 1 to about Le 143 (US$186) in year 7 after completing
credit repayments. Credit requirements per acre and an estimated cash
flow for a three acre rice farm are shown in Table 3, and total rice
credit fund requirements are given in Annex 5, Table 1.
Oil Palm Credit
17.       Credit of up to Le 105/acre would be provided to plant and maintain
to first harvest a maximum of 10 acres of oil palm per farmer. Loans would
bear an interest rate of 8% which would be waived for three years, and would
be repayed over 13 years. Seasonal credit would be provided from year 4
to meet the cost of fertilizers. These credits would be for a maximum of
one year and would bear an interest rate equivalent to 10% of the principal
amount. Credit fund requirements for oil palm production are shown in Annex
5, Table 1. A cash flow for a 10 acre farm is shown in Table 5 of this
annex.  Project oil palm smallholders would sell all of their ffb to ADA,
who would arrange to make collection from participating farm. The return
to the farmer after debt service would increase from Le 61 in year 1 to
Le 462 (US$600) annually after completing debt repayments.
18.       Credit accounts would be handled by credit staff located at the
mill. Repayments would be collected from payments for ffb deliveries and
each farmer would have an individual account in which debits and credits
would be recorded. All participating farmers would be paid the same farm
gate price for ffb. Individual loan accounts would be balanced at the end
of each year and if necessary balancing payments made to individual farmers.

SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board and Marketing
Arrangements for Project Palm Oil, Palm Kernels and Cocoa
The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB)
1.        The SLPMB was established by Ordinance in 1949, with a legal func-
tion to "secure the most favorable arrangements for the purchase, export and
marketing of Sierra Leone's produce and to assist in the development by all
possible means of the agricultural industry of Sierra Leone for the benefit
and prosperity of the producers and areas of production".
2.        Under its charter, SLPMB was given the sole right to export all
agricultural produce. At present, however, only cocoa, coffee and palm ker-
nels are handled by the Board, while ginger and piassava, the remaining two
important export crops are handled by commercial exporters. In addition to
its crop export responsibilities, SLPMB owns nine small palm oil mills, and
a palm kernel oil extraction plant with an annual kernel capacity of 34,000
tons.
3.        SLPMB owns a subsidiary company, the Sierra Leone Produce
Marketing Company, SLPMC, which maintains a small office in London. This
office arranges the overseas sales, freight and insurance of all SLPMB ex-
ports, at a cost of 1/2 of 1% of the cif values of sales. Any profits are
paid to SLPMB as dividends.
Producer Prices and Marketing
4.        Minimum producer prices for crops handled by SLPMB are established
annually by SLPMB with Government's approval, prior to the beginning of each
buying season, and normally such prices remain unchanged throughout the sea-
son (see Table 1). SLPMB operates through licensed buying agents (LBA's)
who purchase produce, either directly from farmers, or from traders and shop-
keepers. To be licensed, an LBA should handle a minimum of 300 tons of pro-
duce each year, and have adequate storage facilities approved by the Produce
Inspection Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. There are 33 LBAs in
the project area operating about 75 buying centers.
5.        Small traders and farmers deliver produce to the LBAs who are res-
ponsible for:
(a) purchasing at buying stations all scheduled produce of
reasonable quality, and preparing it for export, and pay-
ing not less than the official prices announced by the
SLPMB;



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(b) complying with Government produce inspection regulations;
(c) preparing, bagging, sealing and transporting produce in
accordance with SLPMB instructions; and
(d) financing the purchase, handling, storage and transpor-
tation of produce from the time of purchase to the time
of delivery at SLPMB export stores in Freetown.
6.        LBAs receive a buying allowance and an allowance to cover their
transport costs; 1971 allowances for palm kernels and cocoa are shown in
paragraph 9 below. The transport allowance averages about Le 0.03/ton mile
by road, which will be the only method of transportation when the present
narrow gauge railway is closed in 1972. Although the road system in the
project area is adequate for produce evacuation, Government's regulations
restricting the registration of new trucks to Sierra Leoneans only has caused
a shortage of roadworthy trucks, and delays occur in transporting produce to
Freetown.
Produce Marketing Cooperatives
7.        For many years the cooperative movement played an important role
in export crop primary marketing, and in 1958, five cooperative marketing
unions in the project area combined to form a Cooperative Marketing Federa-
tion (CMF), which became an LBA. At the peak of its business in 1967, CMF
handled about 55% of total cocoa exports (see Table 2), but it was never im-
portant for palm kernel marketing. CMF operated almost exclusively on
short-term loans from commercial banks, and in 1967 became bankrupt because
SLPMB payments for produce received were over six months in arrears. Profits
did not cover accumulated interest charges, and loans to cooperative members
were mismanaged. The commercial banks withheld all further loans to the
CMF and it ceased operations. The position of loans to marketing cooperatives
at June 30, 1969 was:
Due for
Loan Type    Repayment   Repaid   Overdue   % Repayment
Short-term    558,807   186,136   352,665         34.5
Medium-term   142,140    60,783    81,355         42.2
Long-term      50,339    17,409    32,930         34.0
In subsequent years, for which complete data are unavailable, the record has
been even less satisfactory as more repayments have become overdue.
Marketing Costs
8.        The main cost elements incurred by SLPMB in 1971 for marketing
cocoa and palm kernels from official buying stations to fob Freetown are
shown below:

Port handling, storage and dues                  2.00       2          2.00  0.5
Storage loss in weight, quality claims           0.50       1          1.00  05
SLPMB administrative overheads                   8.00       8          8.00    2
Total Costs                               94.55    100          351.60  100
SLPMB allocates administrative costs on a tonnage basis, and since 1967 im-
proved management has halved these costs by lowering operating costs, increas-
ing turnover, and eliminating SLPMB loan finance charges.
Allocation of Overseas Sales Proceeds
9.        Tables 3 and 4 show the allocation of cocoa and palm kernel fob
sales proceeds between producer payments, marketing expenses, export duties,
and SLPMB surpluses/deficits.  Marketing expenses between 1963/64 and 1967/68
are estimates only, since SLPMB accounts are unavailable for these years.
The higher export prices received for cocoa and palm kernels in 1967/68 to
the present (Table 5) resulted in increased trading surpluses (Tables 3 and
4), and enabled producer prices to be increased by 6% for palm kernels and
4% for cocoa. Internal marketing costs (excluding produce purchase costs)
have been reduced substantially from about Le 37.50/ton to Le 29.50 for palm
kernels, and from Le 46/ton to Le 38.00/ton for cocoa (see para 9). H1owever,
should world market prices fall to Bank projected levels of Le 504/ton
(US$604.8) spot New York for cocoa, and Le 106/ton (US$138) cif Europe for
palm kernels, and other costs remain unchanged, then SLPMB would only Just
cover its expenses and duty payments 1/ on palm kernels, and would have a
surplus of about Le 40/ton (compared with about Le 160/ton in 1969/70) on
cocoa trading.
Performance
10.       SLPMB management pursued a conservative financial policy from 1940
to 1964, maintaining large and increasing reserve funds, until by June 30,
1964 the audited accounts showed assets of Le 9.3 m, including investments of
Le 5.4 m of which Le 4.0 m were reserved for the price maintenance fund.
Between 1964 and 1967 SLPMB rapidly diversified and expanded its activities.
These new ventures exhausted the financial reserves so quickly that by
1/   The palm kernel duty rate is 10% of fob value, and that for cocoa a
sliding scale of 10% of fob value up to Le 400/ton plus 1% for every
Le 20/ton in excess of Le 400/ton.

January 1967 the Board was bankrupt, and unable to meet its trading commit-
ments. During the period of expansion, the SLPMB increased its staff and
comnitted funds to a program of plantation development covering half a mil-
liLon acres; made a contract for the construction of a large palm kernel
crushing mill costing about 1.7 m; and invested in, among other things,
instant coffee manufacturing machinery, four outdated palm oil mills, an
animal feed mill, and equipment for the manufacture of plastic bags. All of
these activities were financially and technically unsound, and mismanaged.
11.       In addition to the large investment program, the SLPMB attempted
to revise its marketing arrangements by replacing LBAs with its own produce
buying centers, and by making overseas sales from Freetown instead of
through the SLPMC in London. These changes in a previously satisfactory
system destroyed trader and farmer confidence in the produce trading system,
and reduced Sierra Leone's ability to obtain favorable prices for its export
crops. In particular, the contract for exporting palm kernel oil from the
new plant was so adverse -- the marketing agency received 4% of cif Europe
value of the oil -- and the world market price differentials between kernels
and kernel oil were so small that the mill was unable to operate on a sound
economic or financial basis. During its first seven months of operation,
thte mill lost Le 154,567. The plant was closed in January 1968 to avoid
continued financial losses.
12.       Proper accounts were not kept for the period July 1964 to June
19,67, but SLPMB estimates that it invested about Le 10.5 m in non-marketin-
ventures, and by December 1966 had accumulated a Le 1.0 m liability to itn.
buying agents for delivered produce. In 1967 the Standard Bank of West Af-
rica granted Government a line of credit of up to Le 4 m for SLPMB which
allowed it to continue marketing operations. As conditions of this line of
credit, an expatriate General Manager was employed, management consultants
were hired to establish new accounting procedures and strengthen financial
management and control of operations, and all SLPMB industrial and planta-
tion development programs, except the small palm oil mills, were terminated.
13.       Following these changes, SLPMB reduced operating costs which,
together with favorable world market prices for palm kernels, cocoa
and coffee (see Table 5), enabled it to repay its loans a year earlier than
scheduled. In addition, by March 1971, Le 2.6 m were invested in the price
maintenance fund (Le 100,000 above the legal minimum), Le 0.25 m in a new
building fund, and the trading reserves amounting to about Le 1.5 m were
invested in 90-day British Government stocks.
14.       The latest published accounts of the SLPMB and SLPMC are for the
period July 1967 to June 1968, but these have not been published, and accounts
for 1969/70 had not been prepared by March 1971. Despite this lack of ac-
counts, it is apparent that SLPMB has made a sound financial recovery since
1967, and in particular, has significantly reduced its operating costs and
reestablished satisfactory financial reserves. Operating costs could be
further reduced, however, by closing down uneconomic palm oil mills, which,
up to 1963/64, had shown documented losses of about Le 0.6 m, and since then



ANNEX 3
Page 5
estimated losses of over Le 1 m (see Table 11). These mills are old and
frequently break down; oil extraction rates are low and oil of poor quality;
and increasing wage rates and declining supplies of wild fruit have increased
processing costs to Le 40/ton ffb. Although attempts have been made to im-
prove the operation of these mills these have failed to make any improve-
ments, and under Sierra Leone conditions the mills can only continue to
operate at a loss. Four mills have already been closed and SLPNB is con-
sidering a phased closure of the remaining five.
15.       Although SLPMB's current financial position is sound, there is
little room for complacency since it will be faced in the immediate future
with declining trading surpluses, if world prices for cocoa and palm kernels
fall to the levels estimated by the Bank's Economics Department (para 9), and
if coffee purchases continue to be in excess of Sierra Leone's International
Coffee Organization export quota. The present export quota is 5,315 tons,
while purchases and sales since 1967/68 have been as follows:
Year        Purchases      Sales
--------Tons-----
1967/68        3,982        3,982
1968/69        8,237        3,928
1969/70        8,000        5,828
1970/71        8,000        5,800
After allowing for quota sales before January 1972, the 1971 carry-over will
total about 5,100 tons, with a purchase value of about Le 1.7 m.  Although
SLPMB will probably be able to sell coffee to non-quota markets, prices
would be substantially lower than sales on quota markets, and would not cover
SLPMB buying expenses. This situation could be eased by an increased ICO
quota, but this is unlikely since most surplus coffee probably enters Sierra
Leone from neighboring countries. Physical control of such coffee movements
is almost impossible and SLPMB should explore control through producer price
adjustments.
Project Marketing Arrangements
16.       Cocoa.  Project cocoa production at full maturity in 1983 (see
Table 12) would be about 234 tons or about 6% of total Sierra Leone cocoa
production. Farmers would sell their cocoa to LBAa acceptable to ADA.
Project staff would encourage the rehabilitation of primary cooperative
societies to provide competition for the traders. Tables 13 and 14 show
Sierra Leone's current position as a minor cocoa producer (0.2% of total
world production in 1969), and the world cocoa market situation. Project
price projection and internal and overseas marketing costs used to calculate
economic benefits are detailed in Table 15.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
17.       Palm Kernels and Oil.  ADA would purchase all ffb 1/ produced by
project smallholders, and this, together with estate production would be
processed at a new mill established under the project. All palm kernels and
palm oil would be sold to SLPMB, under an agreement to be signed between
ADA and SLPMB. At full maturity in 1982, annual mill production would be
about 4,300 tons of palm oil and 860 tons of kernels (Table 12).
18.       SLPMB would export project palm kernels, and ADA would receive
the minimum producer price together with the LBA's allowance which would
be about Le 73/ton (US$95/ton). This price is used in project financial
calculations, and is the same price as that used in project economic
calculations based on the Bank's Economic Department forecast of US$138/ton
ton cif Europe and costs detailed in Table 16.
19.       In its agreement with ADA, SLPMB would undertake to purchase all
project palm oil and to be responsible for distribution and marketing. The
initial millgate price for palm oil would be agreed between ADA and SLPMB
and would probably be about Le 200/ton. The millgate price would be nego-
tiated annually, and the estate and mill financial projections indicate
that the price could probably be reduced over a 10-year period to Le 128/ton.
At this price the estate and mill could probably continue to operate on a
sound financial basis; the continued profitability of the mill would be a
major factor in fixing palm oil prices. For the economic benefit calcula-
tions, a price of Le 128/ton ex mill is used. This is based on the Bank's
Economics Department's projections for 1980 of US$163/ton cif Europe.

Calculated "total stockst
The difference between world production, adjusted for 1% loss in weight during the movement of
supplies from producing to consuming countries, and world grindings is assumed to be the yearly
carry-over.  "Total stocks" are an accumulation of the yearly carry-overs, making no allowance
for cocoa which may have been destroyed in the producing country. Since actual total stock
information is not published the figures can orly be regarded as estimates. The basis for the
calculations is as follows: For the period 19l16 to 1969, the end-1956 figure was used as the
starting point for the calculations, both forward and backward, since FAO in their CCP/Cocoa/62/4,
1 April 1962 paper indicated that toal end-stocks in 1955/56 amounted to 290 thousand metric
tons (this figure was reduced by 5 thousand tons because the consumpticn figure used at that
time was later revised upward by 5 thousand tons).

ANNEX 4
Page 1
SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Development Authority
General
1.        The Agricultural Development Authority (ADA) would be a
statutory authority established under Act of Parliament. It would be res-
ponsible for:
(a) providing credit to all classes of agricultural producers
and processors;
(b) providing technical and managerial services to agricultural
producers and processors;
(c) assisting Government and other institutions in the
identification, preparation, supervision and management
of projects; and
(d) developing agricultural projects on its own behalf.
Initially ADA's principal functions would be to own and operate the oil
palm mill and the nucleus estate as from the second year of the project.
After the project disbursement period the Authority would take over and
manage the credit fund and operate the rice mills until handed over to
private ownership.
Policies
2.        At ADA's first Board meeting, a policy statement would be prepared,
the main provisions of which are detailed in Addendum A attached, and which
would specify in particular that:
(a) participation by ADA would be only on a project by
project basis; and that each project would be separately
and fully appraised and shown to be economically and
financially viable;
(b) financing of projects by all usual methods, including
equity investments, loan guarantees, underwriting
security issues, issuing debentures and convertible
debentures;



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(c) limiting ADA's financial participation in any single
project to no more than 25% of its net worth;
(d) seeking the participation in project financing of
commercial banks and other local and foreign financial
and developmental enterprises;
(e) in the case of all ADA's activities, including those
carried out on behalf of Government, interest rates
and fees would cover fully ADA's costs, including
provisions for depreciation and appropriate reserves;
and
(f) ADA's Head Office staff would be kept to the minimum
commensurate with its operations and increased only as
the volume of work so justified, and that wherever
possible all accommodations would be rented.
Finance
Financial Structure
3.        The financial structure of ADA would be established, in consultatict.
with IDA prior to its formation. However, it would have an authorised share
ca,pital of up to Le 6 million (US$7.8 million), part of which would be sub-
scribed by Government in the form of the present palm oil estate and those
assets created during the disbursement period: an oil mill, an expanded
oil palm estate, buildings, rice mills, and a revolving credit fund. Further
equity capital would be provided by the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) and the
Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB). The remaining shares when
issued would be subscribed to by Government, as far as possible, and by other
institutions as approved by the Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
in. proportions, and on terms and conditions to be determined by the Minister.
ADA initial share capital would only be increased with the approval of the
Minister of Finance.
Other Sources of Finance
4.        While the Government, BSL and SLPMB would provide the capital
needed for ADA's requirement in this project, for other projects ADA would
have access to other sources of funds. The Sierra Leone National Development
Bank has indicated that it would consider extending to ADA a line of credit of
up to Le 150,000 on terms to be negotiated. For short-term finance ADA
wculd be able to discount its seasonal advances to projects (including loans
made by projects to farmers and cooperatives) with the Bank of Sierra Leone
up to limits to be agreed, and at the prevailing discount rate, currently 6%.
It would also be able to obtain some short-term funds from local commercial
banks. Additionally, ADA would charge fees for any technical services ren-
dered and for managing other projects on behalf of Government or others.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Organization
5.        ADA would have a Board of nine directors, which would be
responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The
Board members would be:
Representatives of:
Bank of Sierra Leone
Ministry of Finance
Ministry of Development
Cooperative Department
Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board; and the
Chief Agriculturist and
Mfanaging Director of ADA and
Two non-officials, nominated by Government, who would
represent the agricultural industry.
Government would appoint one of the Board Members, other than the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board. The Managing Director, who would be
ADA's Chief Executive Officer, would be appointed by the Board and would be
a person of recognized financial, economic and banking experience. The
Board would be assisted by project advisory committees, which it would set
up, as required, for individual projects. Such committees would consist of
not more than five members of which one would be the Project Manager as
chairman, and one a representative of IANR.
6.        Project management would be carried out through project manage-
ment units, each headed by a Project Manager, responsible to ADA's Managing
Director.
Operating Results
7.        Tables 1 to 6 show the costs, benefits and cash flows for the oil
palm mill, oil palm nucleus estate, the credit fund and the rice mills.
The latter would be transferred on a loan basis to individual private owner-
ship as soon as qualified owner operators materialise and therefore are
unlikely to play an important role in ADA's overall financial position.
However, table 3 shows that substantial surpluses would be forthcoming
from the oil palm operations increasing from Le 101,000 in year 2 to
Le 230,000 in year 5 and Le 261,000 from year 11. These surpluses would
provide dividend payments to BSL and SLPMB and if necessary to Government;
the balance could be used for further commercial agricultural development
projects. The surpluses accruing from the Credit Fund, table 5, would be
reinvested as farm loans under ADA's function of providing central credit
facilities on a countrywide basis. Assuming a net earnings of 5% per
annum (after bad debts and management costs had been accounted for) the
Credit Fund in 1982 would stand at about Le 828,000.
Government Financial Control
8.        Under the Government Corporation (Financial Control) Act, 1966,
every statutory corporation (including ADA) has to submit estimates of its
revenues and expenditure at least one month before the start of a new



ANNEX 4
Page 4
financial year. Under the Act the Minister is empowered to give directions
to each corporation on its financial policy, including any specified item
of income or expenditure. In the Act setting up ADA (Section 9(2) the
Board would be guided on questions of financial and monetary policy by
such directions as the Bank of Sierra Leone may give from time to time.
This would provide more satisfactory control of ADA's financial operations
than directions from the Minister of Finance.

ANNEX 4
Addendum A

SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Development Authority (ADA)
Statement of Policy
Scope of Operations
1.        ADA would only become involved in agricultural development which
satisfied the following criteria:
(a)  participation in each development proposal would be
considered only if the proposal was in the form of a
self-contained project, capable of appraisal on its
own merits;
(b)  every project which involved ADA financial participation
would be fully appraised, financially, technically,
managerially, and commercially in accordance with
established international appraisal techniques, and would
be approved only if it was shown to be viable;
(c)  every project which did not involve ADA financial
participation, but in which ADA was asked to provide
technical, managerial or other services to Government
or agriculturalists (including agricultural cooperatives
and commercial organizations), would be approved only if:
(i) it was consistent with Government agricultural
policies and development priorities;
(ii) ADA's fee was sufficient to cover its estimated
expenditure on the project and provide a reasonable
profit margin.
Financial Participation
2.        ADA would make finance available by means of equity investments,
loans, guarantees, underwriting of security issues, and issuing debentures,
convertible debentures, and other appropriate means, according to the merits
of each project.
3.        ADA's equity holding in any project would not ordinarily exceed
10% of ADA's net worth (i.e. paid up capital and free reserves).



ANNEX 4
Addendum A
Page 2
4.        The maximum financial participation by ADA in any single project
(including loans and equity) would not exceed 25% of its net worth.
5.        The repayment period for loans made by ADA would be related to
the anticipated economic life of the assets financed and a careful assessment
of the project's repayment capacity.
6.        ADA would only undertake refinancing in special circumstances.
7.        For large projects ADA would seek participation wherever
appropriate by the commercial banks, National Development Bank and other
financial enterprises.
Financial Policy
8.        ADA's loan interest rates and other fees would be fixed from time
to time in the light of current market rates, but the rates and fees charged
for a particular project would generally be fixed for that project. In
calculating its rates and fees, ADA would include a reasonable margin over
its cost of borrowing funds to cover its administrative expenses, reserves
for bad debts and general purposes, and to pay dividends in accordance with
its constitution.
9.        ADA would not undertake any foreign exchange risk in respect of
foreign loans made to it, or of loans made by it from its foreign exchange
resources.
10.       ADA would issue separate rules covering lending policies and
procedures for loans made under each project.
Management and Staffing Policy
11.       ADA would maintain a small Head Office in Freetown, and concentrate
most of its staff on projects. Until it was earning reasonable profits the
Head Office staff would consist of only the Managing Director and his counter-
part together with the necessary supporting clerical and other staff.
Until the volume of work could justify further senior staff at Head Office,
the Managing Director would obtain technical assistance from MANR staff
and consultants for appraising any new projects submitted to ADA.
12.       Whenever possible, ADA would rent suitable accommodation, both
for Head Office and for project operations, rather than build on its own
account.

Note:  If mill is eventually operated by a private operator and he pays for the mill at 8% over 10 years then the cost
of milling w,uld be Le 1272 for operating + Le 1730 for debt service, totalling Le 3002 per annum.  Average
throughput, say 400 tons paddy, would mean a cost of Le 0.20 per bushel of paddy milled.

SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rate of Return Calculation
1.        The annual costs and returns used in calculating the economic rates
of return for the individual project components are shown in Tables 1-3, and
a sensitivity analysis in Table 5. The following assumptions and data have
been used in the calculations.
(a) Project Life
The life of the project and for each component is assumed
to be 25 years. Thus, farms planted under the project
would come into bearing during a period from the first to
the seventh year, and would produce benefits for 25 years
for the rice farms cleared in project year 1 and for 18
years for the cocoa farms planted in the last project
year. The calculation includes the costs of establishing
and maintaining the oil mill, and the replacement of es-
sential equipment during 24 years of operation.
(b) Costs
(i) Administration
The cost of consultants' studies have not been in-
cluded in the calculations, since these expenditures
would produce benefits additional to those of the
project, following the preparation and implementation
of other agricultural projects. The project head-
quarter costs are discontinued after year three;
whereas the project field services are included until
year six, at which time the services are expected to
fall away to the present level of Government services
already in the area. Credit management costs are
continued for 14 years when it is expected that the
farmers will be financially self-supporting. Project
unit headquarter costs are allocated to each project
component on the basis of staff time as follows:

Cocoa               10        10       13
Palm oil            15        15        5
(ii) Marketing Costs
Full account is taken of the cost for marketing palm
kernels and cocoa exports. Project palm oil ex-mill
is given the same value as imported palm oil cif
Freetown since internal marketing and distribution
costs for both oils are the same. Since all Project
rice would be consumed within the project area or in
areas further to North, the transport of imported
rice from Freetown would be reduced. Project rice
therefore is valued at Le 5.0/ton more than the cif
Freetown equivalent for imported rice. An average
milling cost of US 26/bushel 60 lb, and a paddy to
rice conversion ratio of 60% is used.
(iii) Farm Labor
No value is attributed to family labor since, under
present circumstances farmers lack the opportunity to
do more than traditional and subsistence farming; and
under the project, they would continue to produce their
subsistence requirements, which have not been included
in project benefits.
(iv) Hired Labor
Hired labor employed in the cocoa, and oil palm,
project components is costed at the official
minimum wage of Le 0.85/day, and in the case of rice
development hired labor is costed at Le 0.70 since a
proportion of women would be employed who would receive
lower daily rates then men. The substantial and in-
creasing level of unemployment in the project area
justifies a shadow price for labor. A shadow rate of
Le 0.42/day is used, which probably represents the
amount produced by an additional worker engaged in
subsistence agriculture.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
(v) Contingencies
Project costs include a 5% physical contingency and
a 6% compounded price contingency. Only the physical
contingencies are included in the economic benefit
calculations.
(c) Benefits
(i) Yields and Output
Yields and outputs used in the calculations are given
in Table 8, Annex 5 and in paras 7.01-7.04 of the text.
(ii) Prices
Returns have been calculated by using values based on
the following world market prices in 1972 dollars:
cocoa USi 27/lb spot New York; rice US$81/ton fob
Rangoon; palm oil US$167/ton cif Europe; and palm
kernels US$138/ton cif Europe.
(iii) Foreign Exchange
Local costs and benefits and foreign exchange costs and
benefits are estimated annually over the 25 years of
the project life. The value of project palm kernel and
cocoa production is treated as foreign exchange earn-
ings and the production of palm oil and rice as foreign
exchange savings. The net local cost and net foreign
exchange benefit streams are discounted at 9%, a reasona-
ble estimate of the opportunity cost of capital in Sierra
Leone. The net foreign exchange benefits and the net
local costs are compared to give the effective exchange
rate for the project.

SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Forestry
Background
1.        In 1970 Sierra Leone imported about Le 600,000 worth of sawn wood
and wood products, making up about 50% of all commercial supplies of these
goods. Plywood and veneers worth Le 479, 052 were the most important items,
while imports of rough and squared timber were worth Le 86,000. Import
details from 1965 to 1970 are shown in Table 1. All imports are subject to
duties, which range from 30% for wood in the rough to 44% for carpentry and
joinery items. In spite of these duties, imports are expected to grow unless
domestic supplies of timber are improved and a plant established to manufacture
wood-based panels.
2.        FAO estimates 1/ that overall annual consumption of sawn wood in
African developing countries will increase by about 200% between 1962 and
1985 or by an average of about 5% per annum. It estimates also that wood
panel consumption will increase by 700% or by an average of 9% per annum
over the same period, and that, in general, the income elasticity for wood
products is highest where income levels are low. The average per capita
income for Sierra Leone was US$125.6 (Le 104.3) 2/ in 1968 and increased at
the rate of 5% per annum over the previous five years. Should this growth
be maintained in future, the implicit income elasticity for sawn wood would
be unity if the FAO average projected growth rate for Africa of 5% was
reached; however, a more conservative estimate of income elasticity is used
for the purpose of estimating Sierra Leone's future requirements in Table 2,
and this gives an annual increase in consumption of 3%. FAO estimates that
the income elasticity for wood panels is higher than that for sawn wood,
and therefore sawn wood consumption projections have been based on an
elasticity of unity giving a rate of growth in consumption of about 5% per
annum at an income growth of 5% per annum. Consumption projections are
shown in Table 2.
3.        Sierra Leone has two major areas of forest reserves situated in
Kenema district and in Tonkolili and Kono Districts. The reserves in Kenema
District are being exploited by the Forest Industries Corporation, which has
an established saw mill and furniture factory at Kenema. The timber reserves
in the immediate vicinity of Kenema are running down, and the Corporation
is considering plans for moving the mill 50 miles to the Gola Forest Reserves

in the same district. The mission established the viability of developing a
10,000 acre Gmelina plantation, but because of the short period of disburse-
ment (3 years) for this project it would be more prudent to include the
proposals for the Kenema plantation development in a larger forestry program.
Apart from the Kenema area, Government is anxious to develop the Tama-TonkoliA
Forest Reserve area which is situated between Sefadu and Masingbi in the
central area of Sierra Leone, and has good communications with Freetown.
In 1967 a forest inventory was carried out of the Tama and Tonkolili reserves
indicating a total of 42 million cubic feet of exploitable hardwoods,
extractable at an estimated rate of about 750,000 cubic feet per annum.
4.        Under this project IDA would finance a feasibility and preinvest-
ment study of the Tama Tonkolili area for which the terms of reference are
shown below:
FeasibilitY and Preinvestment Study of the
Tama/Tonkolili Forest Reserve
A study is required of the Tama and Tonkolili Forest Reserves on the boundary
of the Eastern and Northern Provinces of Sierra Leone, to prepare a feasibi-
lity study and investment proposals for the extraction, processing and
marketing of hardwoods existing in the reserves.
The study should include the following:
(a) an assessment of the suitability of the inventoried species
for extraction;
(b) an assessment of internal and external market requirements;
(c) an assessment of the infrastructural, logging and processing
requirements;
(d) an assessment of the overall organization and management,
whether public or private, to undertake the program; and
(e) the need for a replanting program and if necessary the
accompanying trials.
The study should not be restricted to these items exclusively,
but should, in addition, include other items, which during the study are
found to be relevant for the formulation of the proposed forestry investment
plant, including forestry development programs elsewhere in Sierra Leone.
The investment proposal should contain relevant information to
the report outline described below.

General
Description of the Project mentioning:
-    Objectives of the project; and
-    Size and nature of project components.
Dettails of works, measures and policies for the project and detailed schedule
of phasing.
Cost Estimates
Cost estimates should be given with a breakdown into foreign
exchange and local currency. Items costed should specify development costs
and any recurrent costs during the development period, which are to be
capitalized under the project. A full breakdown of project costs should be
given, including the basis of estimates, quantities, unit prices and
provision for contingencies, overhead costs, and a year by year expenditure
schedule should be included.
Estimates should be compared with costs experienced by the
agencies locally, and with costs for similar works elsewhere. The assumptions
made for estimating costs, should be given, in addition to the methods used
for calculating equipment and labor costs.
Finance
An explanation should be given of the computation of foreign costs
of equipment, materials and technical assistance. Also state how local
costs would be financed, would private finance be available.
Or,anization and Management
Details of the following aspects of the proposed project:
-    Management by either the Forest Industries Corporation, or
the proposed Agricultural Development Authority;
