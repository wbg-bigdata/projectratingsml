PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1378-AL)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCR) for the Third Education
Project in Algeria (Loan 1378-AL) for which a loan of US$48.5 million was
extended to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria in May 1977. The
loan amount was reduced twice, first to US$35.8 million, then to US$13.7
million, and the closing date was extended twice, first to December 31, 1980,
then to December 31, 1983. The last disbursement was made on January 18,
1985 and the loan account was finally closed on January 31, 1985, when the
funds remaining in the account were cancelled; US$7.33 million of the loan
had been disbursed.
The PCR was prepared following a field visit by an EMENA education
mission in May 1984. The mission enjoyed the full cooperation of the
Algerian authorities.
Following a review of the PCR by OED staff, it was decided not
to audit the project and the PCR was sent for comment to the Borrower in
April 1985. No comments have been received.

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1378-AL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       This Third Education Project in Algeria, like the two preceding and
sibsequent two education projects, was designed with a view to supporting
national  development  plans  to:   (a) expand  and  improve skilled manpower
resources; (b) enhance the management, planning and implementation capabili-
ties of the various agencies involved in education and training; and
(c) improve access to a broader range of education and training opportunities
nation-wide. More specifically, the project aimed at increasing the quantity
and quality of middle-level technicians and skilled workers by establishing 15
technicums (job-oriented, upper secondary institutions) and two vocational
training centers, both as parts of larger country-wide programs (see paras.
2.13 - 2.15).
2.       Frequent changes in ministerial responsibility for the project and in
project staff and the introduction of a decentralized regional government
reform seriously hampered imFlementation efforts by project technical staff
and also hampered frequent attempts by Bank supervision missions to render
assistance.   The  project  also  experienced  considerable  delay  caused  by
procurement difficulties including misprocurement (see paras. 3.13 and 3.16).
The project was ultimately drastically reduced in scope (see para. 2.16).
However,   the  important  technical   assistance   component   has   proceeded
satisfactorily, particularly in the significant area of training of national
staff, such as institution directors and supervisors, and the technicum
program continues as a successful approach to training, having benefitted from
early Bank advice (see para. 3.09).
3.       The Government eventually assumed the responsibility for financing
the civil works for the 15 technicums (see para. 3.15) and equipment for both
project voca- tional centers (see para. 3.22); therefore, these items were
deleted.  The financing of equip- ment for eight of the 15 technicums and
civil works for the two project vocational centers was retained. The Closing
Date was changed from March 31, 1980 to December 31, 1983 (see para. 2.16) and
the loan amount reduced from US$48.5 million to US$13.7 million (see para.
3.27).   The final disbursement ;a.q made and the loan account was closed in
January 1985, when US$7.33 million had been disbursed and the balance
remaining in the loan account was cancelled (see para. 3.28).

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1378-AL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
Suimary
i.       Project objectives.  At the time of appraisal, the Algerian education
and training system was attempting to meet a growing demand for technicians
and skilled labor. To meet this need, the GoverDment planned a new form of
upper secondary technical education through the establishment of a system of
technicums and through the expansion of the existing vocational training
program. The Third Education Project was designed to support this objective
through the provision of civil works and equipment and the financing of staff
training, school mapping and construction studies (para. 2.15).
ii.      Project  Content.   A  Bank  loan  of  US$48.5  was  granted  to  the
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria on May 15, 1977 to assist in:
(a) establishing 15 technicums; (b) establishing two vocational training
centers (CFPs); (c) training technicum directors and workshop supervisors;
(d) studying the location of future technicums; and (e) studying the use of
prefabrication techniques in school construction (para. 2.13).
izz.     Revisions.   Changing  ministerial  responsibility  and  changes  in
project unit staff, during a period of broad administrative reforms, led to
repeated delays in procurement and eventually to misprocurement (para. 3.14).
As a result,  the Borrower and  the Bank agreed  in September  1981 and in
December 1983 to reduce the project scope and the loan amount; all civil works
were deleted from the technicum component and all furniture and equipment from
the vocational training component. The financing of equipment for 8 techni-
cums and of civil works for 2 CFPs was retained.   The Closing Date was
extended twice, first from March 31, 1980 and then to December 31, 1983.
iv.      Implementation.  Procurement of technicum equipment (para. 3.21) and
CFP coustruction (para. 3.16) are now, after much delay, progressing satis-
factorily and should be completed during the second half of 1985. Technical
assistance (UNDP/ILO) for the overseas training of 176 technicum staff in
Italy and Belgium is progressing to the satisfaction of the Government and the
Bank (para. 3.09). An initial feasibility study for planning new technicum
locations has been completed and detailed work is continuing (para. 3.05).
However, a full mapping study has not been undertaken because, under the
ongoing program of decentralization, responsibility for all school mapping has
been reassigned from the central ministry to local authorities (wilaya



-2-
directorates of education).   The second  feasibility study resulted  in  the
preparation of two manuals of construction nor   for technicums which were
accepted by the Bank as an alternative to the prefabrication study (para.
3.07).
Conclusions
V.       Project Management.  This aspect of the project was unsatisfactory.
Neither the Government nor the Bank could, however, have foreseen the changes
in ministerial responsibility, discontinuity in management, compounded by
decentralization,  that  the  project  experienced.   The  frequent  changes  in
project staff and the transfer of responsibility from central to regional
staff defeated Bank missions' attempts to analyze and resolve issues in a
concerted manner. A lack of project progress reports further compounded Uuc
problem.   By  the  time  some  stabilization  had  been  achieved,  proposals
suggested by the Bank were not followed up and the Government had sufficient
independence through their own funds to develop their programs. The project
thus had a rather low profile within the larger program which sought to
establish a country-wide network of technicums at the level of muicipalities
and submission of disbursement requests were not perceived as high priority by
the local governments because the central government pre-financed the works.
vi.      Procurement.   Changes in ministerial responsibility and in staffing
also contributed to the disappointing implementation of civil works and equip-
ment. A difference in focus complicated procurement issues early in the
project as ministries, responsible for meeting national targets, assigned high
priorities to quantitative crireria, whereas Bank staff promoted cost and
quality control through effective management.  Government quality control of
project  civil  works  components  was  weak.   Because  workshop  equipment  at
operational, non-project technicums and CFPs are in excellent condition and
store rooms orderly and neat, it is anticipated that the equipment being
provided under the project will be effectively utilized.
vii.     Technical  Assistance.   The  UNDP/ILO  technical  assistance  program
financed by the project (174 staff trained overseas) is progressing satis-
factorily.
Lessons and Comments
viii.    While  it was  not  possible in this  case  to  foresee  the  frequent
changes in the project management team (four directors since the project's
inception) and similarly frequent turnover of technical staff, nevertheless,
the Bank should learn the need for prudence in permitting an undue amount of
project management change before considering possible measures (such as
cancellations) when the success of the project is threatened.



- 3 -
ix.      Another lesson is that if a project is to be a very small part of a
larger program (such as the technicums and vocational training centers), the
Bank should appraise fully the larger program to assess any potential impact
on the project.
x.       Given the scope of the programs to which the Government is committed,
in a context of decentralization, consideration should be given to local
administrators being better trained to meet their new responsibilities to
implement the technicum system to respond to local needs, as responsibilities
are transferred by the central government to local governments. The technicum
staff training component of the Fifth Education Project offers the Government
an opportunity for defining local needs.

DEMDCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (LOaN 1378-AL)
PROJECT COMPLITION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     A mission comprising Mr. 0 de Nessie-es (architect) and consultants,
Messrs.  G.  Howell  (technical  educator)  and  C.  L.  Germanacos  (education
planner) visited Algeria May 7-19, 1984.  In accordance with terms of refer-
ence dated April 5, 1984, the mission carried out a completion review of the
Third Education Project, the Loan 1378-AL, for which was signed on May 15,
1977.
1.02     The Project was designed to support the Government's objectives to:
(a) expand and improve the skilled manpower resources of the country, parti-
cularly at middle-level technician and skilled worker levels; (b) enhance the
management, planning and implementation capabilities of the various agencies
concerned with education and training; and (c) promote social advancement
plans by improving access to a broader range of training opportunities with a
nation-wide network of education and skill centers.
1.03     The project, as originally designed, was considerably modified during
the implementation period, for reasons explained later, and was eventually
reduced to construction of two vocational training centers, financing of
equipment for eight technicums (job-oriented upper secondary institutions),
and technical assistance for related training programs and studies.
1.04     The completion mission visited six of the project institutions and a
number of non-project schools and centers (Annex I). The visits enabled the
mission to discuss project implementation with the concerned provincial and
school authorities to complement discussions with the central government
authorities (Annex 2). During the entire mission, the Algerian authorities
and staff were cooperative and generous in the allocation of their time. The
field trip arrangements were efficiently handled and were particu-arly reward-
ing because of the opportunities to observe the real progress made recently in
the realization of the national plans for education and training, from which
the Bank-assisted project was derived.



II. THE PROJECT
A. The Socio-Economic Setting
The Problems and the Imnediate Response
2.01     The Government was acutely conscious of the magnitude and urgency of
the need for skilled manpower after the exodus of French skilled personnel at
all levels in 1962. The authorities were fully aware of the significance and
functions of a responsive education and training system in the realization of
its development proposals. Programs' objectives and priorities in the exist-
ing education and training system were reviewed in this period and the
Government undertook radical reorganization and reorientation to respond to
the new realities of independence.
2.02     In view of some of the unexpected changes in objectives and the
practical problems of implementation the Bank has experienced, it is important
to appreciate the problems and responses of the Algerian authorities in the
decade after Independence. The economic and social imperatives demanded rapid
expansion of the education system, broader coverage, and a greater range of
opportunities.  The Algerians were prepared to experiment, to innovate, to
accept that errors would be made and lessons learned while finding their way;
to accept partial realization of programs rather than no program at all; to
take action even if all the preliminary planning had not been completed rather
than wait for all the details to be finalized.
2.03     Population Growth.  The major determinant of education policy in the
1970's was the explosive population growth impact on economic and social
policies. In 1977, at the time of project appraisal, 58Z of the population of
17.3 million was under 20 years of age; the annual average rate of growth was
3.2Z while the urban population was growing at 6% p.a. This youthful age
structure of the population created a heavy demand for social services includ-
ing education; the demand was recognized by the Government and sustained by an
allocation of a high 7.5% of the annual budget for education and training
purposes alone in 1975 and 9% in 1977.
2.04     Manpower Needs.   The  crucial role of  the  education  and  training
system had also been underscored by the policy of rapid industrialization with
emphasis initially on heavy industries and capital intensive technology,
followed by a determination to promote mechanical, and electrical and light
industries, housing, construction, transportation and telecommunications. The
major issue in development in these areas was that of educating and training
the existing and potential labor force to play the critical productive role
ascribed to it in the National Development Plans of 1974-77 and 1980-84.
2.05     The ambitious 1980-84 Plan target includes training of an additional
67,000 professional and sub-professional staff, 180,000 middle-level techni-
cians  and  over 400,000  skilled  craftsmen.  The  then  existing  education-
training system had neither the capacity nor the capability to train at this
pace; nor was the system in place in the mid-1970's in a position to



- 6 -
produce the outputs required for the planned growth in different sectors.
Despite the spectacular expansion of education in the 1962-75 period, at the
time of project appraisal (1976) the outputs of the system were well below
projected needs, e.g., (a) the projected average annual estimated demand for
middle-level technicians (Level 4) for 1975-85 was 29,000 against an actual
output capability of 16,400; the 15 project technicums were expected to reduce
the deficit by some 4,500 as from about 1981; similarly, (b) an estimated
annual deficiency in skilled workers (Level 3) of almost 24,000 would be
reduced by 480 through the two project vocational training centers.  In the
case of the first example, the Government proposed to build another 15 techni-
cums for an additional output of 4,500 p.a.; similarly the project vocational
training centers formed but a small portion of a planned network of centers.
B. Economic Planning and Education Strategy
2.06      As demonstrated above, in the mid-1970's, the education and training
resources of the country were unable to meet the quantitative requirements for
trained manpower.  Moreover, the qualitative aspects were far from satisfac-
tory. A reform of the structure and curricula, and a review of teacher and
instructor education and of skill training courses had been initiated, to
prepare for expansion of output, combined with relevance and quality of the
programs, particularly in tne light of the long-term economic and social
justice objectives.
2.07      The goals of the Plan and  the National Charter of 1976 are  parti-
cularlv pertinent to an understanding of the education policies, strategy and
priorities which wer.! applied.  The goals  affirmed  the  country's  intention
to:   (a)  expand  and  reorganize  the  country's  productive  base  for  self-
sustained growth with full employment; (b) achieve economic independence; and
(c)  improve income distribution.  Programs to  support these  priority  objec-
tives manifestly implied the availability of qualified managers and a skilled
work force. The skills in the context of the national development plans are
essentially of a technical (industrial, agricultural, social services) nature
at all levels.  Special attention needed to be paid to the establishment of a
broad variety of skill training opportunities on a country-wide basis, and
also to improve the efficiency of management, planning, and supervisory
capability at central and local levels.
2.08      To these ends, the structural and curricular reforms promoted in the
mid-1970's at the time of project appraisal related to:  (a) restructuring of
the education system to establish a nine-year basic course for all (to be
generalized by 1990), followed by a three-year secondary general or a two- or
three-year technical secondary course, or by a vocational training course;
(b) the upgrading and reinforcement of the sciences and practical studies in
both basic (grades 1-9) and secondary (grades 10-12) education; and (c) the
rapid establishment and expansion of technical and vocational training in
post-basic education (technicums) and in a national network of vocational
training centers for skilled and semi-skilled workers; it is at this point
that the third project was intended to make its impact.



-7-
C. Educational Issues
2.09     The objectives  and  the  strategy outlined  above  were  educationally
sound and consistent with national development policies.   But implementation
of the education strategy proved difficult because well-trained, qualified and
experienced personnel, including teachers ar.d workshop instructors, were not
available in the numbers required to execute the programs at central, wilaya
or school level at the pace or breadth of activity envisaged by the Plan
targets. The issues were compounded by the enormous pressure of the growing
school population, by the massive deficiencies of suitable accommodation and
of teaching materials, and by the problems confronted in developing suitable
curricula. These deficiencies could not be remedied in the space of four or
five years. It was not simply a question of money flows; even a new, well-
planned and well-phased and executed education program needs time to show
lasting qualitative improvements and this assumes, in the first place, that
the appropriate human resources are in place at the right time.
2.10     The 1974-77 Education Plan considers all these issues in a perspec-
tive  framework of three quadrennial  plans  (1974-85).   Unfortunately,  it is
concerned only with the formal system of the Ministry of Education.  The first
phase sets out reform programs in detail and proposes what was expected to be
gradual phasing of programs for restructuring and reorganization, for parallel
development of curricula, review of teacher education, preparation of new
learning materials, provision of new facilities including a program of 30
technicims and training of administrators and planners both for the central
ministry and the wilaya education authorities.   The unequal distribution of
educational opportunity is attacked; priority is given to assuring a broader
base of skills at the middle-level of education (grades 7-9) and diversifica-
tion of the upper secondary level to incorporate the technician or vocational
school concept (grades 10-11/12).
2.11     The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MTAS), responsible in the
1970's for vocational training at Level 3, programned for the establishment of
some 20 additional centers with a capacity of 400 each in the Plan period to
expand  their network.   Between  1976 and  1980,  23 centers were established
making a total of 74 in 1980 with an enrollment of 28,500 trainees.
D. Project Genesis and Definition
2.12     The 1974/75 Bank Reconnaissance-in-Depth mission indicated support of
the technicum concept in the context of the reform and reorganization of
middle and secondary education as a whole, and of vocational training facili-
ties. The project was subsequently defined on these lines by two reconnais-
sance missions and a preparation mission in June/July 1976 which assisted the
Algerian authorities in preparing the project. In this period, the details of
the project content were debated at some length. The appraisal mission even-
tually arrived at agreement with the Government for financing of 15 technicu
(as against the 30 requested by the Government) and two vocational training
centers.



- 8 -
2.13     As defined in the Loan Agreement,  the project, at a total cost of
US$111.9 million with a Bank Loan of US$48.5 million comprised:
(a) Architectural designs, construction, furnishing and equipping of;
(i) 15 technicums of MEPS for a total capacity of 16,200 with
boarding for 6,000 and
(ii) 2 MTAS vocational training centers with a total capacity of 800
and boarding for 480.
(b) Technical aGsistance (21 man-months).
2.14     Most pertinent to the successful achievement of the project objec-
tives, and in support of the educational reform as a whole, was the covenant
in the Loan Agreement requiring (a) timely preparation of an action training
program for technicum personnel, and (b) the development of the detailed
syllabi of proposed new technicum courses.
2.15     The Objectives.  There was a close link between project content and
the manpower demands. It was considered by the Bank and the Government that
the estimated 9,000 graduates of the 15 project technicums and the 15 to be
financed solely by the Government, would help meet the urgent needs for
middle-level technicians  in the industrialized areas of the country.  The
progrAms offered would include mechanics, electricity and electronics,
construction trades, industrial chemistry and commercial studies. The voca-
tional training centers would train craftsmen for some 15 industrial and
construction trades.  The technical assistance was  intended to improve the
local capability in administration, organization and operation of technicums,
for a study of the location of new technicums, and for a feasibility study of
prefabrication techniques in school construction.
E. Agreed Modifications to the Agreed Project
2.16     For a number of reasons (see paras. 3.12-3.22), implementation of the
project was so delayed that, after 1980, discussions took place between the
Government and the Bank which led ultimately to major reductions in the scope
of the project. As a result of misprocurement on a construction award, the
financing of the construction of eight technicums had been cancelled and the
loan amount reduced to US$35.76 million.   At this point,  seven technicums
remained in the project to be constructed and equipped under loan financing.
At the same time,  the Closing Date was changed from December 31,  1980 to
December 3;, 1983. In November 1983 after the failure of project authorities,
after 15 months, to evaluate the bids for construction of the remaining seven
technicums, it was agreed to delete these seven technicums for which construc-
tion, equipment and furniture were to have been financed by the loan.
Equipment for eight technicums was retained as feasible.  The equipment for
the vocational training centers was deleted when it became evident that
contracts could not be signed before December 31, 1983.  Thus, the project in
its final scope with a loan amount of US$13.7 million comprised;

Part A;    The design, furnishing and equipping of 8 technicums;
Part B:    The design and construction of two vocational training centers;
and
Parts C,   Technical assistance for training of staff and studies for
D,E.       technicum  location planning and prefabrication  techniques  in
school construction.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Educational Aspects
3.01     While the project institutions are not yet operational,  the Govern-
ment was able to expedite the implementation of the network of technicums by
employing a turnkey approach for the establishment of some schools and else-
where more rapid construction approaches (prefabrication).   In general, local
bidding conducted by the Wilaya met with few of the delays experienced in
ICB. As a result, some 17 technicums were operational in the 1983/84 school
year. At the same time, detailed specifications for equipment had been
developed on the basis of curricula for the key specializations.  The project
has contributed to the progressive extension of the technicum program in
significant ways despite the curtailing of the planned investment in construc-
tion and equipment (paras. 3.14 and 3.15).  Early advice on norms and stan-
dards  for  school  construction  have  borne  fruit  (para.  3.07):   these  are
generally  followed  in  the  government-financed  schools.   Tender  documents
employed by the VMEST were developed jointly by Bank and Project Unit staff.
The Bank also provided extensive advice in the early part of the project on
the choice of equipment and on workshop design and organization for the tech-
nical component of the technicum's program.  The Bank, together with the  MNDP,
encouraged and assisted the successful programs for training; (a) headmasters
and workshop directors from 15 technicums especially important given the need
to coordinate academic and technical programs; and (b) 144 technical subject
teachers (para.  3.09).   The latter will help reduce  the number of foreign
teachers in this area (para. 3.08). Similar approaches were employed in the
area of vocational training after the establishment of the Secretariate of
State (later Ministry) for Vocational Training in 1981.  Some 184 vocational
centers  in  the  country-wide  network  were  forecast  to  be  operational  by
December 31, 1984. With regard to the network of vocational training centers,
the Bank provided extensive technical assistance to the ministry's newly
formed directorates in the planning and management of vocational training
under the fifth project (Loan 1803-AL) at the request of the Minister.
Technicum Program
3.02     Specifically,  the Government secondary technical education program,
of which the technicums form a part, made considerable progress between 1977
and 1983. Total enrollment rose from 11,410 to 29,312, which included 1,468
technicum students in 1977 and 11,609 in 17 technicums in 1983.  By 1985, it
is estimated that technicums will have a total earollment of about 30,000
(Annex 4).
3.03     It was expected at appraisal that about 95% of technicum graduates
would enter the labor force directly to meet the urgent national need for
middle level technicians.  However, since 1979, increasing numbers of techni-
cum students have been entering higher technical institutes.  Thus, the pro-
gram may fail to address the growing need for middle level technicians in
industry (estimated at 49,000 over the five-year period from 1980-84),l/ which
the technicum program was primarily designed to meet.

World Bank, June 1982.



- 11 -
3.04     Technicum administrators and teachers indicated that the majority of
their output had been accepted into post-secondary technical institutions, and
that the remainder had had no difficulty in finding jobs. Total output from
technicuma is so far relatively small (about 1,500 in 1984), but a system of
tracer studies of graduates, as foreseen in the Loan Agreement, has not yet
been developed. A tracer system would be a valuable aid to future technicum
policy planning.
3.05     Location of Technicums.  It was agreed that a study would be carried
out with technical assistance financed by the loan to determine the appropri-
ate location of future technicuas, and that a school map would be prepared.
The first phase of the study ("Guide methodologique: projet de carte scolaire
de l'enseignement secondaire technique" Alger, Dgcembre 1978) was completed in
October 1979. A full mapping study has not been undertaken because the loca-
tion of new technicums has now become the decentralized responsibility of the
local wilaya administration. Eligibility of each locality for a new technicum
is now determined by agreement between Central and wilaya authorities.
3.06     Decentralization  of  construction  supervision  responsibility  has
placed added pressure on limited local technical resources of staff and exper-
tise. Ways to eliminate consequent delays in project implementation should be
explored, including opportunities for local officials to receive training and
guidance in appropriate planning and management techniques.
3.07     Prefabrication  Feasibility  Study.   The  VMEST  (previously  SEEST)
entrusted this study to the National Agency for Prefabrication (ONEP) when the
study of prefabrication, which was intended to be financed by the loan, was
replaced by a technical study of construction performance standards which both
the standard and prefabricated construction programs would be expected to
address. FurthermDre, the Bank agreed in 1980 that the practical manual of
the construction of educational buildings, prepared by the VMEST with assis-
tance from INPED and ETAU (respectively, government consulting and architec-
tural firms) satisfied the project requirement for this study. The resulting
documents 1/ are a useful guide for the design of technicum facilities. Their
specifications generally correspond to those included in project working
papers prepared at the time of appraisal, which therefore appear to have been
useful for the general program.
3.08     Technicum Teacher  Training.  The  technicum  program  experiences  a
serious shortage of trained Algerian teachers and instructors.   In 1983, an
estimated 40% of secondary  technical  teachers  were  foreign.   The  primary
source of new teachers should be the ENSEP program at Oran, assisted under
Education IV Loan 1595-AL to achieve a target output of 250 technical teachers
per annum. The low actual output (estimated at 93 in 1985, many of whom will
probably not enter the technicum program) has led to introduction of a program
of teacher training at four existing technicums with a 1983/84 first year
enrollment of 228. Three new technicums are also under consideration to be
JI "Programme Pedagogique de Construction de Technicums," SEEST,
October  1982,   and  "Technicums:  Nomenclature   des  Locaux  et   Noms
Fonctionels," SEEST (undated 1980/82)



- 12 -
upgraded as staff training institutes.  There will be shortages of technicum
teachers in technical subjects for the foreseeable future.  The quality of
teachers, however, is the single most critical factor for the future success
of the technicum program.
3.09     Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance agreements were concluded
with the Belgian Government and with the International Labor Organization
(ILO) in June 1983.  The agreements provide for 144 technical  teachers to
receive three months of practical training in Belgium and for 15 technicum
directors and 15 workshop supervisors to be trained at the ILO international
training center in Turin.  Subsistence expenses in Belgium are met by the
Belgian Government, with cost-sharing (UNDP) for the ILO component. Training
of instructors, supported by Bank financing (US$0.3 million), continues
through mid-1985 with funds earmarked in the Fifth Project (Loan 1803-AL).
3.10     The programs which have been developed are appropriate to the train-
ing requirements identified.  The training in Turin and the first phase of
training in Belgium have now been completed. Initial indications are that the
program was successful.
3.11     Vocational Training Centers (CFPs).  Construction of two CFPs assis-
ted by the project will be completed in December 1984.  These centers form
part of an extensive development program directed to the training of "level-3"
skilled workers (para. 2.05). Existing centers visited by the mission showed
well-planned use of facilities, reasonably adequate availability of consumable
training materials, and a good standard of equipment. The CFPs have adequate
curricula. A severe shortage of instructors in 1982 led to the introduction
of a program to train 3,300 instructors in one- to two-year programs by 1985.
As a result of this excellent initiative, 1,200 had been trained by June 1984,
with a further 700 expected by October 1984.  The program is proceeding on
schedule, and is receiving Bank assistance under Education IV (Loan 1595-AL)
for establishment of an institute for Vocational Instructor Training at Annaba.
B. Physical Aspects and Procurement
3.12     Sites,   Design  and  Construction.    The  Project,   as  originally
appraised, included the construction of 15 technicums and two CFPs. Technicum
civil works, however, were deleted from loan financing because of persistent
procurement problems.  The CFPs and four of the revised project technicums
were visited  and were under construction  in May  1984.   Three non-project
technicums and two nonr-project CFPs were also visited. All 15 of the original
technicums are expected to be operational in mid-1985.
3.13     The Technicums.  Three government agencies were successively account-
able for the implementation of the technicums: the Ministry of Primary and
Secondary Education (MEPS) until February 1981; and thereafter, the Secre-
tariat of State for Secondary and Technical Education (SEEST), and since
January 1984, the Vice-Ministry of Secondary and Technical Education (VMEST).
3.14     A problem first developed when the MEPS, having received only two
bids for eight of the fifteen technicums in November 1978, proposed an exten-
sion to the bidding period to which the Bank objected.  MEPS rejected all
bids, and declared the bidding aborted ("infructueux"). The Bank objected to



- 13 -
rejection of the two bids, antd, no agreement having been reached on an award,
the Bank declared misprocurement and the Government agreed in February 1981 to
cancel the amount of the loan corresponding to the civil works for eight
technicums (US$12.74 million).
3.15     SEEST launched a second ICB bid, advertised in the Development Forum
in August 1981, for civil works for the remaining seven technicums and aimed
at soliciting design-construction bid packages.   Nine bids were  opened  in
February 1982. However, further delays were incurred due to changes in struc-
ture and staffing of SEEST, and responsibility for the evaluation of the bids
was re-assigned from the Office of Architecture and Town Planning (ETAU) to
the National Prefabrication Agency (ONEP). By May 1983, 15 months after the
opening of the bids, this over-committed agency had still not produced a bid
evaluation report. It was agreed that the Loan would again be reduced by an
amount corresponding to the civil works for these remaining seven technicums
(US09.5 million). The Government consequently assumed full financing for the
civil works of the fifteen technicums.
3.16     The Vocational Training Centers.  The construction of the two CFPs
was to have been completed in February 1979. However, for various procedural
reasons described below, construction did not start until early 1982.  The
first disbursement requests were received in the last quarter of 1983.
3.17     Responoibility  for  the  CFP  program  rested  successively  with  the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MTAS), the Secretariat of State for
Vocational Training (SEFP) and finally with the Ministry of Vocational
Training and Labor (MFPT). Prototype architectural drawings were revised to
take into account suggestions by the Bank to improve circulation, simplify
details,  and  optimize  site  utilization.   These  prototype  drawings  were
approved by the Bank in December 1977. Architectural design and construction
supervision were assigned successively to SEFP, to the Directorate of
Construction and Planning of NEPS, to DNC-ANP (National Army Cooperative),
then, at the end of 1978, to the technical section of XFPT. Soil studies were
received by the Bank in July 1980, and final drawings early in 1980.  This
two-year delay was due to the inability of DNC to meet its timetable, and due
also to the need to reassign design responsibility to the technical section of
MFPT. Construction supervision was then transferred to the Ministry of Public
Works (MTP-DUCH) local representative, and early in 1984, for one of the CFPs,
to the local MEPS representative.
3.18     aite selection met Bank approval,  but procurement  of civil works
became an issue as early ae one month after the Loan became effective. The
Government sought to exempt CFP civil works from ICB procedures so as to deal
with the procurement of all 74 CFPs in their program without exception through
negotiations.  NFPT subsequently agreed to follow ICB procedures,  the ICB
notice was published in the Development Forum in July 1981, and awards were
made to the lowest bidders, both private sector contractors.   Construction
started on one of the two CFP sites in April 1982, but, because of extended
negotiations and delays in contract approval by a state financial control
agency, work did not start on the other, more remote site, until late 1983.
Construction was 70Z completed at Zemmouri in May 1984, but workmanship was
mediocre, and detailing where masonry met prefabricated metal panels was



- 14 -
unsatisfactory.  At the other site, Ain Ouessera,  foundations were completed
and 80% of the steel frames and wall panels prefabricated :n France were
delivered. It is estimated that the two CFPs would be ready to receive equip-
ment and furniture late in 1984, six years after the appraisal estimate.
3.19     The Project faced three types of problems  in the course  of civil
works  implementation.   The first was the  fragmentation of component manage-
ment, due to decentralization.  The second was difficulties with procurement
procedures. The third was the quality of construction.  The Government is now
giving a high priority to cost and quality control, as well as to the develop-
ment of efficient building systems and the improvement in performance of the
fast  growing  construction  industry:   hopefully,  this  industry  will  rapidly
become strong enough to respond fully to the challenge of competitive bidding.
3.20     Equipment and Furniture.   The Loan was intended to finance all the
eqtiipment and furniture for two CFPs and 15 technicums.  However, only equip-
ment for eight technicums was financed, as explained below.
V.21     Technicums.  Bid evaluation reports for equipping 8 technicums were
prepared in January 1982, but contracts were not signed until late 1983;
equipment for commercial, refrigeration and atitomation training could not be
?urchased because acceptable bids were not received  in time.   Four of the
eigh.  sites were visited in May 1984.  Some are substantially completed and
all are expected to) be fully operati. nal in mid-1985.  Over 90% of the equip-
ment has been delivered.  Furniture for Lhe technicums is fabricated locally
and financed by the Government.
,.22     CFPs.   Responsibility  for  the  procurement  of  CFP  equipment  was
assigned  to Vocational Training Department  of the MTAS  in M-y  1977,  with
dieliverv scheduled for February 1979.  Lists were filed in the Bank in May
1978, but were not specific to CFPs financed by the Loan.  These preliminary
Lists were set aside by the SEFP when it assumed responsibility for the proj-
ect in 1980. New lists for the specializations finally determined for the two
centers were not available until late 1983 when it became apparent that the
equipment could not be procured within a reasonable timeframe.  Contracts had
not beeni signed by December 31, 1983.  It was consequently agreed in December
1983 by the Uovernment and the Bank that CFP equipment should be cancelled
from tre Loan and financed by the Government.  Procurement of this equipment
was underway in the Spring of 1984.
3.23     The  centrally-managed  procurement  of  equipment  has presented  less
com-plex problems than those of civil works.  By  .ts very nature it is more
adapt.able to ICB.  An area which needs improvement is the coordination _. the
equipment implementation calendar with the other project activities, parti-
cularly civil works and teacher training: there is an urgent need to train
managers, both at central and wilaya levels, in setting-up and monitoring
comprehensive operational calendars, such as critical path analysis networks.
C. Bark and Borrower Performance
3.24     Performance by the Bank.  The pre-appraisal missions appear to have
played a constructive role in requiring the national agencies to define the
project  and  the objectives more  clearly,  and  to consider the relationship
between  objectives,  content,  equipment  and  teacher  education  requirements.
Moreover, there appears to have been a significant input by tIese missions in



- 15 -
the determination of norms and standards which have been utilized throughout
the Government's larger program for constructing and equipping  the tech:i-
cums.  Supervision missions were frequent (see Basic Data Sheet)--18 over the
seven years--and  for  the most  part  appropriately  staffed.   Bank missions
provided extensive technical assistance including preparation of equipment
tender documents.   The Bank also proposed financing implementation advisers
under the UNESCO funds-in-trust program or financing a team of architects,
civil engineers and procurement spi!cialists to provide assistance.   Project
technical  staff was supportive of the  latter offer,  but  could  not  obtain
authorization from senior ministry officials to follow-up on this approach.
The Bank's tasks in supervision was made very difficult  in that it had to
brief in depth, each successive group of senior officials and project manage-
ment staff; three ministerial and four project teams in secondarv edtucation
and, respectively, three and two in vocational training.
3.25     Performance  by  the  Borrower.   Frequent  changes  in  ministerial
responsibility (chree in the case of the technicums, two in that of the voca-
tional training centers), reallocation of responsibilities from central to
local authorities, and turnover of implementation agencies, and procurement
difficulties (paras. 3.13, 3.16 and 3.19) were an obstacle to the timely
progress of implementation and resulted in delays on loan disbursement.  The
Borrower, however, is now implementing the technicums (15) deleted from the
Loan, applying project appraisal norms and standards.  If there had not been
so manv manage.ient changes, greater efforts could have been made to train
local administrators in technicum implementation and in coordinated planning,
such as critical path network (para. 3.23); continue with a study of planning
of locations of technicums (para. 3.05); develop a system of prefabricated
school construction (para. 3.07); meet the needs for technicum teachers (para.
3.08); control adequately critical procurement procedures (para. 3.14); and
assign tasks only to agencies which are able to meet agreed timetables (paras.
3.15, 3.17).  These shortcomings, which were not addressed during the period
of decentralization because of more pressing problems such as relocating and
housing government officials and establishing wilaya level directorates for
all ministries, are now well identified and supported by the technical minis-
tries.  The initiative taken by MFPT and VMEST in staff training is parti-
cularly noteworthy. The Government is now firmly implementing its comprehen-
sive technicum and vocational training programs, and considerable progress has
already been made.
D. Project Cost, Financing and Loan Disbursements
3.26     Capital Costs.  At the time of the completion mission in May 1984,
notwithstanding a 72% reduction in the Loan (para. 2.16), it was expected that
all the components of the original project would be completed eventually (most
without Bank financing), with all projected civil works, equipment and
technical assistance either under contract, or in the bidding process.  Some
components of the project, however, are not expected to be completed until
1985, five years after the original completion date.  No project institutions
were completed at the rime of the completion mission, and reliable cost
projections for components not financed by the Loan were not available.  The
mission esti- mated the cost of the completed project, as reflected by the
revised Loan Agreement, to be US$22.5 million, as compared with the appraisal
estimate of USt111.89 million, but the original project is Leing implemented
in its entirety at an estimated cost of US$151.2 million (Annexes 5A & 5B).
At this stage of implementation, it is not possible to determine unit costs.



- 16 -
3.27     Project Financing.  The Loan, at the  time  of appraisal,  was  to
finance 43Z of the project cost (US$48.5 million), and the Government 57%
(equivalent  to US$63.4  million).   The  loan  amount was reduced  twice:  in
September 1981 to US$35.8 million, and in December 1983 to US$13.7 million
(para. 2.16). As of June 30, 1984, 37% of the Loan had been disbursed. UNDP
and the Belgian Government are participating on a cost-sharing basis to meet
training and subsistence expenses (para. 3.09).

3.28     Loan Disbursement.  The disbursement rate  of the  Loan remained  a
major problem until the end of 1983 when only 0.08X  of the Loan (US$0.11
million) had been disbursed.  On August 21, 1984, US$5.05 million was dis-
bursed from the loan amount, although 90% of US$10.0 million worth of equip-
ment had  already  been delivered  (para. 3.21).  Reasons for the  delay  in
disbursement were the late start of procurement for civil works (para. 3.12)
and equipment (para. 3.20) and the slow submission of disbursement requests.
The percentage of expenditures financed by the Loan were 31% for civil works,
100% for the foreign and 44% for locally procured equipment, as per the ori-
ginal Loan Agreement, and 100% for technical assistance (originally 80%). The
Loan was closed on December 31, 1983 and the balance of about USt8.6 million
is expected to be cancelled.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
4.01   (i)    The project experienced frequent and unforeseen changes in the
management,   transfer  of  responsibilities   from  central  to
regional staff and from one agency to another which resulted
inevitably in implementation delays and the need for repeated
briefings by Bank staff to the new agencies on the provisions in
the Loan Agreement and on Bank procedures. Government agencies,
either because of unfamiliarity with Bank requirements or
unwillingness to accept such requirements (particularly with
ample Government funding available), persisted in procurement
practices which forced the Bank to declare misprocurement on
sizeable contracts and corresponding cancellation of US$43.5
million  of  the  Loan.   However,  the  Government  decided  to
complete all the original project components using their own
funds and at their own pace. Therefore, all 15 of the original
technicums as well as the two vocational training centers will
be operational in mid-1985.
(ii)    When a project is to be a small part of a larger program, the
Bank should examine carefully the procedures to be utilized in
executing the larger program, identifying clearly where such
procedures would have Lo be modified to be consistent with Bank
practices, and ensure that relevant government authorities are
aware of such differences and are agreeable to modify the proce-
dures to conform to the Bank's requirements.
(iii)    It was not possible to foresee the repeated changes during the
project period in the agencies to whom responsibility for proj-
ect components was assigned. Precautions that the Bank should
take to protect itself from future similar situations are diffi-
cult to identity. Perhaps greater caution is warranted in an
environment in which the education system is burgeoning and
taking new directions, as was the case in Algeria at the time of
appraisal, and in such circumstances, a smaller loan with fewer
components would be prudent until the educational scene is
assuredly more stable.  A counterriding force in such circumr
stances can be expected to be considerable government pressure
for a larger project.  In this case,  the Government requested
the preparation mission to agree to include in the project the
entire technicum program, which consisted of 30 technicums at
the time, which the mission reduced to 15 technicums.
(iv)    The technical assistance program for the training of technical
teachers, technicum directors and workshop supervisors has
proven to be extremely successful.
(v)    The comprehensive guide for the design of technicum facilities
which resulted from the project prefabrication feasibility study
appears to have a very useful project output.
