REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, for the equivalent
of US$48.5 million to help finance a third education project. The loan
would have a term of 17 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with interest
at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Updating economic missions visited Algeria in April and November
1976 and a report entitled "Memorandum on the Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Algeria" (1315-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on February 10, 1977. The mission's main findings are reflected in the
following paragraphs. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        In 1966, Algeria's Revolutionary Council defined the fundamental
objectives which the country intended to pursue during the period ending
1980. These are: (i) to expand and organize the production base, enabling
the economy to reach, by about 1980, a stage of self-sustained growth with
full employment; (ii) to achieve economic independence, which implies that
the country would rely first on its own resources for development, although
international economic relations would be expanded and diversified; and
(iii) to improve income distribution, particularly among regions. These
objectives, and the strategy which has evolved towards their implementation,
take into account the country's physical and socio-economic potential; the
country's leadership is deeply committed to them.
4.        To attain the objectives defined in 1966, Algeria has adopted a
long-term strategy with four main aspects. The first is industrialization,
which is viewed as the principal means of achieving the long-term growth
and employment objectives, since the scope for expanding agriculture rapidly
is limited by physical constraints. Several essential functions are assigned
to industry in this perspective: to produce and process natural resources,
particularly the sizeable reserves of hydrocarbons (oil and gas), for export
to earn foreign exchange; to produce modern equipment for use in all economic
sectors; and to manufacture essential consumer goods required to raise the
living standards of the population. The second aspect of Algeria's long-term
strategy is the introduction of structural institutional changes to keep the
economy in Algerian hands, as a means of imparting dynamism to investment
and production. The main structural reforms are the application of central
planning to the economy as a whole, the expansion of the role of public
enterprises in industry and services, the Agrarian Revolution involving land

- 2 -
and livestock redistribution to poor farmers and the introduction of coopera-
tive management in agriculture, decentralization in favor of local govern-
ments, and the participation of workers in the management of state enterprises.
The third element of Algeria's long-term strategy is the acceleration of train-
ing and education to meet the skilled manpower needs of the economy, improve
employment opportunities, and develop an authentic Algerian culture. The
fourth and final element of Algeria's strategy is austerity in consumption,
to generate national savings for investment and avoid excessive recourse to
external sources.
5.        In the seven years, 1967-73, which constituted the first phase of
implementing the development strategy, structural reforms and investment were
vigorously pursued. The Government acquired nearly complete control of eco-
nomic activity through the systematic nationalization of foreign assets, in-
cluding those of foreign oil companies, and through the creation and expansion
of public enterprises. Total fixed investment increased from 15 percent of
GDP in 1966 to over 40 percent in 1973. Public sector investment rose from
9 percent to 35 percent of GDP with more than half going to industry. In
agriculture, farms left vacant by departing foreigners in 1962 (about 2 mil-
lion hectares) have been managed by their workers under central planning and
control, and since 1971 the private agricultural sector (about 5 million
hectares of cultivated land and 20 million hectares of steppe pasture) has
been progressively brought under the provisions of the Agrarian Revolution.
Education and training were rapidly expanded and improved. The school popula-
tion rose from 1.5 million in 1966/67 to 3.0 million in 1974/75 while the
education and training systems were progressively modified to improve their
efficiency, their relevance to economic needs and their accessibility to the
largest number of Algerian children and workers.
6.        At the same time Algeria's strategy has yielded some less satis-
factory results. First, the real growth of output was below target (about 6
percent per year as against a target of 9 percent) in the 1970-73 period,
mainly because of delays in implementing many projects or in bringing their
output to design capacity, and due to poor agricultural performance. Second,
the sectoral imbalance in investment caused bottlenecks in lagging sectors
such as construction, transportation, communications and housing. Third,
while the unemployment rate in non-agricultural sectors declined from 27 per-
cent in 1966 to 15 percent in 1973, the number of emigrated workers increased
to about 440,000 in 1973, when emigration was officially stopped. In agricul-
ture, slow output growth was accompanied by an increase in underemployment.
About 9 percent of the agricultural labor force was officially considered to
be seriously underemployed in 1973, compared with 4 percent in 1966. Thus,
in 1973, providing jobs for unskilled labor continued to be a worrisome prob-
lem, while the shortage of skilled and experienced nationals was a primary
restraint on investment and efficient management. Fourth, due to sharp dif-
ferences in sectoral and regional development, disparities in income levels
and living standards have persisted; for instance, in 1973, per capita con-
sumption was estimated at $130 on average in rural areas compared to $450 in
urban areas. The impact of these differences is, however, smaller than in
most other developing countries at Algeria's level of development due to the
strong income and price controls and substantial free social services.

7.        The increase in oil prices during the last quarter of 1973 boosted
Algeria's receipts from its main export product, crude oil. Despite produc-
tion difficulties in the last four months of 1974 which caused declines in
the quantities of crude oil output and exports, receipts from hydrocarbon
exports rose from $1.7 billion in 1973 to $4.3 billion in 1974. The addi-
tional $2.6 billion ($190 per capita) which Algeria derived from hydrocarbons
in 1974 greatly improved the balance of payments. Despite the rise in the
import bill due to sharp increases in import requirements (24 percent) and
prices (33 percent), Algeria was able to repay in advance a part of the com-
mercial bank loans it had contracted in 1972 and 1973, and to increase its
foreign exchange reserves further to $1.3 billion at the end of the year (or
3.5 months of 1974 imports). There was a corresponding improvement in the
domestic financial situation, particularly in the position of the Treasury,
which captures most oil revenues. The impact of import price rises and do-
mestic demand pressures was felt only partly in prices to the consumers, as
the Government stepped up sharply consumer price subsidies. The consumer
price index rose only 6.5 percent in 1974. Despite the recovery of agricul-
tural production from the low level of 1973, the financial improvement was
accompanied by slow GDP growth in 1974 due to the decline experienced in crude
oil output and little additional output from industrial projects. GDP growth
is estimated to have been around 4 percent in real terms, and 51 percent in
current prices essentially because of the oil price increase. Excluding hydro-
carbons, these rates are estimated at 7 percent and 18 percent respectively.
Private consumption growth was satisfactory but restrained (about 6 percent
in real terms). National savings rose sharply to 49 percent of GDP, from 37
percent in 1973, and exceeded gross fixed investment.
8.        The improvement in Algeria's financial situation and prospects led
the Revolutionary Council to envisage an acceleration of the pace of economic
development and structural reform during the second Four-Year Plan (1974-77),
which was introduced in June 1974. On the basis of the physical implementa-
tion capacity likely to be available, the Plan estimated that total investment
should reach at least DA 85 billion ($20.4 billion) in 1973 prices during the
1974-77 period, and thus be about 2.3 times larger than during the 1970-73
Plan. The Plan also specified a higher (maximum) investment target of DA 110
billion ($26.4 billion), with supplementary projects to be undertaken if imple-
mentation capacity could be raised above the estimated minimum level. The share
of industry and hydrocarbons in total investment was expected in the Plan
to decline to 44 percent in 1974-77, from 54 percent in 1970-73, while the
relative importance of other sectors was to increase. Based on the expected
outputs from sectoral investment programs, the Plan fixed a minimum (10.0
percent a year) and a maximum (12.5 percent a year) GDP growth target. The
projected growth of investment and output would, according to the Plan, create
enough new jobs to improve the employment situation substantially. The Plan
estimated that the unemployment rate in non-agricultural sectors would decline
to around 4 percent in 1977, while there would be a marked reduction of
underemployment in agriculture.
9.        The Plan also provided for an acceleration of consumption growth
and a reduction of regional disparities. It estimated that private consump-
tion should rise by 11.3 percent a year over 1974-77, compared to a growth



- 4 -
rate not much higher than that of population (3.3 percent) in 1970-73. On a
per capita basis, the growth rate of private consumption would be higher in
rural areas (9.6 percent a year) than in urban areas (5.5 percent a year) as a
result of increases in expenditures on rural development and social services.
W4hile the Plan projected import requirements to rise at constant prices by 21
percent a year in response to the rapidly rising demand for investment and
consumption, it expected export receipts to be large enough to leave a small
surplus on goods and non-factor services for the 1974-77 period as a whole.
Thus, the Plan did not anticipate any foreign exchange constraint, nor any
difficulties in domestic financing. However, it did foresee that the resource
balance would deteriorate after 1974 and turn into deficit by 1977.
10.       From the viewpoint of physical implementation capacity, the Plan's
minimum target for investment appeared to be within reach. The orientation
of the investment strategy in favor of lagging sectors and regions was highly
desirable. The estimate of implementation capacity on which the Plan's
investment target was based implied however that short-cuts would continue to
be taken in the preparation of many projects with adverse consequences for
implementing and bringing them to planned output. In part for this reason,
but also because of the high proportion of projects with long gestation
periods in the investment program (e.g. hydrocarbon production, petrochemicals,
and heavy metal, mechanical and electrical industries), the delay between
investment and the accrual of benefits was expected to lengthen temporarily.
Indeed, the Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) implied by the Plan's
minimum projections of investment and output tended towards 5.0 by the end of
the Plan period compared to less than 4.0 on average in the 1967-73 period.
Further, while the employment situation will probably improve substantially
between 1973 and 1977, the investment cost per additional job is fairly high.
On the basis of Plan estimates in 1973 prices, it was estimated at about
$38,000 in the non-agricultural sectors, and around $25,000 in agriculture.
At the same time, and in spite of the large planned effort to further accele-
rate education and training, the supply of skilled nationals was expected to
continue to be significantly short of projected needs at the high, and espe-
cially at the middle-level of qualification. The Government has been taking
a number of measures to alleviate the problems created by this situation,
including the introduction of improved financial and other procedures to bring
about better operational results on the part of enterprises, and the extensive
use of international cooperation to help in project implementation and carry
out extensive on-the-job training of nationals. It expects that the manage-
ment of assets will improve progressively after the current Plan period when
the supply of skilled nationals is expected to catch up with needs and the
beneficial effects of organizational improvements are increasingly felt.
11.       An unusually wide margin of uncertainty surrounded the prospects
for hydrocarbon export receipts which were to finance most of Algeria's import
requirements during the 1974-77 Plan period.   This uncertainty concerned the
strength of external demand for crude oil and natural gas, the policies that
Algeria and other OPEC countries would follow concerning the volume and prices
of oil production, and the technical problems encountered in oil production
and large-scale gas liquefaction for export.   W4hereas the 1974-77 Plan expected



- 5 -
that during the Plan period Algeria's crude output would rise by 4.7 percent
per year and the purchasing power of Algerian crude on international markets
would remain at the level reached at the end of 1973, these crucial assump-
tions have not been borne out by developments in 1974 and 1975. Due to
technical and economic factors, crude oil output declined to an annual rate
of 44 million tons in 1975 from 50 in 1973, and the realized price of crude
exports also declined from an average $13 per barrel in early 1974 to less
than $12 in 1975. Receipts from hydrocarbon exports declined to $4.0 billion
in 1975, from $4.3 billion in 1974. While the growth of hydrocarbon export
receipts has resumed in 1976 (about $5.0 billion) and should continue in
subsequent years, particularly with the new exports of natural gas and gas
condensate, such growth is likely to be significantly less rapid than
anticipated in the 1974-77 Plan.
12.       Meanwhile, in 1975, Algeria implemented the ambitious investment
strategy of the Plan, causing a rapid increase in import requirements, and
the appearance of sizeable external borrowing requirements. The current
account of the balance of payments, which experienced a surplus of about
$590 million in 1974, showed a deficit estimated at $1,780 million in 1975.
To finance this deficit and keep reserves at an appropriate level, Algeria
borrowed on a commitment basis nearly $3.3 billion from external, sources in
1975.
13.       The investment effort that Algeria can undertake depends mainly
on the level of hydrocarbon export receipts--the country's main source of
savings. It also depends more importantly on the efficiency of domestic
production for import substitution and exports, and on continuing austerity
in consumption policies. In the light of such factors the Government put
into effect in 1976 an investment stabilization program to bring the econ-
omy back into real and financial balance. As a result, investment growth
decelerated markedly during the year. Further, the Government decided that
the composition of investment should favor sectors other than industry, with a
view to relieving the bottlenecks that continued to hamper efficiency in 1974
and 1975, especially in housing, urban public services, transportation and
agriculture. Consequently, investments in 1976 moved towards a more balanced
sectoral distribution and this trend is expected to continue in 1977. At the
same time there has been an appreciable acceleration of GDP growth (about 10
percent in real terms) and an increase in hydrocarbon exports, :in both quantity
(13 percent) and prices (6 percent). Together, these factors have reduced in
1976 the resource gap and eased the pressures on the balance of payments that
had developed in the course of 1975. External borrowing requirements decreased
substantially in 1976 and net foreign reserves amounted at the end of the year
to about $1.9 billion, representing more than three months of 1976 imports.
14.       While economic and financial prospects are difficult to forecast
beyond 1977, it seems likely that Algeria will as in 1976 opt for an invest-
ment strategy appropriately related to its financial resources, and continue
to have sizeable but manageable external borrowing requirements until the mid
1980's. A large part of these requirements, especially in the next five to
six years, will be to expand liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity. The



- 6 -
large LNG export projects however are expected to make a substantial contribu-
tion to export receipts after 1980 and progressively reduce the country's ex-
ternal resource gap. The need to roll over previous external borrowings from
commercial sources with relatively short maturities may become substantial by
1980 and keep total borrowing requirements at a relatively high level well
into the 1980's. Algeria recognizes that it will need to maintain the close
relationships it has been establishing with such sources over the past few
years in order to have their full cooperation when roll over needs appear.
15.       Algeria's total external debt, outstanding and disbursed, was $4.5
billion ($9.0 billion including undisbursed), equivalent to 34.5 percent of
GDP, at the end of 1975. Debt service, however, has fallen in relation to the
substantially increased exports of goods and non-factor services, from 14.2
percent in 1973 to 9.3 percent in 1975. Depending on the investment strategy
which Algeria may choose and the level of hydrocarbon export receipts, the
ratio might rise to a level somewhat above 20 percent of exports by the early
1980's. It would follow a gradually declining trend subsequently as the large
gas and petrochemical projects, presently underway or planned, begin to gen-
erate increasing export revenues. Algeria's external borrowing needs will
be large in the next few years, but can be accommodated in view of the con-
siderably enhanced capacity to carry debt which the country has acquired as
a result of the new relationship between the prices of hydrocarbons and other
commodities in world markets, and of the long-term prospects for gas and
petrochemical exports. Algeria is therefore creditworthy for continued Bank
lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ALGERIA
16.       Lending to Algeria resumed in FY1973 and the Bank has since lent
$461.0 million in ten loans for transport, power, education, industry and
rural development. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of
December 31, 1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. While the
physical execution of most projects is progressing well, effectiveness and
disbursements for some loans have been slow.
17.       The Bank's future lending to Algeria can only meet a small part of
its considerable external financial requirements, as mentioned above, though,
in FY1976 it substantially exceeded the relatively low FY1975 level of $48
million (which resulted from delays in project preparation) and reached
$150.5 million. In the present fiscal year proposals for new commitments
are expected to remain equally important as a result of Algeria's increasing
familiarity with Bank procedures and the Bank's increasing understanding of
the Government's economic and social development policies. At the end of 1975
the portion of Algeria's total debt outstanding and disbursed owed to the Bank
was estimated at one percent; this share will rise somewhat over the next
years, but is projected still to be below 5 percent at the end of the decade.



- 7 -
18.       The provision of technical assistance and institution building sup-
port in connection with lending operations is a major objective in the Bank's
strategy in Algeria, to which the Government attaches special importance.
The aim is to assist the Government to relieve bottlenecks in lagging sectors,
such as transportation, education, urban public services, and rural develop-
ment, and to expand the contribution of institutions in these areas to national
development. Bank operations are expected also systematically to be associated
with the introduction of sounder criteria for project preparation, appraisal
and implementation, and to aid Algeria in making more economic use of its
resources. Finally, future lending will aim at reducing sectoral imbalances
in support of the socio-economic transformation of Algeria which the Govern-
ment is undertaking, particularly in the rural areas.
19.       In past years, the level of awareness and understanding of the
Bank's methods of work and objectives varied considerably among government
agencies and the establishment of a program of Bank lending operations proved
a complex task. The recent increase in lending has substantially improved the
dialogue with the Government and is leading to closer cooperation in project
preparation with the executing agencies.
20.       In FY1977, in addition to the project presented in this report, two
projects (ports and highways) are expected to be submitted to the Executive
Directors. In subsequent years, projects are contemplated in education, high-
ways, power, industry, urban public services, and agriculture (including rural
development); those projects will continue to stress objectives going beyond
the mere transfer of resources. As the pipeline of projects is strengthened,
the lending program is expected increasingly to include directly productive
projects and those with a social character.
21.       Most projects to be presented to the Executive Directors are expected
to have one or more technical assistance components. This is also exemplified
in the project proposed in the present report. In addition, special technical
assistance activities have included a joint Bank-IMF mission which visited
Algeria in the spring of 1974 at the request of the Government, to study the
financial planning system. Acting on one of the mission's recommendations, in
late 1974 the Economic Development Institute held a course in Algeria dealing
with various aspects of financial planning at the central government, banking
and project levels. The authorities showed considerable interest in this
course. At their request, the EDI organized two industrial project courses,
with the Government bearing the cost, during 1976, and is now organizing
further courses as well.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
22.       Education in Algeria is at a transition stage with major structural
and curricular reforms under way. The Ministry of Primary and Secondary
Education has responsibility for primary and secondary education; while having
responsibility for post-secondary education, the Ministry of Higher Education



- 8 -
and Scientific Research, for the present, administers only the university
system. Responsibility for training of craftsmen and technicians is vested
in a number of ministries. Among the most important programs are those
administered by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the Ministry
of Industry and Energy.
23.       Education in Algeria fulfills both social and economic objectives
that are crucial to the country's chosen development strategy. The essential
social objective is to provide a common education base for all through nine
years of fundamental education while using an increasingly Algerian teaching
force and employing Arabic as the principal language. The main economic
objective is to provide sufficient technical and vocational training resources
at the secondary and post-secondary levels to satisfy the economy's growing
need for trained manpower particularly for middle-level technicians and
skilled workers. Here the output capacity falls far short of present and
projected manpower requirements. This situation has already been a major
cause of economic inefficiencies and could seriously hamper the Government's
industrialization effort, unless an appropriate expansion of technical and
vocational training is made. Consequently and because of the inadequacies
in existing technical training facilities, reliance will be placed on a new
network of upper secondary, job-oriented technicums, a new type of upper-
secondary middle-level technician training institution which will be supported
under the proposed loan, for provision of the required middle-level techni-
cians, and on vocational training centers for skilled workers.
24.       Under the second Plan (1974-77) and within the following three plan
periods to 1985 the education system is being restructured along lines which
are expected gradually to remove bottlenecks and achieve the above objectives.
The academic orientation of the traditional French model is being corrected in
favor of a more practical scientific and technological orientation to enable
the system to respond more effectively to the demand for trained manpower at
all levels required by industrialization and the rapid growth of the economy.
The average annual demand during the period 1975-85 is expected to be of the
order of some 29,000 middle-level technicians and about 44,000 skilled workers,
which compares with a present annual output capacity of about 16,000 and 20,000
respectively. The structure and content of both fundamental and secondary
education are being modified. At the base, the system will consist of nine
years of "polytechnic education" to provide a balanced common core program
that also aims to bring out special aptitudes of individuals and ensure their
adaptability to further training in various fields; curricula are being broad-
ened to include science and technology. This would be followed at secondary
level either by three-year courses in lycees and technicums or by teacher
training courses. Post-secondary courses are provided in universities, where
expanded enrollments are being reoriented towards engineering and science, and
in institutes of technology, designed to satisfy the needs for specialized
personnel in various technical and engineering fields. Outside the framework
of the formal education system, semi-skilled and skilled workers and craftsmen
for industry and commerce are trained through a network of vocational training
centers.



- 9 -
25.       Education has expanded rapidly since independence, and particularly
in recent years. Primary enrollments have increased at an average annual
rate of over seven percent since 1970 and now cover 76 percent of the 6-11
age group. Over the same period, secondary level enrollments have gone up
at a yearly rate of 16 percent, while annual enrollments at universities and
other post-secondary level institutions have increased at an even higher rate.
In recent years public expenditures on education have been in the neighborhood
of 8-9 percent of GDP with capital expenditures on education absorbing over
20 percent of public capital expenditures. Over the long term, increases in
public expenditures on education are planned to average at least 10 percent
per annum in real terms. This implies education and training spending at
a level of nine percent of projected GDP in 1985. While this percentage
is higher than those found in most other developing countries, it reflects
Algeria's present efforts in education. In the medium-term, barring unfore-
seeable events in the energy sector, it is unlikely that financial stringen-
cies will present a constraint on the implementation of education reform;
managerial and administrative bottlenecks may prove to be more serious
obstacles.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission in May 1976,
and prepared by the Government. It was appraised in June/July 1976. Nego-
tiations took place in Washington in January 1977. The Algerian delegation
was headed by Mr. Rachid Hassam, Director General of the Ministry of Finance.
A report, entitled "Appraisal of a Third Education Project in the Democratic
and Popular Republic of Algeria" (No. 1322-AL, dated February 23, 1977) is
being distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III, a Supplementary Project Data Sheet as Annex IV and a map showing
the locations of the facilities to be established under the project is also
attached. Two Bank-financed education projects have previously been approved
by the Executive Directors, one in FY1973 and one in FY1976 (Loans 913-AL and
1209-AL). The first one aims at expanding and on improving existing techno-
logical institutes; the second one supports a new post-secondary technological
institute of electricity and electronics and provides technical assistance for
the planning, preparation and execution of various education reform measures.
Implementation of the first education project has suffered initial delays but
improved somewhat in the last year. For the second one, implementation has
so far progressed satisfactorily.
Description of the Project
27.       The proposed project would focus on urgent needs for middle-level
technicians and skilled workers by assisting in the development of a network
of technicums, and two vocational training centers. In addition, by support-
ing the systematic decentralization of training opportunities, it would help
to reduce regional inequalities and support local industrial development.
The proposed project would comprise: (a) architectural design, construction,
furniture and equipment for fifteen technicums and two vocational training



- 10 -
centers; and (b) twenty-one man-months of expatriate technical assistance
for: (i) a study of the optimal location of future technicums; (ii) a feasi-
bility study on the use of prefabrication techniques in school construction;
and (iii) training in administration of technicum staff. The proposed project
would assist in alleviating the acute manpower shortages which at present
risk seriously to impair Algeria's planned economic and social development.
Furthermore, the program of technical assistance would improve the efficiency
of the education system; in particular the feasibility study on the use of
prefabrication techniques in school construction would examine the high
construction costs which are pushing up unit costs in education.
Technicums
28.       The technicums which are to be established under the project are
the first fifteen of a planned network of over thirty such schools. They are
designed to meet urgent needs for middle-level technicians in industrialized
areas as well as regions where important industrial and commercial development
is planned. The locations of the proposed technicums as well as the range
of specialities to be offered were decided in close cooperation between the
Ministries of Industry and Energy, Planning and Primary and Secondary Educa-
tion. Following completion of fundamental education, the technicums would
offer three year courses in mechanics, electricity and electronics, building
construction, industrial chemistry, and commerce. Refresher and upgrading
courses would also be offered. The program would include three to four weeks
training to be spent in designated industrial plants and offices. Detailed
curricula and syllabi for all courses (except management skills) have been
prepared in cooperation with various government agencies and local industries
which would eventually employ the graduates; they have been tailored to the
functional content of jobs in Algerian industry. A system of continuous
evaluation with credits would be followed and this will replace the tradi-
tional type of examination. Some 95 percent of the graduates are expected
to enter the labor force; the remaining five percent would be allowed to pro-
ceed to further training in higher education. The Government would transmit
to the Bank for its review the detailed syllabus for the technicum course in
management skills not later than the end of calendar year 1977, and the
detailed syllabi for proposed new courses not later than three months prior
to their adoption. The Government would also transmit to the Bank for its
review, the proposals for eventual deletions of courses not later than three
months prior to such deletion (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.06 (a)). The
Government would exchange information with the Bank on its tracer system for
the technicums, established by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Educa-
tion, in the fields of educational guidance, vocational orientation and career
evaluation, at a time sufficiently in advance of the opening of the technicums
to permit the Bank to make comments thereon (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
29.       The opening of thirty new technicums, ten per year during the period
1979-82, would require a total of about 3,000 teachers in general, technical
and practical (workshop) subjects. The need for general and technical teachers
could be met through timely development of existing sources, but special
arrangements must be made to supply workshop instructors. A realistic teacher



- 11 -
training program together with a timetable for its implementation has been
presented to and agreed upon with the Bank. The Government would take all
necessary measures to develop and implement this teacher training program
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.07).
Vocational Training Centers
30.       Among the most important training courses for skilled and semi-
skilled workers are those at present conducted by the Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs in thirty-six centers located mainly in urban areas. As a
first step toward a major expansion of this network, which is required to meet
urgent needs of the economy for skilled and semi-skilled workers, the project
would finance two centers which would be located in the Algiers and Medea
regions respectively, and would train skilled craftsmen in various special-
izations for some fifteen different industrial and building construction
trades. Each center would have an annual intake of some 250 adult trainees
with a total enrollment of about 400 and an annual output of about 240.
Completion of primary education would be a minimum entry requirement, with
higher standards if required by the nature of the instruction. Courses
would generally be of fifteen to eighteen months' duration. Instructors
would be trained at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs' teacher train-
ing center in Algiers. The existing supply of instructors would meet the
needs of the proposed training centers.
Technical Assistance
31.       About 21 man-months of technical assistance would be provided
under the project, for which expatriate specialists would be recruited whose
qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment would be
satisfactory to the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.03 (a)(ii)). Ten
man-months would be applied to a study of the optimum locations of technicums
yet to be established; while location planning for the first tranche of the
thirty technicums was relatively straight-forward, taking account of existing
and planned industrial projects, rational location of further technicums being
planned will become increasingly complex and require a systematic study of
needs within the framework of national and regional planning. Two experts
would provide a total of six man-months of assistance in (i) training in
administration for technicum directors, and (ii) workshop management for
workshop supervisors. Five man-months of consultant services would be pro-
vided for a technical and financial feasibility study on the use of pre-
fabrication techniques in school construction which not only would have
particular application to the future development of the technicums network,
but also would have general application to other school building programs.
Within six months of the signing of the Loan Agreement, the Government would
transmit to the Bank for review and comments the draft terms of reference,
including detailed study outlines, for the specialists to be employed for the
technicum location study and the technical and feasibility study on the use
of prefabrication techniques (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.03 (b)). These
studies would be completed within eighteen months of the signing of the Loan
Agreement (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04). With respect to the training



- 12 -
in administration for technicum staff, the consultants required would be
employed within eighteen months of the signing of the Loan Agreement (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 3.03 (b)).
Project Implementation
32.       Responsibility for project execution would be entrusted to the
Algerian Government agencies concerned (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.01).
The Directorate of Construction and Equipment of the Ministry of Primary
and Secondary Education is expected to be responsible for implementation of
the technicums and for the study on prefabrication techniques in school
construction. The Directorate of Vocational Training of the Ministry of Labor
and Social Affairs is expected to be responsible for the implementation of the
vocational training centers. The Directorate responsible for planning in the
Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is expected to be responsible for
the study on the optimum location of technicums yet to be established and for
the administrative training for selected technicum staff. The Project Liaison
Officer in the Ministry of Finance for the two previous education projects
would also act as liaison for the project proposed in this report (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02(b)). Project implementation is expected to span a
period of two and one-half years after the signing of the Loan Agreement
(draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 2). An additional year would be required
for the normal guarantee period for civil works, final disbursements and
closing of accounts.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $111.9 million includ-
ing an investment component of $83.3 million for the fifteen technicums and two
vocational training centers, a technical assistance component of $100,000 and
physical and price contingencies of $28.5 million. While unit costs of equip-
ment and furniture are within reasonable norms, construction costs per student
place (which represent about 77 percent of the total cost of a student place
in the proposed project institutions) are rather high. This is neither due
to the space standards adopted, which are economical and in line with similar
Bank-financed projects, nor to the projected utilization rates which are
reasonable, but rather to the inordinately high construction costs in Algeria.
The latter reflect the general conditions of the construction industry in
Algeria, which has affected projects in virtually all sectors. The proposed
Bank loan of $48.5 million would finance the full foreign exchange cost of
the project. The local cost would be financed by the Algerian Government.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       Civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Procurement Guidelines. It is
expected that some two-thirds of the contracts would be awarded to Algerian
firms as the country has a construction industry capable of implementing the
proposed project. Contracts for furniture and equipment would be awarded in
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines on the basis of international
competitive bidding except for: (a) items which can only be grouped in small



- 13 -
packages (under $50,000), (b) items which must be compatible with other
equipment procured under international competitive bidding, and (c) items of
such a specialized nature that international competitive bidding would not be
practicable. These items, which would not exceed an aggregate maximum of $7.0
million (or about 27 percent of total furniture and equipment cost) would be
procured under normal government procurement procedures, which are satisfac-
tory to the Bank. Whenever possible, price quotations from at least three
manufacturers or suppliers would be obtained. Furniture and equipment lists
would be reviewed by the Bank, and items would be grouped so as to permit such
bulk procurement as would be consistent with appropriate technical standards
and as would permit the most economic method of procurement (draft Loan
Agreement, Schedule 4, paragraph 2(a)), and would be submitted to the Bank for
approval before bids are invited (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, paragraph
D, 2(a)). Suppliers will be required in the bidding documents to provide
initial training of key personnel in the use and maintenance of sophisticated
equipment (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, paragraph 2(b)). In the evalua-
tion of bids, local manufacturers of equipment and furniture would be allowed
a margin of preference equal to the existing rate of custom duties applicable
to competing imports or 15 percent of c.i.f. price, whichever is lower.
Nearly all equipment is expected to be obtained from foreign manufacturers,
while some 50 percent of furniture contracts are likely to be awarded to local
manufacturers or suppliers.
35.       Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan would be made against:     (i)
100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment and furniture;
(ii) 44 percent of the total cost of furniture and equipment procured locally;
(iii) 31 percent of the total cost on civil works; (iv) 30 percent of the
total cost of professional services for the design of school buildings and
supervision of construction; (v) 80 percent of the total cost of technical
assistance.
Benefits and Risks
36.       By providing an annual output of some 4,500 middle-leveL techni-
cians and 480 skilled craftsmen, the project would contribute to meeting
urgent manpower needs in the mechanical, electrical, construction and chemical
industries, and in commerce, thus supporting the Government's policy of rapid
industrialization, industrial diversification and technological progress. It
would also support local industrial development through decentralization of
skilled training opportunities and reduce regional inequalities. Furthermore
the proposed project would develop a closer relationship between secondary
level education and industrial and commercial development, in line with
Government policy to reorient the secondary level education toward science
and technology. Finally, it would contribute to improving education planning
and administration through the technical assistance program.
37.       The establishment of the fifteen technicums proposed under the
project will require a large number of workshop instructors who are in scarce
supply in Algeria. However, measures are being taken under the proposed
project to ensure that an adequate teacher training program will be under-
taken (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.07). Because this would be the first



- 14 -
Bank financed project undertaken by the implementing agencies concerned, some
delays in project execution may result from unfamiliarity with Bank procedures
and possible administrative constraints. Furthermore, as the technicum is a
new type of institution with which Algeria and the Bank have limited previous
experience, there is also a risk associated with the pedagogical aspects of
the project which will require extra monitoring by the Bank. In view of the
benefits expected, the project is, however, well worth the risks inherent in
an innovative operation of this kind.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Democratic and Popular Republic
of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors.
39.       The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for education
projects. Features of the draft Loan Agreement of special interest are
referred to in paragraphs 28 through 35 of this report.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 912-AL Highway Project; US$18.5 million Loan of June 19, 1973; Effective
Date: October 26, 1973; Closing Date: (Original) December 31,
1976, (Current) December 31, 1977.
The overall progress of the project is satisfactory. The project
originally included feasibility studies of the Oran-Arzew and Algiers Southwest
expressways, additional economic studies of the Trans-Sahara road, detailed
engineering of the Algiers Southwest expressway and feasibility studies of an
additional 40 km of principal roads. Upon Government's request and with Bank
approval, these elements have been deleted while additional studies have been
introduced. To allow completion of these additional studies, the Closing Date
had to be postponed from December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1977.
Loan 913-AL First Education Project; US$6.0 million Loan of June 19, 1973;
Effective Date: October 26, 1973; Closing Date: (Original)
December 31, 1976, (Current) December 31, 1977.
Implementation of this project is behind schedule, due mainly to
managerial shortcomings. In particular, progress has been slow on equipment
procurement for the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (University of Annaba)
and the Institute of Agricultural Technology (IAT). However, the preinvest-
ment study for the Institute of Light Industry has been completed, equipment
procurement is well advanced for the technician centers for plastics tech-
nology and natural gas and tenders were invited in December, 1976, for the
construction of workshops and field units for the IAT.
Loan 995-AL Port Project: US$70.0 million Loan of June 19, 1974; Effective
Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Work is progressing satisfactorily and consultants are supervising
construction. Disbursements are somewhat behind schedule but are expected to
catch up in the near future. The project cost, based on contracts already
received, may be slightly below the appraisal estimates of May 1974.
Loan 996-AL Railway Project; US$49.0 million Loan of June 10, 1974; Effective
Date: November 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The physical execution of the project, which supports the railway's
rehabilitation program, is being carried out satisfactorily and on time. Some
consultancy studies are about a year behind schedule but all should be com-
pleted before the project completion date of September 30, 1978. Passenger
and freight traffic is increasing slowly while the financial situation is
improving. However, new line constructions and financial arrangements between
SNTF, SNERIF and the Government have yet to be discussed with the Bank. The
Government by decree, dissolved the old railway entity (SNCFA) and established
two new entities (SNTF for operations and SNERIF for construction). A legal
opinion, confirming that all obligations of SNCFA have been transfered to the
two new entities, has been received; the assignment of individual obligations
to the two new entities is being reviewed.

Loan 997-AL First Power Project; US$38.5 milion Loan of June 10, 1974; Effec-
tive Date: December 20, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The project comprises high voltage substations, gas turbine plants,
dispatch facilities, and consulting services for management and engineering
services. Physical progress of the project is satisfactory. Al1 main con-
tracts have been awarded. Delays have been encountered in the provision of
financial information due to SONELGAZ's lack of experienced staff and inter-
departmental changes of personnel. There are some delays in construction
but the project's completion date is not expected to be affected.
Loan 1158-AL Development Finance Company Project; US$40 million Loan to
Banque Algerienne de Developpement of September 4, 1975;
Effective Date: January 5, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
This project has faced some difficulties. The setting up of the
project appraisal unit within BAD has suffered delays and consequently com-
mitments and disbursements have lagged. In March 1976 the unit started
operations with the assistance of one Bank-seconded expert. A recent
mission has discussed outstanding problems with BAD, and follow-up measures
are now being considered.
Loan 1159-AL Technical Assistance (Rural Development) Project; US$8.0 million
Loan of September 4, 1975; Effective Date: January 5, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Consulting firms have been selected and contracts negotiated on
three of four sub-projects for which planning, preparation and execution by
integrated expert teams will be required. Proposals submitted by consulting
firms for the fourth sub-project on pastoral development of the steppe are
presently being evaluated by Government. The expatriate advisor to the
project coordinator has recently assumed his position as a consultant until
terms of contract for secondment, currently under discussion with the Bank,
are finalized.
Loan 1185-AL SNMC Expansion Project: US$46 million Loan of January 7, 1976;
Effective Date: April 7, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Construction of the cement plant is underway approximately according
to schedule. Training has been delayed due to lack of Algerian personnel'.
The distribution component is being reformulated. Financial measures to ensure
respect of the performance targets proposed by SNMC and agreed with the Bank
are under consideration by the Ministries concerned. The contract for the
technical assistance program for the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite has
been signed; lack of housing for consultants is delaying implementation.

Loan 1209-AL Second Education Project: US$47 million Loan of March 9, 1976;
Effective Date: June 4, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Implementation of this project is progressing satisfactorily. The
consultant architects are expected to submit shortly the master plan for con-
struction of the Institute of Electricity and Electronics at Tlemcen thus
completing Phase I on schedule.   Equipment procurement is proceeding ahead
of schedule at temporary accommodation in Boumerdes.    Implementation of most
technical assistance components has commenced and discussions on the execution
of those remaining are under way.
Loan 1293-AL   Second Power Project;  US$57.5 million Loan of July 8, 1976;
Effective Date: December 2, 1976; Closing Date: December 30,
1980.
The Project consists of the transmission/substation component of
SONELGAZ's 1976-1980 program comprising about 3,300 km of transmission lines
and 4,000 MVA of substation capacity, and studies of SONELGAZ's organization
and management methods. Overall progress is satisfactory. Procurement for
substations to be financed from the loan has been approved by the Bank, but
some delays have occurred in construction. SONELGAZ has not yet submitted to
the Bank a financing plan indicating how the financial covenants agreed upon
will be achieved.

Cumulative          0.30     15.20     39.50      48.50
Procurement:         Civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank Procurement Guidelines. It is expected that some
two-thirds of the contracts would be awarded to Algerian
firms as the country has a construction industry capable
of implementing the proposed project. Contracts for
furniture and equipment would be awarded in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, on the basis of
international competitive bidding except for: (a) items
which can only be grouped in small packages (under $50,000),
(b) items which must be compatible with other equipment
procured under international competitive bidding, and
(c) items of such a specialized nature that international
competitive bidding would not be practicable. These items,
which would not exceed an aggregate maximum of $7.0 million
(or 27 percent of total furniture and equipment costs),
would be procured under normal government procurement
procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. Whenever
possible, price quotations from at least three manufac-
turers or suppliers would be obtained. Furniture and
equipment lists would be reviewed by the Bank, and items
would be grouped so as to permit bulk procurement as would
be consistent with appropriate technical standards and as
would permit the most economic method of procurement, and
would be submitted to the Bank for approval before bids are
invited. Suppliers will be required in the bidding documents
to provide at no additional cost initial training of key
personnel in the use and maintenance of sophisticated equip-
ment. In the evaluation of bids local manufacturers of
equipment and furniture would be allowed a margin of prefer-
ence equal to the existing rate of custom duties applicable
to competing imports or 15 percent of c.i.f. price, whichever
is lower.
Consultants:         Twenty-one man-months of technical assistance would be
provided under the project as follows:
(a) Ten man-months would be applied to a study of the
optimum location of technicums yet to be established.
(b) Two experts would provide a combined total of six
man-months of assistance in:

(i) administrative training for technicum directors;
and
(ii) workshop management for workshop supervisors;
and
(c) Five man-months of consultant services for a tech-
nical and financial feasibility study of the use
of prefabrication techniques in school construction.
