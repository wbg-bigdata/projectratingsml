CHAPTER I
THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01      The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) has no known
indigenous energy resources other than traditional fuels, such as firewood,
vegetable wastes and animal dung, on which no data are available. Although
PDRY is bordered by oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Oman) exploration activities
have so far not yielded any discoveries of commercial deposits of oil or
natural gas. The main exploration efforts currently under way are on the
continental shelf, Socotra Island (about 200 miles off the coast) and in
the eastern part of the country, for which exploration agreements have
been signed with a British, a Canadian and a Soviet company respectively.
The Government-owned Yemen National Oil Company (YNOC) has its own exploration
department, established in 1976, but its efforts are hampered by lack of
modern drilling equipment, for which it has sought outside assistance without
success. Presently, all energy requirements are imported in the form of
petroleum products. These are supplied by the Aden Refinery, a public sector
company, from its refinery built in 1954 with an annual capacity of 8.5 mil-
lion tons of crude oil. The marketing and distribution of petroleum products
within PDRY is the responsibility of YNOC which takes its supplies from the
Aden Refinery.
1.02      After the changes in world oil trade patterns following the closure
of the Suez Canal, oil imports and exports declined rapidly, and consequently
crude oil throughput at the refinery fell from nearly 7 million tons in 1965
to about 1.6 million tons in 1975. The refinery operates now at about 20%
of its annual capacity but it is expected that, due to the growing internal
fuel consumption, there will be a better capacity utilization in the near
future. Iran is PDRY's largest supplier of crude oil, accounting for about
50% of 1975 imports, followed by Kuwait (24%) and Iraq (16%).
1.03      The internal annual consumption of oil products was about 420,000
tons in 1975. The total per capita consumption of energy of 360 kg standard
coal equivalent 1/ in 1974 is below the average for all developing countries,
which amounted to 394 kgce in the same year. This puts PDRY close to the
bottom end of the range for all countries (12-19,500 kgce/capita). Some
comparative figures for other countries are Jordan (388), Oman (250) and
YAR (30).
B. The Power Sub-Sector
Organization
1.04      The Public Corporation for Electric Power (PCEP), the Government-
owned company responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of
1/   1 kg standard coal equivalent (kgce) = 7,000 kilocalories.



- 2 -
electricity in PDRY, was created in 1969, 2 years after independence, to
bring the supply of electric power under a single organization. So far
PCEP has assumed direct control in Aden, Abyan, Mukalla, Saywun, Ash
Shihr, Lawdar and Mudiyah; it also controls the electricity companies in
Ataq, Hami and in a few other small localities through ownership of 60%
of the shares but allows them to function as subsidiaries (see Map IBRD
13399R).
Trend of Public Supply
1.05      Statistics are available for the Aden system, which accounts for
about 90% of the total electricity generation and installed capacity. Some
estimated figures for other isolated systems in the country are available
only for recent years (see tables 1.1 and 1.2). Figures for the last ten
years show a sharp decline in peak demand in the Aden area, from 33.4 MW
in 1966 to 23.8 MW in 1970, following the achievement of independence and
the departure of the sizeable community of expatriates. Official Government
policy since then has restricted air conditioning and other convenience loads
under an austerity program. Sales also dropped well below the preindepen-
dence level, from 145 GWh in 1965 to 114 GWh iu,-l975. Preliminary figures
for 1977 indicate that electricity consumption in 1978 is likely to reach
preindependence level with the beginning of economic recovery.
1.06      While domestic consumption is the largest single category, its share
of about 35% in the Aden area has remained relatively unchanged since 1969,
reflecting general economic stagnation and restrictive Government policies
towards the use of electricity for non-productive purposes. Commercial con-
sumers accounted for 12% of consumption in 1969 but their part had risen to
20% by 1976. The share of industrial consumption (excluding agro-industries)
remained in the range of 26-29% until 1974/75 but declined in 1976 to 16.4%
due to the reclassification of some industrial consumers into the new agro-
industries category. The most rapidly growing category was agro-industries;
as a result of strong Government encouragement of this sector, its share
rose from 7% of electricity sales in 1974/75, when the category was intro-
duced, to 20% in 1976.
Investment
1.07      Total investment for power by PCEP in the period 1972-76 was some
YD 6.9 million (US$20 million) or about 11% of total public investments for
the same period of approximately YD 65 million (US$188.5 million).
Existing Facilities
1.08      PDRY's power generation is limited to the Aden area and to a
few municipalities relying on small isolated diesel plants. PCEP's total
installed capacity is about 69 MW; of this 60 MW is located in the Aden area,
comprising several steam, combustion-turbine and diesel units. The steam
units are now more than 15 years old. They have been steadily losing effi-
ciency since 1965, and the largest unit (6MW), installed in 1966, was lost
permanently in 1972 through turbine-shaft failure. The combustion-turbine



plant was converted to diesel oil when refinery gas, its original primary
fuel, was no longer available and the price of light distillate feedstock,
the original alternative fuel, became prohibitively high; since 1975, it has
been used as a stand-by plant. Generating capacity in the Aden system was
substantially increased in 1975 with the completion of the new diesel station
at Khormaksar (see map IBRD 13399R) with an installed capacity of 5x5 MW. The
new diesel station, which runs on heavy fuel oil, has the lowest operating
cost, and is therefore dispatched at the highest priority.  All PCEP's genera-
tion outside Aden is by diesel engine sets. The most important installations
are: 1,450 kW in Ja'ar, in the Abyan delta and 3,000 kW at Mukalla. There
are a variety of local electricity supply systems in Wadi Hadramout. Their
total installed capacity can be estimated at 3.5 MW made up of a multitude
of diesel sets of a wide range of ratings and origins. This has resulted in
expensive and unreliable operation, and in a growing shortage of supply. The
largest power plants in the Wadi are in Saywun, Tarim, Shibam and Al Qatn.
Of these, only the Saywun plant with an installed capacity of about 1 MW, is
owned by PCEP.
1.09      The only significant autoproducer is the Aden refinery at Little
Aden. It has three 7-MW steam-turbine units which run as required by the
steam needs of the refinery. This capacity is interconnected with PCEP's
system and PCEP buys, at favorable prices, available surplus energy.
1.10      The transmission network consists of some 90 km of 33-kV lines
which are located in the Aden area. Primary distribution is at 11 kV in Aden,
Abyan and Mukalla and at 6 kV in Saywun.  Standard secondaries are 400/240 V,
3-phase, 50 Hz. Copper conductors are used for overhead construction in
preference to aluminum due to high temperatures, humidity and salinity in the
service areas.
Access to Public Supply
1.11      So far, electrification has been largely confined to Aden and
the surrounding area. Outside Aden only Abyan, Mukalla, Saywun, and Ash
Shihr have continuous, 24-hour service. The rest are limited to a few hours
at night and by special arrangement at other times.
1.12      The total number of customers served in 1976 was about 63 thousand,
of which 40 thousand were in the Aden area. Assuming 6 persons on average per
connection, it is estimated that some 22% of the total population of 1.7
million is connected to electricity supply. It is likely that the number of
population having access to electricity does not exceed significantly the
population served.
Development Strategy
1.13      The main objective of the Government's development strategy for
the power subsector is to ensure the adequate expansion of power supplies for
productive purposes, especially in connection with planned industrial and
agricultural development. Provision of electricity for essentially amenity
purposes (e.g. domestic use) is accordingly given low priority, particulary
since the oil price rises of 1973 and 1974, and this policy was formally



-4-
endorsed in a resolution passed by the General Congress of the National
Liberation Front (the ruling party) in 1975 to the effect that no electri-
fication scheme should be entertained if its sole purpose was to provide
lighting.
1.14      Following its establishment in 1969, PCEP has decided on a policy
of encouraging electrification of villages to improve living conditions and
to restrict the drift of rural population to the towns, but in fact financial
stringency had prevented it from doing much to implement this decision. In
accordance with the Government's strategy for the subsector, future rural and
village electrification is likely to be restricted to schemes associated with
agro-industrial developments (e.g. Wadi Hadramout).
1.15      Government policy also aims at consolidation of the power sub-
sector through the progressive take-over by PCEP of all existing public power
facilities.
1.16      Development planning at the national level has formally existed
in PDRY since its independence. However, the development of the power sub-
sector is not based on long-term plans (15-20 years) resulting from least-
cost studies, but rather on ad-hoc measures aimed to cover immediate needs,
especially in the few areas with electricity supply. This is the result of
the obvious needs of the subsector and the lack of sufficient number of
qualified staff to undertake the planning task. A master electrification
development plan for the whole country, with a first priority for the Aden
area, covering the First, Second and Third Governorates, is urgently needed
to prevent haphazard expansion and consequent waste of resources. Preparation
of this development plan, which will require outside consultants, has been
included in the Project and is expected to be financed by the Arab Fund. PCEP
will have the study completed not later than 1980.
Future Load Growth
1.17      A detailed load forecast is available only for the Aden system
(Table 1.2), and for Wadi Hadramount (see Chapter IV); only estimated figures
could be provided for the other isolated systems. These forecasts prepared by
PCEP and based on official Government data, are subject to great uncertainties
since they assume timely implementation of Government industrial expansion
plans, which past experience suggests is unlikely.
1.18      The forecast for the Aden system implies an average annual growth
rate for peak demand of 10.1% in 1977-83 from 30.8 MW in 1977 to 54.66 MW in
1983 (Table 1.1). Total sales according to the PCEP projection, are expected
to rise from the 1977 level of 121 GWh to 268 GWh in 1983 corresponding to a
growth rate in 1977-83 of about 14% p.a. According to the forecast, agro-
industry is the most rapidly growing sector of demand, sales to this sector
rising at about 33% p.a. to 1980, and then declining to 6% p.a. For all
other consumers, domestic and non-domestic, PCEP assumes the relatively low
growth rate of 3% p.a. throughout the period.
1.19      In the Mukalla/Khalf area a new fishmeal plant, a fish-canning
factory, cold storage installations and several other new projects with



-5-
sizeable power demands are planned for the next few years. As a result,
peak demand is expected to grow from 1.7 MW in 1976 to 5 MW in 1983 (17%
p.a. on average).
Expansion Program
1.20      Power development calls for a total investment in 1978-1983 of some
YD 44.2 million equivalent to US$128 million, (see Table 1.3), with almost 77Z
of it going to expansion of the Aden system, and nearly all the balance to
Wadi Hadramout (see Chapter II). This reflects Government priorities (see
para. 1.13), since these are the areas where industrial and agroindustrial
development is concentrated.
1.21      In the Aden system, PCEP is planning to retire the aging steam,
diesel and combustion-turbine units at the Hedjuff station in 1980. A new
60-MW diesel plant in the Aden area with financing from the Saudi and Abu
Dhabi Funds, is expected to be commissioned in 1980 to replace the retired
capacity and provide for the growth in demand. This would be followed in
1984-85 by a new steam station, of 100 MW at Hishwa (Aden), which the USSR has
tentatively offered to supply in two stages to cover the growing demand after
1984. The plan includes 132-kV lines between Aden and the areas of Lahej-
Dukiem and Jaal-Shugreh.
1.22      The expansion program also includes the completion of the 8.2-MW
diesel station in Mukalla and some other small diesel stations and network
extensions in Mudiyah, Wadi Baihan and Nisab.
C. The Borrower and Beneficiary
1.23      The Borrower will be the Government who will onlend the full
proceeds of the credit to the Beneficiary, PCEP (see para. 2.13). The Arab
Fund and the Islamic Developing Bank, the other likely cofinanciers, are
expected to do likewise with their loans.
Management and Manpower
1.24      PCEP is a Government-owned company run by a seven-man board (see
Chart 1). The Executive Chairman of the Board is also the Chief Executive of
PCEP. The other members are PCEP's Chief Engineer, Chief Electrical Inspector,
Chief Accountant, two workers' representatives (the first secretary of the
ruling party from among the members of the PCEP staff and the PCEP's trade
union secretary), and the Director of Projects from the Industries Ministry.
The charter creating PCEP has conferred on the Board all necessary powers
to run a public utility efficiently except that in all matters affecting
other sectors of economy the Board's proposals would require ministerial
consent. The Board is more a management committee than a policy-making Board.
No change is suggested in this arrangement.
1.25      PCEP is staffed with well qualified and trained professionals in
most areas. The heads of the planning and accounting divisions need some



additional training to increase their effectiveness (see para 1.29). The
accounting division needs to be strengthened by filling the post of Deputy
Chief Accountant, which is vacant. PCEP will appoint a suitably qualified
and experienced person as Deputy Chief Accountant before December 31, 1978.
Middle level management also needs strengthening by addition of qualified
staff and additional training to the existing staff. The training component
of the Project will accomplish this (paras. 1.28-1.30).
1.26      With almost 90% of the total generating capacity located in Aden,
the majority of PCEP's total workforce of 1,540 is concentrated in this area.
Training
1.27      Normal attrition of manpower, movements to the small private sector
and the implications of the planned expansion in the next five-year plan
period (1979-1983) point to the need for an additional 400 skilled workers,
100 technicians and supervisors and 20 management-level staff by 1983.
1.28      PCEP operates a small training center adjacent to the existing
steam generating station in Aden, with two engineers working full time con-
ducting courses for both newly recruited and existing staff. These programs
are largely theoretical as virtually no training equipment exists. The
management of PCEP intends to create a new and better equipped training center
at the site of the planned 60 MW diesel station in Aden (Mansoura) to provide
needed back-up training on the maintenance of specialized plant used by PCEP.
Once the new diesel station is constructed, and the PCEP training center moved
to its new site, training equipment and audio visual training programs will
be necessary for the center to carry out its function of providing in-service
part-time training programs for staff from the generation, operation and
transmission/distribution departments. PCEP will finance the major portion
of the training program including the building of the new center, and will
also be responsible for the implementation of the training program. A sum of
US$150,000 out of the total US$520,000 which is included in the credit for
training will be allocated to cover the foreign exchange costs of the training
hardware and software.
1.29      The most urgent manpower problem now facing PCEP is the comparative
dearth of qualified personnel gravitating upwards towards positions of depart-
mental responsibility. Without exception, senior positions in the technical,
administrative and consumer-relations departments are filled by qualified,
experienced and dedicated men, but some of these managers could benefit from
short retraining exposure in overseas utilities. The gap between present
departmental heads and their support staff is very wide, due to recruitment
difficulties imposed by the limitations of the local education system and the
heavy competition for the few selected individuals who travel abroad annually
for higher education and training. One priority need relates to the current
lack of system planning capability within management. The Director of
Planning has had little experience of the techniques involved and would
benefit from a six to nine month attachment to a medium-sized utility overseas
to gain such experience. Similarly, the Chief Accountant who is a chartered
accountant trained in England, should be given the opportunity of updating his



- 7 -
skills by a period of overseas attachment. These and other training needs
will be covered in the proposed training program (para. 1.30).
1.30      To meet these separate needs for (a) the training of future deputy
departmental managers (to enable them to assume greater responsibility),
(b) the retraining of some of the senior staff, and (c) the provision of
higher education and training for newly-recruited secondary school leavers
of high calibre in preparation for the future careers up to middle and upper
management, twenty man-years of overseas training is included in the project.
PCEP will submit to the Association before December 31, 1978 qualifications
and the proposed program for individuals selected for overseas training, and
to carry out the program after reviewing the Association's comments on its
proposals.
Tariffs
1.31      Tariffs are fixed by the Government based on the decision of the
Council of Ministers on PCEP's tariff proposals. PCEP's present tariffs in
Aden are included in Table 1.4. The tariffs can be broadly classified into
four categories. The lowest at 8 to 12 fils (USi 2.32 to 3.48) per kWh
(depending upon the time of the day) is for the agricultural load, the next
at 16 fils (USe 4.64) per kWh for Yemeni domestic consumers, the third at
27 fils (USJ 7.83) per kWh for most other categories of consumers and the
highest at 100 fils (USe 29) per kWh for temporary supplies.
1.32      During FY 1976 the average cost of electricity sold was 22.31
fils (USJ 6.47) per kWh and the average revenue was 21.4 fils (USa 6.21) per
kWh. This average was derived from the revenue of electricity sales to
agriculture (20.2% of the total sales) at 9.1 fils per kWh and the average
of all the other categories at 24.68 fils per kWh. Nearly 20% of the total
demand produced only 8.6% of the total revenue. Tariffs in the Wadi Hadramout
are 50 fils (USe 14.5) per kWh for lighting and fans and 25 fils (USJ 7.25)
per kWh for power which includes pumps and refrigerators down to those of
domestic size. In setting lower tariffs for the agricultural load, the
Government hopes to encourage a more rapid development of agriculture and
its ancilliary agroindustries. However, this policy of charging less than
marginal cost may introduce economic distortions, and also does not allow
PCEP to operate on commercial basis and prevents it from generating a surplus
to help cover its investment needs. The result is heavy reliance for its
expansion program on Government budgetary allocations for which there are
competing demands from other sectors. A revised structure of tariffs taking
into account marginal costing principles would be implemented by PCEP to
enable it to run on commercial lines. This would be done on the basis of
a tariff study (financed from the proposed Credit), to be completed by
Government by December 31, 1979 with the assistance of consultants whose
qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment would be
satisfactory to the Association. An outline of the draft terms of reference
for the tariff study was reviewed with Government during negotiations. Govern-
ment will prepare a revised tariff system in light of the recommendations of
the study and in consultation with the Association and thereafter promptly
implement such revised tariff system.

NOTES
02 data available for 1966-1973 outside the Aden service area.
3/ After independence (1967) - loss of air conditioning load at British camps and housing compounds.
2/ Drop in peak demand due to change-over fram bulk to individual billing at military camps.
3/ Effective capacity only 57 Ma due to loss of capacity of 2 MW in steam and 1 MW in umubuntion turbine plants which are obsolete.
4  Shaft failure took out 6 MW steam unit in 1972.
Y/ Made up of several units left behind by the British forces,
2/ Transferred 3 Ma of diesel sets to Jaar.
7/ Start-up of Khormaksar diesel station (5x5 W).
Ex/ Existing generating plants except Khormakoar are to be retired when the new 6o-MW diesel plant in Aden starts up.
2/ Assumed peak demands, supposing a non-restricted power supply, before the construction of thl 132-kV ltne from Adun, -cheduled fo- 1950.

CHAPTER II
THE PROJECT
2.01      The proposed Project is the first stage of an electrification
scheme to supply power to major population centers, irrigation pumps and
some small industrial consumers in the Wadi Hadramout, an isolated area
in the central part of the country at a distance from Aden of about 500 km
by air and 950 km by road.
2.02      The Wadi Hadramout with an area of about 1,200 km2 and some 200
thousand inhabitants (13% of the country's population) is the largest agri-
cultural region in PDRY and also the location of an ancient and very well
preserved civilisation. One-third of the Wadi area is cultivable and water
is extracted now from some 2,000 open and 100 deep wells at an annual rate
of 130 million m3. The Government is giving the development of the Wadi top
priority in its development plans, and several projects are presently underway
in the Wadi and financed by IDA, the Kuwait Fund, the UNDP, the USSR and other
East European countries. The most important of these projects are:
(a)  Wadi Hadramout Road Project linking Mukalla on the
coast with Saywun in the Wadi (IDA Credit No. 560-YDR
and a Kuwait-Fund loan, 1975) for a total cost of $31.8
million started in 1976 and due to be completed in 1979;
(b)  Wadi Hadramout Agricultural Project (IDA Credit No. 615-YDR,
1976), a $7.7 million multipurpose agricultural project;
with a primary objective of increasing productivity; and
(c)  State Farms Project financed and undertaken by the USSR.
The Government also plans to start in the near future new agro-industrial
projects in the Wadi, including a date factory, a tomato paste factory
and prefabricated and building materials factories.
2.03      In order to facilitate agricultural development in Wadi Hadramout,
the Government has set up a program to replace the existing 2,000 open wells
in the cooperative farms by tube wells to be drilled at a rate of about 50
wells/year beginning with 1978 (see paras. 4.07-4.09). Satisfactory evidence
has been provided to the Association with regard to necessary steps taken by
the Government to implement this program.
2.04      The Project aims at electrifying all water pumping in the Wadi,
which would result in significant savings of fuel and operational costs.
2.05      The only practicable source of energy for conversion to electricity
for the Wadi is imported oil (see para. 1.01). The means of conversion of



- 15 -
other sources of energy such as wind and solar are not yet developed on a
commercial basis. Windmills in particular cannot be used because the area is
practically windless for long periods of time. Consequently the only suitable
solution for power generation in the Wadi is based on the burning of oil,
mainly of the heavy grade, which is cheaper than diesel oil and appropriate
for large diesel units.
2.06      The Project, which would be completed by 1983, includes a 16-MW
diesel power plant, a 33-kV transmission system, four 11-kV distribution
networks, low voltage distribution, studies and training of personnel.
Genesis of the Project
2.07      The Association identified the Project in May 1976 when an energy
sector mission which visited PDRY recommended that the Government should
arrange to have a proper feasibility study carried out before undertaking the
Project. In February 1977 a mission visited PDRY for the preparation of the
Project. It also visited Kuwait to discuss with the Arab Fund its involvement
in PDRY and to explore its interest in participating in financing the pro-
posed Project. In March 1977 IDA granted a Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) advance to enable the Government to finance a feasibility study. PCEP
entrusted Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of England with carrying out the
feasibility study and PCR completed the feasibility study in August 1977
on the basis of terms of reference agreed with the Association. The draft
feasibility report was revised and updated by the consultant in December 1977,
following discussions in Aden with PCEP and the Association, mainly with
regard to the irrigation loads and the resulting changes in the construction
program and its costs.  This report is based on the findings of a IDA mission
which visited PDRY in November 1977.
Project Description
2.08      The Project comprises the following physical parts (see map IBRD
13398R):
-    4x4 MW diesel power station at Qaraw equipped for heavy
oil operation;
-    82 km of 33-kV overhead transmision lines;
-    580 km of 11-kV overhead distribution lines;
-    three 33/11-kV substations totalling 30 MVA, one each
at the power station (2 x 10 MVA), at Al Qatn in the West
(1 x 5 MVA) and at Al Ghuraf in the East (1 x 5 MVA);
-    some 500 11/0.4-kV transformers totalling about 20 MVA;
-    340 km of low voltage distribution lines;
-    meters and service connections for 7,500 new consumers; and
-    drilling equipment for the erection of poles for overhead lines.



- 16 -
The second stage of the electrification scheme (not included in the Project)
would comprise the extension of the power plant with one additional 4-MW
diesel unit, a 33/11-kV substation at Tarim and the extension of the 11-kV and
low voltage networks and would be implemented after 1983 if the development of
water pumping in Wadi Hadramout proceeds according to present expectations.
This would depend on the results of the ongoing ground water study undertaken
by Societe Grenobloise d'Etudes d'Applications Hydrauliques (SOGREAH) under
the IDA financed Wadi Hadramout Agricultural Project. The location of the
power plant and the transmission and distribution components of the Project
are shown on map IBRD 13398R.
2.09      The Project also includes training of personnel (see para. 1.27-
1.30) and studies regarding electricity tariffs (see para. 1.32) and the
development of the power sub-sector (see para. 1.16) and provision for
refinancing the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance made for the
feasibility study.

2.11      The Project cost is based on estimates made by PCR using late 1977
base prices.  Local costs provided by the consultants for erection and equip-
ment of the diesel power station have been adjusted to reflect the low labor
cost in PDRY and the relatively small part of the local component. Engineer-
ing and supervision are estimated at 5% of the total cost. The Project cost
includes US$520,000 (including contingencies) for training and US$430,000
(including contingencies) for a tariff study, a development study for the
Power Subsector and for the repayment of $270,000 PPF advance for the Project
Feasibility Study (Table 2.1). No import taxes are levied. Physical con-
tingency is assumed at 5% for all components. Escalation has been applied
in accordance with the following annual rates corresponding to expected
conditions:

Equipment & Materials            7        6.5          6
The capital cost estimate for the diesel power plant is about US$730/kW.
Costs of 33-kV overhead lines are US$9,800/km; for 11-kV lines the costs range
from US$7,800/km to US$8,700/km and for low voltage lines from US$4,800/km to
US$6,700/km depending on the section of the conductors. The specific invest-
ment for substations and transformers stations is about US$50/KVA. These
costs are considered to be reasonable.
Financing
2.12      Out of the estimated total cost of about US$28.3 million required
for the Project, the proposed IDA Credit would finance US$5 million of foreign
cost, and the Government the total local cost of about US$3.2 million. The
Arab Fund has indicated in principle its interest in participating in the
Project under parallel financing arrangements with an equivalent of some
US$14.5 million and has already completed its apraisal. The Government is
continuing its discussions with the Islamic Development Bank for the provision
of about US$5.5 million under parallel co-financing arrangements to cover the
balance of the financial requirements. The Islamic Development Bank has com-
pleted appraisal jointly with the Arab Fund. The signing of agreements for
the remaining project financing between the Government and the co-financiers
would be a condition of credit effectivenes.
2.13      The IDA credit of US$5 million would be provided to the Government
and the entire amount would be on-lent to PCEP. On-lending terms would be
for not more than 20 years, including 5 years of grace roughly equivalent to
the construction period at an annual interest of 7.5 percent corresponding to
the Bank lending rate. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between
the Government and PCEP would be a condition of credit effectiveness. It is
expected that the Arab Fund loan would be on-lent on similar terms, while that
of the Islamic Bank would be passed on by the Government to PCEP at the
original terms.
2.14      The proposed IDA credit would finance the foreign costs of the
transmision and distribution component (except the overhead lines) as
well as training and the tariff study.
Procurement and Implementation
2.15      Procurement for all major items financed by the Credit would be
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank loans and IDA Credits for equipment. However,
because of the nature of the Project, items valued below US$20,000 aggregating
to not more than US$200,000 may be procured in accordance with international
shopping procedures which are acceptable to the Association. Items financed
by other co-financiers will be procured in accordance with their procedures.

2.16      PCEP proposes to execute the construction of substations and erec-
tion of lines by force account employing its own departmental forces. PCEP in
support of its proposal states that all the 8ubstations and lines in the
country are constructed by its own staff by force account. Since 1972, it has
completed in the Aden area alone, without any external help, the execution of
some 100 km of 33-kV and 110 km of 1l-kV overhead lines, 16.5 km of 33-kV and
150 km of 11-kV underground cables, 600 km of low voltage lines, and 33-kV and
11-kV transformer stations with a total capacity of about 160 MVA.
2.17      PCEP maintains specialized crews for maintenance, repair and instal-
lation of networks, including extensions of the power system and, therefore,
the mission is of the opinion that the force account method of construction
would be appropriate for the Wadi networks. Furthermore, PCEP meets the
following criteria relevant to the use of the force account method of con-
struction:
(i) the size of the work and the difficulty in reaching the
site might limit competition;
(ii) the departmental forces concerned are efficient compared to
execution by other means;
(iii) execution is not likely to result in a permanent expansion
of capacity beyond levels that are justified in the light of
future need (including capacity to respond to emergency
situations), and to cause a diversion of effort from appro-
priate levels of maintenance and other high priority work;
(iv) the departmental forces in PCEP are suitably dimensioned
in relation to their routine workload and emergency operations,
but have some excess capacity which would allow the works to
be carried out without much additional cost.
2.18      For the construction of the proposed networks PCEP will create a
project unit in Wadi Hadramount led by a full-time engineer with adequate
construction experience in networks. This would be a condition of credit
effectiveness. The work will be designed and costed in detail prior to con-
struction, meeting conventional public utility practices on the adequacy of
site survey, project design, preparation of drawings, bills of quantity and
quality specifications for materials and finished works. The project unit
would follow an accounting/costing system to ensure proper allocation of all
costs for the project and to measure and monitor performance. An engineering
consultant acceptable to the Association will be appointed, as a condition of
credit effectiveness, for Project execution, and who would also be respon-
sible for the engineering relating to this work. For the operation and
maintenance of the proposed diesel station and associated transmission and
distribution networks PCEP will establish not later than June 30, 1980 an
operating unit in Wadi Hadramount under such management and operational
procedures as shall be acceptable to the Association. The proposed structure
and responsibilities of this unit will be communicated to the Association by
December 31, 1979.

2.19      Civil works would be by PCEP or small local contracts and would not
be financed from the Credit.
2.20      Table 2.2 to this report includes a tentative list of contracts,
suggested method of procurement, financing sources and a procurement schedule.
The Project would be constructed through approximately 17 contracts.
2.21      The construction of the proposed power plant and the related net-
works presents no greater difficulties than in many other parts of the Middle
East. At both Aden and Mukalla there are suitable port facilities for the
importation of materials and equipment. An asphalt road from Aden to Mukalla
has been recently completed. A new all-weather road 300 km long financed by
IDA and the Kuwait Fund is being constructed from Mukalla to Saywun via
Hawbrah at the western end of the Wadi Hadramout (see para. 2.02). Its com-
pletion, which is expected by December 1979, will facilitate the transporta-
tion of heavy equipment to the Wadi.
2.22      The power plant, which is expected to be the subject of a single
contract both for supply and erection, would be commissioned in the period
October 1980-March 1981.
2.23      The contracts for the transmission and distribution components would
mainly cover supply of equipment, erection including civil works being carried
out by PCEP's departmental force . The Project works would be executed in two
phases:
Phase I (1980-81) would comprise the 33-kV system, about
340 km of 11-kV lines, 11/0.4 kV transformers totalling 13.5
MVA, 150 km of low voltage distribution networks, and connec-
tions for 4,500 new consumers;
Phase II (1982-1983) would comprise some additional 240 km
of 11-kV lines, 11/0.4 kV transformers totalling 6.5 MVA,
170 km of low voltage distribution networks and connections
for 3,000 new consumers.
Materials and equipment would be required during 1978 and 1979 for Phase I.
2.24       In order to ensure proper coordination between the deep well drill-
ing program and the development of electric networks in the Wadi Hadramout,
the Government will assign a senior representative of PCEP to the local
Advisory Committee for the Hadramount Project Organization, a new unit
created under the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform to implement
the IDA financed Agricultural Project. This assignment will be done not
later than December 31, 1978.

Disbursement
2.25      Disbursement from the proceeds of the credit would be for 100% of
the foreign expenditures for equipment and materials for substations, distri-
bution transformers, line construction equipment, engineering services,
feasibility and tariff studies, training equipment and training abroad of
personnel (see Table 2.2). The expected disbursement schedule is shown in
Table 2.3. The closing date would be December 31, 1984.
Environmental Impact
2.26      The Project consists of setting up a complex system of generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity in an agricultural region. The
environmental impact of the power station is negligible, since the diesel
units will be located outside the residential area, near the village of
Qaraw in the central part of the Wadi. The proposed transmission and dis-
tribution networks will improve and extend the existing electricity supply
in urban areas, which are provided now by inadequate local networks, and will
introduce electricity in the rural areas both for domestic users and for
irrigation. Therefore, following conventional practices there would be no
significant environmental impact.

CHAPTER III
FINANCE
Introduction
3.01      The PCEP law requires the Corporation "to secure that the total
revenues excluding capital and other non-revenue receipts of the Corporation
are sufficient to meet its total outgoings properly chargeable to revenue
account, including depreciation and interest payable, taking one year with
another." The law further requires that tariffs shall be fixed having regard
to this objective. In the past, with the exception of 1975 PCEP has not been
complying with these requirements. The Corporation's consequent losses are
subsidized by the Government from its "Equalizing Fund Account" which is
funded from an equalizing fund tax payable by PCEP and other corporations at
5% of the income tax payable. Since no funds are generated internally, PCEP's
projects are financed from (i) loans obtained directly from the Yemen National
Bank, (ii) project loans from the international financial institutions and
loans from the Arab Governments to the Government which are given to PCEP as
Government grants, and (iii) Government grants for local currency expenditures.
3.02      Under its law, PCEP's tariffs are subject to Government approval,
its investment program shall conform to a general program settled in consul-
tation with the Minister, and the Minister may give it such directions as he
considers necessary for its proper functoning. Otherwise PCEP is fully
empowered to run its affairs in accordance with its own internal rules and
regulations which need not conform to Government rules and regulations.
Despite this, in actual practice, PCEP's activities are closely controlled by
the Government.
Past Performance and Present Position
3.03      Since its incorporation by Law No. 38 of 1969, PCEP's revenues
(with the exception of the fiscal year 1975, when it had a small operating
surplus) have not matched its operating expenses as illustrated by the
financial statements for the period April 1974 through December 1976 (Table
3.1). A review of these statements indicates that sufficient emphasis has not
been given to the fiscal side of PCEP's operations. Because of non-payment of
dues by the Government since 1969, PCEP's receivables for electricity sales
have been high, being the equivalent of 206, 199, and 200 days' sales for the
periods April 1974-March 1975, April 1975-December 1975 and January-December
1976, respectively. About two-thirds of the receivables are accounted for by
some eight-year old bills unpaid by Government amounting to YD one million.
Inventories for these periods have also been high, being the equivalent of 8,
14.6 and 14.5 months supply, respectively, of fuel and other consumable
materials. PCEP has already initiated action to improve its bill collection
and inventory management procedures. In April 1978, PCEP installed a computer
for these purposes and expects to convert to a complete computerized inventory
management and billing system by end 1979. Regarding old unpaid electricity
bills of Government, Government has already approved in principle setting off
debts it owed to PCEP against those owed to it by PCEP. PCEP will advise the
Association of the net effect of these adjustments. After elimination of the



- 26 -
old receivables for electricity supply to the Government and after the com-
puterized inventory management and billing system gets into stride, PCEP's
inventories and receivables would be brought down to reasonable levels.
Financial Objectives
3.04      In view of PCEP's large capital expansion requirements amounting to
YD 44.2 (US$128) million in 1978-83 (compare the present net fixed assets,
including work in progress, of YD 6.2 million) and the limited Government
resources, PCEP's present financial objective, namely, generating enough
revenues to cover expenses including interest, is no longer appropriate. Con-
sidering the magnitude of its capital expansion requirements, PCEP needs to
generate internally a reasonable proportion of these requirements and with
this in view, considers that a rate of return of 8% on realistically valued
assets would be an adequate ultimate objective for it. In view of the need
to base tariff action on at least the provisional findings of the tariff study
(para. 1.32) and the time needed for political preparation for such action,
PCEP will reach this objective in stages as follows and Government will take
all action to enable PCEP to perform its obligations:
(a)  PCEP will take from time to time all such measures (including
but not limited to adjustments of its tariffs) as shall be
required to provide it for its 1980 fiscal year with revenues
sufficient to cover its operating costs including depreciation
and to meet interest expenses. For this purpose, PCEP will
prepare with the approval of the Government, and submit to the
Association, not later than September 1, 1979 the measures pro-
posed to be taken in order to provide PCEP with such revenues.
PCEP will thereafter but not later than December 31, 1979 take
all actions required for the implementation of such measures;
(b)  PCEP will take all measures necessary to ensure that it shall
earn an annual rate of return of not less than 2% for 1981
and to ensure that such rate of return shall steadily increase
so as to be not less than 8% for 1985 and the succeeding fiscal
years, of the current net value of its fixed assets in opera-
tion properly valued and revalued in accordance with methods
satisfactory to the Association. The existing law No. 38
which governs PCEP's operations does not prohibit it from
earning positive rates of return and therefore it could aim
at achieving the agreed financial objectives without an
amendment to the law;
(c)  by September 1, 1981 and after approval by Government, PCEP
will propose to the Association the rate of return to be
achieved by it in 1982, 1983 and 1984, and by December 31,
1981 will establish such targets for these years as shall
be satisfactory to the Association; and
(d)  PCEP will communicate to the Association by September 30
of each year the specific measures needed to achieve the
yearly targets along with the earnings forecast for the
current and subsequent years.



- 27 -
To achieve the above targets in 1980 and in 1981, an average tariff increase
of 20% effective January 1, 1980 would be necessary. A significant portion of
the tariff increase will be to offset the effect of inflation (see constant
price ratio statement for tariffs at 1977 level in Table 3.6). For projection
purposes a 30% interim tariff increase in January 1983 which would achieve a
5.4% rate of return in 1983 has been assumed. With the tariff increases
assumed the Corporation will generate about 22% of its investment requirements
in 1980, and about 34%, 25% and 44% in 1981, 1982 and 1983, respectively,
which are adequate.

3.06      The development program will require about $128 million of which
about 23% will be required for the Project including interest during con-
struction (IDC). About 23% of the funds required for the program will be
met from the PCEP's internal cash generation including decreases in working
capital. About 84% of the Project requirements (including IDC) will be met
through foreign loans to the Government relent to the Corporation. The
balance will be met from other foreign loans to the Government to be given
as grants to PCEP.
3.07      About 55% of the total program requirements would be met by Govern-
ment as grants to PCEP partly from expected foreign loans. Although firm
arrangements have not been made in all cases, a significant portion has
already been arranged (e.g. Saudi and Abu Dhabi Funds for the 60-MW diesel
plant in Aden and USSR aid for the 100-MW stream station) and it is expected
that Government would be able to provide the balance of requirements not
covered by foreign loans. The financing plan could therefore be considered
as reasonably assured.

Tables 3.3 to 3.6. The assumptions underlying these forecasts are stated in
Attachment 3.1. Table 3.2 includes debt statements for this period. The
forecasts show that after a 20% tariff increase in 1980 PCEP would vastly
improve its present financial position although the rate of return on revalued
assets would remain around 2% till 1982. After a second tariff increase
effective January 1, 1983 the rate of return would improve to 5.4%. It would
achieve the 8% objective after further tariff adjustments. Its current ratio
would be between 0.6 and 0.7 after 1978 and its liquidity ratio around 0.4.
Although these would appear to be low, they do not reflect an unsatisfactory
condition because the current liabilities include (i) large customer deposits
which normally are not returned within a specified period and (ii) accrued
taxes which fall due for payment only a few months after the close of the
fiscal year when the tax assessment is completed. Excluding customer deposits,
the current ratio would be 4.4 in say, 1979 and 2.1 in 1983. PCEP's low debt
equity ratio of about 27:75 during 1979 through 1981 and about 20:80 there-
after reflects the Government's practice of giving all the foreign project
loans to PCEP as grants. Its debt service coverage is also high because of
high grants and low debts. Its operating ratio (operating expenses/operating
revenues) will improve from 1 in 1977 to 0.73 in 1983.
Forecasts for Wadi Operations
3.09       Since the Wadi Project would constitute a separate isolated system,
forecasts of its operations can be reviewed in isolation from the rest of
the PCEP operations. Table 3.7 includes financial forecasts for the Wadi
System from 1980 (including ratio statements), when a part of the Project
assets will be commissioned, to 1983, when the power station will be fully in
operation.   The forecast projections for Wadi System assume that the timing
and rate of the tariff adjustments would coincide with the tariff increases
for the whole country. This would result in a good financial performance for



- 29 -
Wadi producing a 4.5% rate of return in 1981, 4.3% in 1982 and 7.2% in 1983.
From 1982 onwards the Wadi's cash generation would be such that it would
eliminate the need for the Government grants for its construction requirements
and that sufficient surplus would be available to contribute to the Aden-system
needs.
Fuel Adjustment Charge
3.10      The financial forecasts assume that the present fuel prices will
continue through 1978 and that they will increase at 5% per annum from 1979.
Since PDRY has no oil resources and has to depend on imported crude oil for
its needs sensitivity analyses were conducted for increases in fuel costs from
0 to 50% in steps of 10%. The results of the analyses on financial ratios are
included in Table 3.8. The results indicate that the financial performance is
very sensitive to fuel price changes. The Government will permit the Corpora-
tion to adjust its tariffs to take account of changes in fuel costs through a
suitable fuel cost adjustment provision in the tariff.
Depreciation Policy
3.11      PCEP's depreciation rates for various categories of assets in
service are unrealistically high (average depreciation rate in 1976 was 8%)
resulting in high depreciation expenses with corresponding impact on earnings.
The Corporation's Management has agreed to revise the depreciation rates to
conform to conventional utility practices (suggested depreciation rates are
in para 8 of Attachement 3.1) and to use these rates in PCEP's accounts com-
mencing with its fiscal year 1978 for the various categories of assets sub-
ject to ratification by PCEP's Board. If the Board recommends higher rates
of depreciation than those recommended, the rate of return would be adversely
affected and a much higher and more frequent tariff increases than those assumed
in the forecast would be necessary to meet the financial covenants agreed with
the Association. In order to illustrate this sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted for increases in depreciation rates from 0 to 50% in steps of 10%. The
results of the analyses on the financial ratios are included in Table 3.9.
The results indicate that the financial performance is sensitive to deprecia-
tion rate changes.
Revaluation of Assets
3.12      Since PCEP's rate of return will be computed on revalued assets,
PCEP will formulate the principles and procedures for revaluation and submit
them to the Association for comments by not later than December 31, 1979, and
after reaching agreement with the Association on such principles and procedures
will follow them for the revaluation of its assets from 1980 onwards. The
Association will provide whatever technical assistance is possible in carrying
out this revaluation.
Audit
3.13      The Central Board of Audit created under Law No. 16 of 1972 is
charged with the sole responsibility for auditing the accounts of all Govern-
ment Departments and enterprises in the public sector and also, on a voluntary



- 30 -
basis, of some companies in the private sector. The Director General, the
head of the Board, is appointed by the President of the Republic and can be
removed from office only by him. There is no legal bar to the employment of
the Board staff, including the Directors and Director General, in other organ-
izations. The Board reports directly to the Prime Minister and is independent
of the various executive departments of Government.
3.14      The Board's officials stated that the Board conducts its audit
according to internationally accepted auditing principles. It reviews in
detail all procedures of enterprises and undertakes physical verification of
cash and inventories, both on a regular basis and on a surprise basis, as a
part of its audit. It also obtains confirmation of balances from customers.
The Board was not in a position to give the appraisal mission an idea of the
extent of its audit checks because the percentages of items selected for check
are treated as confidential. For large corporations such as PCEP, a resident
audit group is permanently assigned to the corporation to conduct a concurrent
audit, and in addition there is the usual year-end audit of the accounts of
the corporation. The law allows four months for the Board's audit of an
enterprise's accounts but this period, the Board officials stated, could be
reduced to two months in urgent cases. The Board would give priority to the
audit of enterprises which are implementing IDA-financed projects.  The Gov-
ernment will authorize the Board to accord such priority in auditing PCEP's
accounts.
3.15      The Board satisfies the criterion of being independent auditors.
Considering the qualifications and experience of its staff, the Board's
audit would also seem to serve the purpose of attesting to the reliability
of PCEP's financial statements. The Board could therefore be accepted for
the present as independent auditors satisfactory to the Association under
the proposed project. A firm judgment about the quality of its audit could be
formed after we have some experience of its audit work. As regards the period
for submission of PCEP's audited accounts, considering that PCEP's accounting
department is reasonably well-organized, it should be possible for PCEP to
furnish the Association with audited accounts within a period of five months
after the close of the year. PCEP will accordingly furnish the Association
with its accounts duly audited by independent auditors satisfactory to the
Association within a period of five months after the close of the fiscal year.
Insurance
3.16      PCEP has not been insuring its assets against any risks.  It will,
not later than June 30, 1979: (a) take out and maintain with responsible
insurers, insurance against such risks and in such amounts as shall be con-
sistent with appropriate practice; or (b) insure against such risk, to the
satisfaction of the Association, through other arrangements, including
Governmental guarantee.
Debt Limitation Covenant
3.17      In order to ensure that PCEP does not assume heavy debt service
burdens which will jeopardize its financial viability, it is proposed to



- 31 -
apply to the proposed Credit the standard debt service covenant which would
require the Association's prior concurrence for fresh borrowing of long-term
debts from January 1, 1979 unless PCEP's net revenues before depreciation
and interest for the fiscal year next preceding such borrowing, or for a
later 12-month period ending prior to such borrowing, shall be at least 1.5
times the maximum debt service including that on the debt to be incurred.
PCEP has agreed to this covenant.
Performance Indicators
3.18      The development program is expected to make electricity more acces-
sible to PDRY's urban areas outside Aden and rural population. The institu-
tional and financial reforms are expected to strengthen PCEP's management and
improve its financial performance. PCEP will introduce, not later than June
30, 1979, operational procedures adequate to monitor, in accordance with
indicators acceptable to the Association: (i) the trend of electricity
demand for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes; (ii) PCEP's opera-
tional efficiency and quality of services; and (iii) the financial position of
PCEP. Suitable performance indicators which could serve as guide are given in
Table 3.10.

PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
WADI HADRAMOUT ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR ELECTRIC POWER (PCEP)
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. Income Statement
1.         Sales of Electricity have been based on PCEP's planned allocations
to the existing and new large consumers in the Aden System in the next five-
year plan ending 1983, the rate of growth of other Aden consumers at 12% per
annum and the median forecast of PCR for Wadi Hadramout. Average tariff
increases for the forecast period have been assumed to be 20% in 1980 and
30% in 1983 to (a) at least break even in 1980, and to (b) yield an after-
tax rate of return of at least 2% in 1981, gradually increasing to a return
of 8% in 1985. The interim targets will be agreed between IDA and PCEP by
December 31, 1981. For projection purposes a 30% tariff increase from January
1983 which would produce a 5.4% rate of return has been assumed. The proposed
tariff study is expected to recommend an appropriate tariff structure.
2.        Other Operating Revenues comprising connection and maintenance
charges, according to PCEP's estimates, are estimated to increase by 8% p.a.
in 1977 and 1978 and 5% p.a. thereafter.
3.        Other Non-Operating Revenues represent incomes from short-term
investments, such as deposits with the banks and with Crown Agents, London.
Also included is the income from sale of scrap, distilled water, etc. The
projections based on PCEP estimates are YD 23,300 in 1977 and YD 20,700 in
1978 through 1983.
4.         Fuel and Lubricants requirements are based on estimates of genera-
tion from steam units and diesel units using 98% heavy oil and 2% diesel
oil (for starting) and the following specific fuel consumptions and costs.
PCR's estimates for lubricating oil at 0.2 fils/kWh generated for Wadi
is assumed for Aden System also.
(a) Specific consumptions of fuels are:
Steam Plants        -  1 lb/kWh (12.5 fils)
New Diesel Plants - 0.5 lb/kWh (6.0 fils)
Old Diesel Plants - 0.835 lb/kWh (17 fils for Abyan and
16 fils for all other places)



- 44 -                         Attachment 3.1
Page 2 of 5
(b) Fuel Costs (1978 Prices)
Heavy Oil YD 23.500/Ton
Diesel Oil YD 52/Ton
Fuel price increases are assumed at 5% p.a. for "current" price esti-
mates.
(c) Cost of purchased power was 6.5 fils/kWh in 1977, is 8 fils in 1978
and would be 8 fils in 1979.
5.         Salary and Wage estimates are based on 1976 actuals for the
Aden System projected for the next five-year plan period as shown below and
PCR's estimates for Wadi Hadramout.
for Aden System:
1977            -  8% over 1976
1978            -  4% increase in salaries and wages for
inflation
1979 thru '83  -  2% p.a. increase in manpower
-  6% p.a. increase in salaries and wages for
inflation
6.         Cost of Materials other than Fuel is based on the following:
1977            -  same as in 1976
1978            -  6% increase over 1976
1979 thru '83  -  4% p.a. increase
(8% inflation for statements at current prices is assumed).
For Wadi 2% of capital costs per year has been assumed.
7.        Other Operating Expenses are based on the following:
1977            -  same as 1976
1978 thru '83 - 1977 expenses plus 20% of salaries and wages
to cover PCEP's contributions to State Pension
Fund.
8.        Depreciation.  Following rates appropriate for PDRY's operating con-
ditions are assumed.

9.         Interest is calculated as follows:
(a) The Government will set off in 1978 its six loans to PCEP
of total value YD 1,295,148 at different interest rates
varying between 3% and 6-7/8% against its unpaid elec-
tricity bills of total value of approximately one million
dinars accumulated since 1969.
(b) The following terms have been assumed for the Credit and loans
for the Project:
(i)  IDA Credit to be relent to PCEP  -  $5 million at 7.5% p.a.
interest, a 5-year grace
period and 20-year repay-
ment.
(ii)  Arab Fund Loan to be relent to   -  $14.5 million at 4% p.a.
PCEP                                   interest, a 5-year grace
period and 20-year repay-
ment.
1/   These rates may be subject to some modification before final approval
by PCEP.



- 46 -                         Attachment 3.1
Page 4 of 5
(iii)  Islamic Bank Loan to be relent   -  $5.5 million at 2% p.a.,
to PCEP                               a 5-year grace period and
20-year repayment.
B. Balance Sheet
10.       Gross Fixed Assets in Service are valued at historical costs.  Asset
additions are valued at 1977 prices for the constant price (1977) forecasts,
and at current prices for the current price forecasts. Inventories include
two month fuel requirements and spares of value eqivalent to 1% of the gross
fixed assets.
11.       Accounts Receivable include the PCEP's electricity bills remaining
unpaid by Government for about 8 years and about 75 days' sale of electricity
to others. After the Government sets off its dues against its six loans to
PCEP, and after PCEP improves its collection procedures the receivables are
estimated to be about 40-day's sale of electricity.
12.       Accounts Payable would include the following:
(a) two-month fuel bill; and
(b) a month's requirement of materials other than fuel.
13.       Capital Reserves constitute the value of items PCEP receives from
other Government Departments free of charge.  These are not expected to
increase.
14.       Government Grants include grants from the Government for all capital
expenditures for PCEP's expansion, the foreign cost of which are met from
the proceeds of foreign loans to the Government. However, the three Wadi
Hadramout loans would be relent to PCEP. IDA credit would be relent at 7.5%
p.a., the Bank's current terms. The Islamic Bank and Arab Fund portions are
expected to be relent on the same terms and conditions at which the Government
receives the loans.
15.       Consumer Deposits are estimated to increase by the same percentages
as kWh sales of electricity.
16.       Other Deposits are estimated to increase by using the same rate of
increase during the historical period 1975 and 1976.
17.       Provision for Taxation includes tax liability at 37.5% plus payment
to equalizing fund at 5% of the tax liability.
18.       Government Operating Subsidies are paid out of the equalizing funds
to cover PCEP's losses.

19.       Studies and Training are amortized over the life of the related
projects.
20.       Long-term Investments are not expected to increase during the
next five-year plan period.

CHAPTER IV
ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Load Forecast
4.01       The forecast of the growth of demand for electricity in Wadi
Hadramout is based on different sets of assumptions for each of the consump-
tion categories: domestic, state and cooperative farms, and industrial and
commercial. The state and cooperative farms' demand for electricity is
presented as irrigation pumping because water pumping constitutes the bulk
of their respective power requirements. The forecast for each category of
consumption is presented in Table 4.1.
Domestic Consumers
4.02       Population statistics for the Wadi are relatively recent; i.e.
available only since 1973. Between 1973 and 1977, the Wadi's population which
is mainly rural grew at an average annual rate of 3% reaching an estimated
202,000 inhabitants in 1977, while domestic electricity consumption grew at
an average annual rate of 6% during the same period.   This growth rate is
believed to be an underestimate of the real potential for future growth in
demand, principally because of the constraints on production imposed by the
limited capacity of the existing isolated systems.
4.03       Domestic demand for electricity is assumed to grow at an average
annual rate of 9% because of the following reasons: (a) living conditions in
the Wadi continue to improve and are expected to be better in 1980 relative to
1977; (b) the Government's development program (tubewells, agro-industries,
schools, etc.) will in turn increase the demand for electricity; and (c) the
Project through its transmission and distribution components will increase the
rural population access to electricity. It is expected that some 50 towns and
villages with more than 100 houses each and located at less than 10 kilometers
from the irrigation pumping networks (totalling about 16 thousand houses),
would be connected to the system after 1980. Priority in providing electric
power during the first year of Project electrification (1980) would be given
to State and cooperative farms. The population supplied with electricity by
1983, when the Project would be completed, is estimated at some 80,000 or
about 40% of the total population of Wadi Hadramout including the about 65,000
inhabitants of the four major towns: Tarim, Saywun, Shibam and Al Qatn.
State and Cooperative Farms
4.04       Electricity consumption for irrigation pumping would account for
about 80% of total consumption in the Wadi, till about 1986 when the irriga-
tion scheme would be completed. About 30% of the irrigation pumping demand
would be for the state farms. There are seven state farms currently operating
in the Wadi; two are supplied with electricity from local generating units.
Two additional farms are under construction and are scheduled for completion



- 49 -
by 1979 (see Map IBRD 13398R). The forecast assumes that state farms would be
connected to the central system by 1980 because of their importance to the
economy. It also assumes that water pumping in the state farms would be inter-
rupted during day and evening peak hours in the Wadi. To accomplish this,
Government will issue appropriate instructions through the Ministry of Agri-
culture. Seven additional state farms are included in the 1980-1985 develop-
ment plan. However, their respective location and date of construction has
not yet been determined. The forecast assumes that the new farms would be
established parallel with the Government's plan for increasing the number of
tubewells. Detailed plans for the new farms will not be available until 1979
when the study currently being conducted to determine the water resources of
the Wadi has been completed. Allowing for the lead time required for the
construction of the farms, their demand for electricity is projected in the
forecast to start after 1983.
4.05       Cooperative farming is the Wadi's major industry, principally
depending on open wells for their irrigation water (2,000 open wells in use
in 1976). Nature of cropping pattern requires pumping virtually year-round,
so there is little seasonal variation. In 1976, the Government launched a
program to improve irrigation in the Wadi which included the replacement of
open wells by tubewells that could reach lower aquifers of lesser salt content.
When completed, the program will result in each tubewell (25-30 liters per
second) replacing four of the existing open wells. The load forecast assumes
that for irrigation pumping each tubewell will require on the average a 25-HP
motor driving a 5" diameter delivery pipe pump.
4.06       Although the tubewells are being drilled throughout the Wadi accord-
ing to priorities set by the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, an
overall program of tubewells location for 1979-1983 is not available. However,
based on the drilling progress already accomplished, the forecast assumes that
40 tubewells will be drilled in 1978 and 52 wells/year will be drilled until
1983 and increasing to 63 wells/year until the end of 1986. That is, 169
irrigation pumps will be connected to the grid by 1980 including the wells
drilled prior to 1978. By 1986, a total of 514 irrigation pumps would be
connected to the central grid.
Irrigation Pumping Load and Water Availability
4.07       The growth of the irrigation pumping load depends on the avail-
ability of underground water which, in turn, determines the bulk of the state
and cooperative farms' load growth. Preliminary water and soil studies of
Wadi Hadramout undertaken by a Soviet mission (1969-1971) concluded that the
level of the upper aquifer had fallen between 0.5 m to 2.0 m in the study area
This was attributed to increased irrigation pumping after 1961. A more recent
study (completed in February 1976) conducted by the Office of Technical Co-
operation of the United Nations, is more encouraging. Based on its findings
and on the preliminary results of SOGREAH (see para. 2.08), it is expected
that pumping from the lower aquifers will improve the situation.
4.08       According to the Government plans, the gross extraction from the
lower aquifer by 1985 would amount to 160 million cubic meters per year



- 50 -
compared to the current extraction of 130 million cubic meters per year. The
Ministry of Agriculture has provided evidence that to date, the permissible
extraction rate has not been reached. The anticipated safe extraction rate of
underground water is set at 160 million cubic meters per year, to be achieved
by 1985 as compared to the current rate of 130 cubic meters.
4.09      The forecast of the irrigation pumping load growth provides for an
optimum level of pumping in 1983 of 110 million cubic meters which represents
85% of the present rate of extraction. This will allow the ongoing irrigation
study undertaken by SOGREAH under a separate IDA credit (see para 2.08), which
is expected to be completed by late 1979, to be considered and implemented
without affecting the justification of the Project. The forecast assumes
water extraction rates to increase to 160 million cubic meters per year
between 1983 and 1987 and stabilize at that level thereafter. However, in the
economic justification of the Project, the sensitivity of the return on the
Project to the maintenance of the rate of water extraction at 110 million
cubic meters throughout the life of the Project is assessed (see para. 4.18).
Industrial and Commercial Loads
4.10      The industrial and commercial loads are based on the Government's
second five-year economic plan (the first five-year plan ends in December
1978). Among the principal industrial and commercial loads expected between
1980 and 1983 are a tomato paste plant, a brick factory, grain mills, a cold
storage plant for vegetables and meats, and an ice factory. The load also
includes several schools, hospitals and clinics, and two large potable water
pumping stations. In the forecast, the load is assumed to start in 1980
and to grow at an annual rate of 10% until 1983 and drop to 9% thereafter.
B. Comparison of Alternatives
4.11      To determine the least-cost alternative for supplying the Wadi with
electricity, the following set of comparisons were undertaken by the consul-
tant:
(a) Four isolated systems versus a central power
station in the Wadi;
(b) Central plant at the Wadi supplied by oil pipe-
line versus power transmission from Mukalla; and
(c) Central plant at the Wadi supplied by road tankers
versus power transmission from Mukalla.
(a)  Isolated Systems Versus a Central Power Plant.  This involved
the construction of four new small power plants at the princi-
pal load centers (at Tarim, Al-Ghuraf Qaraw and Al-Qatn) each
supplying separate 11-kV networks as opposed to a central
power station at Qaraw and a more extensive transmission



- 51 -
and distribution network (including 33-kV and 11-kV lines).
The difference in capital cost between the two alternatives
is small (YD 0.1 million or US$0.29 million). However, the
operating cost associated with the four small plants is
greater than that of the single plant because the amount
of labor required for operation and maintenance is signif-
icantly higher for the four isolated systems (80 men for
the four plants versus 29 for the single plant). Also,
smaller plants tend to be less efficient in their consump-
tion of fuel relative to larger size generating plants.
(b)  Central Plant at the Wadi Fueled by Oil Pipeline Versus
Transmission from Mukalla. The comparison involved the con-
struction of a large plant at Qaraw with fuel being supplied
by an oil pipeline connecting Qaraw to Mukalla versus the
construction of a plant at Mukalla and transmitting power
through a 132-kV double circuit line (300 kilometer). The
pipeline diameter of 3.26" was used in the analysis.
(c)  Central Plant at the Wadi Fueled by Road Tanker Fleet Versus
Transmission from Mukalla. The comparison involved a power
plant at Mukalla, 132-kV transmission network linking Mukalla
to the Wadi (300 kilometer) versus a power plant in Qaraw
supplied by road tanker fleet. In both (b) above and (c),
the power plant at Mukalla had to be larger in capacity to
compensate for losses in transmitting power over 300 kilo-
meters. The solution of a steam power plant in Mukalla would
also have the disadvantage of requiring at least four years
for its erection and therefore would not meet the needs of
the Wadi. In addition, the 300 km 132-kV line over the
desert between Mukalla and the Wadi would make maintenance
expensive and difficult.
4.12      The Project is the least-cost alternative for meeting the forecast
demand in Wadi Hadramout because it had the lowest present value relative to
the alternatives considered at discount rates up to 21%
C. Return on Investment
4.13      The rate of return on investment is the discount rate that equates
the sum of the present values of the benefit streams and the sum of the
present values of the cost streams, both measured over the expected life of
the Project. Only the measurable benefits and costs are addressed in the
analysis. Measurable benefits comprise the revenues generated from the sale
of electricity and the savings stemming from: (a) the substitution of resi-
dual oil for the currently used diesel fuel; and (b) transportation cost
reduction accruing from substituting a single generating plant for the four
existing isolated plants. Measurable costs consist of the capital cost,
operation and maintenance cost and fuel cost including transportation. At



- 52 -
the time of the analysis, conversion factors for expressing local costs in
PDRY in terms of their equivalent border value were not available in the Bank.
Consequently, with the exception of fuel used for generation and for trans-
portation for which the cost to the economy (international price) is readily
available, all other costs and benefit streams are expressed in terms of their
local cost.
Non-Quantifiable Benefits
4.14      Several benefits attributable to the Project are socio-economic
and cannot be quantified such as improved quality of life associated with
increased access to electricity, increased potential for the initiation of
small cottage industries with employment potential that could stem rural
migration, improved irrigation pumping and savings in maintenance cost of
pumping stations.
Measurable Benefits
4.15      Two streams of measurable benefits are included in the analysis:
(a) revenues accruing from the sale of electricity; and (b) savings associated
with the execution of the Project.
(a) Revenues from Sales of Electricity. The currently prevailing
tariffs in the Wadi are used as a proxy for the consumers
willingness to pay. For all types of consumption other than
irrigation, an average revenue of 50 fils/kWh (USe 14.5)
is used, while an average revenue of 25 fils/kWh (US4 7.25)
is used for power sold for irrigation pumping. It is assumed
that the industrial customers (expected by 1982) would pay
50 fils/kWh in 1978 prices.
(b) Savings. There are two types of savings that would be
realized when the Project is implemented: fuel savings and
savings in the cost of transporting the fuel to the Wadi.
Fuel savings refer to the economic cost (border price) of
the diesel fuel currently used by the existing isolated
systems at Saywun, Tarim, Shiban and Al-Qatn that will be
avoided by converting the power system of the Wadi to a
central power plant fueled by cheaper fuel (80% residual
oil and 20% diesel oil). Fuel savings are based on the
assumption that for each of the five years (1980-1984),
20% of the total existing diesel operated open wells
would be replaced by electric operated tubewells. Savings
in fuel transportation cost refers to the reduction in the
cost of transporting fuel from the port city of Mukalla to
each of the four small systems (the cost of fuel used by
the Project includes the cost of transportation from
Mukalla to Qaraw). The estimate of transportation cost
saving is based on a set of assumptions summarized in



- 53 -
Annex 1. For the analysis, the economic cost of trans-
portation by tanker fleets is estimated to be 4 fils/ton-
kilometers (Table 4.2). The transportation cost is based
on a round trip between Mukalla and the location of each
of the existing systems in the Wadi.
Measurable Cost
Fixed Project Costs
4.16       This denotes the capital cost associated with construction of the
generating plant, the transmission and distribution networks; all expressed
in 1978 prices. Project costs (foreign and local) are used as given in the
engineering estimate including physical contingency but excluding price con-
tingencies. The cost of pumps are not included in the analysis since open-
well pumps would be replaced by tubewell pumps independently of the Project
(para. 4.05). If the Project is not implemented, the Government would use
diesel pumps which would not require less capital outlays than a substitute
electric pump.
Variable Project Costs
4.17       This encompasses operation and maintenance cost and the economic
cost of fuel. Since the generating plant will use a mixture of diesel (20%)
and residual oil (80%) as fuel, fuel cost is expressed in terms of the inter-
nationally prevailing prices for the two fuels in a proportion identical to
the mixture to be used. The economic cost of transporting the fuel from
Mukalla to the generating site at Qaraw is incorporated in the cost of fuel.
The operation and maintenance cost is assumed to be equal to 2% of the capital
cost (expressed in 1978 prices).
Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
4.18       The rate of return on the Project is about 15%.  This is based on
existing tariffs in the Wadi and that irrigation pumping requires an annual
underground water extraction rate of 160 million cubic meters to be achieved
by 1986 and maintained thereafter. However, if an annual rate of extraction
of 110 million cubic meters is maintained throughout the assumed life of the
Project, the rate of return decreases to 12.75%. In both cases the rate of
return represents a conservative return on the investment because there are
additional non-quantifiable benefits associated with the Project that were not
included in the analysis (para. 4.14).
4.19       The rate of return would increase to 16-1/2% if the average revenue/
kWh would increase by 10%, while it would decrease to 10-1/2% if the cost of
the Project would increase by 20%. In addition, if the domestic consumers
in the Wadi are allowed a subsidy by maintaining their tariff at its 1978
level (50 fils/kWh) while increasing the tariffs for irrigation and indus-
trial and commercial consumption by 15%, the rate of return would be about
17%.

CHAPTER V
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      The Government will:
(a) complete a tariff study to be financed from the Credit,
covering all electricity supplied by PCEP, by December 31,
1979, with the assistance of consultants and under terms
of reference satisfactory to the Association (1.32);
(b) sign loan agreements between the Government and the external
cofinanciers to cover the remaining foreign cost of the
Project, as a condition of credit effectiveness (2.12);
(c) assign a senior representative of PCEP to the Advisory
Committee of the Hadramout Project Organization not later
than December 31, 1978, to ensure the coordination between
the deep well drilling program and the development of
electric networks in the Wadi (2.24);
(d) permit PCEP's tariffs to be adjusted to take account of
changes in fuel costs through a fuel-cost adjustment
provision (3.10); and
(e) authorize the Audit Board to accord priority in auditing
PCEP's accounts (3.14).
5.02      PCEP will:
(a)  fill the post of the Deputy Chief Accountant before December 31,
1978 (1.25);
(b) submit to the Association before December 31, 1978 qualifi-
cations and proposed program for individuals selected for
overseas training (1.30);
(c) create a project unit in Wadi Hadramout, led by a full-time
engineer with adequate experience in network construction
(2.18);
(d) have the work to be executed by force account designed and
costed in detail prior to construction (2.18);
(e) follow an accounting/costing system suitable to ensure
proper allocation of all costs for the project and to
measure the performance of work executed by force
account (2.18);
(f) appoint a consultant for the Project (2.18);



- 57 -
(g) provide the Association by December 31, 1979 with a proposal
for establishing an operation unit to be responsible for
managing, operating and maintaining the electric system in
Wadi Hadramount, and to establish this unit not later than
June 30, 1980, under management and operational procedures
acceptable to the Association (2.18);
(h) apply the depreciation rates suggested in the appraisal report
for accounts commencing from 1978 subject to ratification by
its Board (3.11);
(i) furnish the Association with its accounts duly audited by
independent auditors satisfactory to the Association within a
period of five months after the close of the fiscal year (3.15);
(j) obtain the Association's prior concurrence for fresh borrowing
of long term debts from January 1, 1979 unless PCEP's net
revenues before depreciation, and interest for the fiscal year
next preceding such borrowing, or for a later 12-month period
ending prior to such borrowing, shall be at least 1.5 times
the maximum debt service including that on the debt to be
incurred (3.17); and
(k) develop by June 30, 1979 suitable performance indicators (3.18).
5.03      The Government and PCEP have agreed to the following:
(a) That PCEP will earn revenues suffient to cover operating
costs including depreciation, and interest, in 1980 and
achieve a rate of return of at least 2% in 1981, progres-
sively increasing to not less than 8% in 1985 and there-
after, on realistically valued assets (3.04), the principles
of asset revaluation to be agreed with the Association no
later than December 31, 1979 (3.12). PCEP will take by
December 31, 1979 measures to achieve the above level of reve-
nues in 1980 and by December 31, 1981 establish rate of return
targets satisfactory to the Association for 1982, 1983 and 1984.
(b) No later than June 30, 1979, PCEP will either implement an
insurance policy consistent with sound utility practices, or
insure against such risks to the satisfaction of the Association,
through other arrangements including governmental guarantee (3.16).
5.04      The Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$5 million to be on-
lent to PCEP. Execution of loan agreements with colenders and of Subsidiary
Loan Agreement between Government and PCEP, creation of a Project Unit in Wadi
Hadramout and appointment of a consultant for the Project would be conditions
of effectiveness of the Credit.
