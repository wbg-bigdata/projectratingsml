SUMMARY

1.      The closing date for the Moldova Public Financial Management Technical
Assistance Project (PFMTA) will be extended for twelve months from December 31,
2012 to December 31, 2013.The extension was requested by the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) on December 21, 2012 to allow for the completion of the Financial Management
Information System (FMIS) and achievement of the Project Development Objective
(PDO). The new budget classification, chart of accounts, internal audit practices
supported by the project can only be fully implemented with the FMIS in place. The
implementation of the FMIS will benefit the public financial management (PFM) system
of the country and has major implications on the budget support provided by the World
Bank, the European Union (EU) and other donors. The high-level commitment of the
management of the MoF, as evidenced by appointment of the Deputy Minister as Project
Manager in 2012 and improved project management practices, provides a basis for the
successful completion of the FMIS in 2013. Given that all the efforts will be directed
towards the implementation of the FMIS and that non-FMIS related objectives were
achieved, the portion of the IDA credit not related to FMIS development will be
cancelled as part of this restructuring.

PROJECT STATUS

2.      Credit 40820 in the amount of US$ 8.55 million was approved on June 16, 2006.
The PFMTA Project is also co-financed by two Grants – the Dutch Grant
TF055170(US$4.11) and SIDA Grant TF054017(US$ 2.15) that are closing on December
31, 2012, and a third SIDA Grant TF094801 in the amount of US$2.71 million which has
been fully disbursed and closed. The project finances modernization of budget planning
and execution system, including FMIS development and methodological changes;
internal audit and control reform; training capacity and training in PFM; and project
management activities. The project has undergone two restructurings, extending the
closing date from the original closing date of June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011, and
then to December 31, 2012. Out of the total credit amount of US$ 8.55 million, US$ 1.22
million has been disbursed so far and US$ 6.9 million have been committed for the FMIS
contract.

3.      The project consists of two major components: Component 1 related to budget
reforms and FMIS implementation, and Component 2 related to internal control and
audit. Component 2 was financed under the Grant TF054017 and Component 1 is co-
financed by the IDA credit and the TFs (TF055170 and TF094801). The IDA credit is
used to finance the FMIS contract and activities that support MoF supervision of the
vendor, such as the International FMIS Advisor.

4.     The project has accomplished many of its intended results as reflected in the
achievement of the intermediate outcome indicators that are not related to FMIS

                                          1
implementation. Under Component 1 (sub-components 1a and 1b on budget execution
and preparation), the project supported the introduction of the single treasury account that
contributed to increased transparency and efficiency of budget management through
consolidation of all national public budget balances. New methodological guidelines for
budget preparation developed under the project integrate medium-term budget planning
into the overall budget cycle and enable stronger links between budget allocations and
government policy priorities. Alignment of the newly developed budget classification and
chart of accounts with international standards has laid a solid foundation for improved
transparency of budget and financial reporting. Component 2 has helped strengthen the
internal audit function following the EU type decentralized Public Internal Financial
Control (PIFC) model.

5.      By contrast with good progress achieved under sub-components 1a, 1b and 2 of
the project, the biggest project sub-component 1c, which involves implementation of the
new FMIS, had experienced significant difficulties until recently. The delays were related
to poor performance of the contractor, including delayed development and testing, as well
as weak project management by the MoF. The MoF and the contractor took considerable
time to agree on the detailed functional specifications of the system, as well as the
mechanics of implementation of functions in the new system. This led to the need to
extend the project in December 2011 until the current closing date of December 31, 2012.
The extension envisaged the signing of Amendment #5 to the contract that would set a
new implementation schedule for 2012 to provide for a formal implementation
framework. There were considerable delays in signing Amendment #5 to the contract due
to disagreements between the vendor and the MoF on implementation arrangements. The
situation was complicated by weak project management and lack of regular reporting
from the MoF on the project implementation between January and June 2012.

6.      The situation with project implementation has considerably improved in the
second half of 2012. Contract Amendment #5 was signed on August 8, 2012, and there
was improved progress in project implementation. The amendment has provided a basis
for system implementation in 2012 in terms of implementation schedule. As a result, the
vendor has intensified efforts in system development. The MoF has strengthened project
management by appointing the Deputy Minister of Finance as Project Manager, hiring
additional staff to the PIU and providing weekly monitoring reports. Reflecting these
improvements, the implementation progress (IP) rating was upgraded to “Moderately
Satisfactory? from “Moderately Unsatisfactory? in the previous Implementation Status
and Results (ISR) report. Because FMIS implementation has critical importance for the
achievement of the PDO and most of the results expected under project Component 1, the
PDO rating remains “Moderately Unsatisfactory.?

7.     Improved project progress was insufficient to compensate for the lost six months
in the beginning of 2012. Moreover, the vendor was using an off-site model of
development, with only few staff in Chisinau. It has been agreed to modify this approach,
and some improvements were made by the vendor recently.

8.      The risk to achievement of the PDO was assessed as Substantial. This reflected
the fact that while there are considerable improvements in the budget preparation process,

                                             2
MTEF and internal audit, the ultimate objective of strengthening public financial
management cannot be fully achieved without the FMIS. The risk is now mitigated by the
Time-Bound Action Plan (TBAP) jointly agreed by the MoF and the vendor, appointment
of the Deputy Minister as Project Manager, and strengthened PIU and monitoring
arrangements.

9.       At the same time, the implementation of the FMIS is feasible based on MoF’s
commitment (elevated project status with the appointment of the Deputy Minister as
Project Manager and attention of the top management), implementation plan agreed with
the vendor, and improved project management practices (weekly monitoring reports and
VCs, weekly management meetings with the vendor, strengthened PIU). During
November 2012, the MoF, the vendor and its sub-contractors have resolved most issues
requiring clarification on the system’s functionality and fine-tuned the previously
discussed requirements to allow for the completion of FMIS development and testing. In
addition, a TBAP was developed, envisaging a schedule for FMIS implementation
activities, as well as resources committed by the vendor and its sub-contractors, including
a substantial increase in the number of staff (on site and off site). This plan provides a
basis for the successful completion of FMIS development by August 31, 2013 and
subsequent acceptance of the system and refinements by the end of 2013.

10.     The current low disbursement level can be considerably improved only after the
operational acceptance of the FMIS. So far, the MoF has paid to the FMIS supplier 35
percent of the total contract price amounting to US$10.4 million. The initial payments
under the FMIS contract had to be made from the successor Grant TF094801 that was
fully used and closed in October 2011. US$3.77 have been disbursed from TF055170 and
US$1.51 has been disbursed from TF054017. Hence, out of the total IDA credit amount
of US$8.55 million, only US$1.22 million has been disbursed so far while remaining
commitments stand at US$6.9 million (roughly 80 percent of the IDA credit).
Amendment #5 envisaged shifting all remaining payments until the system’s operational
acceptance, and thus commitments under the FMIS contract will only be realized once
the FMIS is operational by the new closing date.

11.     There are no financial management issues associated with the project, and project
audits are up to date.


PROPOSED CHANGES

12.    Implementation arrangements. A TBAP for the project has been jointly developed
by the MoF and the vendor and reviewed by the World Bank (Annex 1). The TBAP
describes actions required to develop the FMIS and monitor the implementation process.
In addition to the TBAP, the contractor and the MoF agreed on a detailed plan that
envisages a strengthened quality assurance mechanism on the vendor’s side, as well as
increased human resources allocated by the contractor and its sub-contractors.

13.    Closing date. The proposed extension will constitute the third extension of the
closing date. In the letter of the MoF dated December 21, 2012, the Borrower requested
extending the Credit closing date by one year. The proposed extension of the closing date
                                            3
from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 for FMIS-related activities is based on
the TBAP jointly agreed by the Borrower and the vendor, which includes detailed actions
and milestones for testing and development of FMIS (Annex 1). The TBAP envisages
August 31, 2013 as the date for the system’s operational acceptance and testing. An
additional four months are added to allow for completion of the operational acceptance
procedures, training on system use from the contractor and for remaining payments.

14.     The team recognizes that the risk to the PDO remains significant and the pace and
quality of FMIS implementation have yet to be fully restored. At the same time, a number
of positive developments have taken place in the recent months, which if sustained, will
allow for full implementation of the FMIS by the proposed new closing date. The vendor
has strengthened its performance, mobilized additional resources on-site and has
intensified efforts to address outstanding issues. Additionally, good progress has been
made in development and testing of FMIS application software, FMIS release 1 through 3
testing has been completed. Additional procurements have been launched for training
supporting FMIS roll-out. Given the above, the team proposes that the World Bank
approves a technical extension of the closing date from December 31, 2012 to December
31, 2013 to allow full FMIS implementation.

15.     Cancellation. The project extension will only apply to FMIS-related activities. All
efforts of the MoF will be focused on the completion of FMIS development and its
implementation. The remaining portion of the IDA Credit in the amount of US$ 600,000
will be cancelled. This amount is currently unallocated and results from financing of the
originally envisaged activities through trust funds, as well as cost savings.

16.     Grants. The grants co-financing the project - TF055170 and TF054017, will be
closed on December 31, 2012. Most of the activities under these grants have been
successfully completed, delivering improved budget methodology, including MTEF and
internal audit improvements. The remaining balance will be returned to the donors (the
forecasted balances are US$ 236,000 under TF055170 and US$ 354,000 under
TF054017, subject to adjustment as of December 31, 2012).
