                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the project is to minimize the threat in the Kyrgyz Republic posed by the Highly Pathogenic AvianInfluenza(HPAI) infection as well as
                         other poultry and livestock diseases and to prepare for the control and response to aninfluenza pandemic and other zoonotic or infectious disease emergencies
                         in humans.

                         Financing for the animal health component of that project. The project activity to support the establishment of a compensation fund has been modified to adapt to the unique situation
                         in Kyrgyzstan and the Government proposed to undertake a pilot program to demonstrate the utility of such a fund to producers and the industry for disease control.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The activities completed to date have contributed to achieving the Project Development Objectives. The country is better prepared for an HPAI outbreak than prior to the project, but
                         there are still some activities that need to be completed in order to finish this work. The funds allocated for core project activities and operations are expected to be fully disbursed and
                         the funds allocated for the Animal Disease Control and Compensation Fund (ADCCF) are subject to establishment of a legal framework but are expected to be disbursed under the
