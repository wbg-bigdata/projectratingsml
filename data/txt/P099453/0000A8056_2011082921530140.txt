                         The overall objective of the project is to minimize the threat in the Kyrgyz Republic posed by the Highly Pathogenic AvianInfluenza (HPAI) infection as well as
                         other poultry and livestock diseases and to prepare for the control and response to aninfluenza pandemic and other zoonotic or infectious disease emergencies
                         in humans.

                         The project has been making satisfactory progress. The Kyrgyz Republic is much better prepared for an outbreak of avian influenza than at the outset of the project, and considering
                         the reduced risks associated with an outbreak of avian influenza, the project was restructured in June 2010 to address a broader scope of disease risks. This is being carried out in

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The activities completed to date have contributed to achieving the Project Development Objectives. The country is better prepared for an HPAI outbreak than prior to the project, but
                         there are still some activities that need to be completed in order to finish this work. Although the funds allocated for core project activities and operations are expected to be fully
                         disbursed, the funds allocated for the Animal Disease Control and Compensation Fund (ADCCF) are subject to establishment of a legal framework, and are at risk of remaining
                         undisbursed.
