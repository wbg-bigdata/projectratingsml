INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ISRAEL LIMITED
SUMRY
i.        The Industrial Development Bank of Israel Ltd. (IDBI) is an
institution of national importance. As of December 31, 1966, its issued
share capita:L was IL339 million ($113 million equivalent). In addition,
IDBI had loan funds of IT225 million, including a Bank loan of $20 million
(I6O0 million).
ii.       Only IT15 million of IDBI's capital carries full voting right.
54j% of the voting shares are held by private domestic investors, 26% by the
Government and 20% by foreign investors. IDBI's Board of Directors numbers
56, and its functions have largely been delegated to three committees on
which the main shareholding groups are represented. Through its Board and
committees, IDBI is closely integrated with the commercial banking system
of Israel and with the financial and economic decision-making machinery
of the Government.
iii.      Since IDBI was appraised in 1964 for the first Bank loan, it has
succeeded in remedying some of the weaknesses then apparent. The staff
has been increased and now embodies a wider range of professional skills.
Project appraisals have been improved and IDBI's investment decisions are
no longer as heavily reliant on appraisals made by the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry as they used to be. IDBI appraisals are still uneven in
quality but the best have reached a satisfactory standard. IDBI has set
up a project supervision department, the lack of which had been a major
deficiency.
iv.       ID13I has concerned itself almost exclusively with lending, and
by the end of 1966 had approved loans to a cumulative total of IT770 million
($256.7 mill-Lon equivalent). About 42% of the loan portfolio is partially
guaranteed by the Government. Such guarantees have reduced the risk of
IDBI's operations, but may have encouraged some laxity in its project
appraisals. IDBI has financed some poor projects which had been spconsored by
the Government on political considerations and were guaranteed by it.. The
proportion of such poor projects in IDBI's portfolio is judged to be less
than 5%.
v.        ID3I's equity investments amount only to 6% of its portfolio, and
appear to be overvalued in the books. They include an investment in a
subsidiary, the Investment Company of IDBI Ltd., which has a share capital
of IT20 million and is owned 75% by IDBI and 25% by the Government. It is
operated as a department of IDBI. The Investment Company has a complex
portfolio but has not been very active. IDBI's present policy is tco abstain
from making equity investments, and to simplify the subsidiary's portfolio
by liquidation of the latter's subsidiaries.



vi.       ID3I's pre-tax income in 1965 and 1966 amounted to 10.5% and 9.7%,
respectively, of average net worth. In the past years, administrative
expenses were relatively stable, between 0.3% and 0.4% of average portfolio,
but these increased to nearly 0.5% in 1966. The high cost to IDBI of share
capital raised from the public is partly offset by the low-yield Government-
held shares, but the overall cost of resources is now about 6.4% as against
an average yiLeld from loans and investments of 8.3%.
vii.      IDHI has financed on the average between one-fifth and one-quarter
of gross industrial investment in Israel. During 1966 industrial investment
declined to IL380 million from 1h500 million in 1965. The latest Bank
Economic M4ission provisionally estimates that industrial investment will
improve in 1967 and 1968 to about h1440 million and 11500 million, respec-
tively. IDBI will continue to be the chief institutional source of long-term
finance for private and cooperative industry. In each of 1965 and 1966 IDBI's
loan approvals amounted to about IT98 million.  It is very probable that
approvals in 1967 will be no less than in those two years, i.e. about IT100
million, especially as total industrial investment is expected to increase
in 1967 over that in 1966. Moreover, at the end of 1966, IDBI had pending
loan applications of I199 million. An estimate of loan approvals of 16100
million and 11110 million in 1967 and 1968, respectively (together with
total equity investments of Ii6 million) appears to be justified. To make
approvals of the order of I216 million ($72 million equivalent) during these
two years, IDBI is likely to need additional resources of the order of I75
million ($25 million equivalent) all of which could be applied to foreign
exchange expenditure.
viii.     IDBI continues to be a suitable borrower and should be able to
put a second Bank loan to productive use. Such a loan, unlike the first,
should be available only for expenditures in foreign currencies, and its
other terms should also be those currently applied to Bank loans to
development iinance companies.
ix.       For the proposed loan, IDBI should be required to submit to the
Bank for prior approval: (a) projects to which IDBI intends to lend 11.5
million or mcre from the Bank funds; (b) projects to which the total amount
of IDBI assistance is to equal or exceed IL2.5 million and for which the
use of Bank funds in any amount is proposed; and (c) all projects, regard-
less of size, which use Bank funds and for which IDBI expects to receive
a Government guarantee. The aggregate of all IDBI's sub-loans requiring
prior approval should be at least half the amount of the proposed Bank loan.
x.        Sirnce in future IDBI and its subsidiary are expected to remain
inactive in the field of equity investment, it is recommended that I:DBI's
maximum total investment (loan and equity) in the subsidiary be set at 7Y-
of IDBI's share capital and reserves, reduced from the 20% limit provided
in the first Bank Loan Agreement.



REAPPRAISAL OF
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPNENT BANK OF ISRAEL LIMITED
I. INTRODUCTION
1.         The Bank made a loan of $20 million to the Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of Israel Limited (IDBI) in September 1965. The loan is now almost
fully committed; as of February -28, 1967, the loan account had been
credited with about $19.2 million for 67 projects, and $14.8 million had
been disbursed.
2.         In March 1966 the Government of Israel requested the Bank to
consider a further loan to ImBI. A mission visited Israel for three weeks
in June and July 1966, and was followed up by a brief mission in December.
This report is based on the findings of those missions, and focuses on
developments during the past two years.
II. INDUSTRY AND FINANCE
3.         The diminished pace of growth of the economy from 1965 has been
reflected in industrial production, which advanced by 10% and an estimated
3% to 4% in 1965 and 1966 respectively, as against the phenomenal rates of
14% to 15% per amnum during 1958-1964. The lower rate of increase wa,s
apparently due to the Government's disinflationary monetary and fiscal
policies, a fLattening of demand (arising from stabilization of consumption)
and a drop in overall investment, notably in the construction industry.
4.         In contrast to steady increases in industrial investment in 1964
and earlier, lthere has been a decline in 1965 and 1966. Gross investment
in industry (the bulk of it in private and co-operative enterprises) was
estimated at :W500 million and IT380 million in 1965 and 1966 respectively,
down from a peak of about I.520 million in 1964 (all amounts at current
prices).
5.         The Government is making efforts to arrest the recession and
the increase in unemployment. It believes that this is the opportune time
to achieve a clesired transfer of resources, including manpower, to the more
productive sectors of the economy, especially industry.  With this in view,
the Government is preparing an industrial program for the next few years,
partly to replace the earlier "1964-1970 Program."  For 1967 and 1968, it
hopes for a large increase in industrial investment.
6.         The Government's hopes are based in part on the establishment and
rapid progress of science-based "growth" industries, such as petro-chemicals,
electronics, scientific instruments, phosphates and others. However,
apparently the Government also wants progress in a wide range of the estab-
lished industries including textiles, by putting pressure on firms to export,
and contemplates reinforcing the various incentives to industrial investment,



production and exports. It is considering changes in the Law for the
Encouragement of Capital Investment to provide grants for the purchase of
machinery for export or import-substitution ventures, and higher depreci-
ation allowances. Development area industries may be given increased
subsidies. Export premiums are available for a large number of products,
at rates frcm 4% to 8% of value added. Greater assistance is proposed for
research, an,d the Government is in the process of setting up an Israel
Research and Development Corporation. Measures are contemplated for
attracting nmore foreign investors.
7.         The prices of industrial products continued upwards in 1965 and
1966, in a wage-price spiral, despite the fact that the levelling off of
demand and the decline in investment made possible better labor discipline,
fewer wage demands and redeployment of labor. Since early 1965 labor
productivity is estimated to have improved.   Export earnings continled to
increase in 1965 and 1966, largely because of bigger exports of diamonds
and potash. The Government reduced certain import duties in November ,1966,
as part of a liberalization program, which should expose more and more
industrial products to foreign competition.
8.         IDBI continued to be the most important institutional source
of medium- and long-term finance to private industry.    Between 1960) and
1966, DBI's loan approvals were on the average 22.6% of estimated gross
investment in industry. Over the period, IDBI's annual share fluctuated
between about 13% and 31%j but in the three latest years the fluctuations
have been smaller, with 19.7% the lowest and 25% the highest. In 1966,
IDBI's share was 23.6%. In that year about one-fifth of its approvals
were made in the closing month.
9.         In 1965 the Bank of Israel tightened controls on bank credit,
but demand for credit rose continuously, for a wide variety of purposes.
Bill discounting swelled further, despite a cost to the borrower of 15%
to 20%. Increases in bank credit were mostly on account of directed loans
and earmarked funds, such as the Government's Export Fund. Monetary
controls have been eased from mid-1966.
10.        The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has not been a significant source
of funds for industry; real estate, bank and finance company issues have
predominated. In 1962/1963 there was a big boom on the market, but it
slumped in 1964. Prices of shares continued to be depressed, the volume
of trading is small and there have been hardly any new issues. Contributing
to the depressed condition of the market have been the absorption of funds
by the high-yield short-term Government loan, better yields from linked
debentures, the failure of share prices to act as a hedge against irnflation,
the unloadinig on the market of substantial quantities of shares initially
issued outside the market, the diminished interest of foreign investors
and the decline in personal restitution payments from Germany. In 1965 the
Government appointed a committee to advise on measures to revive the market.
Among its recommendations subsequently accepted were the aboliton of capital
gains tax on profits on share sales, and the establishment of investment
funds. So far these measures have failed to infuse new life into the market.



III. THE COMPANY
History and Powers
11.        The Industrial Development Bank of Israel was established in
1°57 on the initiative of t1e Government of Israel, the three largest
commercial banks in Israel-, the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor)
and the Manufacturers' Association. It commenced business in October 1957.
IDBI's main function is the provision of medium- and long-term finamce to
private industrial enterprises in Israel. It is also empowered by its
charter to engage in underwriting, guaranteeing, and providing tecimical
assistance to industry.
Ownership
12.        Of the presently authorized share capital of Il417 million,
only I£16 million carries full voting rights. Of the latter, I£15.1
million was issued and paid as of December 31, 1966, and was widely
distributed among the sponsors of the Company, other major financial
institutions and foreign investors (Annex 1); the Government held 26%,
foreign investors 20% and private domestic investors 54%. The proportion
of the Government's shareholding gives it, in terms of Israel Company Law,
veto power in regard to major changes in IDBI's charter.
13.        As of December 31, 1966, there had been issued about I£324
million in share capital, other than the voting stock. Of this, the
Government held about 59%, foreign investors 22%, private domestic
investors 8p and enterprises jointly owned by private domestic and
foreign interests 11%. Owmers of voting shares have subscribed sub-
stantially to the other types of share capital. A fuller description
of the share capital is given in paragraphs 25 to 27 and Annex 2.
Organization and Management
14.        Board of Directors.   IDBI's Board of Directors is appointed
by the principal Ordinary A shareholders. All holders of I£250,000) or
more in Ordinary A shares are entitled to appoint one director for each
block of I£250,000 shares held. In consequence of this formula, the Board
is unusually large. It represents a broad cross-section of financial and
business institutions in the country, and foreign investors. The affilia-
tions of the 56 Board members as of December 315 1966, (Annex 3) are
indicated below:-

15.        Dr. Y. Foerder and Dr. Avraham Neaman continue to be the Chairman
and M4anaging Director, respectively. The former is also the Chairman of
Bank Leumi Le-Israel, the largest commercial bank in Israel.
16.        Committees.  The Board of Directors meets four or five times a
year. It has delegated most management tasks to three sub-committees:
the "Vice-Chairmen's" Committee, the Executive Committee and the Loan Com-
mittee.  Through these sub-committees a large number of directors are
closely associated with the work of the Company. The Vice-Chairmen's
Committee, set up about two years ago, consists of the Chairman of IDBI,
the Managing Director and the five Vice-Chairmen, two of whom represent
commercial banks and the other three the Government.  This sub-committee
is concerned with the more important administrative and personnel matters,
and serves as a sounding board for policy matters likely to prove contro-
versial.
17.        The Executive and Loan Committees (Annex 3) are responsible for
processing loan applications and deciding on related policies. All loan
applications are first considered by the Loan Committee, which is empowered
to take decisions on loans up to If300,000. Proposals above this limit or
on which unanimity is lacking are resferred to the Executive Committee for
decision. The Executive Committee presently consists of eighteen members
of whom four represent the Government.
18.        Management and Staff.  The Managing Director is the chief
operating executive. He has two deputies, namely, the Assistant Manager
and General Secretary, and the Comptroller, who respectively supervise
the operational and financial aspects of the work.  The management team
consists of these and the Legal Advisor, the Executive Secretary, and the
Economic and Financial Advisor (on two years' leave of absence from May
1966).  The main changes since the previous mission in November 1964 have
been the establishment of a Follow-up Department, and an increase in the
size of the professional staff from 30 to 45 and in other staff from 59
to 85. Early in 1966 the Company purchased for its offices two floors
in a new cooperative building.



19.        The staff is generally competent.  Management information
systerms are expected to be strengthened writh the installation of a system
of mechanized accounting. The Company has been concentrating on training
less experienced staff, and also intends to add some new staff members to
enable it to deal with an expected increased volume of appraisal and end-
use work.
Project Appraisal and Follow-up
20.        Loan applications are successively processed by an initial
screening committee, the staff, and the Loan and Executive Committees. The
screening committee has a varying membership, including one or more
Government representatives, and decides whether an application deserves
further exanination or should be rejected on broad criteria without a study
of its individual merits. Most rejections occur at this stage, for reasons
such as: the project is non-industrial; has applied for a working capital
loan; is too small; or has a low national priority.
21.        The Engineering and Economics Departments, acting in coordination.
prepare the appraisal reports and recommendations, assisted by the Legal and
other departments.  In 1964 IDBI's appraisals were found to be primarily
concerned with estimating the value of assets available for security, and
deficient in certain respects such as in the analysis of the market and
of technical characteristics; most of them were also heavily dependenlt on
the appraisals of the Mlinistry of Commerce and Industry, whose views on the
technical and marketing aspects of projects were often accepted by the ID3I
staff as bases for recommendation. During the past twxo years, IDBI has
succeeded in substantially improving the scope and quality of its appraisals,
because of greater experience and better staff training (one member attended
an EDI course), more internal discussion, the introduction of a wider range
of skills in the Engineering and Economics Departments, and more time spent
on each appraisal (as a result of reduced work-load). There is sti:Ll scope
for improvement. Appraisals still do not present the problems and defects
of a project clearly and forcefully. Given a continuing determination on
the part of the management, however, standards should rise further as the
staff continues to gain experience.
22.        The Ministry of Commerce and Industry still examines projects
for the granting of various Government incentives and approvals, although
it has recently decided to rely more heavily on IDBI's appraisals in the
future. IDDI no longer accepts the Ministry1s findings without question
but examines and often criticizes them. If the Loan or Executive Committee
disagrees on the merits of a project approved by the Ministry, often the
project is approved conditionally upon a Government guarantee (paragraph
48) and occasionally also upon appropriate changes in the project. The
wide knowledge and experience of individual members of the Loan and Execu-
tive Committees continue to make an important contribution to loan clecisions.



- 6 -
23.        The Follow-up Department was established in January 1966,
partly as a result of the Bank's recommendation.   It is headed by a mechan-
ical engineer formerly with the Engineering Department, and has three
economists, two accountants and a textile engineer on its staff. T'he
Department is responsible for obtaining and examining the reports and
accounts suibmitted by IDBI's clients, for making on-site inspections and
where necessary for recommending action to the management. Inspections
are presently directed to projects knoam to be in difficulty, and to
projects in arrears or default, having IDBI loans over I£1 million. The
Department plans eventually to make regular on-site inspections of all
projects having IDBI loans of I£O.5 million and upwards. From its work
so far, the Department considers that the most common problem met by
industrial projects is the limited size of the market for the goods produced.
IV. FINANCIAL RESOURCES
24.        The main sources of funds for IDBI have been share capital
debenture issues, loans from the U.S. Agency for International Development
(AID), and from the IBRD, as follows:-
I. million
Share capitai, paid-in-             339
Debentures 2I                        65
AID dollar loans                     60
AID counterpart loan                  40
IBRD loan                            60
564
Managed funds (AID) 2!               35
Other resources have been derived from Government loans and long-term
deposits, working capital loans, minor loans in foreign currencies, and
retained earnings.
Share Capital
25.        By far the largest source of funds has been share capital (Annex
2). As of December 31, 1966, the authorized capital was I£417 mil:Lion and
the issued and paid-in capital I£339 million. At present there are nine
classes of authorized capital, each having distinctive characteris-tics as
to voting power, redeemability, linkage, dividend rights, profit partici-
pation and rights in liquidation.
1/ Amounts outstanding as of December 31, 1966.
2/ Original amount, excluding revaluation increments.



- 7 -
26.        The ordinary voting shares are entitled to a fixed dividend of
6%, plus participating dividends.  INo of the classes of non-voting shares,
one ordinary and one preference (redeemable) are fully owned by the Govern-
ment and carry dividends at the rate of 3%J and 3W  respectively; these are
in effect low-cost subsidized money. The five classes of preference shares
held by private shareholders are dollar-linked and are entitled to divi-
dends at the rate of 6% (three classes), 7% and 71eo; the first three also
participate in profits. The highest fixed dividend is 8%, paid on the
preferred ordinary shares, which have very limited voting rights.
27.        The latest issue, initiated in May 1966, was that of Preference
D shares, in the amount of $20 million. These shares are being sold at
par in the U.S. market, are linked to the U.S. dollar, will receive a 71s
dividend, and are redeemable at ID13I's option after December 1973 at
105-5/8% of par plus accrued dividend. The issue has been underwritten,
on a "best-effort" basis, by the recently established dealer-broker agency,
Capital for Israel, Inc. of New York; the underwriting commission is 7]<%0.
As of the end of 1966, about $2.7 million had been subscribed.
Debentures
28.        At December 31, 1966, debentures in the amount of I£58.5 million
were outstanding, including I£21 mLllion in linking increments (Annex 4).
The debentures are secured by a floating charge on all the assets of IDBI.
AID Loans
29.        As of December 31, 1966, the outstanding amount of IDBI's two,
5%, dollar loans of $10 million each from AID was IL40.9 million equivalent.
Of the third loan of I£40 million, made in 1964 at 3-V  from U.S. Counter-
part Funds in Israel, I£31.6 million had been withdrawn for use.
IBRD Loan
30.        The IBRD loan of $20 million bears a fixed interest of 5g.,
with an amortization schedule equivalent to the sum of the individual
amortization schedules of IDBI's loans employing the Bank funds, not to
exceed 16 years in any case.
Government Deposits
31.        IDBI has received deposits from the Goverrment from time to time.
In December 1962, certain outstanding deposits were consolidated into a
single loan of about I£59 million. By the end of 196h, however, the
greater part; of the loan had been converted, by stages, into Government-held
preference share capital, carrying a 3% dividend. The balance of the loan
has not been repaid but set up as a separate account, by agreement, against
Government-guaranteed loans in default (paragraph 50); repayments are made
only againsl; amounts recovered.



- 8 -
32.        The Company, in its turn, has been maintaining deposits with
the Government, by placing with the Treasury the proceeds chiefly of
linked debenture issues. The purpose of this arrangement of interlocking
deposits is to give IDBI a small interest advantage and to protect it
partially from linkage risks. The amounts of the respective deposits have
fluctuated, but since 1965 IDBI's deposits with the Treasury have usually
exceeded the latter's deposits with it, because of the conversion mentioned
in the preceding paragraph. Presently about 85% of IDBI's deposits repre-
sent proceedLs of its debentures, having contractual and matching repayment
schedules.
Government Funds and German Loan
33.        I'he Government has planned to provide IDBI with a total of
I£OO million during 1965-1970, an average of T£20 million per year. It
was understcod by IDBI that the furids would be invested as share capital
of the Ordinary B class, rather than made available as loans, and in 1965
Il10 million was so invested. However, for 1966 the Government substituted
for its ovm contribution funds from a loan to it by the Federal Repuiblic
of Germany, of which D1I35 million, or I£27 million equivalent, was specified
for industrial development. The funds have been passed on by the Government
to 1DBI in the form of Treasury deposits. These funds are available for
financing imports.  An estimated 1917 million of the loan was committed in
the last two months of 1966. The remaining £10 million was earmarkced by
Government for specified projects, of which an estimated I£5 million wias
committed in 1966.
Short-term Borrowing
34.        Since May 1965, IDBI has had recourse to commercial bank
accommodation to meet tempcrary shortages of funds for loan disbursements.
As of December 31, 1966, the outstanding amount of such short-term loans
was I£45.2 million, almost all of it in foreign currencies. These loans
were obtained from 16 banks, the interest rates range from 5-7/8% to 11%,
and repayments extend up to 19 months; some of them have been renewed.
Managed Funds
35.        IDBI is an agent for the U.S. Government for the grant of local
currency loans to industrial enterprises, within the framework of the
"Cooley Fund" authorization. Funds are provided as required and IDEBI is
responsible for the execution and collection of the loans (and occasionally
for appraisal of projects), receiving a commission of 0.2% p.a. on out-
standing amounts.

V. POLICIES ANTD OPERATIONS
36.        IDBI's policies have evolved in the course of operations.,
Despite a broad mandate, IDBI has concerned itself almost exclusiveLy
with lending. Loans are granted for fixed capital, including land, buildings
and equipment. With minor exceptions, working capital is not provided. In
addition to its ordinary lending activities, IDBI has managed a program of
lending from AID (Cooley) funds. It has also engaged in two types of
guarantee operations: firstly, letters of credit to finance equipment
purchased abroad, and secondly, guarantees of loans, mainly AID (Cooley)
loans.
37.        Financial assistance is provided to industrial ventures primarily
in the private and co-operative sectors. IDBI is not usually called upon
to finance Government-controlled enterprises; there have been about a dozen
exceptions to this, mostly in the Company's early life.
38.        IDBI operates within the framework of the Government's policy
and programs for industrial development, but it deals with loan appLications
on their individual merits and does not pre-allocate its resources -to
particular sectors.
Loan and Guarantee Operations
39.        Summary of Operations.  From its inception to the end of 1965,
IDBI had approved 1,574 operations (loans, Cooley loans and long-term
guarantees) to a cumulative total of I£672.1 million, of which I£591.1
million had been disbursed and I£486.3 million was outstanding (Annex 5,A).
The figures for 1966 are I£98.5 million in approvals and IT£94.7 million in
disbursements. Approvals in 1965 amounted to I997.9 million as against
IL124.7 million and IT55.9 million in 1964 and 1963, respectively.
Approvals in 1964, when economic growth in Israel was at a very high
level, were the highest in IDBI's history.   IDBI attributes the decline
in 1965 and 1966 to its own shortage of funds; it no doubt also reflected
general economic conditions, particularly lower industrial investment.
40.        Charges for Loan Finance.   IDBI presently charges 11.8% interest
on its loans. It does not impose a commitment fee, but collects a one-time
commission of 1% on the amount of each loan. For certain loans, including
most of those guaranteed by the Government (paragraph 48), a part of the
11.8% intereist is paid to IDBI by the Government, as an interest subsidy
for the projects concerned. At present this subsidy is at two rates, viz.
2.8% and 4.55.
41.        Before December 1963,  IDBI's loans were partly or wholly
linked (as to both principal and interest) to the U.S. dollar and/or to
the cost-of-living index, at an interest rate of 8%, plus the 1% commission.
For certain AID loans, the interest was 7p. In December 1963, IDBI
introduced EL system of unlinked loans, charging 12% interest, which is



- 10 -
the legal ceiling. This rate was in effect till February 1966, when it was
altered to the present 11.8%.  In introducing unlinked loans, borrowers
with index-linked loans made after February 1962 (when the Israeli pound
was last devalued) were offered the option of converting these into non-
linked loans at a premium interest of 4%, retroactive to April 1963
85% of the outstanding loans so eligible for conversion have, in fact,
been converted. IDBI has estimated that 43% of the average amount of
loans outstanding during 1966 were linked to the dollar, 5% to the cost-
of-living index and the balance, 52%, unlinked.
42.        IDBI has protected itself from the exchange risk by an agrree-
ment with the Government for the insurance of its foreign exchange l-iabili-
ties, for which an insurance premium is paid to the Government (paragraph
62).  Consequently, IDBI's interest income is reduced by the premium expenses
paid. The estimated yield in 1966 from loans outstanding, after dedluction
of this premium, was an average of 8.6% on all loans and 9.45%, on non-linked
loans.
43.        Security and Extent of Commitment.  IDBI follows a conservative
policy in securing its loans. The assessment of collateral is basecd on
estimated realization on liquidation, and the size of a loan is limited to
70% of such assessment on new machinery and 50% on new buildings.  The
assessment is lower for development area projects and for specialized or
used equipment. If conventional security (fixed or floating charges on
mac hnery or mortgages on immoveable property) is considered inadequate,
additional security is obtained in the form of Government guarantees (para-
graph 50) or sponsors' guarantees.  IDBI usually expects its borrowers to
contribute a minimum of one-third of total investment in each project,
except for projects in development areas.
1/
44.        Paeriod of Loans.  IDBI does not usually lend for less than four
years. Its Longest loan has been for twenty years. The usual grace period
for repayments is two years. Of the loans approved to the end of 1965,
about half by value were repayable in from nine to thirteen years, but a
larger number of loans were repayable in between six and eight years
(Annex 5,B).
45.        Size of Loans.  Although IDBI is reluctant to consider appli-
cations for loans below I£25,000, about one-eighth by number (but ornly
0.5% by value) of loans approved are below that figure. There are no
specific restrictions on the maximum size of a loan or on total commitment
to a single enterprise. In respect of loans approved to December 31, 1966,
59% by value were IMl million or over; the average size was I£Y440,000.
1/ In this and the three subsequent paragraphs, the term "loan" refeirs to
loans, Cooley loans and guarantees.



- U1 -
The average size of loans as well as the proportion by value of larger
loans has been increasing. The largest loan to date has been one of
I£25 million, equivalent to 3.8% of' the outstanding loan portfolio, and
7% of IDBI's net worth, at December 31, 1966.
46.        I)istribution by Industrial Branch.  IDBI's heaviest commitments
by industry are in the classification "textiles and leather," loans for
which amounted to 30% of total approvals so far (Annex 5,D). In view of
the diversity of products and market outlets within the classification,
the apparently high proportion is not a matter of concern.  The other loans
have been widely distributed among various industries.
47.        Geographical Distribution.  The regional distribution of loans
approved shows a bias towards the less developed parts of the country,
including Negev (Annex 5,E).
48.        Government-Guaranteed Loans. As of December 31, 1966, an
outstanding amount of I£273.6 million or 42% by value of IDBI's portfolio
consisted of loans which were guaranteed for repayment by the Governiment;
the total amount of the guarantees was I£119 million. Projects for which
IDBI seeks such guarantees may be broadly classified into four groups:-
(i) Those for which the security offered is inadequate, in
IDBI's judgment.
(ii) Projects which depend, for their viability or prospects,
on special Government help, e.g. subsidies, import protection, expoit
premia, Government purchase contracts.
(iii) Development area projects, most of which have characteristics
(i) and (ii) above, and are also handicapped by inadequate infrastructure
and skilled labor supply. Over 80% of the Government-guaranteed projects
are in development areas.
(iv) Projects whose financial structure is not considered sound
by IDBI (e.g. high debt/equity ratio) or for which the proportion of
funds provided by the sponsors is regarded as insufficient. M4any teatile
projects are in this category.
49.        The Government is prepared to guarantee loans because of its
interest in the growth of development areas, in promoting exports or
import substitutes, and in encouraging projects with a high value added,
especially those based on local raw materials. Most such projects are
considered good, viable and bankable by IDBI, given the assistance and
support provided by the Government. However, apparently there have been
a few instances where poorly organized non-viable projects received financial
assistance from DBI because the Government desired to promote them for
political reasons. It is difficult to estimate just how many such loans



- 12 -
IDBI has made, but probably less than 5% of IDBI's portfolio consists of
projects of this nature. IDBI has indicated its intention to tighten its
appraisal standards so that poor projects are not financed even if they
bear a Government guarantee. In any event Bank funds should not be avail-
able for such projects, to ensure which a mandatory review is recormended
(paragraph 93).
50.       The Government's guarantees are of two types, "general" and
"special". The type and extent of a guarantee is set from case to case by
IDBI's Executive Committee, with the concurrence of its member representing
the Treasury. The Government's obligations in respect of the "general"
guarantees are met from a fund to which the Government credits an anmount
(according to an agreed formula) for each guarantee given. The present
size of this fund is adequate in relation to the size of the outstanding
amount of guaranteed loans and to the likely claims. In the event of
delinquency, IDBI is compensated up to 80% of the outstanding balance of a
loan, the Gov,ernment bearing the first risk.  "Special" guarantees can
extend up to 100% of the value of the loans and are given on an individual
basis, i.e. the guarantee fund cannot be used for them. As of September 30,
1966, the value of outstanding loans covered by special guarantees wras
IL15 million, out of a total of Ib271 million in loans outstanding covered
by all Government guarantees.
51.       The Government guarantees are unconditional, i.e. do not clepend
upon the exhaustion of legal remedies by IDBI. In the event of default on
a guaranteed loan, the principal amount outstanding is immediately paid to
IDBI.
Investment in Shares
52.       IDBI's investments in the share capital of enterprises, including
its holding in its subsidiary investment company (paragraphs 55 to 57),
amount to little more than 6%0 of its total portfolio. The share invrest-
ment portfolio as of September 30, 1966, was I625 million, the bulk of it
(94%) being shares not quoted on the stock exchange. As of September 30,
1966, the aggregate market price of the quoted shares was equivalent to
68% of their book value. Only about half the portfolio, by value, consists
of shares in manufacturing companies, most of the balance being shares in
investment companies which operate primarily in the industrial sector.
Less. than half the investment in manufacturing companies is in ordinary
shares, the balance being in preferred.   Since 1964, there have been few
new equity investments.
53.       IUBI's relative inactivity in the share investment field has
been largely conditioned by the financing practices in Israeli industry,
in which the proportion of debt is high and there persists a considerable
reluctance to expand equity ownership. In recent times the depressed
condition of the stock market reduced activity further. Many of IDBI's
investments were made in connection writh its loan operations, and in the
earlier years it obtained about a dozen conversion rights, of which only



- 13 -
one has been exercised. Its holdings in investment companies were (lesigned
to bring IDBI into close association with large investment groups in the
country, through which funds could be channelled to small enterprises;
thus IDBI also made fairly sizeable loans to these investment companiies.
ID3I is active on the board of one of these investment companies, anid also
participates in the management of a manufacturing company in which :Lt has
an equity investment.
54.        Over the next two years, IDBI's equity investments are likely
to be few and are expected to arise mainly in connection with mergers,
amalgamations or reconstructions of industrial companies in which f)BI
had an existing interest, not as investments in new enterprises. In general,
IDBI's present policy is to abstain from making equity investments, for
the following reasons: since in Israel loans are often secured by share-
holders' guarantees, IDBI might find itself with an open-ended commitment to
an enterprise of which it was a shareholder; IDBI's high public standing
in Israel morally obligates it to prevent the failure of any company in
which it has shares, thus increasing indefinitely its original commitment;
IDBI could be caught in conflicts of interest if it were simultaneously
a lender and a shareholder; and its position as a lender is stronger than
as a minority shareholder.
The Investment Company of IDBI
55.        IDBI and the Government, respectively, own 75d0 and 25% of the
I£20 million share capital of the Investment Company of IDBI, established
in December 1962 to operate in the field of equity investments. This
subsidiary company was set up following legal advice on the requirements
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and given that IDBI was
marketing its securities in the United States. The Investment Company's
other resources now consist of loans totalling I£1.75 million. Its initial
portfolio consisted of investments transferred by the Government ancd IDBI,
in payment for shares subscribed in the Investment Company's capital.
However, it persuaded the Government to take back most of the Government's
initial investments, all of them unprofitable ones, at no loss to itself.
It has not made much progress since it went into business at the encl of 1963,
shortly before the stock market was to enter into a prolonged depression.
56.        Tlhe Investment Company's share, loan and debenture portfolio,
as of December 31, 1966, was valued in the books at about I£22.3 million.
The value of quoted securities amounted to I£6.5 million, the market price
of which was only 6Z% of book value; however, a specific reserve provision
of I£1.75 million covered a substantial part of the difference between
market price and book value. About half the portfolio consisted of shares
of the Investment Company's four subsidiaries.   Though relatively small in
value, this portfolio contained a wide variety of stock (some of it of non-
manufacturing companies) with involved relationships through subsidiaries.
The Investment Company's new activities have been few.   It has had a. small
profit from its operationsin 1964 and 1965, but showed a small loss in 1966,
after providing I£.16 million for dliminution in the value of quoted shares.
A more detailed description of the Investment Company is given in Annex 6.



- 14 -
57.        The Investment Company is virtually a department of IDBI.  It
was originally intended that the Investment Company would take over most
of the equity investment activity of IDBI but, in the present circumstances,
the considerations inhibiting equity investments by IDBI itself alsco apply
to the Investment Company. No substantial increase in its activities, or
in the equity activities of IDBI itself, is expected, at least for the
next few years.
58.        IDBI has decided to simplify the Investment Company's present
portfolio by dissolving or disposing of the Investment Company's two main
subsidiaries by the end of 1967. Ihen that is done, IDBI itself wil.l have
the Investmeint Company as its only direct or indirect subsidiary.
59.        Unader the first Bank loan agreement, IDBI is required to restrict
its total investment in the Investment Company and other subsidiaries to
20% of its share capital and reserves.  Given the expected inactivity of
the Investment Company and the plan for liquidating its subsidiaries, it
will need little or no additional resources in the next few years. IDBI
has therefores accepted the Bank's suggestion that the maximum limit on
its exposure in the Investment Company be reduced to 71; of IDBI's share
capital and reserves.

- :15 -
The Company has grown substantially since 1958, when its assets totalled
TZ49 million. During 1966 the total investment portfolio (loans and equity
investments) increased by 9%.
61.        'rhe only restriction on IDBI's borrowings in relation to its
equity is contained in the first AID loan agreement, which provides that
the Company's consolidated indebtedness should not be more than twice
the share capital and surplus. In fact, the ratio of average outstanding
long-term debt to average net worth for 1965 and 1966 were only 0.4 and
0.44, respectively.
62.        Linkages and EKchange Risk.   IDBI has dollar and index-linked
assets as well as liabilities.  TheJcapital structure has thus been affected
by the devaLuations of the Israel pound since 1958, and by increases in the
cost-of-living index due to inflation.  Such changes complicate comparisons
of its balance sheets for different years.   The combined effects of these
adjustments have resulted in a surplus of linked assets over linked liabi-
lities. As of December 31, 1966, the net linking funds were IF£63.5 million.
Part of this will be needed to redeem linked preference shares, and part may
be a tax liability (not yet certain); the balance, which IDBI estimfates at
I£30.11 mil:Lion, is in effect a free reserve. Since December 1963, IDBI
has been malcing only unlinked loans, while a large part of its resources
are from abroad. To deal with this exchange risk the Government, by an
agreement in April 1965, assumed responsibility for the payment of all
linking increments on linked borrowgings, debentures and deposits, which
were contracted after the February 1962 devaluation; and also assumed the
exchange risk on all foreign currency liabilities which may be contracted
in the future. The only liability not included in the insurance agreement
is that on lthe class of dollar-denominated preference shares issued before
February l962, but this is effectively covered by IDBI's holding of State
of Israel dollar bonds. As consideration for insurance, IDBI pays the
Government an insurance premium of 4% per annum on the outstanding amounts
of the various liabilities; on two classes of liabilities the premium is
higher, exceptionally, at 4.5% and 5.85%.
63.        TMe aggregate amount of insured liabilities has been less than
the outstandling amount of unlinked loans. Thus, on the basis that IDBI's
interest rate on loans includes a 4% insurance premium charge, there has
been a surplus to IDBI after payment of the insurance charges to the Govern-
ment. The accumulated surplus, termed "inner reserves" by IDBI, is a
free reserve.
Financial Results
64.        Income. The income statements of the Company are given in
Annex 10, and those for recent periods are summarized below:-



- 16 -
1964          1965          1966
(in I '000)
Gross income                        42.,387       56,286        62,21h3

and investments, etc.              848            750         1,304

Total net income, before taxes     26,805         35,802        34,577
Pre-tax income . average net worth   9.6%          10.5%          9.7'
After-tax income * average net worth 6.1%o          6.8%          6.1%
65.        Between 1962 and 1965, administrative and general expenses ranged
between 0.3% and 0.4% of average portfolio, without any perceptible trend,
but in 1966 they increased to almost 0.5p% by I£1,153,000.   Pre-tax income
increased by 33% in 1965, but declined slightly, by 3%, in 1966, due mainly
to a large increase in interest expenses (including interest on short-term
loans) and insurance charges payable to the Government. After providing for
the fixed dividend of 3% on Ordinary B shares and 3Wo on Preference A shares
(the two categories of subsidy money provided by the Government), the after-
tax returns on the balance of the share capital were 13.4% and 11% in 1965 and
1966, respectively.
66.        The high cost to the Company of publicly raised share capital
is offset, to some extent, by the cheaper Government shares; despite this,
the pre-tax cost of share capital is now over 8%. The overall cost of
resources, including interest on loans and debentures and dividends on all
but Ordinary A shares, is about 6.4%, compared to the present average yield
from loans and investments of 8.3%. This gives a "spread" of 1.9% on
resources.
Allocation of Income
67.        From its inception to 1966, the Company allocated its cumulative
total income as follows:  dividends 83%, general reserve 12%, and other
free reserve If%.
68.        Dividends.  All classes of shares, except Ordinary A, carry the
right, statu-rory or conventional, to minimum rates of dividend.  Consequently,
dividends have commanded a substantial share of disposable income (Annex 9).



- 17 -
69.       Reserves.  The Articles require that after payment of dividends
and dividend arrears on all cumulative preference shar T, a part of
"ordinary" profits must be credited to a reserve fund._    This may not
exceed 10% oi such profits but there is no lower limit, so that theorecti-
cally even a token sum can be set aside as reserves. Further amounts
(unspecified) may be credited to the reserve fund at two stages: after
payment of thie specified dividends on ordinary shares, and after distri-
bution of specified participating dividends on preference shares. The
reserve fund may also be credited with sums from the surplus of the
profits-linking fund account. As of December 31, 1966, the general reserve
was IL11.5 million.
70.       The following table lists the various items of reserves and shows
the reserves position in the past few years:
December 31
1963        196I        1965       1966

General reserve                    6.5          8.0        10.0       11.5
Other free reserve                   -           -          2.4        4.2

Capital linking increments        31.1         33.6        30.1       30.1
Unappropriated                     0.3          1.2         0.7        0.5
44.2        49.1        49.6        52.7
The total reserves at IT52.7 million as of December 31, 1966, were together
equivalent to 7.8% of the Company's total portfolio.
71.       Prcivision for Bad Debts.  The cumulative provision for bad
and doubtful debts., net of amounts written off, as of December 31, 1966,
was I12.86 million. A provision of about Thl.8 million has also been
made for diminution in the value of equity investments.
Delinquent Lcans and Investments
72.       As of December 31, 1966, a cumulative amount of MIL.7 million
in loans and equity investments had been written off (Annex 10),
including IL1.3 million in loans guaranteed by the Government. On the
same date, the amount of arrears on loan repayments was IT26.9 million
(of which Ib22.5 million had been in arrears for more than a year); that
represented an increase of 170% over the 1965 year-end amount.   The amount
in arrears was the aggregate of portions of outstanding loans totalling
IL269 million, or 40% of the loan portfolio. Legal proceedings were in
progress in respect of outstanding loans amounting to IL14.9 million, of
which 119.3 million were Government--guaranteed. At this date the Government
Before doing so, the Company may set aside a sum in a capital redemption
reserve TLnd for its redeemable preference shares, but no such fund has
been established so far.



- 18 -
had also paid IDBI a cumulative amount of Ib34 million in respect of
Government-guaranteed delinquent loans. The total of the amount of
arrears and of loans undergoing legal proceedings as of December 31,
1966, viz. Ib4J.8 million, amounted to 6% of portfolio. The position
is not unsatisfactory, taking into account the Government guarantees.,
However, during 1966, there has been a sharp increase in delinquent
loans and the situation needs to be closely watched.
Portfolio
73.       In general IDBI's security requirements appear adequate to
protect the Company, having in view the high proportion of loans in clefault
which are covered by a Government guarantee.
74.       Owing to the depressed state of the stock market, the present
market values of most of IDBI's quoted equity investments are below cost.
These are carried on the books at cost. The consequent overvaluation,
together with the apparent overvaluation of the subsidiary Investment
Company's shares in IDBI's accounts, is estimated at not more than
T11.2 million as of September 30, 1966. That is covered by the provision
indicated in paragraph 71.
75.       In assessing the adequacy of IDBI's total reserves, account
must be taken of IDBI's normal security requirements, the Government
guarantees, the good diversification of loans, and the fact that many of
the loans are seasoned. The overall position appears satisfactory.
Share Values
76.      IDBI's Ordinary A shares, Preferred Ordinary shares and the
dollar-linked Preference B, C, CC and CC1 shares are listed on the Tel
Aviv Stock Ebcchange. In 1965 and 1966, the volume of trading was higher
than in 1964, but prices fluctuated more widely; as of the end of 1966,
except for Ordinary A shares (which were quoted at 154.5% of par) all
known quotations were below par. Local financial circles consider the
reason to be the continuing depression of the market rather than a lack
of confidence in the quality of the shares. The average book value of
all classes of shares as of December 31, 1966, (including the reserves
on capital linking increments) was 117.5% of par.
Audit
77.       The Company's accounts are audited by Messrs. Somekh, Chaikin,
Citron and Co., a firm of independent public accountants acceptable to
the Bank. The 1966 accounts were certified by the Auditors as giving a
true and fair view of IDBI's affairs and financial results for the year.

VII. PROSPECTS AND PROJECTIONS
Estimate of Riture Operations, 1967 and 1968
78.       19665 was a relatively poor year for industrial investment in
Israel, which dropped to I£.380 million from If,500 million in 1965. This
fact, and the overall impact of the current recession, influence any
projections of activity during 1967 and 1968. As mentioned earlier
(paragraphs 5 and 6), the Government considers the present time to be
opportune for embarking on an effort to build up industrial investment.
According to the preliminary findings of the latest Bank Economic Mission
to Israel, industrial investment is expected to increase by 15% in 1967
and 1968 (to about I£440 million and I£500 million, respectively), and
somewJhat more rapidly thereafter.
79.       IDBI should continue to be the chief institutional source of
medium- and long-term finance for private and cooperative industry. A
ministerial committee appointed in 1965 projected IDBI's operations through
1970 at an average annual rate of 1120 million. The Government now
believes, in the context of its ambi-tious plan, that this estimate will
be exceeded in 1967 and 1968 by up to I£30 million annually, a total
of up to I£300) million ($100 million equivalent) for the two years.
However, IEBI"s latest estimates are more cautious. According to these,
loan approvals in 1967 and 1968 will be IO110 million and I£117 million,
respectively, a total of I£227 million ($75.7 million equivalent).
Very little share investment activity is expected, I£3 million per year.
80.       In 1965 and 1966, IDBI's loan approvals were I£98.3 million
and I£98.5 million respectively.  It is very probable that approvals in
1967 will be no less than in those two years, i.e., about IF£100 million,
particularly since in 1967 total industrial investment in the economy
is likely to increase over that in 1966. This conclusion is reinforced
by the fact that at the end of 1966 IDBI had under consideration, at
various stages of processing, loan applications totalling I£99 million,
most of which had been cleared by the screening committee and were ex-
pected to result in business.   The estimate of loan approvals of I£100
million in 1967 and 10% more, IF,110 rillion, in 1968, together with
estimated equity investments of If£6 million, leads to the expectation that
IDMI will approve I£216 million ($72 million equivalent) in new business
in the next two years. These figures would be larger if a big project
for phosphates (or any similar big projects) sponsored by the Ministry
of Development, went forward and IDBI participated in it.
81.       At the end of 1966, IDBI had undisbursed portions of approved
loans of I£48.6 million, giving a tot;al of operational funds needed of
I£265 million. Translated to a cash basis this would mean disbursements
of I£221 million in 1967 and 1968, and undisbursed approvals of If43.6
million at the, end of 1968 (for whicth, how;ever, resources will have to
be lined up previously). IDBI is planning to repay in full by the end of
1968 the short-term loans it has been using since 1965, of which about
I£145 million is now outstanding. Taking into account planned realization



- 20 -
of its deposits with the Treasury and of some of its short-term assets,
a net improviement in the short-term position by some IL14.5 million is
expected. Repayments on IDBI's long-term debts will be I668.5 million
in 1967 and 1968.
Resources, 1967 and 1968
82.       IDBI's available resources, or those in sight, are as follows:
(i)  Loan collections are expected to amount for the two-year
period to about IL104 million.
(ii) Share capital: the new issue of $20 million of Preference
D shares, together with a small amount of Preference CC1
shares, are estimated to yield Th21.5 million and I129.6
million in 1967 and 1968, respectively, a total of I1,51.1
million.
(iii)  The U.S. Export-Import Bank:  in March, 1967, IDBI signed
a loan with this bank for $6 million (IL18 million equivalent)
for equipment procurement in the U.S.A., for ten years at
6% interest.
(iv)  Government funds:  for 1966, the Govermment's planned
contribution of an average of IT20 million per annum was
substituted by a German loan, of which a balance of
IL5 million is available for use in 1967 (paragraph 33).
Another Il15 million can be expected from the Governmlent
in 1967, and IL20 million in 1968. IDBI has assumed that
these funds will be subscribed for Ordinary B shares and
has so treated them in its estimates.
Nv)  Funds from other existing sources:  these are the undis-
bursed portions of the first Bank loan, the AID counterpart
loan and the AID (Cooley) loan, and IDBI's own cash
generation. They are expected to make a contribution of
some IT59.6 million in 1967 and 1968.
Estimate of Additional Requirement
83.       ID3I's estimated need for, and sources of funds are set out in
Annex 1l, and summarized below:
Uses                                       IL million
Operations                                   264.6
Debt repayment                                68.5
Im?rovement in short-term position            14.5
347.6



- 21 -
Sources                                   ITE million
Loan collections                             104.0
Share capital                                51.1
Government funds                              40.0
Export-Import Bank loan                      18.0
Other existing sources                       59.6
272.7
Uncovered Balance                             74.9
IDBI will thus require around IL75 million, or about $25 million equivalent,
in funds from sources other than those indicated above, for 1967 and 1968.
Prospective Sources
84.       Apart from the Wforld Bank, IDBI has had talks with lenders in
the U.K. and Canada, none of which have yet led to any positive results.
The Company does not foresee the possibility of raising funds from
domestic sources other than the Government, while the prolonged depression
in the stock market continues. Bond or debenture issues are closely
regulated, ar,d are used primarily for Government financing.
85.       IDEI's resources are in general readily convertible as between
foreign currencies and Israeli pounds. The exceptions are: (i) the
German loan, which can be used only for imports and of which a balance
of 165 million is available for commitment in 1967; and (ii) the Export-
Import Bank loan of IJ18 million, which can be used only for procurement
in the U.S.A. An analysis of the projects submitted under the first Bank
loan shows that about 47% consisted of imports.   The sampling is indicative
only, but on the assumption that this proportion of project costs is in
foreign exchange, IDBI could use about IL100 million in foreign exchlange
during 1967 and 1968. Since the total of the German and Export-Import
Bank loans is I123 million, it follows that IDBI could use to cover foreign
currency expenditures up to whatever resources it obtains to fill the
estimated "gap" of 1175 million in resources.
Estimated Results
86.       The Company's pro-forma financial statements (Annex 11) indicate
that during 1966-1968 its profitability, although increasing slightly over
the period, is expected to be lower than in 1965, owi4ng to the relatively
high cost of the new Preference D shares.  After providing for dividends
of 3% on Ordinary B shares and 3V  on Preference A shares, the after-tax
return on the balance of the share capital is estimated to be 12% in each of
1967 and 1968 compared to 13.4% in 1965 and 11% for 1966. The average
yield on all resources will increase slightly, so that the estimated average
"spread" on funds will remain at around the 2% level.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECONMENDATIONS
Conclusions
87.       At the time IDBI was appraised for the first Bank loan, it
already had substantial resources, a large portfolio and seven years'
working experience.  Since then the Company, while continuing to grow,
has taken measures to remedy some of its earlier weaknesses. The staff
has been increased and now embodies a wider range of professional skills.
Project appraisals have been improved, and while they are still uneven
in quality, the best have reached a satisfactory standard. The manage-
ment is seeking to raise standards further. The Company has set up a
project supervision department, the lack of which had been a major
deficiency.
88.       IDBI is and is likely to remain the chief institutional source
of long-term finance for industry in Israel and an organization of
national importance. Through its Board and Committees, it is closely
integrated with the commercial banking system of Israel. There is still
a special relationship betwieen IDBI and the financial and economic
decision-making machinery of the Government; but IDBI's investment
decisions are no longer as heavily reliant on appraisals made by the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry as they used to be. About 42% of
the loan portfolio is supported by Government guarantees. In almost
all cases Government-guaranteed projects also receive general Government
support and assistance, which make them acceptable for finance on
banking terms. In a few cases poor and economically ill-conceived
projects have been financed by IDBI, with Government guarantees, because
of political considerations; but the amounts involved have been relatively
small. The availability of Government guarantees has reduced the risk
of IDBI's operations, but may have, encouraged some laxity in IDBI's project
appraisals.
89.       IDBI followed up its previous issues of share capital in the
U.S.A. with another issue in 1966. Its ability to raise capital abroad
contrasts with its difficulty in raising funds from domestic sources other
than the Government.
90.       IDBI is a sound development finance company and continues to
deserve the support of the Bank.
Recommendations
91.       ID:BI is likely to have in the years 1967 and 1968 a shortfall
of the order of In75 million ($25 million equivalent) all of which could
be applied to the foreign exchange component of the projects it finances.
Funds of up to this amount from the Bank and other sources could be put
to productive use in supplying IDBI with the resources it needs to continue
its important investment activities.



- 23 -
92.       The terms of the proposed Bank loan should be those generally
applied to loans to development finance companies. It would
thus differ from the first Bank loan in the following respects:
(i} the rate of interest for each portion credited to the
loan account would be at the Bank's standard rate current
at the time;
(ii) the loan would be available only to meet the cost of
imports of goods and services. The present Bank loan
is available for expenditure in domestic as well as
foreign currencies. For disbursements against that
loan, IDBI had little difficulty in documenting
foreign and domestic currency expenditures separately.
93.       For the first loan, IDBI was required to submit for prior
approval sub-loans in excess of $333,334 (IT1 million) each, to total
not less than $10 million. For the proposed second loan, it is recommended
that the free limit for sub-loans be increased, in view of the improvements
in IDBI's project appraisal standards. At the same time it would also be
desirable for the Bank to have the opportunity of examining a broad cross-
section of IDBI's projects. To achieve these purposes, IDBI should be
required to submit to the Bank for prior approval the following:
(i) any sub-loan for which IDBI intends to use I1l.5
million or more of funds from the Bank loan;
(ii) any sub-loan to which the total amount of IDBI assistance
is equal to or in excess of IL2.5 million and for which
use of funds from the Bank loan in any amount is proposed;
and
(iii)  all sub-loans for Go-vernment-guaranteed projects,
regardless of size, which use Bank funds (see paragraph 49).
94.       The Bank should periodicaLUy review the requirement of approval
for all Government-guaranteed sub-loans with the intention of establishing
in future an appropriate free limit (sub-loans below which limit will not
require prior approval) based on its experience with such projects.
95.       It is also recommended that the maximum limit on IDBI's
investments (loan and share) in the Investment Company be set at 7?V of
IDBI's paid-in share capital and reserves, reduced from the 20% limit
provided in the first Bank loan agreement (see paragraph 59).

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ISRAEL LTD.
INVESTMENT COMPANY OF IDBI
1.        The Investment Company of IDBI, established in December 1962,
is 75% owned by IDBI and 25% by Government, each of which initially
obtained its shares in exchange for shares in other companies. According
to IDBI, the subsidiary was set up on legal advice, to enable IDBI to
comply with the requirements of the U.S. securities and Exchange Commis-
sion (SEC), so that it would continue to be exempt from the SEC's classi-
fication "investment company." Such a classification would have implied
an obligation on the part 'of a company registered with the SEC to comply
with certain formal requirements difficult for a foreign-based company.
2.        The present authorized, issued and paid-in capital of the
Investment Company is I£20 million consisting of equal amounts in
ordinary (voting) shares and 4% preference shares. Of the voting capital,
75% is held by IDMI and about 25% by the Government; the ownership of
the preference shares is in an almost similar ratio. The Investment;
Company's Board of Directors has five members, two of whom represent
the Government and the other three are IDBI nominees, including the
Chairman, Dr. Neaman.
3.        The other resources presently consist of I11.75 million in
loans, including I£1.6 million from IDBI. The Investment Company has
not made much progress since its establishment. It started functioning
at a time when the stock market was entering into a prolonged depression.
Most of the share investments put in by the Government when the Investment
Company was formed were in companies that were unprofitable and had
accumulated losses. Subsequently all but three of those investments were
sold back to the Government at book value, by an agreement reached in
1964. It also sold small amounts from its remaining portfolio. As a
result of these transactions, there was a small loss in 1964, and a profit
of 1z581,000 in 1965. Since new investments have not been substantial
(in 1966 there was only one investment, of less than I£100,000), the
Investment Company now has a smaller share portfolio than it had initially.
The book value portfolio as of December 31, 1966, consisted of the follow-
ing:
Price Paid

ANNEX 6
Page 2
The market value of the quoted shares was only 1I4.1 million (or 62% of
price paid), but the Investment-Company has made provisiorn totaling
I£1.75 million to partially cover the overvaluation of the shares in
the books. About two-thirds by value of the share investment portfolio,
other than the two main subsidiary companies, was in manufacturing
companies. Mqost of the remainder was in investment companies, in which
IDBI also has participated. The loans were made in connection with share
investments; the largest among them represents a debt incurred by a
client when it bought back the Investment Company's participation in
its share capital.
4.        The Investment Company's two main subsidiaries are both fully
owned, and are both investment companies. One of them, Pituach Veneemanuth,
was transferred to the Investment Company by the Government. The second,
Deco Investment Co., is 100% owned by Pituach Veneemanuth. Neither of
these two subsidiaries has any distinct existence, except for a legal
corporate one. They are a part of the Investment Company set-up, and
their boards are identical to that of the latter with the addition of
two staff members. The Investment Company intends to dissolve or
liquidate both these subsidiaries, a process expected to be completed
by the end of 1967, provided that legal or taxation difficulties do not
arise.
5.        The Investment Company has a 50,' interest in, and manages, a
finance company set up in 1965 to operate on the stock exchange, follow-
ing the recommendations of the Govermment-appointed committee (paragraph
10 of the Report); this is inactive now. The Investment Company is
active on thei boards of two other manufacturing companies, in one of
which it has a 50% interest.
6.        The Investment Company's pre-tax earnings reached a high of
IP958,000 for 1965 (equivalent to 4.7% of average net wiorth) after provid-
ing an amount of IL581,000 for diminution in value of investments. In
1966 it suffered a small loss, after making a similar provision of
If1,161l000. No dividends have been declared. The net worth as of
December 31, 1966, was 101% of paid-in share capital. The balance
sheets and in,come statements are sunmarized below:
