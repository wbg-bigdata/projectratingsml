REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
SECOND WESTERN PROVINCE RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:       United Republic of Cameroon.
Loan amount:    US$21.5 million, including the capitalized front-end fee of
US$53,616.
Terms:           Standard.
Cofinancing:    IFAD:  US$14.5 million.
Project
description:  The five-year project would extend and consolidate ongoing
operations under the Western Highlands Rural Development
Project (Cr. 784-CM) to the whole Western Province, and
improve the precision of the technical package for farmers.
The focus would be on increased food crop production and
improvements in coffee yields and quality. The project would
include: (a) expansion and streamlining of UCCAO's extension
services, strengthening of the cooperatives and modernization
of coffee processing and marketing facilities; (b) provision
of incremental inputs; and (c) supporting activities,
including applied research, village water supply, feeder
roads, soil conservation, reafforestation, bottomlands
development, monitoring and evaluation, and the provision of
technical assistance, fellowships and studies. The proposed
project would support key Government objectives: (i) slowing
down urban migration by raising smailholder productivity and
improving rural living conditions; (ii) promoting national
food production and generating additional export earnings; and
(iii) decentralizing economic development by strengthening
regional institutions. It would also encourage rationali-
zation of policies regarding input supply, commodity pricing,
and interest rates. The project faces three risks; the
management risk is not considered high as the proposed
activities would rely on existing structures and systems,
whose effectiveness would be strengthened through improved
technologies, procedures and controls, combined with train-
ing. Reorganization of input supply would reduce the risk of
untimely and inadequate delivery of fertilizers and pesticides
to farmers. Financial weaknesses of the Robusta cooperatives
would be remedied through improvements in the pricing system
for coffee and in the management and accounting procedures of
the cooperatives.

Economic rate of return:   The estimated overall ERR is 30% calculated on the

results from the fact that for the arabica coffee

investment and incremental operating expenditure
than would otherwise be normal for such a project.

SECOND WESTERN PROVINCE RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01     The Government of Cameroon has requested IBRD and IFAD assistance in
the financing of a Second Rural Development Project in the Western Province.
This project would follow on from the Western Highlands Rural Development Pro-
ject (Cr. 784-CM). In addition to extending coverage to the entire Western
Province, the second project would build on the achievements of the first and
stimulate greater integration and precision in all operations. Increasing food
production, improving coffee quality and strengthening of farmer cooperatives
would be key objectives. The project was identified and prepared by the FAO/
IBRD Cooperative Program in 1981 and appraised in May 1982 by a mission consist-
ing of Messrs. M. Nightingale, T. Turtiainen, N. Nanopoulos, P. Tessier-Viennois
(IBRD), and F. Couprie and C. Sourang (Consultants). Negotiations were delayed
due to major political changes in 1983.
1.02     Cameroon is located on the Gulf of Guinea, covers 475,000 km2, and
includes a wide range of climatic conditions, from Sahelian in the extreme
north to tropical rain forest in the south.  One third of the land (156,000
kim2) is classified as agricultural.
1.03     Cameroon' s population is estimated to be 9.1 million (1983), over 40%
being under 15 years of age, and about 75% being directly dependent on the
rural sector. With the current 2.7% per annum growth rate the population is
predicted to almost double by the year 2000, reaching about 16 million, 50% of
whom are expected to be urban. Consequently a substantial increase in agri-
cultural productivity is required if urban food needs are to be met from
domestic production.
B. The National Economy
1.04     Over the past 15 years Cameroon has experienced accelerating economic
growth. Real GDP increased by an average of 4.2% per year during the Second
Development Plan period (1966-71), 4.5% during the Third Plan period (1971-
1976) and an estimated 9% in the Fourth Plan period (1976-1981). The GDP is
currently estimated at US$7.9 billion, representing a per capita income of
US$880 in 1982/83.
1.05     The Cameroonian economy is now experiencing the most rapid structural
transformation in its history as a result of rising production and export of
petroleum. Prior to the exploitation of oil, Cameroon was dependent on agri-
cultural products for the bulk of its foreign exchange earnings. In 1977/78,
agricultural commodities accounted for 72% of all export earnings, with cocoa
and coffee alone accounting for 53%. However, oil exports, started in 1977/



- 2 -
78, rose to some 52% in 1980/81 and are estimated at 63% for 1981/82. As a
result, the relative share of agricultural exports (whose value remained
stable) fell to 37% in 1980/81 and an estimated 28% in 1981/82. Similar,
although less dramatic, shifts have occurred in the structure of domestic
production. Between 1977/78 and 1980/81, the proportion of agricultural
production (including forestry and fishing) fell from 32 to 26% of GDP, while
oil production rose to over 11%. These trends--rising share of oil in GDP and
exports, and attendant reduction of agriculture's share have continued during
1981/82 and 1982/83 and have resulted in structural changes that are likely to
persist. Oil revenues are expected to dwindle by the mid-1990s at which time
agriculture will again become the main source of growth. In the medium term,
therefore, the Government needs to pursue structural changes in agriculture to
establish the precursors to future growth.
1.06     Infrastructure developments carried out under the Development Plans
have included improvement of the road network, modernization and expansion of
the railway system and port facilities and the sxploitation of hydro-electric
potential.
C. The Agricultural Sector
1.07     Cameroon's diversified agricultural (including forestry) sector is
the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for about 75% of the
population. The sector, divided into traditional agriculture and industrial
plantations, currently involves the cultivation of approximately 2.5 million
ha, or 16% of the country's cultivable area. The traditional sub-sector,
comprising one million smallholdings with an average size of about 2 ha,
accounts for over 93% of food crop production grown for both subsistence and
the domestic market. Cocoa, coffee and cotton are produced for export.
Cattle raising, mainly by nomadic and semi-nomadiic pastoralists in the North,
accounts for about 15% of agricultural production of the traditional sub-
sector. The estate sub-sector comprises several large predominantly Govern-
ment-owned plantations producing palm oil, mainly for domestic consumption,
and rubber for export.
1.08     Cameroon is largely self-sufficient in food, but cereal imports,
mainly wheat and rice for the urban market, have risen since 1970. While the
potential may exist for increasing rice production economically, climatic
conditions do not favour wheat growing. Camerocn will, therefore, continue to
import wheat and, by the year 2000, the quantity is expected to account for
25% of all cereals consumed.
1.09     There are large regional variations in cropping patterns and popula-
tion densities, leading to marked regional disparities in farm incomes. Per
capita farm incomes in the cocoa and coffee producing areas of the south are
about US$260 (1982), whereas in the Western Highlands (maize and coffee) and
parts of the Northern Province (mainly sorghum), where population densities
rise to over 200/km2, they are as low as US$160. Moreover, average per capita
incomes in agriculture are low compared to national per capita incomes of
about $880 (1982), which accounts for steady urban migration. Government
recognizes the essential role of agriculture for long term stability of the
economy and is increasingly concerned by this situation.



1.10     Greater emphasis is being put on improving social amenities in the
rural areas and on projects for raising the productivity of smallholding
agriculture. Principal constraints to the implementation of these plans are
inadequate extension services, weak institutions, inappropriate research, poor
roads, and inefficient input supply and product marketing arrangements. One
of the central objectives of the Fifth Development Plan (continuing from the
Fourth) is to increase productivity through modernization of existing small-
holder cultivation of export/cash crops, including coffee and cocoa. However,
far greater emphasis is now being placed on increased food crop production for
the growing urban population. With the dominant theme of avoiding decline in
agricultural production as a result of the oil boom, Government's initial
budgets for the Fifth Plan (1981-86) propose doubling total investment over
the five years to US$11 billion (1980 terms) and devoting 24% to investments
in the agricultural sector.
D. The Coffee Sub-Sector
1.11     Coffee production in Cameroon for the decade to 1982 has ranged from
78,400 tons (1977) to 105,000 tons (1981), with average annual production
being 93,000 tons, (25% arabica, 75% robusta). This represents about 2.4% of
the world market. However, the annual export quota assigned to Cameroon by
the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) has been reduced from 96,120 tons
to 90,000 tons in early 1982, and to 85,340 tons in mid 1982, despite stocks
of some 20,000 t (mainly robusta). These have accumulated partly as a result
of poor quality and weak export administration. The ICO quota provides for an
annual increase in exports of 1.3% (1,110 tons).
1.12     Producer prices for coffee are reviewed annually and set by Govern-
ment. In 1981 farmers received 61% of FOB value, with 19% being paid for
transportation and processing and 20% as taxes and surplus. As there have
been different marketing arrangements for arabica and robusta coffee, with
government managing robusta marketing directly (para 6.06), a proportionally
larger share of taxes and surpluses were derived from robusta than arabica.
Government subsidies to coffee producers for inputs (paras 6.11-6.15) in 1981
were equivalent to 7% of FOB value, resulting in direct net taxation of coffee
products of about 13%.
1.13     Approximately 45% (up to 42,000 tons) of Cameroon coffee exports
originate in Western Province, which produces 90% of total arabica and 30% of
the nation' s robusta. Both types of coffee originating from this zone are
potentially premium quality and, although the ICO quota currently makes no
differentiation, world demand for arabica coffee is consistently higher than
that for robusta. This market preference might be reflected in quota changes
when ICO agreements are renegotiated. For the immediate future, however, the
prospects for the coffee industry in Cameroon are for a limited increase in
production, within the ICO quota, to be obtained through improving production
efficiency and quality from the existing plantation area, reducing costs and
streamlining marketing arrangements.

E. Bank Group Assistance in Agricultural Development
1.14     Since 1967 the Bank Group has been involved in 19 projects in the
agricultural sector, amounting to a total of loans and credits of US$333.9
million. The major thrust of these projects concerned the tree crop subsector
(oil palm, cocoa and rubber, 9 projects, US$172.4 million); they also included
rural development (3 projects, US$57.7 million), livestock (2 projects,
US$45.1 million), rice production (3 projects, US$34.7 million), forestry (1
project, US$17.0 million) and a rural development fund (RDF, US$7.0 million).
Government's performance in implementing these projects has been mixed.
Implementation of the Second Livestock, the ZAPI and the Oil Palm/Rubber con-
solidation Projects, is hampered by serious organizational, managerial and
financial problems, for which the required remedies are being examined with
Government. Government's performance in implementing the other projects has
been generally good and achievements have been satisfactory. The performance
of the Western Highlands Rural Development Project (Cr 784 CM) (para. 1.31)
has been above average, with 85% realization and a completion period of five
years, or one year extension over the appraisal estimate.
1.15     Bank Strategy and Project Rationale.  To assist Government's policy
for modernizing agriculture, accelerating regional development and expanding
food crop production, Bank lending for the next five years is expected to
support broad sectoral development projects as well as extending investments
in rural development projects. The proposed project would address these ob-
jectives by: increasing crop productivity, strengthening UCCAO, an effective
regional development agency, and helping rationalize Government's pricing
policies.
F. Major Sectoral Institutions
1.16     The institution of principal relevance to the project is the co-
operative Union in Western Province (Union Centrale des Cooperatives Agricoles
de l'Ouest-UCCAO) with its various tiers of responsibilities and functions.
The Ministry of Agriculture is also represented in the project area at Pro-
vincial and Department levels. However, under arrangements for the first
project the Ministry's role is largely supervisory (para 4.03). This reflects
Government's policy of decentralizing responsibility for managing rural
development programs to regional development agencies.
1.17     The Cooperative Movement.  The cooperative movement in Cameroon
started in the early 1930s with the establishment of some cooperatives in the
main coffee growing areas. Initial development was scattered and uncoordi-
nated, but since independence the Government has promoted cooperatives as a
means of providing rural services. The Department of Cooperatives and Mutu-
ality (COOPMUT) of the Ministry of Agricultural is responsible for supervising
cooperatives. Altogether, there are over 350 cooperatives in the country with
a membership of about 320,000 families.  The 66 agricultural cooperatives are
grouped under four Provincial Unions. There is no centralized cooperative
banking system in Cameroon and the cooperatives utilize commercial banks and
Government's agricultural credit institution (Fonds National pour le Devel-
oppement Rural - FONADER) as a source of loan funds for members, the coopera-
tive being responsible for repayment.



1.18     Six agricultural cooperative societies representing the administra-
tive departments of the Western Province together constitute the UCCAO. As a
result of various programs, including enactment of the 1973 Cooperative Act,
the cooperatives in the Western Province, under the apex organisation UCCAO,
have attained sufficient size and stability to be financially viable units in
their own account. These cooperatives have fairly uniform structure and
administration. While performance of individual cooperatives has varied, the
overall system in the Province has reached a stage of development where the
Government has been able to entrust it with various rural development pro-
grams. Thus the movement can now be used as a vehicle for implementing
Government's policy of decentralization of economic and social development in
the Western Province (para. 1.16).
1.19     UCCAO.  Established by law in 1973 and operating by Government
decree, dated 1974, UCCAO originally involved four arabica producers' coopera-
tives, and had a monopoly in purchasing and exporting arabica coffee. UCCAO
was to provide inputs and coffee processing services for its member coopera-
tives. In 1978, UCCAO's objectives were broadened to include support for all
agricultural production activities, and the two robusta cooperatives in
Western Province joined the union. UCCAO is fully owned by its members and
governed by an elected General Assembly comprising representatives of the
Sections within the member cooperatives. A Board of Management representing
the boards of the member cooperatives elects a president and employs a General
Manager with a staff of about 160. This staff is organized into Departments
of Finance and Administration, Commercial Services, Production Services, and
Technical Services, each with a Director. Although UCCAO has an extensive
mandate to direct agricultural development activities in the Province, its
main activities include financial management, bulk purchase and transportation
for coffee production inputs, management of members sales, central sorting and
marketing of arabica coffee, and selling robusta coffee to the National
Produce Marketing Board (Office National de Commercialisation des Produits de
Base - ONCPB). Through managing the Western Highlands Project (para 1.31) the
Union began to fulfill its larger role in promoting agricultural develop-
ment. The project would continue this process.
1.20     The Departmental Cooperatives.  Total membership of the six member
cooperatives forming UCCAO is approximately 100,000 farmers, although, in
practice, there is little distinction between members and non-member/users of
UCCAO's services. The cooperatives are organized into Cooperative Sections
(CS), each of which comprises a number of Cooperative Centers (CC) (Organigram
- Lnnex 1).  The structure and function of the societies and their relation-
ship with UCCAO is governed by statutes. Each society has an administrative
headquarters which provides a center for storage and distribution of ferti-
lizers and collection and processing of parchment coffee. Cooperatives each
have a Board of Directors elected by the Cooperative Sections (CS) to decide
on constitutional and developmental issues and distribution of financial
surpluses to farmers. For each society, a director, approved by the Minister
of Agriculture, is responsible for managing the cooperative's activities as a
whole. The CS is the primary unit of the cooperative organization, each has a
committee constituted of delegates elected by its Cooperative Centres (CCs).
The latter, numbering about 307, have little physical structure and an average



- 6 -
membership of 325 farmers. Through such an organisation, farmers' views and
problems are well represented and UCCAO is considered to be responsive to
these views in management and policy making.
1.21     Cooperative Service Centres (CSC).  Each cooperative operates a
network of cooperative service centres (CSC) which offer services to members,
including the supply of crop production inputs, distribution of coffee
seedlings, credit and transportation, and the purchase of washed/dried coffee
on behalf of their society. Of the 52 CSCs, 41 have storage facilities (total
capacity 27,000 m2) and 31 have office space. The remainder act primarily as
purchase depots for seasonal coffee collection teams. Approximately 60% of
the CSCs have managers who are responsible for day-to-day organization under
the instructions of the cooperative's board of directors. About 20 CSCs
supply farm inputs and these employ at least one permanent staff member
(currently totaling 70). In principle, the CSC should also provide advice and
training for cooperative members, retail goods and other services, but, to
date, these have not been offered. The project would help to remedy this
situation.
1.22     Cooperatives' Financial Situation.  In the three year period 1978 to
1980, UCCAO cooperative members produced a total of 50,000 tons of arabica
coffee, 16,000 tons of robusta coffee, 16,800 tons of cocoa, with a total
market value of US$94.6 million. Sales of inputs, construction materials and
food crops, and other items, earned an additional US$14.5 million, producing a
group turnover of US$109.1 million. From this earned income the cooperatives
generated a profit of US$14.4 million in the period. Of this, about US$5.6
million was paid to farmers in the form of bonuses. However, during this
period, while international coffee prices dropped by about 25%, the farmgate
price for arabica coffee was increased by Government decree by 25% from an
average CFAF 265 in 1978 to CFAF 330 (US$0.84) per kg in 1980. Moreover, the
affiliation of the two robusta coffee cooperatives to UCCAO in 1978, while in
line with Government's policy to have a single development agency in each
province (para. 1.16), placed added burden on the Union's finances. This was
partly the result of inadequate management of the robusta cooperatives which
did not control costs and, to a large extent, from Government's practice of
paying less to robusta cooperatives for coffee processing and marketing than
the real costs which they incurred. Up to 40% of earnings from robusta coffee
sales were retained by the ONCPB as Government revenue. UCCAO itself assumed
the responsibility for covering losses incurred by the robusta cooperatives
and is currently using about 85% of its surplus from arabica coffee marketing
for their support. As a result, the profitability of combined cooperative
operations has been drastically reduced and the profit (before bonus payment)
of the group dropped from US$5.9 million in 1979 to US$1.4 million in 1981.
Interim measures have been taken by Government to reduce taxes on coffee, but
more long lasting reforms are required to help the UCCAO group to preserve its
financial integrity. These measures would be taken as part of the project
(6.06).
1.23     In 1980 the value of UCCAO's capital  stood at CFAF 686 million
(US$1.8 million) with the ratio of capital to assets at 1:12 and debts to
equity at 1:10. This is a satisfactory financial situation. Individual
cooperatives are legally obliged to transfer 15% of their operating surpluses



-7-
to their reserve funds and 5% to an educational fund. These provisions,
together with high coffee prices in the mid 1970s have allowed the coopera-
tives to accumulate large reserves. The net worth of the group is now
estimated to be CFAF 11.1 billion (US$28.3 million), which, for a marketing
cooperative like UCCAO, is an excellent position. However, while the overall
liquidity of the group as a whole has been quite good, there are great vari-
ations between the cooperatives; the most solvent having a ratio of 7:1, and
the worst, for the two robusta cooperatives, with ratios below 1:1. As
stated, the robusta cooperatives have been able to operate only with the
financial support from UCCAO (para 1.22).
1.24     Under the first project, audits of each cooperative and of UCCAO were
completed in May 1982, together with a detailed organization and management
study undertaken by consultants. The audit report, which was generally
supportive of UCCAO's and the cooperatives' accounting operations, identified
a number of areas where improvements could be made. For example, UCCAO has
consistently made inadequate provisions for bad debts and losses on poor
investments. Adjusting for these, the auditors found that UCCAO's net worth
had been overstated by about 10%, even through it was still excellent (para
1.23). The accompanying study made specific proposals for remedying weak-
nesses in accounting, financial management, training, and operation of
services. These have been adopted as the bases for organizational improvement
in the proposed project (para 3.14) and considerable progress has been made
with implementing these changes. Furthermore, additional investments in the
individual member cooperatives would be conditional on their effecting the
proposed changes in procedures and resolution of financial queries (para
3.33). On this basis UCCAO and its member cooperatives are considered to be a
suitable vehicle to handle project implementation.
1.25     Credit Operations.  The cooperatives have been providing credit to
their members for several years through the CSCs. In principle there are four
types of credit: (a) secured seasonal credit in both cash and kind received
against end-of-year bonus payments ("Credit sur la ristourne"); (b) unsecured
seasonal credit in kind ("Credit special"); (c) unsecured seasonal credit in
cash to robusta coffee farmers ("Credit de campagne"); and (d) unsecured
medium-term agricultural equipment credit ("Credit materiels agricoles").
Seasonal credit is repayable within twelve months and security is the
cooperatives' franchise on coffee purchases. Historically, credit has been
mainly seasonal and for coffee production. Therefore it has not generally
been available to women for food crops. Agricultural equipment credit is
provided for three years for the purchase of pulpers, sprayers and wire
netting for grain storage units. Exact provisions have varied between
cooperatives. In 1980 and 1981 the total value of all these forms of credit
was approximately CFAF 400 million (US$1.0 million) and credit was granted to
about 17,000 farmers (17% of the cooperatives' members). Although the
cooperatives have improved their credit operations and record keeping in
recent years, deficiencies in procedures and accountancy methods still
exist. The overall ratio of credit recovered to credit disbursed was 78%
during the last four years, but due to stricter control this ratio was
improved to 97% for years 1980-81. In general, difficulties in credit
handling and constraints in its growth can be attributed to: (a) the absence
of an adequate system for credit administration; (b) lack of a monitoring and



-8-
supervision system; and (c) the fact that no interest is charged on loans
provided from the cooperatives' own funds, which encourage delayed repay-
ment. These issues would be addressed by the project (paras 3.16 and 4.17).
1.26     Coffee Processing.  In 1982 a consultant's survey of the physical
facilities at each cooperative assessed the organization of each factory and
the associated arrangements for buying and transportation. The role played by
UCCAO in processing and marketing was also reviewed. Considerable deficien-
cies, including worn out machinery, poor organization, inadequate maintenance,
untrained management and poorly coordinated transport at all stages, were
identified. The operations of the robusta cooperatives' factories were the
least efficient, although a generally poor situation prevailed. Overall it is
estimated that approximately 8% of the value of UCCAO coffee is being for-
feited because of poor quality and inefficient handling and a further 9% is
lost due to unreliable marketing by UCCAO. As a result there has been a
steady deterioration in the reputation of Cameroonian coffee, particularly for
arabica, which now attracts the lowest prices in the world markets. Correc-
tion of these weaknesses is vital to promoting sales of Cameroon coffee and
maximizing earnings in the difficult years ahead.  The project would con-
tribute significantly to resolving these problems (para 4.22).
1.27     FONADER was created in 1973 with the dual role of: (a) providing
credit to farmers, pre-cooperatives and cooperatives, and (b) appraising,
financing and supervising (on behalf of Government) a wide variety of rural
development programs, from insecticide and fertilizer supply to village water
supply and irrigation projects. The Special Rural Development Fund Project
(FSAR - Cr. 723-CM) is a key element in these actions. A FONADER branch
office exists in Western Province (at Bafoussam), however, its activities are
limited and its total lending in Western Province was only CFAF 160-190
million (US$0.5 million) in 1981. Loans to cooperative societies have been
fully recovered, whereas for loans to individuals and farmer groups, recovery
has been only about 25%.
1.28     FONADER contributed US$2.5 million to a Revolving Credit Fund (RCF)
established under the Western Highlands Rural Development Project (para. 1.31)
for farm inputs. This fund is administered by UCCAO which contributed US$1.4
million to its creation. Funds from the RCF are lent to farmers at an annual
interest rate of 9% and includes a 2% contribution to the National Guarantee
Fund and a 4% administrative fee to FONADER. The difference, amounting to 3%
per annum for funds borrowed from FONADER and 7% per annum for funds contri-
buted by UCCAO, are retained by the RCF to cover UCCAO's aministrative costs
and to provide further credit to smallholders. Although loans and annual
interest charges to the RCF have been repaid by the cooperatives on time, no
reconciliation has been made of individual repayments. This situation would
be rectified under the project.
1.29     At the national level, the bulk of FONADER's funds were traditionally
utilized to subsidize farm inputs such as fertilizers. As a consequence,
funds for financing investments in cooperatives to improve their facilities
and efficiency has been inadequate. To partially remedy this situation
investment funds originating under the project (para 5.04(ii)) when repaid by
the UCCAO cooperatives would be allocated to a special fund, to be designated



-9-
by Government, for subsequent re-lending for capital investments in other
cooperatives.
1.30     Provicial Delegation of Agriculture.  The Ministry of Agriculture is
represented in all provinces by a Provincial Delegate (DP) who is responsible
for coordinating the actions of the provincial representatives of the various
directorates of the Ministry. The provincial delegation is represented by a
delegate in each administrative department and a senior agricultural officer
(chef de poste agricole principal - CPAP) at sub-department level. The
MINAGRI Delegate in Western Province is a member of the project coordinating
committee (para. 4.02).
G. Performance Under the First Project
1.31     The Western Highlands Rural Development Project (Cr. 784-CM) was
appraised in June 1977. Estimated project costs were US$25.0 million, to be
financed: by IDA US$13.0 million; Government, US$4.4 million; UCCA0, US$7.4
million; and farmers, US$ 0.2 million. The Credit became effective in
December 1978. The project area encompassed the three arabica coffee-growing
departmegts of the Province (Mifi, Menoua and Bamboutos) covering an area of
6,000 km . The project zone included 100,000 ha. The objective was to
provide a package of complementary measures including training, extension,
fertilizer and pesticides, credit, soil conservation/afforestation, applied
research, improved food crop seeds, and coffee processing to stimulate pro-
duction. Project financing also included institution building and development
of bottomlands and village water points. The project was to extend over four
years and UCCAO (para. 1.16) was designated executing agency.
1.32     The Project was planned to utilize and strengthen existing provincial
resources. Thus, while the IDA Credit provided funds for establishing project
units to execute certain components (soil conservation, seed farm, monitoring
and evaluation, and training and extension), other components were to be
executed by existing MINAGRI provincial services: rural works (G6nie Rural)
for construction of water points and bottomland development, and the crop
protection service (Department of Agriculture) for pest and fungus treatment
of coffee. Similarly, a convention was made between the national Agricultural
Research Institute (IRA) and Government for undertaking applied research
work. Project extension services were to be developed within UCCAO so as to
replace the existing, poorly organized extension service under the Provincial
Delegate of MINAGRI.
1.33     Start-up of the project was slow because of delays in establishing a
Directorate of Production within UCCAO with responsibility for the project's
agricultural field activities. Progress of most project components reflected
this delay. Project activities have accelerated considerably since 1980, and
approximately 85% of the original objectives will have been achieved after
postponing the Credit closing date by twelve months to June 1984. In response
to justified demand, the original project area was extended in 1980 to include
contiguous parts of the three other provincial departments (Noun, Haut Nkam
and Nde) contained within the arabica coffee zone.



- 10 -
1.34     The principal achievement has been in institution building: the
planning, organization, control, recording and accounting procedures estab-
lished within the project are good. The project has successfully established
training and extension services. A self contained, 30 bed training centre has
been constructed in Bafoussam. Training service staff include two farm
extension lecturers, audio visual, design and printing technicians and support
staff. Six courses for selection and training of extension officers have been
completed and the service has produced training materials which have been
demonstrated and distributed to field staff and farmers. The following
extension service staff have been appointed: a chief and a deputy chief of
service, 4 sector chiefs, 53 supervisors and 190 extension agents, a signi-
ficant advancement over the original calendar. An estimated 40,000 farmers
have been covered by the project's extension services, compared with 30,200
envisaged at appraisal. However, at the end of the project, approximately 33%
of the extension staff and participating farmers will have been involved with
the project for less than one year (Working Paper 12). A project monitoring
unit (PMU) has been operational for three years (para 4.21).
1.35     In terms of physical achievements, the project will have realized the
following: design and construction of 200 water points (of 220 planned),
provision of 2,900 coffee pulpers (of 3,000 planned); cultivation of 200 ha of
the seed farm (of 300 ha planned), and the initial distribution of improved
seeds: hybrid maize (100t), beans/groundnut (50t) and potatoes (50t).
Achievements in promoting soil conservation will exceed the pilot expectation
with the creation of 36 demonstration sites. An estimated 450 ha of eroded
slopes will have been planted with trees (100% of plan). In addition to
creating a topographic survey capability, 350 ha, or 88 percent of the 400 ha
bottomlands planned for drainage will be achieved. However, due to delays in
establishing the terms governing their use, only 260 ha of these bottomlands
will be cultivated (in 1730 individual farmer parcels). Six Cooperative
Service Centres (CSCs) will have been constructed and a further 16 renovated,
thus completing 60 percent of the original objective. Most of the shortfalls
have resulted from late starts and over optimistic targets. Progress under
each component has been thoroughly analyzed and targets under the second
project (para 3.02) account for the experience gained to date.
1.36     During the project, annual fertilizer application will have increased
by approximately 3,000 tons over PYO level, but due to problems affecting
national procurement and financing of inputs, this is equivalent to only 30%
of the appraisal plan. In 1983 Government took action to improve the financ-
ing and supply aspects of crop inputs (para. 6.13). Similarly, the achieve-
ments in treatment of coffee against pests and diseases, although in line with
original proposals, are now considered sub-optimal due to poor timing and
selection of priority areas and national shortages of chemicals. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations regarding permanent improvement in the organi-
zation of input supplies (para. 6.13).
1.37     Apart from the problem in input supply, weaknesses in the first
project included over-emphasis on coffee production and lack of attention to
improving coffee quality, coffee marketing and the balance between coffee and
food crop production. In order to avoid over-complexity, the first project
included only minor direct participation of the six UCCAO member cooperatives,



although 85% of farmers are members. Other problems related to weak IRA
support for the applied research component, delayed initiation, and over-
ambitious monitoring and evaluation. Insufficient definition of their
relationship with the project resulted in lack of cooperation from provincial
and departmental MINAGRI delegates. These problem areas have been reviewed
and would be addressed in the second project.
1.38     Implementation of the Western Highlands project was also constrained
by problems encountered by the associated Feeder Roads Project (Cr. 749 -
Ln. 1494). Cost overruns and central management difficulties have delayed
construction and reduced the length of roads which can be achieved with the
funds available. As a result, only about 400km (44%) of the 900 km of cate-
gory A feeder roads programmed for reconstruction/maintenance in Western
Province, are likely to be achieved. The Government has now reorganized and
decentralized feeder road construction for the remaining category A feeder
roads and these are likely to be completed during the second project.
1.39     Despite these shortfalls, the first project has had a significant
impact on agricultural production in the area. Incremental coffee production
is expected to reach 2,200 tons per year, or 70% of the level anticipated at
appraisal (3,160 tons). The complex mixed cropping regime in the project area
(para. 2.05) makes it extremely difficult to measure food crop production
levels; however it is estimated that the overall increase in rainfed food crop
production during the first project has exceeded predictions by 10,000 tons
(5%). No project cost overrun is anticipated and disbursements are expected
to be completed within one year of the appraisal estimated disbursement
period.  The economic rate of return for the first project is re-estimated at
approximately 17%. The shortfall over the appraisal estimate (20%) is due
primarily to lower coffee production resulting from inadequate supply of
fertilizers and chemicals.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Geographic and Demographic Background
2.01     The project would serve the whole of the Western Province (IBRD Map
No. 16677), which occupies 13,930 km2 (3% of the national territory), about
twice the area of the first project. This includes a total of 407,000 ha of
cultivable land (2.5% of the national total), of which an estimated 250,000 ha
are cultivated annually. The Province has some 1.0 million inhabitants or
about 12% of the national population. Approximately 80% are rural and
agrarian. The area is densely populated, with an average of 72
inhabitants/km2 varying from 27/km2 in the Noun to 221/km2 in the Mifi. This
compares with a national population density of 18 inhabitants/km2.
2.02     Ecology and Climate.  There are four soil types in the project
area: (i) ferralitic, covering 85% of the Province, of which one third has
reasonable agricultural value; (ii) black androsols of medium-high potential;
(iii) brown entrophe soils of high potential; and (iv) hydromorphic alluvial
soils of high potential when drained. The rainy season extends for 9 months,



- 12 -
with annual precipitation varying from 1,500 mm (eastern lowlands) to 2,000 mm
(Western Highlands). Mean annual temperatures range from 20 to 220 C. Three
agro/ecological zones are discernable: (i) highland zone, extending for
approximately 9,400 m2 and including three sub-zones at different altitudes;
(ii) central plateau to the east, covering 3,750 km2; and (iii) robusta/cocoa
zone at 1,000-1,500 m covering 750 km2 to the south. The highland zone was
originally densely forested, but growing population pressure has resulted in
extensive deforestation and increasing erosion.
B. Human Resources and Land Tenure
2.03     It is estimated that the project area includes 133,000 farms,
comprising on average 6 family members, equivalent to 3.5 adults per farm.
Average farm size varies from 1.3 ha in the most densely populated part of
Western Highlands to 3.0 ha in the east of the Province. Land rights are
usufructuary and manual labor is generally provided by family members. The
incidence of landlessness is rare because of migration by young people to
urban centers, notably Donala. However, this has resulted in a demographic
profile of the farm labor force in which the average age of farmers is 53
years, 19% are aged over 65 and only 9% are between 25 and 35 years.
C. Agronomic Traditions and Production
2.04     Traditionally, men are responsible for coffee cultivation and women
for subsistance food production. As a result, a system of intense mixed
cropping has evolved whereby women cultivate and weed a wide variety of food
crops between coffee bushes. Selling of surplus food crops is women's
prerogative. Pruning, fertilization and spraying of coffee is exclusively
masculine work, as is harvesting (although children also assist), primary
processing and marketing. Recently, the production for marketing of mixed
food crops (involving both women and men) outside coffee plantations has
increased, using steeper slopes and sometimes seriously reducing the period
during which the ferralitic soils are left under bush fallow. As this
practice will reduce long-term soil fertility, the need for improved extension
services, cultural practices and better coordination of mixed cropping is
becoming critical.
2.05     The economy of the Province is very closely linked to the performance
of the arabica and robusta coffee which occupy 60,000 and 57,000 ha respect-
ively, together representing 61% of the total cultivated area. Cocoa planta-
tions occupy 4,800 ha in the lowest, robusta region but this crop has limited
potential compared with coffee. The main food crops are maize, groundnuts,
beans, yams, plantains and bananas. Despite its large population, Western
Province is the main center for commercial production of potatoes and
vegetables in the country, and it is the main source of food crops for the
cities of Douala and Yaounde. The association of food crops with arabica
coffee is most fully developed in the highlands, where the farms are the
smallest (average 1.3 ha). In spite of a one cycle cultivation for most of
the crops, the rate of intercropping is so high that cropping intensity can
reach 200%. Relative to the ecological and demographic factors, this regime,
having evolved over many years, is probably best for optimum output. In
contrast, robusta coffee is generally grown in pure stands, but is sometimes



- 13 
found in association with food crops (20%) or cocoa, oil palm, native pear
(Dacryodes edulis), banana or plantain(30%).
2.06     Because of their association with coffee, food crops benefit from the
fertilizer applied to that crop. By national standards the rate of fertil-
izer consumption, estimated at 140 kg per hectare on small arabica coffee
farms, is high. Current areas and yields of the principal crops in the area
(on a pure stand basis) are estimated as follows:

Cattle are mainly kept in the highland pastures above 1,800 meters and in the
poorest part of the Noun Department. The typical crop farm has only small
animals, mostly pigs , but also sheep and goats, and poultry.
2.07     With the high ratio of 2 persons per ha of agricultural land, it is
estimated that annual average GDP per capita in the region ranges from about
US$160 for a typical farm family planting 1.0 ha of food crops, to about
US$250 for a 1.7 ha farm (in the Western Highlands area), growing both arabica
coffee and food crops. Because of the dependence of the region on rainfed
agriculture, rural incomes fluctuate considerably. Estimated cash income
averages US$400, with coffee contributing about 60% of the revenue on arabica
farms and 100% on robusta farms.
2.08      Agricultural Research.  Regional IRA research centers are located at
Dschang, Foumbot and Bambui, each having a number of zonal antennae.
D.  Road Communications
2.09      The main road network in the highlands of the Province is dense and
in good condition. The roads from Bafoussam to Douala, to Bamenda and to
Foumban are paved and main access routes existing in the three departments
covered by the first project are of all-weather gravel or laterite construc-
tion and are sometimes paved. The construction of a paved road linking
Bafoussam and Yaound6 will be completed in 1984. Conversely, the feeder road
network, although fairly extensive, is in poor condition (particularly



- 14 -
Category B roads) due to inadequate maintenance. This creates a serious
constraint to input supply and crop marketing. The Feeder Roads Project (para
1.38) was designated to support the Western Highlands Rural Development
Project but did not fully achieve planned targets. In the new areas to be
included in the project the road network is considerably less extensive and
often poorly maintained, creating communication problems. The project would
include provisions for alleviating this constraint (para 3.35).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Summary
3.01     Objectives.  The project would be a fo:Llow-up to the Western
Highlands Rural Development Project (Cr. 784-CM). It would consolidate and
improve the existing operations and extend these to the whole of Western
Province, with the aim of reaching 85,000 farmers, or about 60% of the rural
population. Of this number, 45,000 would be incremental. The focus would be
on promoting sound food crop husbandry, improvement in coffee quality and
marketing, strengthening of cooperatives and further integration of project
services with routine provincial operations.
3.02     Summary Description.  These objectives would be achieved through a
five-year project which would comprise:
(i)  quantitative and qualitative improvement of coffee and food crop
production by the provision of incremental fertilizers and pesticides
(paras 3.06 and 3.07); strengthening the organization of the crop
protection service for coffee (para 3.08); and improvement in crop
drying and storage techniques (para 3.09);
(ii) expansion and streamlining of UCCAO's agricultural training and
extension services to cover all six departments of the Western
Province, including the recruitment of extention agents and
"intendants" to improve the planning and control of extension
services, and to support the reorganization of cooperative service
centers (para 3.14); and female extension agents to focus training
and extension activities on food crop production for women (para
3.12);
(iii)  enhancing the organization and management capacity within UCCAO,
particularly through strengthening its administration and financial
management and effecting similar improvements in the operations of
cooperatives (para 3.15), and revision of farmer credit operations
(para 3.16) and training all levels of cooperative staff (para 3.11);
(iv) acceleration of soil conservation and reafforestation measures (para
3.17) and drainage and cultivation of bottomlands (para 3.18);
(v) adaptive research which would concentrate on improving on-farm
technology and coffee processing, and increasing the supply of elite
food crop seeds for multiplication (para 3.20);



- 15 -
(vi) reorganization of the coffee seed nurseries (para 3.25) and enlarging
the seed farm to increase the supply of improved food crop seeds
(para 3.23);
(vii) construction of 450 village water points to improve public health
(para 3.27) and to facilitate coffee washing operations, for which
collective pulpers and drying trays would also be provided (paras
3.30 and 3.31);
(viii) reorganization and streamlining of coffee processing and marketing,
including modernization of the cooperatives' factories and construc-
tion and improvement of processing facilities for UCCAO (para 3.33);
(ix)  construction, upgrading and periodic maintenance of 500 km of
category B feeder roads to facilitate delivery of inputs and
evacuation of products (para 3.35); and
(x) strengthening the existing monitoring and evaluation units at project
and national levels, and creation of MINAGRI evaluation capacity in
the Province (para 3.39).
B. Detailed Features
3.03     Agricultural Productivity.  The key objectives of the project would
be to emphasize food crop production in association with coffee by the appli-
cation of specific balanced technological "packages", and to improve the
quality, storage, processing and marketing of these products. The existing
cultivation practices of predominantly mixed cropping would be maintained;
however, productivity would be improved in two fundamental ways:
(i) the revision of crop husbandry practices to give specific attention
to food crops; including provision of improved seeds, timely planting
optimum density, appropriate fertilizer treatment, and adequate
weeding; and
(ii) the introduction of specific programs for the organization and
phasing of coffee replanting, improving the precision of pesticide
and fungicide treatment and the harvesting and primary processing of
coffee by farmers.
Apart from expansion in the area of bottomlands cultivation, no significant
change in the existing cultivated areas of crops are anticipated during the
project. Rather, incremental production would result from technological
improvements on two levels: (i) improved husbandry and fertilizer application;
and (ii) appropriate crop protection activities, the use of improved varieties
of food crops and better coffee seedlings. It is estimated that these
refinements would require an additional 45 mandays per family per year, of
which 60% would be for women's tasks. Annual labor use profiles indicate that
this would be feasible. In view of the low significance of cocoa production
in the project area compared with coffee, for which the area is agronomically
better suited, no assistance would be provided for cocoa production.



- 16 -
3-04     Food Crop Production.  Food crop production would focus on maize,
groundnuts, beans, yams, plantains, potatoes and bananas. Vegetable produc-
tion would be promoted through intensive cultivation on small plots in the
bottomlands which would be drained under the project. The necessary produc-
tion technology and potential performance of improved varieties of the major
crops involved have been established during the first project (Working
Paper 2).
3.05     Coffee Cultivation.  A replanting program for arabica coffee would
include replacing the existing Jamaican varieties by the Javan variety which
has higher yield potential and greater resistance to anthracnose (coffee berry
disease). The program would benefit from better organization and approxi-
mately 3,000 ha of arabica coffee would be replanted annually. This is about
4% of the total area in the Province, which, if maintained would renew all
coffee plantations every 25 years. This is considered appropriate to achieve
optimum productivity, compared to the 40 years resulting from the current
replanting rate (2.5% per year). Improvement of robusta planting material
would involve the production of clones of selected local varieties at the IRA
Barombikang station, to produce rooted seedlings for subsequent distribu-
tion. The robusta coffee nursery and replanting programs would be substan-
tially reorganized to allow systematic replacement of approximately 800 ha
annually. For both arabica and robusta coffee, replacement of old plantations
would be ensured by annual programs, strictly organized and coordinated by the
extension service on a zoned basis (para 3.25).
3.06     Fertilizer Consumption.  By PY5 fertilizer would be expected to be
applied to 80g of arabica coffee area and 30% of the robusta coffee area.
Because of the effect of food crop association, it is estimated that of the
total fertilizer applied under the project, arabica and robusta coffee would
benefit from 27% and 75% respectively, food crops utilizing the remainder.
The yield response is estimated at 1 kg clean coffee per 2 kg available
nutrients for both arabica and robusta.  Projections of fertilizer use are
summarized on the following page:

These targets are realistic, as the organizational constraints which led to
inadequate supplies of fertilizers (and crop protection chemicals) in the past
(para. 1.36) have been largely overcome by Government action in 1983 (para.
6.10). The policy regarding fertilizer price subsidies is being reconsidered
by Government and periodic joint reviews during the project are expected to
bring about progressive rationalisation. Study of the technical and economic
aspects of single ingredient versus compound fertilizers would be a priority
for the project's applied research component (para 3.20).
3.07     Crop Protection.  The operational objectives of the project in terms
of areas to be treated and quantities of chemicals required for disease
prevention would be as follows:
(i)  continue to treat an area of 80,000 ha of coffee plantations against
antestia but, by improving efficiency, reduce the quantities of
chemicals applied from 320,000 to 240,000 liters per annum;
(ii) treat as at present, the 54,000 ha of arabica plantations above
1,500 m annually against anthracnose, but increase the availability
of chemicals to farmers from 1.0 to 4.3 million 50 mg sachets;
(iii)  extend the area of robusta coffee treated annually against scolytes
from 13,000 ha to 20,000 ha, and increase the application rate with
corresponding increase in chemicals from 33,000 to 120,000 liters;
(iv) maintain all other plant protection operations at their current
level, except for a minimal increase in the chemicals provided for
capsid control through swingfog machines; and
(v) introduce insecticide spraying of approximately 5,000 ha of plantains
to control weevil infestation.
3.08     Crop Protection Service.  To assure better proficiency in disease
prevention in coffee, the coordination between UCCAO's Production Department
and the provincial crop protection service would be improved and UCCAO would
continue to be involved in the choice and procurement of chemical inputs for
the service (para 6.13).  At negotiations Government assurances were obtained
regarding the provision of sufficient subsidy funds each year in FONADER for
the timely purchase of chemicals (para 8.01(ii)). Appropriate precautions
concerning the suitability of biocides and their safe use would be observed as
UCCAO gave assurances at negotiations to procure only chemicals satisfactory
to the Bank (para 8.01 (i)). It is envisaged that the existing six crop
protection brigades would be maintained throughout the project, without
significant increase in staff. In addition to the necessary vehicles and
operating costs for the brigades, annual financing would be provided for about
5,500 manual sprayers to be sold for cash or on credit to farmers and 60
Swingfog apparatus for sale to cooperatives.
3.09     Food Crop Drying and Storage.  Approximately 40 percent of food crops
are stored in farm houses or clay bins and inadequate drying is common. Con-
sequently, post harvest losses arising from rotting and insects infestation
are estimated to be 13%. Actions to reduce these losses would include train-



18 -
ing of women in improved harvesting techniques and storage methods. Specific
finance, through medium-term credit would be provided under the project for
the purchase of 3,000 160 kg capacity metal bins for airtight grain storage on
the farms. Insecticides for protection of stored crops would be available.
Similarly, credit would be made available to small groups of farmers for
installation of 75 charcoal fired grain driers (3 ton bag capacity). Trials
with both of these methods were undertaken during the first project and
detailed instruction on their implementation would be provided to farmers by
the extension service (para 4.08).
3.10     Field Services.  UCCAO's training and extension services, effectively
initiated under the first project, would be consolidated and the services
expanded province-wide. Improved use of the "training and visit" (TV) system,
and cooperative training would be instituted.
3.11     Training Service.  Operations of the training center (para 1.34)
would be intensified under the project through the provision of financing for
the following actions:
(i) improving the building facilties at th,e center and extending training
operations to cooperative employees;
(ii) the appointment of an administrative officer, (to relieve the Chief
of Training Service from day to day involvement in the center's
operation) together with additional support staff;
(iii) the recruitment of four additional Cameroonian training officers,
making a total of six: (a) to give specific attention to the
training of women; (b) to facilitate expansion of training for
cooperatives; and (c) to provide direclt liaison with extension agents
in the field;
(iv) purchase of audiovisual equipment for production and distribution of
technical information and training materials;
(v) purchase of vehicles for the operation of the center and associated
field work, including a minibus to transport of extension service and
cooperative staff trainees, and a mobile cinema; and
(vi) the recruitment of training specialists (6 months in PY1 and 2 months
in each of PY2 to PY4) to assist in designing training programs for
cooperative staff and to train training officers.
3.12     Extension Service.  In order to reach participants in the extended
project area, the field extension service staff would be increased under the
project as follows: two sector chiefs (making 6 in total or one per depart-
ment), i2 sub-sector chiefs (making a total of 27); 21 extension supervisors
(chef de poste agricole- - CPA - making a total of 65), and 130 extension
agents (moniteur agricole-MA- making a total of 320).  In addition twenty-four
supply officers (intendants) would be recruited in order to improve procedures
for estimating seed, fertilizer and chemical requirements, organizing their
transportation, storage and distribution, as well as undertaking actions to



- 19 -
raise coffee quality. To improve the coordination of food crop production
12 female agricultural graduates would be recruited (2 per department) as
"animatrices" to devise and promote specific programs for women.
3.13     To support the increased extension services, financing would be
provided under the project for construction of a central store for materials,
the construction or rental and operation of offices for the sector chiefs and
sub-sector chiefs, purchase and operation of vehicles and office equipment,
and for field demonstrations. Additional equipment and facilities for the
UCCA0 workshop, which was improved under the first project, would also be
included to expand its capacity to adequately maintain the increased number of
vehicles. A qualified and highly experienced mechanic would be recruited
internationally to supervise garage operations (para 3.38).
3.14     Development of the Cooperative Movement.  Assistance would focus on
improving organization and management both at cooperative level and in UCCA0
(para 4.13). Financing would be provided for the following incremental costs
associated with these developments: vehicles for UCCAO supervision, equipment,
including the eventual hire of computer facilities for accounting; the comple-
tion of the construction of the 38 Cooperative Service Centers (CSCs)
commenced under the first project (para 1.35); and necessary improvements to
14 CSCs in the extended project area. This would involve the construction and
equipping of eight centers (including office and store of about 3,720 m2 each)
for cooperatives in the remaining four departments. Approximately 10,000 tons
of additional storage capacity (8,000 m2) would be constructed to remedy
deficiencies at the cooperatives and UCCAO.
3.15     Provision would also be made for the reorganization of accounting,
financial control, administration and credit operations within UCCA0 and in
each member cooperative. Key project personnel would be provided through
international recruitment, including (a) a qualified financial controller
(5 years) as advisor to the UCCAO finance and administration Director the
Project Manager on management controls, and (b) a credit specialist (3 years)
to assist in reorganizing the credit section. As part of the phased reorgani-
zation of CSCs, additional qualified personnel would be recruited for the
positions of center chief/credit officer, cashier/ credit clerk, credit clerk
and storekeeper, plus three support staff. Provisions would also include:
training for existing staff, revision of administrative and accounting
procedures, and short term consultancy by an accountant to advise the coopera-
tives on their financial reorganization. A scheme for encouraging members
savings would also be initiated as an adjunct to the proposed credit scheme.
3.16     Financing would include the provision of credit for crop production
inputs, simple storage and equipment. In accordance with annual crop "pack-
ages", seasonal credit would be available in kind, to farmers and their wives,
on the recommendation of the extension officer and cooperative delegate, and
approved by the extension supervisor. To qualify for credit, farmers or their
wives would receive training and participate in group T&V extension activi-
ties. Credit would be secured by the predicted value of coffee to be produced
from the individual's holdings. The loan would be recovered, together with
the interest accrued (para 4.17), by deduction from the amount due for
delivery of parchment/dried coffee. Although farmers would be individually



- 20 -
responsible for credit repayment, farmers within the extension group would be
collectively responsible for ensuring timely reimbursement. Inputs would be
sold to non coffee growing farmers for cash only. Loans for medium term
investments would be approved on the basis of a satisfactory repayment record
for seasonal credit.
3.17     Soil Conservation and Reafforestation.  Increased farmer sensitivity
to the importance of soil conservation is vital to the long term stability of
agricultural production in Western Province. Therefore, the conservation
measures initiated under the first project, and actively supported by the
farmers, would be expanded. Project financing would include support for
specific control measures covering 100 ha of the most endangered areas and
reafforestation of 750 ha of eroded hills. Approximately fifteen pre-exten-
sion plots would be provided in the six departments with emphasis on village
participation. These would include 50 demonstration plots involving shade,
fruit and fuel plants and include the production of selected grass and other
grazing species for small livestock. Permanent staffing of the conservation
section would be expanded to provide six controllers (3 additional, giving 1
per department), support staff, casual labor and the necessary vehicles and
equipment. The tree nursery sections would be similarly expanded to provide
seedling production and distribution capacity in each department. A special-
ist advisor would be recruited internationally (para 3.38) to assist with the
expansion of operations during PYI, and retained thereafter on a consultancy
for two months per year in PY2 to PY4, for review and planning.
3.18     Bottomlands Development.  In order to increase the area of cultivable
land available to the population, finances would be provided to carry out
simple drainage works on areas of potentially highly productive bottomlands.
This drainage work, totalling approximately 350 ha, would be undertaken by the
Bottomlands Development Unit, established under the first project. A quali-
fied and experienced engineer supported by a draftsman would continue to head
the unit, which would be strengthened by the recruitment of a second engineer
specifically responsible for preparing detailed plans and evaluating the
development costs of potential sites. This would include detailed sociolo-
gical and technical studies of potential development areas. The latter would
be supported, through the convention with IRA, by soils analysis at the Econa
laboratory. Some additional craftsmen, support staff and laborers would be
recruited, together with provision of necessary vehicles and equipment for
operating the service, office rental and establishment cost. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that allocation of individual areas of bottomland
development would be preceded by detailed planning and evaluation by the
Bottomlands Development Unit and formal agreement with the community concerned
regarding: (i) the allocation of plots to farmers, (ii) production techniques
to be used, (iii) the regular maintenance of earthworks and structures (in
collaboration with the Bottomlands Development Unit), and (iv) payment of
associated costs (para 8.01(xii)).
3.19     Particular attention would be given to accelerating the cultivation
of the combined area to be drained under the first and the proposed projects
(target 700 ha). The sociologist, to be recruited to undertake preliminary
studies would also help prepare agreements and training programs for the
selected communities. A specialized section for rainfed vegetable production



- 21 -
would be established, as part of the extension service to be staffed by a
chief, three supervisors and six extension agents. As with the first project,
plots designated for vegetable cultivation would be assigned by UCCAO (para
4.19) in parcels of approximately 0.20 ha. Finance would be provided for the
necessary vehicles, equipment and support staff to enable the section to
undertake demonstrations, specialist training, production planning and super-
vision. The section would maintain close liaison with the market intelligence
unit of the monitoring and evaluation service (para 4.21), and would promote
collaboration between the growers and private traders operating in the area.
Crops to be grown include mainly potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage and beans.
3.20     Applied Research.  Provision would be made for undertaking by IRA of
a detailed program of applied research concentrating on the association of
food crops with coffee, both in young and mature plantations. This would
include measurements of optimum plant populations, and technical and economic
aspects of fertilizer treatment. Extensive trials on cultivation techniques,
the relative benefits of associated crops compared with pure stand, and the
implications on the respective roles of men and women on the farm would be a
central feature. Specific research would be undertaken to select superior
varieties of plantain and root crops from those existing in the zone and to
test the adaptability of various fruit tree varieties. Trials to develop
improved, simple methods for preservation and storage of food crops on farms,
would continue.
3.21     Special attention would be given to studies for improving the proces-
sing and drying of coffee cherries. Financing would be provided for, inter
alia, trials with chemicals for accelerating fermentation of arabica coffee
and the introduction of village coffee washing facilities. The latter could
be modeled on techniques successfully used in Eastern Africa, and funds would
be included for the installation of up to 25 washing/drying "factories" at
receptive cooperative centers. Supervisory staff and finance for planning,
construction and operation would also be provided.  In addition to the techni-
cal aspects, these trials would need to investigate alternative approaches for
buying arabica coffee as berries, rather than dried as at present. Success
would offer significant advantages, both in quality of product and from
improved productivity.
3.22     The applied research component would be executed both on IRA stations
and selected farms near agricultural posts. To overcome the inadequate
actions taken in support of applied research during the first project,
finances would be provided, for the permanent assignment of 2-3 technicians
and laborers to conduct the work plus specific supervision by an experienced
research scientist, and staff for the coffee factory trials.
3.23     Project Seed Farm.  Financing would be provided to extend the
productive area of the seed farm (para 1.35) from 200 to 300 ha. This would
include the recruitement internationally (para 3.38) of a specialist manager
(3 years), replacement of vehicles, incremental investment in facilities,
equipment and operating costs - including the purchase of elite food crop
seeds (principally from IRA under annual contract).



- 22 -
3.24     Improved seed output would increase from 100 tons of maize and 50
tons of beans/groundnuts in 1983, to 250 tons of maize, 66 tons of groundnuts,
and 78 tons of beans per year. This represents a surplus of maize seed beyond
the project requirements (which would be sold) and a shortfall in beans and
groundnuts. The latter would be overcome by the seed farm contracting and
supervising multiplication by farmers in the vicinity. Production of seed
potatoes (50 tons in 1983) would continue on the 20 ha high altitude site,
multiplication being undertaken with assistance of farmers, to produce 700
tons annually by PY5. Expenses for seed drying arising from inclement condi-
tions are reflected in high production costs for seeds. The project would,
therefore, emphasize cost reduction and improved efficiency of farm opera-
tions. The selling prices for seeds (currently CFAF 100/kg for maize seed)
would be reviewed annually in line with crop values and the farm's role within
the national scheme for seed production. However, in order to avoid farmer
resistance and maintain equitability with other areas, seed prices would not
necessarily reflect the full cost of operating the farm. Any subsidization of
the seed farm's operations would be carefully assessed within the context of
the farm's annual work plan.
3.25     Production of Coffee Seedlings.  The UCCAO Production Services
Department (para 1.19) would assume responsibility for organizing and super-
vising the production and distribution of coffee seedlings. Personnel and one
vehicle would be financed to create a small unit to support the extension
service's zoned annual replanting program. Suitable nursery sites would be
selected by arabica cooperatives.  Financing 'would be provided to enable the
extension staff to train the cooperative personnel responsible for the opera-
tion and to produce sufficient selected Java seedlings to replant 2,000 ha
each year. Seedlings for a further 1,000 ha of arabica replanting would be
produced by distributing Java seed to selected farmers, who would be super-
vised by extension officers. Robusta plant propagation would be reorganized
on the IRA station at Barombikang, which would be responsible for selecting
superior varieties in the Province and producing cloned plants. A small truck
would be provided to enable the seedling unit to deliver young plants to
distribution points in each department.
3.26     Seedlings would continue to be sold to farmers for CFAF 5 each,
estimated to be only 10% of the cost of production. However, this practice
would be reviewed in the course of the project; with a view to raising prices
in stages as the farmers come to appreciate the benefits of replanting with
the better variety. In order to ensure that all target farmers are eligible,
the present regulations stipulating that farmers must replant a minimum of 1.0
ha to receive a replanting subsidy and concessional plants, would be changed
to 0.25 ha not later than November 30, 1984. Assurances concerning these ad-
justments were obtained from Government during negotiations (para 8.01(iii)).
The replanting cost for farmers would be approximately CFAF 1,750 (US$5) per
0.25 ha.
3.27     Village Water Supply.  On the basis of one water point per 1000 head
of population, the minimum requirements for the Western Province are estimated
to be 1,100 water points. There are now estimated to be 540, including 200
constructed under the first project. Other small development programs (e.g.
FONADER and Community Development Department) are expected to add a further



- 23 -
110 during the five-year implementation period of the project. To help meet
the remaining shortfall, financing would be provided for the construction of
about 450 water points (para. 4.19). Construction would follow the approach
successfully pioneered under the first project which included developing
wells, controlling springs with piping and reservoirs, and piped canalisation
from perennial streams to reservoirs. The program in the arabica and
robusta/cocoa zones would be approximately as follows:
Arabica Zone             PYl        PY2        PY3       PY4        PY5        TOTAL
Wells (equipped)         16(4)      16(6)      16(10)    17(10)    17(10)       82(40)
Controlled Springs       21         21         22        22         22         108
Canalisations            14         14         14        14         14          70
Total               51         51        52         53         53        260
Robusta Zone

Controlled Springs       17         17         16        19         18          87
Canalisations            12         12         12        11         11          58
Total               37        38         37         39         39        190
GRAND TOTAL              88         89         89        92         92         450
The infrastructure associated with each new water point would include:
reception area, taps, tanks and drains, and would be designed for the dual
purpose of domestic usage and coffee washing in the arabica zones.
3.28     Construction would be undertaken by the provincial rural works
service (Genie Rural) under a convention to be signed with UCCAO (para
4.19). Under the supervision of the Provincial Chief of Genie Rural, con-
struction would be organized by the village water section, headed by an
engineer. Financial provisions would include funds for the construction of
storage facilities in Bafoussam, vehicles, equipment, incremental personnel,
construction materials and other operating expenses for six departmental sub
sections (3 expanded under the first project, 3 requiring considerable
strengthening), each with two supervisors for planning/organization and
engineering. Construction would be executed by 12 teams in the departments
included in the first project (Mifi, Bamboutos and Menoua) which would be
strengthened, plus 10 more to be developed in the additional departments to be
included in the proposed project (Haut Nkam, Nde and Noun). The existing pipe
manufacturing unit at Bafoussam would continue to provide well construction
teams with two additional units created to serve the expanded project area.
Provisions would also be made for the expansion of the section's capacity for
planning and superivising maintenance of water points. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations (para 8.01(xii)) that: (i) annual investment
programs would include the number of water points to be developed as well as



- 24 -
detailed plans and work schedules; and (ii) before undertaking the works,
village management committees would be formed in recipient villages with the
nomination and training (by Genie Rural) of a representative responsible for
operation and maintenance and have undertaken to finance spare parts or
repairs deemed necessary by Genie Rural. As an innovation, 100 wells would be
equipped with hand/foot pumps to increase the extraction rate and improve
health and safety.
3.29     Primary Coffee Processing.  There are estimated to be 22,500 indi-
vidual coffee pulpers in the arabica zone, of which 15,000 are considered
operational. This represents an average of one apparatus per 6-7 producers.
Although average availability of pulpers varies between departments, the
bottlenecks and processing delays resulting f'rom this dearth represents a
major cause of deterioration in coffee quality.
3.30     This would be remedied by financing group purchase of 250 communal
pulpers to be set up at water points, with the supervision of installation and
maintenance assumed jointly by UCCAO's Technical and Production Departments.
The first project successfully piloted the installation of 10 such communal
coffee pulping machines, which have a processing capacity of 300 kg cherries
per hour.  In addition to a faster rate of work and a longer operation period,
the pulpers offer a relatively easy focus for extension supervision and can be
included in the community management/maintenance of the water point. On the
basis of only 150 kg cherries per hour, one installation would be sufficient
for 40 growers. Such installations could be made for a cost of CFAF 18,000
(US$46) per planter, compared with CFAF 67,000 (US$170) for individual pulpers
assembled locally, or CFAF 110,000 (US$280) for imported models.
3.31     A further action to improving coffee quality would be provision of
financing for construction of approximately 5,000 m of simple, wood/gauze
drying racks, either in association with communal pulpers or for individual
coffee growers. Both pulpers and drying racks would be sold for cash or
through medium term credit which would be subject to (i) the approval of the
senior extension officer and cooperative manager; (ii) the existence of a
suitable water source with modern infrastructure; (iii) an undertaking by the
UCCAO Technical Department in collaboration with G6nie Rural to install the
equipment; and (iv) an agreement with the borrowers regarding operation,
preventative maintenance and purchase of spare parts.
3.32     This action would be complemented by testing larger scale, village
coffee washing/drying "factories" to be designed and constructed by the UCCAO
Technical Department in collaboration with Genie Rural (para 5.06) and IRA
(para 3.21) on a pilot basis. For the time being UCCAO would continue to sell
individual pulpers, but it is hoped that the demand for them will decline as
the advantages of communal units are recognized by the farmers.
3.33     Coffee Factories.  In order to improve the average quality of coffee
sold by UCCAO, which has resulted from the fragmented development, dilapidated
machinery, poor productivity and inadequate maintenance and management of
factories, financing would be provided to UCCAO and its six member coopera-
tives for assistance. Where necessary, measures would be taken and invest-
ments would be made in individual cooperative factories to upgrade the



- 25 -
conveyance, pre-cleaning, hulling, polishing, grading and mechanical cleaning
and bagging of coffee and expansion of storage facilities. The basic invest-
ment requirements have already been identified, but financing to individual
cooperatives for such investments would be conditional on the following (para
8.03(ii)):
(i)  the submission of detailed plans and budgets satisfactory to the
Bank;
(ii) recruitment by the cooperative of competent staff, application of
maintenance schedules, and training of factory operators; and
(iii)  rectification of financial/accounting queries raised during the three
year audit to 1981 (para 1.24).
3.34     To alleviate the present bottleneck in the terminal processing of
arabica coffee, financing would be provided for the construction of a building
extension and supporting equipment for UCCAO's central processing factory at
Bafoussam. This would double the capacity for sorting and grading. It would
be an essential complement to the improved processing by farmers and coopera-
tives and would contribute directly to improving quality control of supplies
to the world market. In addition to expanding an existing UCCAO building, the
investment would include a full complement of machinery (5t/hour capacity) for
the receipt, handling, drying and final processing (including color sorting)
of green coffee from the robusta societies (or private traders). Essential
vehicles and start-up operating costs would also be provided.
3.35     Feeder Roads.  To assure the timely supply of inputs, improve contact
between extension agents and the farmers and facilitate marketing of cash
crops, a five-year program of construction and periodic maintenance of about
500 km of Category B roads would be financed through the project. Provisions
would be made for: (i) purchase and rental of equipment; (ii) purchase of
spare parts, fuel, lubricants and materials; and (iii) technical assistance to
support the provincial Feeder Road Unit (para 1.38) to implement the program.
3.36     The proposed improvement, rehabilitation and construction program
would consist of: (i) reshaping with and without widening the roadway; (ii)
regravelling selected sections; and (iii) building, repairing and reinforcing
drainage and storm water structures. The design standards would be based on
the minimum necessary for providing reasonable all-weather access for the type
of vehicles and traffic intensity anticipated (less than 15 vehicles daily)
over a ten-year period.
3.37     The proposed program is designed to connect with the category A
feeder roads designated for construction by the Feeder Roads Project (para
1.38). Specific roads have been selected from an initial list of 1,250 km,
identified by UCCAO, the Cooperative Directorates and the local authorities,
as being achievable by a single construction/maintenance brigade within the
project period. Projections are based on the assumption that the ongoing
Feeder Roads Project would be successfully reorganized and that additional
Government funds would be provided to complete the 900 km originally planned.
Disbursement of loan proceeds for this component would be conditional upon the



- 26 -
international recruitment of a roads engineer and a mechanic (para 3.38) and,
in addition, would be made in annual tranches conditional upon: (i) operation
of the provincial feeder roads unit to the satisfaction of the Bank; (ii) com-
pletion of the Category A feeder roads related to the Category B feeder roads;
and (iii) presentation of annual work programs with detailed plans and budgets
(para 8.03(i)).
3.38     Technical Assistance Personnel.  The preceding activities would be
assisted through financing for the recruitment, internationally, of the
following personnel:
(i) for the four positions continuing from the first project, a director
for production services (UCCAO), a seed farm manager, a garage
manager, and a head of the central evaluation unit (MINAGRI, DEP);
(ii)  for five new positions at UCCAO, a financial controller (advisor), a
director of technical services, a credit specialist, and a roads
engineer and a mechanic (the last two being seconded to the
Provincial Feeder Road Unit).
About 36 man years of service would be employed in these 9 positions which
would be awarded on the basis of two year renewable contracts. In addition,
about 100 man months of specific consultancy assignments are envisaged for:
coffee marketing (para 4.22), erosion control/afforestation (para 3.17),
cooperative training (para 3.11), accounting and systems analysis for project
evaluation. Provision should also be made for approximately 18 man months of
studies and reviews in support of the project, in areas such as transporta-
tion, food crop marketing, and national production of food crop seeds.
3.39     Monitoring and Evaluation.  As explained in para 4.21, the project
would support monitoring and evaluation activities at three levels: for
expanding and improving the project unit (PMU, para 1.34) and the coordinating
evaluation activities of the central unit (CEU, para 4.21) in the DEP, and for
creating a provincial evaluation unit (PEU) as an antenna to the CEU. The PMU
would be headed by a Cameroonian agricultural economist, with the assistance
of a data analyst, both of whom were trained under the first project.
Additional posts, to be created for the PMU under the project, would include a
statistical controller, an administrator, a secretary, 2 senior enumerators
and 15 junior enumerators. As with the first project, the CEU, in Yaounde,
would be headed by an internationally recruited M and E specialist with
relevant post-graduate specialization and experience. Additional personnel to
be recruited under the project for the CEU would include a specialist
statistician, hired on a consultancy basis; a computer analyst; two training
officers, a senior evaluation officer and a senior statistical officer. The
PEU, to be located in Bafoussam, would be staffed by a Cameroonian
agricultural economist or agriculturalist who would be assisted by a junior
agronomist.

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General Project Organization
4.01     As in the first project, UCCAO would be the project executing agency
and the UCCAO General Manager would be the Project Manager. Although UCCAO is
an independently managed entity with a separate governing board (para 1.19),
the Cooperative Act gives supervisory responsibility to the Minister of
Agriculture, who has ultimate power to intervene in the operation of either
UCCAO or its member cooperatives, thus assuring UCCAO's compliance with
project agreements. Vesting project execution powers in existing regional
agencies is consistent with Government's policy, enunciated in the Fifth Five-
Year Development Plan, of delegating and decentralizing responsibility for
integrated rural development activities to appropriate regional agencies.
Consistent with this policy, UCCAO's charter has been changed since the
beginning of the first project to permit it to provide services covering all
major aspects of agricultural development in the Western Province, not just
support for coffee production.
4.02     Project Coordinating Committee (PCC).  The PCC, created under the
first project in 1981, would continue under the chairmanship of the Governor
of Western Province. Members would include the provincial representatives of
all ministries with functions relevant to rural development, including the
provincial delegate for MINAGRI, plus the directors of the member cooperatives
and the six departmental prefects. The responsibilities of the Project
Coordinating Committee would continue to be as follows: (i) to advise on long
term development priorities; (ii) to approve the project's annual work program
and budget; (iii) to decide on priority locations for project-financed bottom-
lands and village water points, based on technical/economic proposals from
project management; and (iv) to supervise the organization and maintenance of
community level developments provided under the project, including the repay-
ment by the communities of associated costs (para 4.19).
4.03     Relationship between Project and Provincial MINAGRI Delegation.  The
realignment of functions between MINAGRI's provincial delegation and UCCAO as
project executing agency, which began under the first project for three of the
six provincial departments, has been recently reconfirmed as Government
policy, through a formal ministerial declaration (note de service). These
arrangements would continue under the project and be extended to cover the
entire province. Under the project, UCCAO would continue to be responsible
for technical quality and daily management of extension services (para 4.08).
This would assure a direct line of technical and administrative control of
field services under one management authority, supported by the project. On
the other hand, this arrangement would not diminish the essential role of
MINAGRI's Provincial Delegate as the Ministry's official representative in
Western Province. He would retain responsibility for the supervision of
agricultural production in light of Government's policy, the coordination of
the overall activities of the MINAGRI's services (Rural Works, Water and
Forestry, Monitoring and Evaluation, etc.), as well as the management of
direct assistance to specific agricultural development projects not covered by
the project. As a condition of loan effectiveness, the Ministry of Agricul-



- 28 -
ture would confirm UCCAO's technical and organizational responsibility for
extension services in the project area (para 8.02(iv)). At negotiations
assurances were obtained that, as under the first project, agricultural
extension personnel in the new project areas and personnel of the bottomlands
development unit would be transferred to UCCAO from the provincial services of
MINAGRI (para 8.01 (xiii)).
B. Organization and Management
4.04     UCCAO is managed by a competent Cameroonian Director General with
overall, responsibility for four headquarters departments (para 1.18). The
projects actions would continue to be concentrated mainly in the Production
Department (Organigram - Annex 4). Inexperience on the part of staff,
particularly in serving the needs of member cooperatives, had led to over-
centralized management by the Director General and insufficient delegation of
responsibilities. This resulted in low efficiency and inadequate supervision
of the financial and technical management of the cooperatives. A number of
actions have already been taken to improve this situation and, furthermore,
specific provisions and organizational changes (paras 3.14-3.16 and 4.13)
would be undertaken through the project. In addition, field services in the
departments covered by the first project have been improved during that
project and emphasis would be placed on extending these improvements to the
rest of the Province (para 3.12).
4.05     To permit UCCAO to better deal with critical project areas, and with
a view to further building a trained and experienced Cameroonian staff within
a technically and administratively strong organization, particular emphasis
would be placed on recruitment and training of national staff and upgrading
efficiency in all departments. This would be realized through granting all
financial and other incentives on a uniform basis for staff employed at simi-
lar levels (on which UCCAO's assurance was obtained at negotiations - para
8.01(iv)), a training fellowship program, provision of technical assistance
personnel and expansion of in-service training. The fellowship program to be
prepared by UCCAO would upgrade the skills of approximately ten Cameroonian
supervisory staff through medium term (1-2 years) and short term (1 to 3
months) courses, within or outside Cameroon.
4.06     Nine technical assistance staff and several short term consultants
(para 3.38) would be recruited following Bank guidelines and in accordance
with terms of reference (working papers) acceptable to the Bank. In view of
the importance of these appointments, the signing of satisfactory contracts
for, the directors of production services, technical services and for the
financial controller, would be a condition of lcan effectiveness (para 8.02
(iii)). For most positions, the need for specialist services is expected to
cease between PYs 3 and 4 and, as happened in the first project, one year
prior to his departure, each specialist would be expected to assume more of an
advisory role. UCCAO's assurance was obtained t;hat the heads of its extension
services and of its accounting service would at all times be filled by quali-
fied and experienced persons (para 8.01(iv)).



- 29 -
4.07     The project would be implemented following annual work programs and
budgets for each service, with sufficient detail to show relevant expectations
at the subsector level. Government and UCCAO's assurances were obtained at
negotiations that annual work programs and budgets would be submitted to the
Bank by September 30 each year and would require the Bank's approval in the
case of feeder roads. UCCAO's different services would assume increased
operational responsibility, to execute agreed annual work programs within the
budgets. The Project Manager would continue to monitor progress through
weekly progress reports from the major service chiefs, supported by improved
data from the Project Monitoring Unit (para 4.21) and from UCCAO's Finance and
Administration Department. These data would be reviewed and discussed in two-
weekly project management meetings of the heads of sections, and summary
quarterly progress reports would be produced and forwarded to the cofinanciers
within four weeks of the end of each quarter year (para 8.01(xi)).
C. The Extension Service
4.08     The Extension Service would continue to operate as under the first
project. Its chief, whose qualifications and experience would be acceptable
to the Bank (para 4.06), would be responsible for the organization and control
of extension operations, under the overall direction of the Director of
Production Services. To improve management efficiency, given the enlarged
project area, two deputy chiefs would be employed. Extension work would
emphasize "whole" farm development in each ecological zone, and would promote
coffee and a "package" of inputs and technology focussing mainly on a
combination of three major food crops: maize, beans, and groundnuts. Produc-
tion targets and packages would be reviewed with the MINAGRI Departmental
Delegate annually, prior to the start of the growing campaign, before
submission of the comprehensive budget to the PCC.
4.09     Six departmental extension service sector chiefs would be responsible
for operations within their assigned departments. Programs would be executed
through the 4-5 sub-sector chiefs assigned to each department, who would each
direct the activities of about 3 CPAs. Extension agents would be assigned to
specific areas/villages under the supervision of a CPA (1 per 5 MAs). The
Project Manager would be responsible for hiring and firing project staff. In
the recruitment of additional staff for the extension service (para 3.12), the
system of written and oral testing, successfully adopted under the first pro-
ject, would be continued. The availability of suitable agricultural graduates
and diploma-holders is sufficient for the needs of the project. However,
whenever possible, preference would be given to the recruitment of MINAGRI
extension staff already assigned to the Province. MINAGRI extension staff
below CPAP level, who are currently employed in the departments to be brought
into the second project but who are considered unsuitable for employment,
would be transferred to other duties. Thus, the unified extension service
effectively established under the first project would continue (para 4.03).
4.10     The T and V organization of the extension service, based on a 15 day
work program cycle would be employed. Fortnightly meetings would be held for
the extension staff in each district in order to (i) review the achievements
of the preceeding two weeks; (ii) set the program for the following two weeks;
(iii) provide training for forthcoming activities; and (iv) distribute train-



- 30 -
ing materials. This program would be translated into daily work schedules by
individual extension officers (MA) with their CPA, and would include details
of inputs or materials required.  Each MA would complete a record of daily
work achievement which would subsequently provide the basis for weekly
meetings with their CPA or sub-sector chief. A similar procedure would apply
for all levels of extension staff in reporting to their supervisors, the
sector chiefs reporting directly to the extension service chief and through
him, to the Director of Production Services. Officials from the departmental
cooperative would be invited to assist in one monthly meeting at the
appropriate level (PA or sub-sector chiefs).
4.11     Reaching the target of 85,000 farmers under the project would result
in a farmer to extension agent ratio varying from 200:1 to 350:1 depending on
the period of project development in each department. Collaboration between
the extension service, cooperatives and farmers would be further enhanced by
the nomination of farmer leaders by the groups of about 40 farmers. The exten-
sion service began organizing such groups in 1982 and about 100 of them are
expected to be operational before the initiation of the proposed project.
Their number would increase to approximately 2,200 by PY5, an average of 6 per
extension agent. The leaders would assist in training, organizing demonstra-
tions, promoting special actions, like improving coffee processing and
cultivation techniques for food crops, and organizing group loans for farmers
in their groups. The existence of 2,200 farmer leaders at the end of the
project impelementation period would make it possible to extend the number of
farmers assisted per extension agent to an overall average of 500:1.
4.12     Extension operations would be reinforced by the appointment of about
24 input supply officers (intendants; para 3.12) who would be responsible for
assuring that adequate supplies of fertilizer and seed and plant protection
services were available for delivery in conjunction with extension advice.
These officers would be experienced agricultural graduates with proven organi-
zational ability, whose work would also help to accelerate the reorganization
of cooperative service centers (CSC).  It is envisaged that the intendants
would enable the cooperatives to improve their efficiency in managing input
supply, and that the need for these posts would terminate at project
completion.
D. Developments in Cooperative Organization
4-13     The organization and management of UCCAO would be strengthened so as
to provide more regular support to the management of its member cooperatives,
and better supervision in its services to cooperatives. Following the
auditors' recommendations (para 1.23) UCCAO has made significant progress in
improving operations and the performance of managerial and supervisory staff
of its own departments (para 3.15). Similar pre-project actions have been
initiated in the cooperatives and would be accelerated during the project.
The need for training in all aspects of cooperative operations is urgent for
cooperatives' staff (including UCCAO's) and committee members. UCCAO's
training service would be responsible for arranging training schedules (out-
lined in project file), and implementing courses. An ILO-assisted National
Cooperative Education Project, executed by COOPMJT, has been training coopera-
tive members and staff in other provinces since 1973. This project has now



- 31 -
been extended and will include assistance to the Western Province for planning
of curricula which would support UCCAO's training programs for cooperative
members.
4.14     In addition to the emphasis on training, improvement in cooperative
management and operations would be advanced through the reclassification and
appointment of key personnel (para 3.15). A high priority for the credit sec-
tion would be the implementation of uniform credit procedures in all coopera-
tives, including the introduction of individual records and the application of
individual interest charges. Actions have already commenced to revise job
specifications for key cooperative staff and to analyze the adequacy of exist-
ing personnel for these jobs, leading to subsequent recruitment/replacement as
required. This particularly applies to key posts in cooperative service
centers, including those personnel dealing with finance and accounting, stock
control, credit control and internal audit. Accounting and stock control
procedures will be revised to make a uniform system, amenable to more thorough
monitoring. Finally, UCCA0 will produce new operational manuals as part of
the action plan for implementing the auditor's recommendations (para 1.24).
Assurances regarding the preparation of these manuals and the implementation
of the above reforms were obtained during negotiations (para 8.01(ix)).
Furthermore, in order to assure the efficient use of improved facilities,
disbursements against eligible costs of construction and rehabilitation of
coffee factories would be conditional on individual cooperatives implementing
the prescribed reforms, and producing investment plans satisfactory to the
Bank. This would also apply to disbursement for eligible costs of UCCAO's
construction and rehabilitation program (para 8.03 (ii)).
E. Credit to Farmers
4.15     The provision of seasonal and medium term credit for farmers to be
financed under the project would be made using the Revolving Credit Fund (RCF)
established and managed satisfactorily under the first project (para 1.28).
Resources of the fund would be augmented over the project period to a level
sufficient to allow the participating farmers to draw up to US$130 of seasonal
credit per year (para 3.16). Medium term credit would be provided for periods
of 2-5 years for financing sprayers, pulpers, farm implements, grain storage
and drying facilities. Government confirmed at negotiations that all farmers
and member cooperatives receiving credit from UCCA0 would pay a 11.25 percent
rate of interest for the PY1 season (para 8.01 (vii)). The interest rate of
11.25% would be in the range of commercial rates in Cameroon (10-18%) and is
considered acceptable. It would represent a substantial increase, of 2.25
percentage points, over the rate applied under the first project. However,
while this interest rate is in line with recent inflation in Cameroon, it
might not be positive in real terms over the project implementation period, as
inflation could go higher under the impact of increased oil revenues.
Furthermore, the 1.25% margin available to UCCAO and its member cooperatives,
may prove insufficient to cover administrative costs. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that, each year the final on-lending rate would be
reviewed and, after consultation with the Bank, be revised if appropriate
(para. 8.01(vii)). Understandings were reached as to which criteria would be
taken into account, i.e. the inflation rate, the other interest rates
prevailing under the rules of the Central Bank, and the financial equilibrium
of UCCAO and the cooperatives.



- 32 -
4.16     The expanded credit program would fol:Low standardized lending proce-
dures and practices to be applied in all six cooperatives.  UCCA0 would ensure
that the credit section of its Finance and Administration Department would be
reorganized with a qualified manager and 10 supervisors. With the help of an
internationally recruited credit specialist, U(CCA0 would develop and instruct
the credit sections to be developed in each cooperative in the use of a new
credit administration manual. Each cooperative would be responsible for its
own credit operations under the supervision of the Revolving Credit Fund (RCF)
management committee, and UCCAO's Board of Management (para 1.19) would decide
the interest rates to be levied each year. The credit office established at
each cooperative headquarters would recruit adequate credit staff at CSC
level, all of whom would be trained in the standardized credit system.
4.17     Bank loan proceeds for credit under the project would be passed on by
Government to UCCA0 at 10 percent interest rate per annum by UCCA0 to coopera-
tives at 10.5% and would be onlent to farmers at a final rate of 11.25% in
PY1. At negotiations, assurances were obtained from UCCAO that each coopera-
tive would be responsible for losses on account of non-recovery of credit from
its members, as they have been to-date (para 1.28). Funds for loans to coop-
eratives for investment in coffee processing operations (para 3.33) would be
on-lent by UCCAO at an annual interest charge of 11.25% in PYI. Funds repaid
by UCCAO to Government from the investment loans would be channeled into a
general cooperative fund (para 5.04(ii)).
4.18     Project Workshop and Building Construction.  Project vehicles and
equipment, except road construction machinery which would be maintained by the
Feeder Roads Unit (para 4.20), would continue to be maintained by the UCCAO
workshop.  For building construction to be financed under the project, UCCAO
would develop a civil engineering section within the technical services
department. This section would collaborate with the building unit of the
provincial rural works department (Genie Rural) for preparing contract
documents and supervising construction of offices, storage facilities and
CSCs.
F. Bottomlands Drainage and Village Water Point Construction
4.19     UCCAO has been formally designated by the Governor of Western
Province as the authority to be fully responsible for: (i) the allocation of
drained bottomlands to farmers; and (ii) the design, location and implementa-
tion of village water points for the project. Bottomlands drainage would be
done by the project Bottomlands Development Unit (para. 3.18), while project
actions for water point development would be carried out by the Provincial
Rural Works Department (Genie Rural) (para 3.28) under an executing agreement
to be made with UCCAO (para 5.06). Planning for these developments would be
in close collaboration with village development committees and execution would
depend on mandatory agreements between UCCAO and the communities concerned
(paras 3.18 and 3.28). These agreements would be scrutinized during project
supervision.



- 33 -
G. Feeder Road Construction
4.20     As a result of agreements between the Bank and the Government, the
Feeder Roads Project (para 1.38) has been reorganized and an autonomous Feeder
Roads Unit has been established in the Western Province under the control of
the Provincial Delegate of the Ministry of Equipment.  It consists of three
brigades and is equipped and financed by the Feeder Roads Project with the
objective of completing the scheduled construction program of category A
feeder roads (para 3.37) and their subsequent periodic maintenance. Assis-
tance under the project would therefore be restricted to the construction and
periodic maintenance of Category B roads (para 3.35). A fourth brigade would
be created within the Unit to execute this work. An agreement between UCCAO
and the Feeder Roads Unit would be signed by September 30, 1984 governing the
construction of the Category B roads which would link Category A roads once
these had been built (para 5.06).
H. Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) and Studies
4.21     In order to improve the quality and timeliness of information on the
project's physical progress, the existing Project Monitoring Unit (PMU), would
be more effectively linked to the Central Evaluation Unit (CEU) in the DEP of
the Ministry of Agriculture (para 3.39). As an antenna to the CEU, a Provin-
cial Evaluation Unit (PEU) would be created and attached to the MINAGRI
Provincial Delegate in the Western Province to assess the overall agricultural
progress in Western Province and monitor the quality of the work undertaken by
the PMU. The PMU would organize and conduct field surveys and ad hoc studies,
undertake initial analysis of data and provide project management and the CEU
with a synthesis of results. A price information and marketing research unit
would be attached to the PMU to work in collaboration with the MINAGRI Provin-
cial Delegate to collect, analyze and disseminate information on food crop
markets, prices and distribution channels. The CEU would provide methodologi-
cal assistance, analytical support and data processing capabilities to the PMU
and distil and synthesize the experience from various other rural development
projects to guide national policy making and planning.
4.22     UCCAO Coffee Marketing Study.  A consultant coffee marketing
specialist (para 3.38) would be recruited by DEP in PY1.  His initial
assignment would be to finalize an action plan for UCCAO permitting it to
improve the strategy and standard of its coffee marketing. Following the
annual coffee marketing campaign in each succeding year during project
implementation, the consultant would return to review the achievements and
revise the action plan with UCCAO.
V. COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
5.01     Project costs (Table 1, page 35) are estimated at CFAF 21.8 billion
(US$55.7 million) with a foreign exchange component at CFAF 13.3 billion
(US$34.0 million) or 61% of project costs. Total costs include an estimated
CFAF 2.7 billion (US$7.1 million) of taxes and identifiable duties, primarily



- 34 -
on vehicles, equipment, local salaries and construction materials. Total
contingencies amount to CFAF 5.4 billion (US$13.8 million), 25% of total or
33% of baseline costs.
5.02     Baseline costs (CFAF 16.4 billion; US$41.9 million) are expressed in
December 1983 prices. Project costs include all incremental investment and
operating costs, technical assistance costs directly associated with the
project and the cost of replacement vehicles. Physical contingencies of 8%
have been applied to all capital and operating costs, except personnel
expenditures. Price contingencies have been applied throughout the project
period as follows: (i) for all local costs, 12% p.a.; (ii) for internationally
recruited personnel 10% p.a.; (iii) for fertil-izers and pesticides (all
imported), 9% p.a.; and (iv) for all other foreign expenditures, 7.5% (1984),
7% (1985) and 6% thereafter.  These price escalation factors follow forecasts
of international inflation for foreign supplied goods and services and
estimated annual inflation in Cameroon for local costs.
B. Proposed Financing
5.03     External financing would cover the estimated foreign exchange costs,
CFAF 13.3 billion (US$34.0 million), plus CFAF 784 million (US$2.0 million -
IFAD only) to finance about 10% of the incremental cost of local personnel,
plus the front-end fee. The IBRD loan of US$21.5 million would cover 44% of
total net project costs (63% of total foreign exchange) as well as the front-
end fee of US$53,616, representing 0.25% of the Bank loan. The IFAD loan of
US$14.5 would be applied to cover 30% of total net project costs, including
37% of total foreign exchange requirements and US$2.0 million of incremental
local operating expenditures. Of the remaining project costs, Government
would finance CFAF 5.7 billion (US$14.6 million: 26% of total costs or 19% of
total costs net of taxes); UCCAO, CFAF 1.8 billion (US$4.6 million; 8% of
total costs or 6% of costs net of taxes); and farmers, CFAF 196 million
(US$0.5 million, 1% of project costs and of costs net of taxes). The proposed
financing plan is shown in Table 2. External financing would be on a joint
basis with the exception of investments for coffee treatment and processing;
and of incremental local personnel and associated costs for the extension
service, which would be financed on a parallel basis by the Bank and !FAD,
respectively. The proposed Bank loan of US$21.5 million would be made to
Government for a 20-year period including a five-year grace period, with a
variable interest rate. IFAD's loan would be made to Government for a 20-year
period, including a five-year grace period, witn a rate of interest of 4.0%.
5.04     The funds made available by the external lenders, Government and
UCCAO would be deployed as follows:
(i) CFAF 12.6 billion (US$32.1 million - Bank US$8.2 million) would be
passed on to UCCAO as a grant to cover project investment and
operating costs associated with training, extension, project admin-
istration, and project monitoring and evaluation activities and to
reimburse specialist agencies executing specific project functions;
(ii)  CFAF 6.2 billion (US$15.7 million - Bank US$12.9 million) would be
on-lent to UCCAO on terms satisfactory to the Bank, of which, (a)
US$7.1 million (all Bank) would be utilized by UCCAO or on-lent to



- 35 -
its member cooperatives for the construction and rehabilitation of
coffee processing factories (para 5.06); (b) US$3.6 million (Bank
US$3.3 million) would be on-lent to UCCAO for subsequent on lending
to farmers for small equipment and (c) US$5.0 million (Bank US$2.5
million) would be on-lent to UCCAO for subsequent on-lending to
farmers for incremental seasonal inputs (para 4.15). Government
assurance has been obtained that one of the conditions of its on-
lending to UCCAO would be that repayment of principal and interest on
loans for construction and rehabilitation of coffee factories be
channeled into special fund, to be designated by Government, for
financing capital improvements for cooperatives at the national level
(para 8.01 (vi));
(iii)  CFAF 294 million (US$750,000 - Bank US$350,000) would be used by
MINAGRI (DEP) for expenditures incurred in evaluation at the
provincial and national levels, and to finance a study of coffee
marketing (para 4.22).
5.05     The project account established as a vehicle for financing UCCAO's
activities under the first project would continue to be used under the
project. As a condition of loan effectiveness of the proposed project,
Government would raise the current level of working capital in that account to
CFAF 400 million (para 8.02(ii)). This is equivalent to about 3 months
operating costs, including salaries of extension workers. Government has
given assurance that the project account would subsequently be maintained at
the level of CFAF 400 million by making quarterly transfers, representing its
contribution to project financing, following normal Government cash management
procedures in addition to amounts withdrawn from the cofinanciers loans (para
8.01(ii)). UCCAO would buy fertilizer and agricultural chemicals sufficient
to meet project objectives (details Working Paper 2) using the Revolving
Credit Fund established under the first project. Government has assured that
by August 31, of each year it would deposit in FONADER an amount equal to the
estimated value of subsidies payable on all inputs for that year and FONADER
would pay the suppliers the corresponding amount of their invoices (para 8.01
(ii)).  As under the first project, UCCAO would borrow short term funds from a
commercial bank sufficient to pre-finance farmers' share of recurrent input
costs. UCCAO's accounting system is judged to be adequate to manage funds
originating from these various sources (para 1.24).
5.06     Subsidiary Loan Agreement and Executing Arrangements.  Specific
financing arrangements would be made governing the use of certain project
funds as follows:
(i) as a condition of loan effectiveness (para 802(i)), a subsidiary
loan agreement, acceptable to the Bank, would be signed between
Government and UCCAO for: a) onlending funds to finance seasonal and
investment credit (para 5.04 (ii)); and b) onlending funds for
construction and rehabilitation of coffee factories. Completion of
individual investment plans by UCCAO and the cooperatives, acceptable
to the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement of funds for these
investments (para 8.03 (ii)). Individual cooperatives would need a
period of one to two years to implement administrative and managerial
reforms before they could efficiently use the new investments.

Achieving acceptable progress in this area would also be a condition
for disbursement for individual factory improvements (para 8.03
(ii));
(ii)  UCCAO would sign an agreement, acceptable to the Bank, with the
Provincial Rural Works Department (Genie Rural) for execution and
supervision of civil works for village water supply (para 3.28).
This would contain provisions for financing as a grant and for annual
work planning. At negotiations Government gave assurance that such
an agreement would be signed by September 30, 1984 (para 8.01
(viii)). Agreement would also be reached between UCCAO and Genie
Rural concerning collaboration on civil works tasks for coffee
processing and office constructions to be made under the project
(paras 3.32 and 4.18);
(iii)  Agricultural Research Institute would manage an applied research
program (para 3.22), under an agreement with UCCAO acceptable to the
Bank; together with the following services: soil analysis; supply of
parent food crop and planting material for arabica and robusta
coffee; and quality control of products and project seed farm (para
3.23). The agreement would provide for financing as a grant.
Government has assured that such an agreement would be signed by
September 30, 1984 (para 8.01(viii));
(iv)  UCCAO would enter into an agreement satisfactory to the Bank with the
new Provincial Feeder Roads Unit (para 4.20) for the construction and
periodic maintenance of feeder roads (para 8.01 (viii). The
agreement would be signed by September 30, 1984 and would provide for
the financing, with a grant, of Category B road construction, to be
executed according to annual work plans which would account for
progress being made in the completion of Category A roads. Disburse-
ment of funds under this agreement would be orn an annual basis,
subject inter alia to approval by the Bank of the annual work plans
(para 8.013(7ir.
C. Procurement
5.07     All goods, works and services under the project would be procured
following Bank Guidelines. These procedures have been applied satisfactorily
during the first project. Contracts of US$100,000 or more, mainly for
imported equipment, vehicles, and chemicals, totalling about US$22.5 million
(Bank, US$10.8) would be awarded through international competitive bidding
(TCB). Goods manufactured in Cameroon would be allowed a preference of 15% of
the cif price on imported goods, or the level of applicable duties, whichever
is lower. Contracts between US$100,000 and US$20,000, for civil works and
small equipment and amounting to a total of about US$10.1 million (Bank:
US$4.3 million), would be procured following local competitive bidding (LCB)
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. For contracts under US$20,000,
mainly for small equipment, direct local procurement, on the basis of at least
three quotations, would be allowed up to a total not exceeding US$2.1 million
(Bank US$ 0.5 million). Civil works for feeder roads, water points and
bottomlands development US$3.0 million (Bank: US$0.5 million) are unlikely to



- 38 -
attract foreign bidders because of their low unit cost, geographic dispersion
and phasing over time. They would be procured following LCB or, if this was
impracticable, would be undertaken on force account. A total of about 45 man
years of internationally recruited technical assistance staff and consultancy
personnel would be required during the project (para 4.06), at an average cost
(all inclusive except housing) of US$110,000/man-year (total US$5.2 million;
Bank US$2.5 million). The remaining expenditures (US$11.1 million; Bank
US$2.9 million) represent personnel and operating costs. These would be made
following normal procedures of Government and UCCAO, which were acceptable
under the first project.
5.08     Contract Review.  All contracts for goods or packages of goods with
an estimated value in excess of US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to
prior Bank review, resulting in a coverage of about 75% of goods contracts.
D. Disbursement Procedures
5.09     The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of six
years. An estimated disbursement profile for the proposed loan is given in
(Annex 5). This is based on analysis of past disbursement experience for Bank
financed rural development projects in West Africa, and adjusted to reflect
the operational momentum and the current level of disbursement under the first
project. The Bank and IFAD loans would be disbursed jointly on a pari passu
basis; except for the coffee-related components, to be financed by the Bank,
and extension staff salaries, to be financed by IFAD, which would be disbursed

fellowships and studies would be supported by full documentation. Disburse-
ments against local operating costs and local personnel financed by IFAD, and
machinery operating costs and maintenance financed by the Bank and IFAD would
be against certificates of expenditure, with supporting evidence, showing
costs incurred by category. These would be retained for inspection during
project supervision. The financial unit established under the first project
within UCCAO's financial department has gained adequate experience in
preparing disbursement requests by component and expenditure category.

E. Financial Management, Reporting and Audit
5.11     The project would continue to support the upgrading of UCCAO's
financial management with the objective of creating a strong department
capable of (a) continuing the expeditious handling and recording of UCCAO's
financial transactions, and (b) executing new responsibilities for supervising
and supporting the financial managment of member cooperatives. A financial
controller would be appointed under the project (para 3.15) to advise the
Director of Administration and Finance the new accounting and financial
control systems throughout UCCAO, and the Project Director on management
controls. Financing would be provided for renting computer facilities once
the anomalies in accounting, stock-keeping and credit control are resolved.
Following the recommendations of the management study undertaken under the
first project (para 1.24) an accounting system common to all cooperation would
be introduced, involving more advanced book-keeping, cost accounting and stock
control for each cooperative and UCCAO. Appropriately qualified Cameroonian
staff would be hired and trained, including fellowships as necessary, for
eventual take-over of these activities. The accounting, procurement and
disbursement operations maintained under the first project, would be further
improved to produce detailed records and financial analysis of all of UCCAO's
operations by project activity, type of expenditure and administrative
department.
5.12     As was the case under the first project, UCCAO, as the project
executing agency, would continue to furnish quarterly progress reports to
Guovernment and the co-financiers containing relevant data on technical
achievement and financial situation of the project. As this was complied with
satisfactorily during the first project, no additional assurances are required
in this respect. As under the first project, provision has been made for
annual audits of UCCAO and cooperatives accounts by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and for the preparation of a project completion
report.
VI. PRODUCTION ESTIMATES, PRICES AND MARKETING
ARRANGEMENTS AND FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
A. Participation Rates and Production
6.01     Projections of the rate of farmer participation in the project,
yields and production increases have been made for each ecological zone of the
Province. The estimates have accounted for the unique agronomic charac-
teristics of each zone, variations in expected farmer reaction to incentives,
and demographic characteristics; they also reflect performance under the first
project. Details of production areas and the impact of different project
actions on the major crops are shown in Annex 6.1. A summary of the situation
at full development (PY6) based on the weighted differences in crop yields and
areas between the various ecological zones is tabulated below:

B. Crop Marketing and Price Outlook
6.02     Coffee Market.  Present projections indicate strong and relatively
inelastic supply conditions for coffee, with considerable stock-piling by
exporters, for the rest of the decade. Demand over the same period is expect-
ed to grow by only about 1.3 percent per year. As global demand is also
inelastic, coffee prices are likely to fall in real terms and, as a whole,
major coffee exporters are likely to have reduced earnings from coffee as
exports grow. The ICO agreement aims to avert this possibility by stabilizing
world coffee prices through the application of export quotas for member
producing countries (para 1.11). Recognizing this objective, Bank policy
restricts lending for coffee production to cases where incremental production
would be justified by (i) expanding domestic consumption; (ii) changes in
established ICO quotas; and (iii) growth in anticipated exports to non-ICO
countries.
6.03     Following these criteria, the increment in total annual coffee
production in Cameroon could extend from 1,310 tons in 1983 to 1,550 tons in
1992, for a cumulative total of 14,320 tons and be within ICO guidelines
(Working Paper 5). The increase in output from the principal coffee growing
areas of Cameroon are expected to reach a total of 9,900 tons on the period
1983-92, well within Cameroon's ICO quota limit. Of this, 7,830 tons (79%)
would come from the proposed project area which would be equivalent to 55% of
the allowable production increase. The project's increased output would



- 42 -
result from the maturation of young trees, ra-ther than from an expansion of
coffee production areas.
6.04     Coffee originating from the Western Province continually receives a
price discount in export markets due to its poor quality and as a result of
problems arising from the poor management of official exporting. Attributed
both to poor treatment and handling on farms, inefficient factory operation,
and long delays during subsequent handling and storage, quality losses
currently result in forfeited revenue of about; 9% for arabica and 7% for
robusta. Further revenue is lost due to poor export administration by UCCAO,
including late presentation of documents, shipment delays and discrepancies in
quality from stated standards. Cessation of such forfeitures would produce
immediate and positive financial benefits for UCCAO and farmers. A study,
financed under the first project, has analysed current operations at each
stage in the coffee marketing chain from Western Province up to delivery to
the importer, and has made recommendations for improvement in UCCAO marketing
procedures. At negotiations Government gave assurances that UCCAO would
submit for the Bank's approval, by September 30, 1984, a plan for the adoption
of these proposals, and would implement these within 12 months of approval
(para 8.01 (x)). This plan would include a formal review of progress, to be
undertaken by the Studies and Projects Department (DEP) of the Ministry of
Agriculture, in each project year.
6.05     Coffee price forecasts in constant 1982 terms predict a decline in
the indicative cif price of coffee of from about CFAF 1,020/kg in 1984, to
CFAF 983/kg in 1985 and rising to CFAF 1,173/kg in 1995. Accounting for
shipping, insurance and handling, fob prices for arabica coffee are expected
to decline from CFAF 918/kg in 1984, to CFAF 904/kg in 1985, rising to 953/kg
in 1990 and CFAF 1,126/kg in 1995. Forecasts for robusta coffee prices follow
a similar trend, declining from CFAF 808/kg in 1984 to CFAF 796/kg in 1985,
and rising to CFAF 991/kg in 1995. These prices have also accounted for a
gradual reduction in price discounts from 9% to 4% for arabica and 7% to 2%
for robusta coffee between 1984 and 1995, resulting from project actions to
improve quality (para 3.29), as well as the elimination of the present
discount for late deliveries from 1985 onwards (para 6.04).
6.06     Coffee Export Marketing and Prices.  Producer prices for coffee and
cocoa are set annually by Government with the objective of guaranteeing a
satisfactory return for producers and protecting them from fluctuations in
world market prices. During the last decade, producer prices have represented
between 30 and 65% of the FOB price. Terminal processing and export marketing
of arabica coffee in the Western Province is undertaken by UCCAO and COOPAGRO,
an association of large producers. Robusta coffee is processed by coopera-
tives and private operators and marketed by private exporters. Export
marketing of robusta coffee is regulated by Government through the ONCPB which
fixes producer prices, assigns quotas to exporters and determines the amounts
to be paid to cooperatives and other processors to cover their costs. All of
these standard costs are announced in an annual bareme which regulates the
returns to all participants in the coffee production chain. The surplus after
deducting the producer price, processing costs and a uniform export tax are
retained by the ONCPB, as a stabilization fund. In contrast, the export
marketing of arabica coffee is not regulated b;y the ONCPB, except that



- 43 -
Government levies a predetermined tax on exports. The surplus accruing from
arabica coffee export sales is retained by exporting cooperatives who
accumulate legally determined reserves and pay farmers a year-end bonus or
"ristourne" to distribute profits. The allocations payable to coffee
processors (particularly of robusta coffee) have neither been systematically
determined by ONCPB nor based on reliable cost data. They have not accounted
for regional variations in cost. As a result, many robusta cooperatives have
systematically been under-compensated by ONCPB for the real costs they have
incurred. Unfortunately, accounting and financial management of robusta
cooperatives has not been sufficient to enable them to document the costs of
coffee-related activities. However, the result of the audit of coffee
cooperatives undertaken as part of the first project, showed that the
allowance for UCCAO's robusta cooperatives may have been 25% below the actual
cost incurred. This underlined the situation already recognized by UCCAO
which had in recent years been supporting the operations of the robusta
cooperatives from reserves accumulated on the sale of arabica coffee (Working
Paper 5). In 1981, this support amounted to about CFAF 200 million (US$0.6
million). Government conducted its own assessment of the bareme in mid 1982,
and has subsequently taken steps to redress the situation. For 1982/83, the
indicative prices of coffee on which taxes are levied (valeur mercuriale) for
both arabica and robusta coffee were lowered, reducing the export tax from 42%
to 32% of the "valeur mercuriale" and leaving more funds available for
distribution to processors. However a longer term solution to the problems
caused by the bareme would be a systematic adjustment each year. Government
has given assurances that the periodic revision of the price fixing formula
applicable to coffee would ensure full coverage of the cooperatives processing
and primary marketing costs (para 8.01(v)).
6.07      Food Crop Market.  The market outlook for food crops in Cameroom
appears favorable for producers, for the foreseable future. The combined
effect of population growth at a rate of 2.7% per year, and rising real per
capita incomes at a rate of 3% per year, will create an expanding local demand
which has the potential of raising real prices for all food crops. Expanding
demand in neighboring countries will also re-enforce local demand. Moreover,
projections of world market prices for maize and groundnuts show a rise in
real terms by about 2% per annum at least to 1995. This means that the risk
of cheap internationally-traded cereals being available to substitute for
locally produced food is low.
6.08      It is estimated that the project would stimulate an increase in food
crop production of about 160,000 tons in aggregate, which represents a 17%
growth over five years (para 6.01) or about 3% growth per year. About 75% of
this increase would be consumed directly by farm families or be sold to the
urban population within the Province through traditional marketing methods.
The remaining 25% could readily be marketed outside the Province by the
traders and intermediaries currently operating in the Province. The opening
of a new major road from Bafoussam to Yaounde (scheduled for 1986), together
with the improved feeder roads financed under the project would promote
further marketing efficiency. The sale of crop driers, storage bins and
pesticides to farmers on credit would further enhance the competitive position
of farmers in food markets. Finally, the diffusion of simple market
intelligence information for food crops sponsored under the project (para



- 44 -
4.21) would help increase market transparency. Therefore, no significant
bottlenecks are expected to obstruct regular, efficient, year-round marketing
of food crops produced by project participants in the main domestic consump-
tion centers in Douala and Yaounde. Thus, incremental production is not
expected to have a locally depressing effect on average price levels.
6.09     The rate of increases in nominal, farm level food crop prices in the
Province has been, on average, about equal to the rate of inflation in the
country. This has been achieved as aggregate food crop supply has grown in
rough proportion to aggregate demand. This situation is expected to continue
over the forseeable life of the project so that no general growth in real food
crop prices is assumed in the subsequent analysis of farm budgets (para 6.10).
A list of these prices is given in Working Paper 6. In addition, food crop
markets are not regulated. Most crops originating in the Province are traded
within Cameroon and the small amounts that are exported are not subject to
non-economic barriers. Therefore in subsequent economic analysis of the
project, observed market prices are assumed to be economic prices. An excep-
tion is made for maize, which could be imported feasibly to serve the Douala/
Yaounde markets, in which most of the project participant's incremental maize
production would be sold. In this case, the economic price of maize at the
farm level is estimated on an import parity basis. The economic farm level
price of maize is thus projected to rise from CFAF 48/kg in to CFAF 59/kg
(US$0.15) at full development (PY6) and remain constant thereafter.
C. Supply, Prices and Subsidization of Inputs
6.10     Government's procedures for procuring, distributing and financing
modern inputs (mainly fertilizer) have been inefficient and have failed to
provide adequate quantities to farmers in a timtely fashion (para 1.36).
Organizational inefficiencies have been compounded by Government's policy of
fertilizer subsidization, which, for coffee producers in the Western Province
alone, cost CFAF 942 million (US$2.4 million) in 1981 and CFAF 1,105 million
(US$2.8 million) in 1982. Government's total direct commitment to fertilizer
subsidies is estimated to be in the order of US$15 million, based on cif
Douala prices. In 1983 Government acted to alleviate the organizational
problems of input supplies by: a) increasing the funds available for sub-
sidies and including their financing within the national budget (instead of
impredictable coffee levies), so as to ensure timely and sufficient delive-
ries; and b) creating a technical input committee, including representation
from UCCAO and other relevant agencies, to advise the Central Tender Board
(Commission Centrale des Marches - CCM) on appropriate qualities of agricul-
tural chemicals (para 3.08).
6.11     To continue with the present subsidy program would eventually present
a serious constraint, not only on the project,but also on future agricultural
development in Cameroon. For example,to meet the goals of the Fifth Five-Year
Plan, fertilizer consumption would increase by about 10% per year to 1985-86.
It is doubtful whether the present administrative and distributional structure
could manage this growth. In addition, annual Government subsidies would rise
to about US$30 million per year. As part of the Bank's country economic and
sector work, the Bank financed a study, completed in 1983, to make proposals
for remedying Government's input supply and distribution problems. The



- 45 -
study's main recommendations are: i) to simplify and reorganize the input
supply circuit, including a greater participation by private traders; and ii)
to phase out the subsidization of fertilizer prices and, eventually, of crop
protection chemicals, coupled with increases in producer prices to maintain
farmers' income. The proposals are being actively considered by Government
and the dialogue on this subject will continue, with a view to agreeing on the
adoption of a more appropriate policy. In order to achieve further rationali-
zation, assurances were obtained that Government would periodically exchange
views with the Bank with respect to problems related to its input supply and
agricultural pricing policies (para 8.01(iii)).
6.12     Analysis shows that coffee farmers could afford to pay the full cost
of fertilizers and, provided sufficient fertilizer was made available to
farmers on time to permit its efficient use, little or no adjustment to coffee
prices would be necessary to maintain at least the level of real income
derived from coffee in PYO.
6.13     The measures undertaken by Government in 1983 to reduce the admini-
strative complexity of supplying fertilizer (para 6.10) have significantly
improved the situation in Western Province (para 1.36). UCCAO has been given
the responsibility for assessing the needs for fertilizers and crop protection
chemicals in the Province. Assurances have been obtained that: i) UCCAO
would continue to be associated with the choice and procurement of fertilizers
and crop protection chemicals for the project area (para 8.01(i)); and ii)
funds necessary to cover the subsidy on these inputs would be made available
to FONADER by August 31 of each year (para 8.01 (ii)). An understanding was
reached that adequate supplies of fertilizers and chemicals wold be delivered
to farmers by March 31 of each year.
6.14     Crop protection chemicals for coffee have been procured and distri-
buted, following the same system as for fertilizer (para 6.10). These
products have been distributed free of charge to farmers, and lack of
financing as well as administrative procedures have reduced their availability
in appropriate quantities and at the optimal time of the year. Recent reform
of fertilizer procurement and distribution procedures was also applied to
agricultural chemicals (para 6.13). However, the introduction of user fees
for agricultural chemicals is not envisaged at this time, since the applica-
tion of these chemicals is to treat infestations that are easily transmitted
over wide areas, and whose containment is as much in the public interest as in
the private interest of individual farmers. To date, these chemicals have
been applied on an area-by-area basis as a public service. This method is
presently judged to be the most effective technically and economically. The
cost of the subsidy on agricultural chemicals for the Western Province was
estimated to be about CFAF 477 million (US$1.2 million) in 1982, or about
US$10 per farm family per year.
6.15     Farmer Benefits.  Four illustrative farm models reflecting the
characteristics of the major ecological zones in the project area (para 2.02)
have been constructed to show the possible impact of the project on individual
participants. These models represent farmers in the arabica zone (highlands)
and the robusta zone (lowlands) with each zone sub-divided to account for
cropping or soil differences (Working Paper 2). Calculations are based on



- 46 -
achievement of expected yield increases valued at constant 1983 prices and the
situation of typical farmers in the arabica and robusta coffee zones are shown

D. Financial Implications
6.16     Farmers' Incentives.  As a result of their participation in the
project, farmers would earn increased net cash revenues by PY6 of between $218
per year for farmers in the black soil arabica zone and $178 per year in the
lowland robusta coffee/cocoa zone (para 6.15). They would also have increased
production costs of between $59 per year for the black soil arabica farmers
and $63 per year in the mixed robusta coffee/cocoa zone. The ratio of
incremental net cash income to incremental cash costs for those farmers is,
respectively, 3.7 and 2.8. These ratios exceed 2.5, which is a ratio normally
taken as an indicator that sufficient incentive exists for farmers to accept
the financial risk of further participation in the cash economy.

6.17     UCCAO/Cooperative Cash Flow:  The incremental cash flow for UCCAO and
its cooperatives resulting from the project is calculated on the following
assumptions. Inflows for UCCAO and the cooperatives originate: from Govern-
ment, as a grant to cover its participation in the project, to support recur-
rent costs of incremental staff, and to cover subsidies payable on inputs;
from ONCPB as payment under the robusta coffee bareme for coffee purchasing
and processing operations; from farmers and municipalities as payment for
production inputs and fees for bottomland use and for maintenance of water
points; from Government as a loan to finance seasonal credit for farmers and
the rehabilitation of coffee factories; and from the sale of coffee. Outflows
include: payments for costs incurred on behalf of the project, including
recurrent costs; payments to farmers for coffee, and repayment of loans to
Government. A number of inter-cooperative transfers, covering onlending from
UCCAO to member cooperatives for coffee factory rehabilitation, levies to
constitute the education fund, payments to robusta coffee growers originating
from ONCPB and management fees paid by cooperatives to UCCAO are not included.
While there have been some rigidities and imbalances in the management of
inter-cooperative transfers in the past (para 1.23), recommendations of the
auditors are being implemented which will facilitate these in the future. In
view of the UCCAO group's financial situation, it is important that UCCAO
maintains a positive cash flow balance as a result of project activities.
Under the proposed financing plan (para 5.03) and with adjustment in the
bareme payment for Robusta coffee, the UCCAO consolidated account would have a
positive balance averaging CFAF 135 million (US$340,000) per annum during
project implementation (Annex 6:2). Government would continue to contribute
towards the recurrent costs of extension operations between PY6 and PY11.
This would be a grant payment averaging CFAF 380 million (US$1.0 million), or
approximately 30% of recurrent costs each year up to PY11. From PY12, it is
anticipated that the UCCAO group would be able to wholly finance the recurrent
costs arising from the project. After implementation is complete (PY5), the
proposed project would continue to generate a cash-flow surplus for UCCAO's
account. This surplus would vary from US$0.4 million in PY6 to US$1.9 million
in PY20; an annual average of US$0.8 over the period.
6.18     Government's Cash Flow:  Government's incremental cash flow resulting
from the project is estimated on the following assumptions. Inflows include:
the loans from IBRD and IFAD; the repayment of loans by UCCAO; and taxes and
surpluses on the incremental arabica and robusta coffee production channelled
through ONCPB. Outflows include: payments of grants to UCCAO to cover project
costs; recurrent costs of extension personnel and their operations; subsidy
payments on fertilizer and agricultural chemicals; project related loans to
UCCAO; payments on behalf of the DEP (MINAGRI); and debt service on the IBRD
and IFAD loans. Under the proposed financing plan, the Government account for
the project would be negative to a maximum of CFAF 3.7 billion (US$9.5
million) in PY3. This balance would be redressed by PY12 and an average
positive annual balance of approximately CFAF 1,350 million (US$13.4 million)
could be anticipated between PY13 and PY20 (Annex 6:3). This indicates that
Government would be able to meet its obligations regarding the finances of
project related activities and recurrent input costs. Furthermore, commencing
in PY6 it would be feasible for Government to levy additional taxes, thereby
reducing the surplus accruing to UCCAO and increasing fiscal revenues from the
project area.

VII. BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits and Impact
7.01     The project's directly quantifiable benefits would be increased
production and quality of crops. By full development (PY6), incremental
coffee production would reach 6,930 tons (17% increase) and incremental output
of food crops would be about 160,000 tons. Most of the incremental food crop
production would be in excess of family consumption needs and would be sold
either in the Province or in the major urban centers in Cameroon. By PY6, the
FOB value of incremental coffee would be about US$15.0 million in constant
1983 terms, and the farm level value of incremental food crop production would
amount to US$18.0 million. Less easily quantifiable, but also significant,
would be the improvements made in the operations of rural institutions and the
modernization of the cooperative movement in Western Province. It is clear
that the long-term well being of agriculture in the Province will depend on
the ability of the cooperatives to exercise increased public responsibilities
and the project would assist them to increase this ability. Support of UCCAO
and its member cooperatives would permit them to assume greater autonomy,
thereby helping them to respond to changing needs and situation to sustain
long term development. Infrastructural developments financed under the
project would directly support production and enhance rural life.
7.02     After the Northern Province, the Western Province has the second
highest population of Cameroon's seven provinces. However, the Province ranks
fifth in GDP and per capita income. Thus, the project would cover one of the
poorest areas in the country. Moreover, the entire Province would be included
in the project so that assistance would be extended to the poorest inhabitants
of the Province. These are people farming ecological zones of the lowest
potential in the Province, and who have not significantly benefited from
development projects in the past. The proposed project would make specific
provisions to assist women, and would specifically address the constraint
faced by the low income farmers, bringing them progressively into the cash
economy through the intermediary of improved coffee production and marketing.
The project would benefit some 85,000 families, or more than half-a-million
individuals; more than half of which would not have participated in earlier
projects. Cash income for participants would increase by about 50% (para
6.10) thereby providing a significant stimulus to rural growth affecting more
than half of the Province's population.
B. Economic Analysis and Sensitivity
7.03     The project's economic rate of return has been calculated using the
following assumptions regarding costs: (i) project investment costs (PY1-PY5)
have been valued in mid 1983 terms, and an allowance has been made for annual
operating costs and periodic replacement of vehicles and equipment PY6-PY20;
(ii) costs include physical contingencies (para 5.02) but exclude taxes and
price contingencies; (iii) a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.77 has been
applied to the domestic portion of all costs to bring them to border price
equivalents; (iv) farm labor, incremental with respect to PYO, has been shadow
priced at CFAF 600 (US$1.5) per man-day and incremental and recurrent



- 49 -
fertilizer and spraying costs have been included at their economic farmgate
value (Annex 2); and (v) the cost of constructing the 450 km of category A
feeder roads, necessary to complete the feeder road system in the province has
also been included, at a cost of US$5.0 million.
7.04     Economic benefits include  only quantifiable crop production valued
as follows: the value of incremental coffee production is estimated on an
export parity basis, allowing for a reduction in quality discounts from 9% to
4% of the fob price (para 6.05). Incremental maize production has been valued
on an import parity basis, at the farm level in the Province, and incremental
food crop production has been valued at market determined farmgate prices
which are assumed to be equivalent to the economic values. Incremental
benefits are assumed to lag one year behind projects costs since incremental
crop production would be realized only after project actions had taken place.
The sole exception is coffee produced from the regenerated plantings, for
which maturation is assumed to extend to PY18.
7.05     Under the above assumptions the project's economic rate of return
(ERR) is estimated at 30% (details, project file). This high rate of return
results from the fact that for the arabica coffee zone, the project continues
actions begun under the first project, and thus requires a lower level of
investment and incremental operating expenditure than would otherwise be
normal for such a project.
ERR        Switching Values at 12%

in Benefits     in Costs
(a) Project, Including Category A
Feeder Roads                           30.5          27.0           36.9
(b) Project, Without Category A
Feeder Roads                           33.7         29.3            41.4
(c) Coffee Factory Construction and
Renovation                             33.6          48.9           95.8
7.06     Sensitivity.  The project is relatively insensitive to unfavorable
variations in costs, benefits, and participation rates.  A decrease in
benefits of 27%, or a rise in costs of 37% in real terms would be required to
reduce the ERR to 12%, which is the estimated opportunity cost of capital in
Cameroon. Noreover, a two year lag in benefits or a 30% reduction in farmer
participation would still produce acceptable internal rates of return of 13%
and 16%, respectively. Such adverse developments are not considered likely,
given UCCAO's satisfactory performance in extension and cost control under the
first project, and the relatively favorable outlook for food crop markets. A
separate economic analysis of the project's industrial component (para 3.33),
includes as benefits, the reduced discounts and penalties resulting from
improved quality and management (over the total tonnage), and as costs, the



- 50 -
investment and operating costs associated with factory construction and
renovation, training, and employment of experts. This component has an
economic rate of return of 34%.
C. Risks
7.07     There are no special technical risks associated with the project.
Average yield expectations account for inter-year weather variations in the
project zone as well as normally expected divergences from experiment station
results (para 6.01). Farmers are already familiar with the basic cultivation
techniques which the project would improve, and their participation is
expected to be good, owing to proven success of the T and V extension system
in the Province.
7.08     The project management risk is not considered high, since the project
will be executed by an existing organization which has already proven itself
capable of effectively performing the required field operations. Moreover,
the recruitment and training of qualified personnel and better coordination of
planning and evaluation with both provincial and national organizations (para
4.02) would strengthen administrative procedures and financial controls iden-
tified as weaknesses in the first project. Reorganization of the system of
input procurement and distribution would reduce risks associated with the
timely and adequate supply of production inputs (para 6.13). Lastly, specific
actions are to be taken over the project period to improve the operational and
financial performance of the cooperatives. As an interim measure, however,
project supported field operations would be centrally managed by UCCAO to
serve farmers needs while the cooperatives are improving.
7.09     A number of conditions have been proposed governing the use and
disbursement of project funds which would limit financial risks of the
project. Reviewing the coffee bareme would reduce the risk to UCCAO's finan-
cial position resulting from its support of the robusta coffee cooperatives.
Finally, a major effort has already commenced to improve financial management
in all the cooperatives. The analysis of farm budgets (para 6.15) shows that
farmers would have sufficient financial incentive to participate in the
project.
VIII. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     Agreement was reached with Government during negotiations on the
following major points:
(i) UCCAO's participation in the choice and procurement of farm inputs
(para 6.13); and project chemicals to be satisfactory to the Bank
(para 3.08);
(ii) deposit, by Government, of funds, a) equivalent to the value of
subsidies on fertilizers and chemicals by August 31 of each year
(para 6.13), and (b) necessary to cover its share of project services
and recurrent costs (para 5.05);



- 51 -
(iii)  periodic exchange of views with respect to input supply and
agricultural pricing policies (para 6.11) and the qualifying area for
coffee replanting subsidy (para 3.26);
(iv)  uniform basis for granting financial and other incentives to project
staff (para 4.05); and suitability of project management personnel
(para 4.06);
(v)  periodic revision of the price fixing formula for coffee (para 6.06);
(vi)  deposit by UCCAO of funds reimbursed from industrial investments in a
general cooperative fund (para 5.04(ii));
(vii)  an on-lending rate for credit in PY1 of 11.25% to be reviewed in PY2
through PY5 and, after consultation with the Bank, to be revised, if
appropriate (para 4.15);
(viii)  signing of separate executing agreements for implementing water
supply, roads, and research components (para 5.06);
(ix)  preparation of manuals and application by UCCAO and its member
cooperatives of organization changes (para 4.14);
(x)  presentation of action plan for improving coffee marketing by
September 30, 1984; and subsequent implementation within twelve
months (para 6.04);
(xi)  presentation of annual work programs and budgets by September 30 in
each year, and quarterly progress reports (para 4.07);
(xii)  for each bottomland to be developed, completion of detailed plans and
formal community agreement (paras 3.18 and 3.28); and
(xiii)  transfer of agricultural extension personnel and bottomlands
development personnel to UCCAO (para 4.03).
8.02     The following would be conditions of loan effectiveness:
(i)  the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between Government and
UCCAO regarding the provision of funds for project credit activities
(para 5.06);
(ii)  the initial deposit by Government of sufficient funds to increase the
Project Account to CFAF 400 million (para 5.05);
(iii)  the finacial controller; and the directors of production and
technical services would have been employed (para 4.06);
(iv)  confirmation of a single extension service in Western Province under
the responsibility of UCCAO (para 4.03).



- 52 -
8.03     The following would be conditions of disbursement:
(i)  against feeder roads:  recruitment of key staff (para 3.37); and, in
addition, (a) the satisfactory operation of the Feeder Roads Unit in
Western Province, (b) presentation of annual work plans and budgets,
and (c) completion of associated Category A feeder roads network;
(ii)  for individual cooperatives: implementation of specific measures in
the areas of financing/accounting and staffing (para 4.14); and
submission of detailed investment plans (para 3.33).
8.04     Under these conditions the project would be suitable for an IBRD loan
of US$21.5 million.
