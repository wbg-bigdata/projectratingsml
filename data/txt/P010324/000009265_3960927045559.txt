MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED BANK LOAN AND A PROPOSED IDA CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE THIRD INDUSTRIAL INESTMENT CREDT (C) PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed Bank loan of US$ 148 million
equivalent and a proposed IDA credit of SDR 1.5 million (US$ 2 million
equivalent) to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) is submitted for approval.
The loan would help finance viable private industries through a network of
seven participating financial institutions (PFIs), which will include four
major commercial banks (NCBs) and three leading development banks - (Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC), Industrial Development
Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the National Development Finance Corporation
(NDFC). The credit would help finance technical assistance programs aimed at
accelerating the growth of the equity markets and strengthening the PFIs. The
loan would carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would have a
fixed amortization schedule of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.
The credit will be on IDA standard terms with 35 years maturity.
2.       Background.  Since 1977, GOP has adopted a policy of promoting
private investment and curtailing investment by public enterprises in the
manufacturing sector. The Bank has played an important role in assisting the
GOP in meeting its objectives. Prior to 1983, Bank lending to industries was
limited to three development banks (PICIC, IDBP, and NDFC). PICIC and IDBP
were facing severe financial difficulties due to the massive devaluation of
the Rupee in 1972. NDFC was lending only to public enterprises. These
institutions were also operating under different rules regarding income tax,
business activities, and dividend policies. Under the First IIC Project cf
US$100 million comprising a loan of US$50 million (Ln. 2380-PAK) and a credit
of US$50 million equivalent (Cr. 1439-PAK), which was approved in 1983, the
*       Bank assisted GOP in the financial restructuring of PICIC and IDBP.  The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) also made a parallel loan of US$110 million on almost
identical terms. To enhance competition in the system of industrial finance,
the Habib Bank Limited, the largest commercial bank, was included in the
Project as an intermediary. About half of the funds were earmarked
individually for the four PFIs, and the rest was made available on a
first-come first-served basis subject to the PFIs meeting agreed performance
criteria. The implementation of the First IIC project was highly successful.
The loan and the credit were committed well ahead of schedule and disbursements
amounted to US$38.4 million and SDR 39.1 million respectively as of
December 15, 1988.



3.       Under the Second IIC Project of Us$ 150 million comprising a Bank
loan of US$148 million (Ln. 2648-PAK) and an IDA credit of US$2 million
equivalent (Cr. 1646-PAK), approved in January 1986, the credit delivery
system for industrial finance was further enlarged by the inclusion of two
more commercial banks (United and Muslim), and institution building efforts
were intensified. IDBP's Charter was amerded so that it could lend for
working capital, and specific targets were established for deposit
mobilization, loan collections, debt service coverage and profit. In the case
of PICIC, a change in management was made and a new business strategy was
developed. NDFC's Charter was amended so that it could lend also to the
private sector. A technical assistance program for building up project
lending capability of the PFIs, especially of the commercial banks, was
included. The project also supported GOP's policies for enhancing viability
of the stock market. The implementation of the Project is proceeding well.
As of December 20, 1988, the loan (Ln-2648) of US$ 148 million was fully
committed and disbursements amounted to US$73.7 million. The implementation
of the technical assistance component (Cr.1646) of US$ 2.0 million equivalent
is also proceeding well.
4.       Project Objectives.  The proposed Project will support GOP's policy of
promoting private industrial investment under the Seventh Five-Year Plan
(1988-93). The demand for credits under the second IIC project has far
exceeded the expectation. In view of the GOP's commitment to the SAF program
as discussed in the Policy Framework Paper, a positive investment climate is
expected to continue and there is a need to make adequate foreign exchange
resources available to Pakistan's private sector, to maintain the momentum.
The specific objectives of the proposed Project are as follows: (a) to assist
GOP in accelerating the growth of equity markets through necessary policy
changes and technical assistance; (b) to improve credit delivery for
industrial finance by focusing on the system as well as the individual
financial intermediaries; (c) to assist the PFIs, especially PICIC and IDBP
in their business diversification programs and to continue institution
building programs of PFIs; (d) to address selected important corporate
finance issues such as bridge loans, and more market-oriented interest rate to
foster efficient industrial growth; and (e) to ensure a steady flow of
long-term foreign exchange resources to private industry. Under the proposed
Project, the number of term lending facilities will be expanded from six to
seven major financial institutions (three DFIs and four NCBs). Together, they
will be covering about 80% of the financiai system. The National Bank of
Pakistan will have access to the Bank's funds for the first time.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed Project would involve a Bank loan
of US$148 million for on-lending and an IDA credit of UTS$2 million equivalent
for technical assistance. GOP will on-lend the Bank's funds to PFIs at
122 p.a., and bear the interest rate and exchange risks for a fee. Based on
the present Bank lending tate of 7.65%, the current fee would be 4.35% p.a.
PFIs will on-lend the Bank's funds to viable private enterprises in all
sub-sectors at a minimum interest rate of 15Z p.a., which is substantially
positive and expected to remain positive during the medium term. The PFIs
will be allowed to price the individual sub-loans at or above the minimum



- 3 -
lending rate based on the credit risk of each sub-borrower. As under the
second IIC Project, all PFIs will receive a minimum spread of 32 and bear the
credit risk. The PFIs will be responsible for appraising projects in
accordance with the standards accept-ble to the Bank. All projects will
include calculations of Internal Financial Rate of Return and Internal
Economic Rate of Return. The appraisal reports will also include a statement
on the environmental impact of each sub-project and, when warranted, the
appropriate remedial actions. The Bank's funds will be made available to PFIs
on a first-come first-served basis. GOP will bear the commitment fee until
the Bank has authorized sub-projects to the PFIs. The maximum and minimum
sub-loan sizes would be US$6.0 million and US$750,000 respe.tively.  To ensure
a sound capital structure and strong commitment from the sponsors, the maximum
debt:equity ratio of sub-projects financed under the proposed Project will be
60:40 and a minimum Debt Service Covt.age Ratio of 2:0 will be required for
the borrowing company. Bridge loan will be considered as debt. Specific
eligibility criteria have been established for each PFI. These criteria
include maintenance of debt service coverage ratio, debt equity ratio and cash
collections. In case of the two development banks, PICIC and IDBP, the
criteria include the implementation of the agreed business diversification
programs. The Bank and ADB have worked closely in lending through financial
intermediaries in Pakistan. ADB has adopted an almost identical approach as
that of the Bank by making an open-ended credit line available to eligible
PFIs. The Bank and ADB have also synchronized the conditionality related to
the PFIs. A breakdown of costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and disbursements schedules are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.7436-PAK
dated December 29, 1988, is also attached.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has thus far been
instrumental in enlarging the credit delivery system for industrial finance
through the inclusion of commercial banks and making it more competitive by
broadening the range of services offered by the PFIs. The Bank has also
played a key role in assisting the DFIs in their financial restructuring and
diversification programs. The Bank and ADB are the two major sources of
foreign exchange for term lending, and the Bank's continued involvement is
crucial for private industrial investment in Pakistan. Institution building
efforts started during the first two projects need to be continued to ensure
their successful implementaticn. As set out in the Policy Framework Paper,
there is also a need to accelerate development of capital markets so that
adequate equity funds could be mobilized for private investment to complement
debt financing. The proposed Project will complement a proposed Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL), which will address broader financial sector
issues in the context of the SAF program and focus on: (i) improving monetary
and debt management; (ii) strengthening the regulatory framework for
supervising financial institutions; and (iii) improving the accounting
policies to increase transparency in the system. Specific measures to
strengthen the commercial banking system will also be taken under the proposed
FSAL. Policy measures proposed under the Project complement those envisaged
under the FSAL and it is important for the Bank to be involved in the evolving
institutional structure for term lending in the foreseeable future.



7.       AgreedActions. During negotiations an agreement was reached with
the Government on the following: (a) Policy measures to accelerate the growth
of the equity markets and the access of the corporate sector to equity
finance. In this connection, during negotiations it was agreed that GOP will
(i) issue a circular clarifying its policy on pricing of new share issues in
the stock market, (ii) allow the corporate sector to have direct access to the
capital market by enabling them to issue Participation lerm Certificates
directly to the public, and (iii) issue instructions enabling commercial banks
to perfoz.., trust function. The above actions have been carried out
satisfactorily. In addition, it was agreed that GOP will (i) take necessary
actions to allow financial institutions to become members of the Karachi Stock
Exchange by December 31, 1989, and (ii) issue the necessary instructions in
consultation with the Bank on the use of bridge loans by June 30, 1989;
(b) On-lending arrangement. GOP would pass on the Bank funds at 12% and PFIs
would be permitted to charge flexible interest rates that the market would
bear above a minimum rate of 152; and (c) Performance criteria for the PFIs.
These criteria include appropriate levels of debt service coverage and
collection ratios, and of non-performing assets, as well .s the implementation
of the agreed business diversification plans.
8.       Benefits and Risks.  The private industrial sector is the most dynamic
sector in Pakistan and has performed well. However, it has only partially met
its potential given Pakistan's physical resource endowment and human
resources. The Project would allow the Bank to assist GOP in meeting its
objectives of increasing the role of the private sector under the Seventh Plan
and accelerating the growth of the equity markets. Based on the experience of
earlier projects, the project would create about 20,000 new jobs. The main
risks would be a change in GOP's policy regarding the role of the private
sector and failure of the PFIs to meet the agreed criteria. An adequate
number of eligible sub-projects might not materialize if political
uncertainties emerge and policy initiatives needed to support a strong
investment climate including a sound macro-economic framework falter.
Currently, however, projects on hand in the pipelines of the PFIs show credit
demand substantially in excess of the proposed loan amount. The risk of PFI
failure to perform is minimal as any PFI which does not meet the agreed
performance criteria will be excluded from accessing the Bank funds.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the loan and credit.
