PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
ELEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 1278-PAK
Preface
An IDA credit in the amount of SDR 44.3 million (US$50 million
equivalent) for the Pakistan Eleventh Railway Project was approved on
July 1, 1982. The credit was closed on December 31, 1985, the original
closing date. Disbursements under the credit totalled US$25.71 million,
and the final disbursement was made on July 25, 1986, at which time
US$23.28 million was cancelled.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office and is based on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the Credit and Project Agreements, supervision reports, transport
sector memoranda, and information contained in the project file and
provided by the Borrower during project appraisal. A PCR mission was
undertaken in May 1987 to obtain additional information on the causes of
delay in project implementation, actual costs of the pioject, and other
details.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on February 23, 1989, for comments
by April 14, 1989, but none were received.

PAKISTAN
ELEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 1278-PAK
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
The objectives of the Eleventh Railway Project were to assist
the railway to respond to the challenges of road competition. The
maajor components of the project aimed to:
(a)  improve   the   reliability   of   locomotives   through
modernization of maintenance;
(b) improve operational and financial performance through
the introduction of a management information system; and
(c) establish a regular export/import container service
between Karachi and the inland terminal at Lahore.
Responding to the challenge also required operational and
financial measures to be taken and these were included as covenants.
Implementation Experience
The IDA Credit (1278-PAK) for the project amounted to SDR
44.3 million (US$50 million equivalent) but, as a result of delays in
project implementation, only US$25.71 million was disbursed; US$23.28
million was cancelled. The proceeds of the credit were onlent to PR
by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) at 11% interest rate for a period
of 20 years including a grace period of 4 years. The ileventh Railway
Project was appraised in November 1981 and the credit became effective
on September 13, 1982.
The components of the project (para 2.07) to be financed
under the credit consisted of expansion and equipping of locomotive
workshops, an initial stock of locomotive components for a unit
exchange pool, provision of maintenance spares for locomotives, a
management information system, expansion of the Lahore Dry Port and
rolling stock and handling equipment for container operations. The
project also included: (a) staff training; (b) technical assistance to
study the possible expansion of electrification; and (c) a plan of
action to improve operational and financial performance.



The locomotive maintenance improvement component was modified
somewhat (para 3.03) in March 1984 by redirecting some of the project
plant and machinery to the Moghalpura workshop. In December 1985, a
few weeks before the closing date, some of the funds of the credit
were reallocated (para 3.04) resulting in an SDR 8,860,000 reduction
in funds for plant and machinery and increased funds for unit exchange
components and revenue spare parts.   At the disbursement closing date
(July 26, 1986), an undisbursed balance of US$23.3 million of the
credit was cancelled.
Total project cost of US$42.2 million (as of May 1987) was
only 32% of appraisal cost (Annex 2), largely because the project was
not completed. After the termination of credit disbursements, project
implementation was continued on a much reduced scale utilizing GOP's
own resources and bilateral  credits.    Spare parts and unit exchange
components were purchased from the original manufacturers of existing
equipment; otherwise all the goods financed under the credit were
procured through ICB.
None of the three principal components of the project was
completed. For the locomotive maintenance improvement, two of the
shops were constructed but one was only 15% complete; about three
quarters of the unit exchange components originally intended to be
procured were actually purchased.   Procurement of revenue spare parts
about equalled the original allocation for this purpose but the
additional funds made available under the credit reallocation were not
used. No implementation of the MIS component was carried out because
the telecommunications installation on which it depended was not
completed (para 3.08).
The principal cause of delayed implementation of the project
(para. 3.02) was that during the initial two years of the scheduled
implementaton, the Railway Board gate  little urgency to obtaining GOP
approval for  project  components.    Once  final  approval  was given
implementation proceeded satisfactorily on the locomotive maintenance
and containerization  components.    As  the  closing date approached,
PR/GOP requested extension of the credit but IDA refused the request
(para 3.27).   The  refusal was  based  on  the  inordinate delays in
implementation caused by late GOP/PR approval of the project and the
inadequate compliance with important covenants of the Credit Agreement
(8.05).
Railway  freight  traffic   (Annex   4),   in  terms  of  ton
kilometers, increased slowly between FY 1981 and FY 1986, in line with
the modest appraisal forecast.   Passenger  kilometers (Annex 5) in FY
1986 remained at about the same level as in FY 1981, falling 10% short
o_ the forecast  level.    Among  the  factors explaining the stagnant
railway traffic is the low availability of locomotives caused in large
part by severe problems in locomotive maintenance. Improvements in
operating indicators (Annex 6) were few (and some worsened) despite
the Plan of Astion incorporated in the project.



- vi -
The financial performance of PR (Annex 8) fell far short of
the objectives of the project.    In contrast to an appraisal forecast
of net operating revenue of Rs 711 million in FY86, the PR actually
incurred a net operating loss of Rs 479 million for that year. The
principal reason for the deteriorating financial performapee was the
reluctanc of the GOPIPR to raise passenger fares (para 5.05). Only
after a long delay was a 15X general passenger fare increase
introduced in mid-1985 and this increase fell far short of the need.
Compliance with financial covenants was inadequate (Annex 9). While a
few uneconomic passenger services were eliminated as required under
the plan of action, many more services should, on economic grounds, be
terminated; recognizing that, to a large extent, the poor and
deteriorating financial condition of PR is attributable to the
continuation of uneconomic lines and servizes, there is little hope
for achieving major improvement in these results unless either (1) PR
reduces many more such services despite possible adve:se public
reaction; or (2) GOP grants PR substantial subsidies annually to
offset heavy losses incurred by PR where GOP requires that such
services be provided (para 5.10).
Results and Sustainability
The economic benefits of the partially completed project were
small and the rate of return negative (Annex 10). If the project is
ultimately completed, which is by no means assured, the project will
probably yield a low  return.    Hence,  the project is not considered
sustainable.
Findings and Lessons
The main objectives of the Eleventh Railway Project, were not
achieved.    Nonetheless,  the  Association  has  had  some  favorable
influence on the long-term development of the railway through its
continued involvement. The overseas training program has had some
positive  impact  on   the   quality   of   management.       Also,  the
electrification study completed under the project provides a basis for
orderly development of electrification if financing for such a project
becomes available.   More  important,  the initiatives undertaken with
the main project components are steps that needed to be taken and, if
the railway is to continue serving the nation with reasonable
efficiency,  these   developments   should   be   carried  forward  to
completion. Moreover, since the closing of the loan GOP and PR have
become more aware of the need for the railway to adjust to the
competitive environment. The railway has taken various initiatives of
its  own  and   a   draft   institutional,  managerial  and  financial
restructuring order is currently awaiting Cabinet approval.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
ELEVENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 1278-PAK
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Pakistan covers a land area of about 800,000 square kilometers and
has a population of about 96 million. The size and configuration of the
country and the location of principal population centers are such that much
domestic trade involves transport over long distances. A distance of about
1,500 km (1,000 miles) separates Karachi, the main port and industrial center
in the south, from the important northern centers of Lahore, Rawalpindi, and
Islamabad. Since railways generally are economically best adapted to
long-distance transport, the conditions in the country are particularly
advantageous for Pakistan Railways.
1.02     The steadily improving economic performance of Pakistan between
fiscal years 1977 and 1983 was interrupted in FY1984 as a result of an
unexpected decrease in agricultural production and a fall in migrant
remittances as well as a carryover of inflationary pressures built up in the
previous year. FY1985 was also a difficult year for Pakistan's economy;
although economic growth rebounded strongly from the slUrp of FY1984, the
balance of payments deteriorated and government finances worsened
considerably. The growth rate for gross domestic product averaged 6.7 percent
for the period FY1977-1983, slowed to 3.5 percent in FY1984, then returned to
about the 6.7 percent level in FY1985. Per capita GNP was US$390 in 1983
compared with US$300 in FY1981-82.
1.03     Pakistan's transport system consists of Pakistan Railway (PR),
semi-public Pakistan International Airlines, National Shipping Corporation,
privately owned Pan Islamic Steamship Company, four provincially-owned bus
companies, numerous private road transporters, National Logistics Cell,
Karachi-Mu.tan Pipeline and two ocean ports, Karachi and Qasim, through which
virtually all the country's exports and imports are lhandled.
1.04     The principal lines of the 8,775 km PR were built in the 19th
century. The system is government-owned and operated and constitutes one of
the largest and most important public sector organizations in the country.
For many years, PR was the nation's principal mode of modern transport but
recently has conceded that dominant position to road transport. A number of
railway projects including the Eleventh Railway Project were designed to
improve PR's competitive position and reverse this trend. Since 1952, the
Bank Group has lent US$213 million for railway projects in Pakistan.



-2-
1.05     At the time of appraisal of the Eleventh Railway Project in November
1981, PR had already received eight loans and credits amounting to US$187
million, all with essentialiy the same objectives of rehabilitating the
railway infrastructure and improving PR's planning capacity, accounting
procedures, management and operations. The first loan to the railways (then
Pakistan Western Railway) was made in 1952 and the latest (Credit 684-PAK and
Loan 1372-PAK) in 1977. All eight of the loans/credits were fully disbursed;
performance however, was mixed with satisfactory results for the earlier
projects and less than satisfactory results in the case of the Tenth Railway
Project. Under the Eighth and Ninth Railway projects (496-PAK and 621-PAK),
progress in physical implementation was slow and during that period
(1965-1979) PR experienced significant declines in its overall performance.
Because of politicel disturbances in the early 1970s and the severe flood
damage in both 1973 and 1976, the Ninth Railway Project (621-PAK) required
nine years instead of the estimated three years to be completed. The Tenth
Railway Project (Credit 684-PAK, Loan 1372-PAK) was completed in seven and a
half years, some two and a half years behind the original completion date.
1.06     Among the major concerns of the Association during implementation of
the Eleventh Railway Project was PR's reluctance to prepare an action plan to
achieve operational improvements, to curtail uneconomic passenger services and
to increase passenger fares inorder to improve the railways' deteriorating
financial performance.
1.07     The Eleventh Railway Project has not been completed and the project
objectives have not been realized. Implementation has continued at a slow
pace following the termination of disbursements in July 1986 and PR intends to
complete the project by mid-1988 if sufficient alternative financing can be
found.
H. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     The proposed content of the Eleventh Railway Project was discussed
informally among GOP/PR officials and Bank staff as early as 1979. In October
1980, a mission formally identified the project which was to include three
main components: (a) locomotive maintenance improvements; (b) development of
container handling facilities; and (c) management information system.
2.02     In August 1961, the Secretary of the Railway Board, in a letter to
the Ministry of Railways, proposed that the Eleventh Railway Project be
approved in principle and requested clearance of the project concept; a copy
of the request was sent to the Bank. The project differed in one important
respect from preceding Baak Group-financed projects for PR: previous projects
had involved gene;.al support of railway development plans, but the new one was
directed to a limited number of specific high priority items.
2.03     Preparation of the project was accomplished by the PR and various
consultants engaged by PR and the Bank. For improvements in locomotive
maintenance, PR itself in 1980 undertook a study aimed at determining the
facilities and materials required to establish a plant for remanufacturing
locomotive components and assemblies essential to implement a unit exchange
system. To assist PR in this work, a team of PR officials visited Railway



-3-
organizations in the US and Canada and produced a useful report in 1981. The
intention was to locate the remanufacturing activity at the Central Diesel
Locomotive Workshop in Rawalpindi, but during subsequent project
implementation it was decided (April 1984) to concentrate much of this work at
the locomntive workshop in Moghalpura. PR/GOP indecision on this issue caused
substantial delay in approval of the project by the Railway Board and Planning
Commission.
2.04     For preparation of the component concerning '>:ntainer handling
facilities, PR was assisted in 1981 by both the Japan International Cooperaton
Agency and R. Waheed Associates, Ltd., Consultants. In addition, the Bank
employed Anderson Associates (US) to review PR's findings and provide
technical assistance to PR in defining facility expansion and equipment
requirements for the lahore Dry Port. This work was carried out
satisfactorily.
2.05     Preparation of the management information system (MIS) component was
carried out by PR, but it was not detailed.  A consultant, W.H. Thompson (US),
employed by the Association in 1980 prepared a brief report on PR management
information needs.  The railways intended that the specific characteristics of
the system and its hardware requirements would be determined during project
implementation by consultants to be engaged by PR.  Both PR and the
Association recognized that a precondition for implementation of the MIS was
the completion of the telecommunications system, under the Tenth Railway
Project which, at the time of appraisal was expected to be completed before
mid-1983. Later, it became clear that this forecast was much too optimistic:
in June 1987, the telecommunications system was still not completed.
Consequently, MIS was not begun.
2.06     An additional preparation study for the project was done by Emmay
Associates, Ltd. (Pakistan) in 1981. These consultants studied the future role
of the railway, determining that PR would continue to have an important role to
play in the transport system of Pakistan and that the railway needed
strengthening in several important respects. The report was accepted by the
Bank as satisfactory. However, the report only confirmed that PR had a
potential role, but did not examine the fundamental institutional, management
and financial reforms needed for the railway to be able to realize that
potential in the face of intensifying road competition. Nevertheless project
preparation mission discussed the constraints affecting both PR's ability to
carry traffic and its financial performance, and operational and financial
covenants were included in the loan agreement.
2.07     The proposed Eleventh Railway Project contained three high-priority
items and also included a special electrification study, all of which were
expected to be completed in mid-1985.  The project was estimated to cost about
US$132.7 million (Rs 1,393.4 million) with a foreign exchange component of
US$76.1 million, and included the following components (ref. to Schedule 2 of
the Credit Agreement):
(a) Locomotive Maintenance Improvements
(i)    Expansion, equipping, and modernization of the Rawalpindi Central
Diesel Locomotive Works to provide for remanufacture and overhaul



-4-
of locomotives components for the Borrower's entire diesel
electric fleet, including the provision of stock, spare parts,
technical assistance, and training.
(Iii)    Modernization, repair, and improvements of the Karachi
Locomotive Shed to allow change over to unit exchange
maintenance, including the Drovision of stock, spare parts,
technical assistance, and training.
(b) Management Information System
Development and implementation of a management information
system, including the provision of a data network, hardware and
software, technical assistance, and traini.ng.
(c) Containerization
(i)    Expansion of Lahore Dry Port, construction of tracks and storage
and acquisition of rolling stock and handling equipment for the
operations of container service.
(ii)    Development of a container tariff and information system for
Karachi Port Trust.
(d) Other
Feasibility study of electrification of mainline
Khanewal-Karachi.
2.08     Recognizing that the operational and financial performance of the
railway had been less than satisfactory immediately prior to the time of
appraisal, the project incorporated a Plan of Action, which set forth targets
for various operating measures (Annex 7) in the years from 1981/82 to 1984/85,
and required elimination of various uneconomic passenger services, staff
reductions and other actions.
2.09     At the time of Bank appraisal, the PC-1 documents for various
principal components of the Eleventh Railway Project had not been formally
approved by the Railway Board and the Planning Commission, nor had approval
been given at the time of credit negotiations or indeed effectiveness. This
sanction was required by GOP before expenditures could be incurred for any of
the components, even after approval of the credit by IDA.
2.10     Du-ing negotiations, in May 1982, a major issue was the Association's
insistence that GOP commit itself to increase passenger fares within a
specified period of time. This issue had been under discussion between PR/GOP
and the Bank for months prior to negotiations. The urgent need for a
substantial increase in fares on second class service was clearly required to
improve the financial performance of the railways, but the GOP feared a broad
p_blic outcry and political reaction.  Ultimately, agreement was reached that
increases in fares and rates, the amount to be determined by PR/GOP, would be
announced no later than June 30, 1983. This requirement was incorporated in a



- 5 -
Side Letter, which also contained a Plan of Action representing measures to be
implemented by PR to achieve various .pecified targets of operational and
financial performance. In addition, a number of significant finar.cial
covenants were included in the Credit Agreement.
HI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Start Up
3.01     The credit for the Eleventh Railway Project became effective on
September 13, 1982. about 2 1/2 months after Board approval. Little was
accomplished in 1982 and 1983 as PR was continuing to prepare the PC-1
documents for the main project components (para 2.09). In the fall of 1982,
however, the electrification study was begun. Procurement of revenue spare
parts for locomotives could go forward without PC-1 clearance, but-even here
the PR was slow to act. In March 1984, a supervision mission found that about
US$5 million had been expended on locomotive spare parts. Also, limited
tenders had been invited for procurement of some components for the ur.it
exchange system and for some container handling equipment, all in anticipation
of the clearance of PC-1 documents, since no orders could be placed until
obtaining clearance of those documents.
3.02     There are two principal reasons for the long delay in clearing the
PC-ls. First, frequent changes in railway management during 1982-84 resulted
in lack of leadership and urgency in preparing the PC-ls by the railway staff
and in their finalization by the Railway Board. Also during this period the
Board was giving priority to aquisition of new locomotives and construction of
a railway manufacturing plant. In addition the recommendations of overseas
inspection teams for each of the three components resulted in corrections and
revisions being made to the PC-ls. The Board also made little effort to have
the Planning Commission clear the documents in an expeditious fashion.
Second, the Ministry of Finance experienced a shortage of local funds for a
number of investment projects under consideration in 1984 and implementation
of the Eleventh Railway Project was held up on this account.
Proiect Modification
3.03     The locomotive maintenance improvement component was modified
somewhat in March 1984. The original intention was to centralize, as much as
possible, the heavy maintenance and remanufacture of locomotives and critical
components at the Central Diesel Locomotive Workshop in Rawalpindi.  On
reconsideration early in 1984, it was found that a more productive approach,
at least in the short term, would be to utilize the Moghalpura Workshop for
remanufacture of engine blocks, turbochargers, expressors, traction motors and
traction generators. This approach would also ensure continued work for the
staff at Moghalpura which was phasing out its overhaul of steam locomotives.
Accordingly, most of the machinery procured under the project would be
directed to Moghalpura rather than Rawalpindi facilities. This change was
consistent with the PC-1 then approved by the Railway Board.

Reallocation of Credit
3.04     In early December 1985, a few weeks before the closing date, but
after the Association had informed GOP/PR that no extension was possible, GOP
and IDA agreed to the following reallocation of the SDR 29,230,000 originally
allocated to the Locomotive Maintenance Improvement component:
Original             New               Percent
Allocation        Allocation            Change
--------- ( S D R ) ------
(a)  Plant and Machinery       12,850,000          3,990,000           -  69
(b)  Components                11,950,000         16,390,000           +  37
(c)  Spare Part,                4,430,000          8,860,000           + 100
Component fotal           29,230,000         29,230,000               0
The principal reasons for the reallocation were to enable PR to concentrate
procurement where the needs were especially critical and to emphasize
procurement which could be accomplished most expeditiously in the short
remaining time before disbursements were terminated. Also, not all of the
funds that had been allocated to plant and machinery were required because
actual costs for many items were substantially lower than the cost estimates
for those items.
Implementation Schedule
3.05     On the planned project completion date of June 30, 1985, the only
component that had been virtually fnelly implemented was the electrification
study (Annex 1) while some 802 of the revenue spares had been procured. The
MIS component had not begun and the rfnaining components were only 15 - 20%
completed.
3.06     The locomotive maintenance improvement component was delayed by slow
action on the PC-1. Not until November 1984 was formal approval given for the
subcomponent on plant and machinery and not until December 1984 was approval
obtained on the subcomponent concerning procurements for the unit exchange
system. Although PR initiated the procurement process prior to PC-1 approval,
the entire procurement schedule was severely affected by the delay. By
mid-1985, only about 15% of the component was completed.
3.07     The containerization component was similarly affected by slow GOP
processing of the PC-1, which was not approved until October 1984;
nevertheless, some tendering was initiated earlier in anticipation of that
approval. By mid-1985, the component was only about 152 complete.
3.08     Implementation of the third major component, MIS, was to have begun
in January 1984, but was never initiated becatuse of a long delay in complet.on
of the telecommunications component of the Tench Railway Project on which it
wis dependent. The several causes of delay in execution of the telecommuni-
cations component were identified in the Project Completion Report on the
Tenth Railway Project.1'
-~'   South Asia Regional Office "Pro ect Completion Report: Pakistan Tenth
Railway Project (Credit 684-PAK and Loan 1372-PAK)" Report No. 5767,
June 28, 1985. (Distributed to Executive Directors, President et al on
July 30, 1985.)



- 7 -
3.09     Procurement of revenu- spares for locomotives was not conditional
upon approval of the Planning Commission and therefore orders could be placed
earlier than for other components. Ordering began in 1983 and, as of mid
1985, most of the original US$5 million allocated to this component had been
procured. Subseqiently, additional funds were allocated for this purpose, but
they were not utilized.
3.10     The implementation of the overseas training activity was to have
begun in 1982 with completion expected in 1985. In actuality, the training
was undertaken in the first half of 1986, after the closing date but before
the termination of disbursements. The reasons for the late start relate
largely to the causes of delay in implementation of ocher components (para
3.06). In contrast, the feasibility study of electrification on a main line
was begun on schedule but completed in September 1985, long after the May 1983
planned completion date, the longer elapsed time being attributable largely to
unanticipated difficulties in carrying out the study.
3.11     The Plan of Action called for various measures to be implemented by
specified time periods. In particular, the GOP/PR agreed to announce and
introduce by June 30, 1983 a general increase of at least 20X in the passenger
fares on second class service. This was not done and, a telex in April 1984
from the Associatior to GOP indicated that IDA support could not continue
unless various actions were taken including increasing passenger fares by 20%
by July 1, 1984. This was not done and the Assoc iation in a letter of
September 7, 1984, again emphasized the need for GOP to grant approval by
April 30, 1985. An inadequate 152 general fare increase in passenger and
freight rates was put into effect by PR on June 6, 1985 (para 5.05). The
actions taken with regard to implementation of other measures under the Plan
of Action are discussed below (para 4.07).
Reporting
3.12     PR provided the Association with quarterly progress reports on
implementation of the project and railway operations. The quality and timing
of these reports were satisfactory.
Procurement and Physical Implementation
(a) Locomotive Maintenance Improvement
3.13      The civil works element of the maintenance improvement component was
not implemented in its entirety. Fully completed were the cylinder
manufacturing shop and the miscellaneous component repair shop at Rawalpindi
as well as the extension of a traction motor rewinding shop at Moghalpura and
residential accommodations in two locations. At Rawalpindi, the miscellaneous
component repair shop was 80% completed, while the store for unit exchange
assemblies was only 157 completed, as of May 1987. Before the latter item can
be finished, a separate shed needs to be constructed.
3.14     A total of 73 items of plant and machinery were to be procured under
- .le maintenance improvement component.  As of May 1987, 45 of these items had
been received at a total cost of US$5.1 million, of which US$3.6 million was
foreign cost. Following the termination of disbursements in July 1986, the



railway used a small amount of alternative financing to carry out commitments
made under some of the then outstanding purchase orders. Notwithstanding this
effort, over half of the 73 items in the original procurement plan had not
been purchased as of May 1987. Under the project, procurements of plant and
machinery were based on international competitive bidding.
3.15     Components and assemblies for the maintenance improvement category of
the project had been procured as of May 1987, to the extent of US$20.9
million, of which US$13.2 million represented foreign cost. To carry on the
procurement after disbursements from the IDA credit terminated, .lternative
financing was again utilized. Virtually all of the components were purchased
on the basis of quotations from original manufacturers based on lists approved
by IDA.
3.16     Revenue spare parts were similarly purchased on the basis of
quotations from original manufacturers. As in the case of components, not all
of the spare parts on order when credit disbursements were terminated could be
delivered, although some of these parts were financed with alternative
financing. As of May 1987, expenditures on spare parts totalled US$6.8
million, of which US$4.9 million was foreign cost. Thus, the procurement fell
far short of the US$8.9 million revised allocation of the credit for this
category.
(b) Railway Container Operation Component
3.17     The civil works for expansion of the Lahore Dry Port have been
virtually (892) completed. The earth work, track rearrangements, drainage,
fire-fighting facilities, watchtower, and offices were finished but some work,
as of May 1987, remained to be done on the construction of import and export
sheds and a link road. Only 12% the 100 special wagons for transporting
containers had been built in May 1987; the materials for all 100 wagons had
been procured and the remaining 88 were to be completed by mid-1988. About
80. of the container handling equipment had been procured at that time. The
latter equipment was procured on the basis of ICB while the civil works were
undertaken by the PR and the materials for container wagons were procured
locally for use in PR manufacture.
(c) Management Information System
3.18     This component of the project was deleted because of delay in
completion of :he telecommunications system, a prerequisite for the MIS
(para 3.08).
Electrification Feasibility Study
3.19     The feasibility study for the possible electrification of the
Khanewal-Karachi railway line was initiated in October 1982 and the
consultants, Transmark (UK) and Saigols (PAKISTAN), submitted a draft final
report in mid-1983. Certain shortcomings were found in the report and a
supplemental study was required, particularly to analyze the economic
implications of incremental development of electrification. The supplemental
study was begun in July 1985 and the final report was submitted in November



- 9 -
1985. This report was acceptable to the Association and PR/GOP. Its
principal finding was that it would be economically feasible to develop
electrification of the 160 Km Khanewal-Samasatta line, and the PR plans to
initiate construction of that work, subject to availability of funds and GOP
approval.
Training
3.20     Not until the latter half of 1985 were significant steps taken toward
implementation of the training component. In September of that year PR sent
to the Association the first of a series of lists of proposed candidates for
overseas training. In December 1985, the Railway Board forwarded to the
Association training proposals from various organizations in the United
Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The Association approved both a list
of candidates and the proposed training program in British Railway and
Canadian Pacific; the overseas training began in.J'anuary 1986 with middle and
upper level management staff attending programs appropriate to individual
specialties. Sixty two persons were accommodated, each participating for
periods varying from two to four months. About 120 man-months of training
were involved which was approximately three times the 42 man-months planned.
Management staff consider the program to have been beneficial and expressed
interest in having more opportunities of this type. While the program was
originally intended, at least by the Bank, for middle level management staff,
a considerable number of the participants were high level staff, some
approaching retirement.
3.21     The overseas training was not begun until after the closing of the
credit. It was carried out between January and July 1986, a period during
which IDA continued to make disbursements from the credit. The principal
reason for the long delay in execution of this project element is that it was
designed essentially as part of the locomotive maintenance improvement
component and thus its implementation was affected by the problem of PC-1
approval already discussed (para 3.02).
3.22     In the technical assistance area, Transmark, consultants (UK),
undertook two studies in addition to the electrification study reviewed
above. One of the studies analyzed track machinery maintenance and the other
explored the stores and inventory control system; both reports made
recommendations for improvement in procedures and the reports were
satisfactory. The two studies did not begin until January 1986, i.e., after
the credit closing date, and were completed in June 1986.  Another study
undertaken by consultants under the project assisted PR in planning a
management information system.  Initiated early in 1986 by Canadian Pacific
Consulting Services, this study was completed in June 1986 and the report was
found to be satisfactory.
Proiect Cost
3.23     The total project e'ost estimated at appraisal was US$132.7 million
but because of the non- or under-implementation of most of the project
components, actual costs, as stiown in Annex 2 were much lower. Actual costs
as of May 1987 were US$42.2 million and included some costs incurred since the
termination of disbursements in July 1986. The difference between the
appraisal estimate and the actual cost is due to the shortfall in project
completion.



- 10 -
3.24     The MIS component, which was not implemented at all, accounted during
appraisal for US$13.4 million or ten percent of the total cost estimate. For
other components, the percentages of actual cost to appraisal cost, shown in
Annex 2, vary widely and indicate the extent of completion of the particular
components. Only in the case of unit exchange components for maintenance
improvements are the actual and appraisal costs approximately the same.
Expenditures on training was lower than the appraisal estimate mainly because
of the absence of local training costs. The electrification study cost little
more than a third of the estimate for that item.
3.25     Modification of the project, as indicated in para 3.03, shifted the
use of funds as between workshop installations at Rawalpindi and Moghalpura,
but did not have a significant effect on project costs. The reallocation of
credit funds among categories, as described in para 3.04, recognized that
appraisal estimates for plant and machinery items were high in relation to
actual costs.  While the funds available,for revenue spare parts were doubled
in the reallocation, which occurred ixmediately prior to the closing of the
credit, the increase did not result in larger foreign expenditures for spare
parts.
Financial Sources and Disbursement
3.26     Under the original IDA credit, the amount available to GOP/PR was
US$50 million but only US$25.7 million was actually disbursed. Of the US$42.2
million total project cost (to May 1987), the IDA creut of US$25.7 mullion
covered 61%. The remaining cost of US$16.5 million was provided by GOP.
3.27     Extremely small disbursements of the credit were made prior to June
30, 1984, as shown in Annex 3. Under the appraisal plan, US$27 million was to
have been disbursed at that time, but only US$200,000 had actually been
disbursed. At the planned project completion date, June 30, 1985, US$7.8
million had been disbursed, and when the credit was closed on December 31,
1985 the amount was US$13.0 million, about one-quarter of the total credit.
IDA denied a request for extension of the credit, but subsequently agreed to
honor applications for withdrawals from the credit for approximately six
months after closing. PR accelerated its procurement efforts in 1985 with a
view to withdrawing as much of the funds available as possible before
termination of disbursements. The final disbursement was made on July 25,
1986, raising the cumulative disbursements to US$25.7 million. Some US$23.3
million, or 47 percent of the US$50 million credit, was cancelled.
3.28     The causes of slow disbursements are because of tAe delays in
obtaining GOP/PR approval of the main project components (para 3.02).
Although there were some difficulties with PR/GOP processing of withdrawal
applications, due to insufficient experienced staff in the Railway Board,
those problems were a relatively minor cause of disbursement delays.
Performance of Consultants, Suppliers and Borrower
3.29     The consultants employed to carry out the electrification study,
Transmark (UK) and Saigols (Pakistan), were required to undertake a
supplementary study following their draft final report; the results in the end
were found acceptable. The quality of training provided to PR staff by
British Railways and Canadian Pacific Railway was found to be satisfactory to
the Bank and considered beneficial by PR management. No substantial problems



- 11 -
were experienced in dealings with suppliers although a large and costly
machine shipped from Italy was severely damaged in shipment requiring
replacement with much consequent delay; responsibility for the damage had not
been assigned but insurance covered the loss.
3.30     Performance of the Borrower in the physical implementation of project
components was less than satisfactory. GOP/PR should have either processed
the PC-1 documents more expeditiously (para 3.02) so as to permit timely
project implementation or should not have negotiated and signed the credit
agreement.
IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
Freight Traffic
4.01     At the time of appraisal, freight traffic was expected to increase
slightly at about 1% p.a. between FY 1981, when it was 7.9 billion TKM, and FY
1986 when it rose slightly to 8.3 billion TKM. The actual TKM for FY 1986 was
almost exactly as forecast but, as indicated in Annex 4, followed an erratic
path in the interim, falling sharply in FY 1982 and rising almost as
dramatically in FY 1986. In terms of tons of freight loaded, the pattern was
much the same. The average length of haul was the same in FY 1986 as in FY
1981. The lack of significant growth in railway freight traffic does not mean
that the economy was stagnant during recent years but rather that the railway
was losing ground to competing transport in the haulage of the nation's
freight.
4.02     A number of factors explain the lack of steady growth in railway
freight traffic. One of these causal factors has been the failure of the
railway staff .o adapt its policies and practices to the developing
competitive situation in which PR's competitors, especially truck operators,
aggressively pursue the available traffic. The railway's organization and
management system has not been conducive to either efficient operations or the
provision of high quality services that are responsive to shipper needs and
desires. Severe problems with locomotive maintenance have been particularly
damaging to reliable, high quality freight services. Failure to implement
fully, as planned, the Eleventh Railway Project limited the alleviation of
some of PR's major constraints on traffic growth.
4.03     The railway which once strongly dominated modern transport in
Pakistan, has seen its role shrink to the point where it handles less freight
traffic than highway transport.  Yet the role of the railway continues to be
fundamentally important to the economy. PR has substantial potential for
increasing its participation in the total movement of freight. Realization of
that potential, however, will require reorganization of the railway and an
improved management system. Also, the PR must gear itself to handle
containers expeditiously and on competitive terms. Moreover, much improvement
will be needed in locomotive maintenance to improve operations and the
reliability of freight services.



- 12 -
Passenger Traffic
4.04     Appraisal forecasts of passenger traffic were somewhat more
optimistic than forecasts of freight traffic. Passenger kilometers (PKM) were
expected to increase at 2 to 3% p.a. from 16.4 billion in FY 1981 to 18.7
billion in FY 1986, as shown in Annex 5. Actual PKM in FY 1986 were 16.9
billion, or about 10% lower than forecast and at virtually the same level as
in FY 1981. Traffic has subsequently increased to 18.0 billion PKM in FY88.
The number of passengers carried by PR fell by 422 between 1981 and 1986, as
the railway lost substantial numbers of short-haul passengers to highway
transport. Accordingly, the average distance travelled by rail passengers
increased from 133 km to 203 km between FY 1981 and FY 1986.
4.05     The reason for the loss of much short-haul passenger traffic is that
branch line and stopping train services are uncompetitive with modern road
transport.  Another cause of the low passenger traffic in FY 1986 was the'
elimination of some uneconomic passenger services. also an action required for
improvement of financial performance.
4.06     Rail passenger service is a major part of the PR's business and will
undoubtedly continue to be so. In fact, the railways have given undue
preference to passenger services over freight services in the use of
locomotives and in other ways. In any caze, PR has an important role to play
in the movement of passengers although it is likely to experience competitive
problems similar to those in other countries, namely, that bus operators
capture much of the short-haul traffic while airlines increase their
participation in the movement of long-distance passenger transport.
Operating Performance
4.07     A key element in the Plan of Action included in the Eleventh Railway
Project was the establishment of a set of operational targets to be achieved
during project implementation. Annex 6 shows the appraisal targets for the
years 1982 through 1985 and certain revisions of the 1985 targets proposed
during a Bank supervision mission in July 1984, to allow for the lack of
progress in the project components. For most indicators, the revised targets
were liberalized at that time in the sense that the new objectives were more
easily attainable than the original targets. For example, the overall
availablity of diesel locomotives as a percentage of the total fleet of such
locomotives was originally to increase gradually from 83% in 1982 to 882 in
1985. In July 1984, the target for 1985 was reduced to 85X. In 1986, the
actual 84.4% level achieved was still short of both the original and the
revised targets set for 1985.
4.08     Problems in locomotive maintenance have been particularly severe in
recent years with adverse consequences for operational performance and
reliability of service. One of the few positive indications, as shown in
Anrax 6, is that in 1986 the percentage of diesel locomotives out of service
soecifically because of lack of spares had been reduced to 2.26X, a figure
better than the revised 1985 target. On the negative side, the number of
traction motorL aboard locomotives not working was 300, or double the number
in the revised 1985 target and many times larger than the original target for
that year. The diesel locomotive downtime during scheduled heavy repairs
remained above both the original and revised targets for 1985.



- 13 -
4.09     With regard to freight train operations, all three revised 1985
targets were achieved ir. 1986 but the original targets had not been attained.
4.10     Various operating indicators are presented in Annex 7 with the
results shown for the fiscal years 1981-1986. Average freight train speeds
show no improvement. Wagons per train rose sightly and net load per freight
train increased 9% in the period. Turnaround time for wagons rose from 15 to
18 days.
4.11     One of the requirements of the Plan of Action was that PR eliminate
uneconomical passenger trains at the rate of 2 to 3 per month beginning in
July 1982. The PR cancelled 18 passenger services in 1982, 4 each in 1983 and
1984, 8 in 1985 and 27 in 1986. Other suburban passenger services were
eliminated and trains were dropped on various days for certain additional
services. Some 143.passenger train stops had been eliminated by Apri.l 1986.
Locomotives have been diverted from poorly patronized trains or sections to
more remunerative sections.
4.12     Had the Eleventh Railway Project been fully implemented as scheduled,
the operational performance of PR would no doubt have been better than the
actual result. A completed locomotive maintenance improvement component would
have been a particularly helpful in view of the critical problem of poor
maintenance of the locomotive fleet.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Net Operating Revenue
5.01     Appraisal forecasts of net operating income anticipated a loss of
Rs 485 million in FY 1982 followed by a surplus Rs 232 million in FY 1983 and
growing surpluses in subsequent years, as inl1icated in Annex 8. In FY 1986,
the surplus was expected to reach Rs 711 million. Realization of these
optimistic financial forecasts, according to the Staff Appraisal Report, would
depend largely on significant increases in railway freight traffic and
sizeable increases in passenger fares.
5.02     Actual financial results during the 1983-1986 period were far short
of the forecasts. Large net operating losses were incurred *n each fiscal
year 1982-1986, growing rapidly from Rs 224 million FY 1982 to an
unprecedented Rs 817 million in FY 1985, then moderating somewhat to a loss of
Rs 479 million in 1986. Between FY 1982 and FY 1985, operating expenses
increased by 362 while operating revenue rose only 212 as PR postponed needed
passenger fare increases.
5.03     The primary reason that the financial results fell so far short of
the forecast was that the PR failed to act quickly and adequately in raising
passenger fares on reducing costs of providing passenger services. In FY
1986, the loss reduction from the preceeding year occurred mainly because of a
sizeable increase in freight traffic in FY 1986 and the introduction of a 15%
general fare increase on June 6, 1985. Operating losses were also influenced
to some extent by increases in appropriations to the depreciation reserve
which rose more than had been anticipated in the forecasts.



- 14 -
5.04     Appraisal forecasts show a relatively poor operating ratio of 1162 in
FY 1982, then falling sharply to 94% ia FY 1983 and to still more satisfactory
levels in subsequent years. The actual operating ratio rose from 1072 in
FY 1982 to 122% in FY 1985, then fell to 111% in the following year. The
reasons for the adverse trend in the actual operating ratios experienced by PR
are to be found mainly in the failure of the PR to take timely steps to
increase revenue, as noted above (para 5.04).
Rates and Fares
5.05     Financial covenants 2n the Credit Agreement, summarized in Annex 9,
required GOP/PD, inter-alia, Li take measures satisfactory to the Association,
to enable PR to earn revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt
service requirements. In carrying out this measure, GOP agreed in the Plan of
Action to announce increases in rates/fares no later than June 30, 1983.. One
action required was a substantial general increase in passenger fares but
GOP/PR failed to act in 1983. Bank missions and communications reminded
GOP/PR frequently of the urgency of action on this issue. Not until June 1985
did the PR introduce a general passenger fare increase, two years later than
had been originally agreed. Moreover, only a 15% fare increase was introduced
at that time despite the Association's repeated insistence that PR needed at
least a 20% increase on second class passenger service, the class of service
yielding by far the largest amount of passenger revenue.
5.06     The basic reason for GOP's reluctance to raise passenger fares has
been the fear of widespread public criticism of such action and consequent
political reaction. GOP successfully opposed general fare increases during
the period from 1980 to 1985 even though PR's financial condition was
deteriorating sharply9 as noted above. Regrettably, the longer fare increases
are postponed the more difficult it becomes during inflationary times to make
the necessary fare adjustments, because the size of the increase required
rises while the travelling public comes to believe that stable fares are a
permanent feature of railway policy.
5.07     The insufficient action on fare increases meant that the borrower did
not comply with the financial covenant of Section 4.03. If PR continues to
have difficulty obtaining GOP permission to charge compensatory fares for
passenger services, the railways would be well advised to concentrate more of
their resources on freight transport because the financial potential of
freight traffic on PR is generally greater than that for passenger traffic and
because it is generally easier to adjust freight tariffs for cost increases.
5.08     In addition to the financial covenant of Section 4.03 relating to
PR's overall pricing structure, Section 4.04(a) required that revenues from
passenger services as a minimum cover the variable costs of such services. As
cf mid-1986, while mail/express trains met this test, other passenger services
did not. Section 4.04(D) required that steps be taken to assure that fares of
air conditioned sleeping coach services at least cover the total cost of such
services; the 15% general increase of July 1985 which was applicable to this
class of service as well as others was not sufficient to cover total cost of
the service, ind the railway concluded that any further increase would reduce
patronage, t' ss reducing rather than increasing revenue.



- 15 -
Elimination of Uneconomic Services
5.09     Under Section 3.09 of the Credit Agreement, the borrower was to cause
PR to carry out a Plan of Action, the details of which were agreed between the
Association and PR. Among the various actions required was the elimination of
uneconomic and underused passenger trains. In response, PR eliminated a few
of these services but, according to PR, pressure from politicians made it
necessary early in 1987 to discontinue, for a time, the cancellation of
further uneconomic services.
5.10     A railway costing study undertaken in the latter part of 1985 has
permitted an analysis of the costs and revenues of different types of
passenger services for FY86:
Revenue     X of
Type of Passenger                              as X.       Pass.
Service           Cost      Revenue      of Cost     Train
(Rs/PKM)   (Rs/PKM)                   KM
Express               0.085     0.097         114         46
Ordinary              0.592     0.080          14          51
Commuter              0.226     0.030          13           3
Thus while revenues from express services more than cover the cost of such
services, revenues from ordinary and commuter passenger service cover only a
small fraction of the related costs. Had such an analysis been available
earlier, the Plan of Action (provided for under Section 3.09 of the Credit
Agreement) requiring at least a 202 increase in passenger fares, and the
elimination of uneconomic passenger trains could have been modified. In view
of road competitior., it would be inefficient to expect express passengers to
subsidize ordinary and commuter passengers. On the other, raising ordinary
and commuter fares the seven to eight fold needed to cover their costs was
hardly practical. Thus, whereas the fares for express services should be
required to cover costs, for other services the options are to either
undertake a phased program of withdrawal or for GOP to directly reimburse PR
for losses incurred on those non-commercial unprofitable services that GOP
wished to continue for political or social reasons. Discussions with PR/GOP
during 1987/88 in context of a possible Transport Sector Adjustment Loan, have
generated a better understanding of such an approach and this is now likely to
be adopted.
VI. INSTTUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01     Among the strengths of the Pakistan Railways organization are the
many highly experienced staff who have developed their skills over long
periods of service with the railways. The system is large and complex
requiring diverse technical specialists as well as managers capable of
integrating the activities of a wide variety of operating units. Highly
experienced staff are indispensable for efficient operation of such an
elaborate system. Wl.ile spr-e staff undoubtedly have substandard capabilities,
many are very competent in their jobs and they constitute an invaluable
resource on whict, to build a belter and more efficient organization.



- 16 -
6.02     The effectiveness of a workforce depends heavily on how it is
organized and there is no doubt that PR needs much improvement in this
regard. For example, there are too many managers reporting directly to the
General Manager. Also, the Railway Board does not confine itself to broad
policy matters but involves itself unduly in activities such as procurement
that should be the responsibility of the General Manager. The entire outmoded
organizational structure needs to be substantially modified and management
needs to be assisted by a computer-based management information system. PR
management should have more authority over such vital matters as adjustment of
rates and fares. Also, there is need for mote commercial orientation of
managerial and operational personnel, particularly of those staff who deal
directly with the shipping and travelling publLic.
6.03     A study of the PR's organization and management was completed in
early 1987 by the Canadian Pacific Consultants Service. Many recommendations
for improvement were presented in the report. Subsequently the Bank, at GOP's
request, in April 1988 examined the need for institutional, managerial and
financial restructuring. The Bank's report was well received and a draft
Presidential Order which adopted most of the key measures identified in the
Bank's report, is awaiting Cabinet approval.
6.04     Institutional problems of major importance were evident in carrying
out the Eleventh Railway Project. After agreeing to the project appraisal and
signing the Credit Agreement, the Railway Board and the Planning Commission
spent two years reviewing project components and approving the PC-1 documents
(para. 3.02).
Staff Development
6.05     In mid-1986. PR had a total staff of 128,047, and thus was the
largest public sector employer in Pakistan. Among the measures that were to
be taken by PR under the Plan of Action for the project was that of reducing
the number of non-professional and unskilled staff through attrition. During
the period from FY 1982 to FY 1986, traffic increased somewhat while the staff
size declined as follows:
FY 1982       FY 1986           Change
Ton-kilometers (billion)             7.1            8.3             +172
Passenger-kilometers (billion)    16.5             16.8             + 2%
Total Staff (thousand)             130.0          128.0             - 2Z
Thus some progress was achieved in reducng staff despite a rise in traffic.
Nonetheless, substantial overstaffing remains.
6.06     The Directorate of Research and Training, Pakistan Railway, was
established in May 1983 by integrating four independent training
institutions. In 1986, technical training was provided to 1,489 personnel at
the Walton facility in Lahore; artisan and supervisory training was given in
Karachi and at the workshops in Lahore and Rawalpindi. Under the project,
overseas training of 62 managerial and technical staff was undertaken in
British Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway (para 3.20).

VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01     The locomotive maintenance improvement component of the project was
expected to result in a substantial increase in the availability of diesel
locomotives. Specifically, the 83% availability of such locomotives at the
time of appraisal was expected to rise to 88% upon completion of the project
which wiuld be equivalent to adding 24 diesel locomotives to the fleet.
Approximately the same amount of benefits was expected from increasing the
tractive effort of existing locomotives.
7.02     In actuality, the availablity of diesel locomotives, according to
1986 data, increased only marginally to 84% and therefore only a fraction of
the antic4pated benefits based on this factor were realized. With regard to
the tractive effort of locomotives, the situation actually deteriorated since
the number of electric motors not working increased from 250 at time of
appraisal to 300 in 1986. The fact that this component has not been fully
implemented accounts in large part for the minor benefits realized. Benefits
from plant and machinery procured but not yet fully operational will increase
somewhat in the near future.
7.03     The railway container operations component was designed to enable the
PR to handle a large number of containers be -en Karachi and Lahore,
sufficient to operate one container train a week beginning in 1985 and rising
gradually to one such train a day four years later. In FY 1986, some 12,000
TEU of containers were expected to be handled on the railway, or 15% of the
total container traffic then forecast to be available. Benefits for the rail
haul were expected to be derived from savings in rail transport costs compared
with trucking costs, reduced pilferage ind damage to freight, reduced shipping
rates and lower packaging costs.
7.04     Actual benefits from railway container operations have been much less
than planned. The number of TEUs transported by the railways in FY 1986 was
only 2,174, and less than 1% of the total TEUs available. Assuming the
savings factors for particular types of benefits are realistic, the small
volume of container traffic on the railways indicates that the overall
benefits from this component were only a small proportion of the benefits
forecast. Implementation of this component, of course, was incomplete; the
failure to build 88% of the planned container wagons limited the growth of
container traffic on PR but an even greater constraint was PR's lack of
rigorous marketing of container services in Karachi port.
7.05     Whether the partially implemented locomotive maintenance improvement
and railway container operation components will be completed or not is
uncertain. PR management in May 1987 expressed its intention to do so but its
ability to carry out remaining activities depends on the availability of
financing. Even if full project implementation is achieved over the next year
or two, the long delay will probably result in a low overall economic rate of
return. According to the Staff Appraisal Report, a two year delay in project
implementation would result in a 10% ERR and a three or four year delay would
reduce the ERR substantially below that level.
7.06     Economic rates of return were calculated in the Staff Appraisal
Report for two elements of the project: (i) 172 for the combination of the
locomotive maintenance improvement, MIS and technical assistance and training;



- 18 -
and (ii) 29% for the railway container component. Annex 10 shows that, in view
of the low benefits actually realized, neither of these project elements has
an adequate ERR. As previously pointed out, the MIS component was not
implemented. The locomotive maintenance improvement component has a negative
ERR while the railway container component has a low of 4.42 ERR. Overall,
given that the components as appraised were either not implemented or only
partially completed the project yields a negative ERR.
VIII. ASSOCIATION PERFORMANCE
8.01     During project preparation in 1980-82, the need for the railway
management to respond to the challenge of road competition was identified.
The Association felt that further project assistance would provide an
opportunity to have a continuing dialogue with railway management on how they
were to adjust to this challenge. Adjustment would require increased
efficiency of operations through operating improvements, through improving
locomotive reliability and utilization, and through adopting modern management
techniques. The railway also needed to develop new services including moving
containers between Karachi and Lahore. These items were discussed during
preparation and the project components carefully prepared over a two year
period together with the needed operation improvements and financial changes.
8.02     The selection of high-priority components for inclusion in the effort
were sound. Locomotive maintenance was, at the time of appraisal and remains
a critical problem area and the project approach to alleviating the
maintenance constraints on locomotive availability was appropriate. Also
container operations represent a traffic growth opportunity of major
proportions for PR and it was reasonable to assist the railway in gearing up
for that trxffic. Similarly, the introduction of a management information
system is o:xe of the best possible measures for improving railway management
and thus warranted inclusion in the project. In addition the project included
covenants covering financial and operational measures needed for the railway
to make adjustment to a competitive transport environment.
8.03     Project implementation suffered from various factors.  Perhaps the
most important is that, despite the Pakistan's Fitth Development Plan (1983/84
- 1987/88) proposing a change in the railways role, it was only in 1985 that
the Railway Board's perception of PR's role began to change from their earlier
view that it was a public carrier whose primary duty was to provide
inexpensive passenger transport. Also during 1982-84 railway management was
in a state of flux with frequent personnel changes in senior positions. Thus,
during the critical start up period for the project in 1982 and 1983, railway
management did not g4ve priority to the project either to meeting the
financial or operati1onal covenants or to expeditiously processing the PC-l's.
Indeed the Railway Board gave priority during 1982-84 to acquisition of
locomotives and construction of a locomotive manufacturing plant. With regard
to the MIS component, neither the Association nor anyone else could have
foreseen the difficulties and delays that developed in installing the
telcommunications facilities which were a prerequisite for the MIS.
8.04     Credit covenants, including side letters, focussed on the operational
and financial measures needed for the railway to begin adjusting to the
competitive transport environment. The two year delay in revising tariffs or
to obtain direct GOP payments for those non-commercial services that could not



- 19 -
be withdrawn, was thus a major failure to address PR's deteriorating financial
performance, a critical element in the adjustment. Similarly PR's failure to
address seriously the need for operating improvements and modification of
services meant that the project's objectives could not be met.
8.05     Beginning in April 1984 the Association alerted PR and GOP to the
above failures in a series of communications, which stated that continued IDA
support was only possible if financial and operating improvement actions were
taken. Following an April 1984 supervision mission, the South Asia Director
informed GOP that IDA support for the project could not continue unless the
following corrective measures were taken:
(i) By July 1, 1984 passenger fare increase of 20%;
(ii) By August 15, 1984 acceptable program to meet operational
targets;
(iii) By July 1, 1984 approval of all PC-ls except MIS component.
In a June 1984 internal Association review, senior management (SVPOP) strongly
indicated that cancellation would be fully justified if an acceptable plan of
action for improving railway operations and finances were not put forward by
PR/GOP.
8.06     The July 1984 supervision mission noted that little progress had been
made and the South Asia VP wrote to the Secretary of Finance reiterating the
Association's concerns, and stating that for IDA support to continue, action
was needed by November 1984 on:
(i)  Approval of PC-l's except MIS component; and
(ii)  ?repar-tion of an acceptable list of dated action covenants
required to meet objectives of the Action Plan and the revised
operational targets.
By the end of November 1984, the PC-l's were approved but no progress was made
on the other matters and GOP was informed of the need for progress on them.
Correspondence continued in early 1985 asking for the list of dated actions.
The May/June 1985 supervision mission informed GOP that any consideration of a
request for an extension of the project would focus on operational
improvements. Also although GOP had proposed a 23% fare increase with effect
from June 1985, th* increase was reduced to only 152.  After many years of
inaction such an increase was considered inadequate. The Association again
as'ed for an Action Plan to be received by July 31, 1985 and one was finally
sei.. on August 11, 1985.
8.07     The September 1985 supervision mission found that financial
performance was inadequate, and that although there was some improvement in
operations, there were deficiencies in certain key areas. The mission
recommended, that based on non-compliance and PR/GOP's inability to provide a
satisfactory Action Plan, the closing date remain at December 31, 1985. The
Association thus had no option but to decline to extend the closing date since
it had become quite clear that the overall project objectives of assisting PR
to adjust to road competition were not being met.



- 20 -
8.08     Officials of PR and the Ministry of Railways as well as other
interested agencies of GOP were disappointed that IDA did not extend the
Credit beyond the December 31, 1985 closing date. These officials felt that
such an extension was warranted and in the best interests of all the concerned
parties. They noted that extensions had been granted in preceding projects
and that such action had permitted completion of those projects.
Nevertheless, the Bank's decision not to extend the credit, despite half the
funds being undisbursed, has subsequently had a powerful effect in getting the
message acrnss to GOP and PR that unless the railway begins a serious attempt
to adjust to the competitive transport environment, it would have little place
in Pakistan's future transport system and that investments in the railway
would be futile without such adjustment. During 1986-88 the Bank has had an
extensive dialogue with PR and GOP on railway restructuring in the context of
a possible Transport Sector Adjustment Loan, and there is now a greater
awareness within both PR and GOP of the need for the railway to adjust.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The project was well-conceived, concentrating on high priority needs
of PR, but suffered on account of factors which had nothing to do with its
design or objectives. In retrospect the Association was over-optimistic about
how quickly the railway management could begin to respond to the challenge of
road competition. As such, it might have been better to delay appraisal until
it was clear that the Railway Board understood the need for adjustment and was
willing to take appropriate measures. Indeed the latter is now occurring and
the project components will, belatedly, play an important role in assisting
the railway to make the adjustment.
9.02     As regards implementation of the major project components, had the
necessary PC-1 documents been approved before project effectiveness the
results would have been more satisfactory. The principal lesson learned from
this experience is that such approval should be a prerequisite for project
effectiveness. This lesson was taken into account during preparations for the
FY87 Fourth Highway Project.
9.03     Compliance with certain covenants in the Credit Agreement was too
little and too late. Some of the requirements of the covenants and the Plan
of Action called for measures, such as increasing fares and eliminating
uneconomic passenger services, that invited reaction from local politicians.
These measures were essential, however, given the rapidly growing deficit and
need for financial discipline.
