MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RLCONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROpOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A BEIJING-TIANJIN-TANGGU EXPRESSWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan and credit to the People's Republic of China to help finance a
Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway Project. The loan for US$25.0 million would
have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with standard variable
interest rate. The credit for SDR 98.9 million (US$125.0 million equivalent)
would be on standard IDA terms.
2.        Background.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed
by the pace of recent economic development, and capacity constraints are
evident in all modes. The most serious transport need is for dramatically
expanded road capacity, especially in rural areas where increased agricultural
and small-scale industrial production have created an urgent demand for better
farm-to-market transport services. Road transport will also face a growing
share of the demand for passenger transporation from the increasingly mobile
population. In the railway subsector, the network capacity has severely
hampered delivery of energy supplies (i.e. coal), and even with recently
initiated investments in rail line electrification and new line  ^- -truction,
it will take s-veral years to alleviate bottlenecks between major mining areas
ard coastal cities. China also needs to substantially expand its port and
waterways facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade caused
by inadequate berth capacity and container handling capacity. China's Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes all these sectoral needs. By the end of
the plan period, freight traffic is projected to be 45% higher than in 1985,
and passenger traffic 60% higher, with a disproportionately greater share of
the increase falling on road transport. To meet these needs, substantial
investments are envisioned, especially in highway network expansion, new rail
lines, double-tracking and electrification of existing lines, and more berths
at coastal ports. The Plan also proposes to secure efficiency gains in trans-
portation from operational improvements; these include the development of
integrated transportation networks, in particular for coal transportation and
for import/export trade, and technological improvements such as container
handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. To facilitate these
developments, the Plan envisions significant institutional changes in the
sector, including an extension of the policy of separating the functions of
Government from those of operating enterprises and delegating authority to
local managements. The Bank fully subscribes to the Government's objectives
for development of the transport sector and is supporting its initiatives with
financial and technical assistance. Three railway projects (Loans 2394-CHA,
2540-CHA and 2678-CHA, and Credit 1680-CHA) are assisting the expansion of
capacity on key routes and the manufacture of electric locomotives, passenger
coaches and signalling equipment. Two port projects (Loans 2207-CHA and
2689-CHA) will effect improvements at Tianjin, Shanghai, and Huangpu Ports.



-2-
The first Bank Group financed highway project in China (Loan 2539-CHA and
Credit 1594-CHA) involves the construction and improvement of national and
rural roads.
3.        Road freight transport ircreased by about 18% p.a. from 76.4 billion
ton-km in 1980 to 177.0 billion ton-km in 1985. Road passenger transport
increased by 16%p.a. over the same period from 73 billion passenger km to
154 billion passenger km. Road traffic is growing at a rate as high as 18-19%
ahnually in the vicinity of some major cities where road congestion is already
a serious problem. The Seventh Five-Year investment plan for the highway
subsector is to upgrade at least 80,000 km of existing road, and to construct
about 60,000 km of new road of which 1,580 km will be expressway or Ciass One
standard road. The proposed 142 km Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway is part
of the plan for high standard road investment. There is also an urgent need
for more modern techniques in the planning, design, construction and mainte-
nance of roads. The first Bank Group financed operation in the highway
subsector in China, which is progressing satisfactorily, is supporting the
Government's policy and institutional objectives related to (a) modernizing
highway design, including updating and improving construction and material
specifications; (b) increasing the cost effectiveness of highway investments
by improving economic evaluation techniques for road investments and support-
ing the move to competitive bidding for civil works; (c) supporting the high-
way research program, including studies on pavement evaluation, strengthening,
rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing paved road network, road
capacity in congested areas, and road safety; and (d) staff training.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project aims to assist the
Government in meeting the road transport demand in one of the most important
corridors in China, and increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
the subsector. Specific policy, institutional and technological objectives to
be addressed by the project would be: (a) the identification of the most
appropriate method of financing roadworks; (b) examining the economic and
financial efficiency of tolling; (c) introduction of improved road planning
techniques; (d) assistance in research to upgrade the quality of local bitumen
to be used for road paving; (e) assistance in identifying the appropriate type
of organization for operation and maintenance of the expressway; (f) staff
training; and (g) continued assistance (started in the first Highway Project)
to modernize design, construction and materials specifications and contract
documentation.
5.        Project Description.  The project would be carried out under the
overall responsibility of the Ministry of Communications (HOC) with an
expressway company, formed by the two municipalities and one province in which
the expressway will be located, responsible for supervision of the expressway
construction. The project would include: (a) construction of a 142 km, four-
lane divided, controlled access, tolled expressway connecting Beijing and
Tianjin with the new port of Xingang at Tanggu, as well as two connecting
roads (12 km); (b) consultants' services to help train the MOC's and the
expressway company's staff in the supervision and quality control of construc-
tion; (c) provision of road maintenance, operation and traffic monitoring
equipment for the expressway; (d) assistance, through the provision of equip-
ment and expertise, in improving road planning by setting up a computerized



-3-
road data bank; (e) studies on (i) the method of financing the expansion,
improvement and rehabilitation of China's highway network, (ii) the appro-
priate organization for operation and maintenance of the expressway upon
completion, and (iii) the potential for using local bitumen for road pave-
ments; and (f) training of staff from MOC's Highway Bureau and the Provincial
Highway Bureaus, in the area of transport planning and other highway and
transport-related topics.
6.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Government is seeking Bank Group help in
removing the transport bottlenecks impeding economic growth. The Seventh
Five-Year Plan recognizes the need to expand and improve the highway system,
moderrize the planning, construction and maintenance of highways, expand and
improve road transport and set up improved strengthened institutions capable
of managing a modern highway system and road transport industry. The present
relatively low level of highway network development in China allows the appli-
cation of the concept of intermodal planning or modal complementarity in
important transport corridors. The design and construction of the first
expressway in China will introduce important new technology. The Bank's
involvement in the highway subsector under the first project, and particularly
in policy, institutional and techuical matters aims at helping to modernize
the subsector by bringing the Bank's experience to bear on the problems and by
expediting the introduction of advanced technology to solve them. The
proposed project would provide continued support to the Government in these
matters and would encompass new tasks involved with the financing, management
and operation of China's first tolled expressway.
7.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions: (a) to establish before the completion of construction and in
consultation with the Bank Group, an expressway operating organization which
would include a special monitoring group to carry out the monitoring work
agreed with the Bank Group; (b) to take all steps necessary to ensure that the
two principal connecting roads (7.5 km and 4.5 km in length) would be open to
traffic upon completion of the expressway; (c) to carry out the three studies
in accordance with the terms of reference and timing agreed with the Bank
Group and thereafter to exchange views with the Bank Group on the studies and
implement the agreed recommendations; (d) to carry out a training program
acceptable to the Bank Group; (e) to ensure that the toll rates would not
exceed 30 percent of the estimated vehicle operating cost savings (an under-
standing was also reached on the method of calculating vehicle operating costs
which would be refined jointly by MOC and the Bank prior to the opening of the
expressway); and (f) as a condition of effectiveness, to enter into a project
implementation agreement among MOC, the two municipalities and one province.
8.        Justification.  Transport demand in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu
corridor currently far exceeds capacity and is expected to grow very rapidly
in the next decade due to the expansion of the Tanggu port to accommodate
increases in foreign trade and investment, the opening up of market activity,
urban expansion and the overall rapid growth of the national economy. There
is thus an urgent need to expand road and railway capacity in the corridor and
to ensure that the two modes are used in the most cost effective manner.
Based on origin-destination surveys conducted in the corridor, the expressway
will cater to short- and medium-haul traffic, freeing the rail system to



-4-
increasingly supply the long-haul demand, which is also consistent with the
Government's recent policy to use rail primarily for long distance traffic.
The principal benefits accruing to users of the expressway would be savings in
vehicle operating costs and reduction in accidents. The comparision of
benefits and costs yields an economic rate of return of aDproximately 15
percent. In comparison to non-tolled highways, there are additional costs (of
tolling facilities and their operation) and potentials for lost benefits
(particularly in the early years) on toll roads as some operators will prefer
the higher vehicle operating costs on local (untolled) roads to paying the
tolls. Experience gained through the expressway monitoring unit will refine
understanding of this critical relationship. However, based on Bank Group
studies and experience elsewhere in the world, a toll set no higher than about
30% of attributable vehicle operating cost savings would likely result in a
traffic diversion not greater than about 15% (on which basis the economic rate
of return would still be at an acceptable level of 13%) and produce revenues
sufficient to cover at least the operation and maintenance costs of the
expressway. Based on sensitivity analysis, the project would remain viable
should costs exceed estimates by 10% or benefits be reduced by 10%, or for
combinations of higher cost/lower benefit in the 10% range.
9.        Risks.  Aside from the possible risks of having costs exceed
estimates and/or benefits reduced by 10% (discussed in the preceding
paragraph), a principal risk would be a substantial delay in the completion of
the expressway. The project seeks to deal with these risks by providing
special assistance in procurement and training of construction supervisory
engineers. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project with a one-year delay
in expressway completion would remain viable.
10. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and credit.
