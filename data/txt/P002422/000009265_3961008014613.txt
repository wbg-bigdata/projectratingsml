MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE
FOR AN INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development Credit to the Republic of Sierra Leone for SDR13.6 million, the
equivalent of US$20.0 million, on standard International Development Association (IDA) terms,
with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project aimed at supporting the Govemment's
reform of the health sector based on its National Health Action Plan (NHAP). The NHAP has
attracted significant co-financing, mostly on a grant basis, from a number of bilateral and
multilateral donors.
2.    Country and sector background. With an annual per capita GNP of only US$150
(1993), Sierra Leone is classified as one of the poorest and "least-developed" countries in the
world. After negligible growth in the 1970s, the country's economic performance deteriorated
sharply in the 1980s, coinciding with the Bank's five-year suspension of activities in the country.
Faced with limited resources, the Govemment of Sierra Leone (GOSL), with assistance from the
Bank and the IMF, embarked on an ambitious structural adjustment program (SAP) in late 1989,
aimed at economic stabilization and creation of conditions for sustained economic growth and
reduction of poverty. As stated in its Policy Framework Paper, increased public investment in
social sectors-particularly for health care and basic education-is a central part of the GOSL
adjustment program and development strategy.
3.    Since 1991, Sierra Leone has been plagued by civil unrest in the form of a hit and run
campaign against the public. This has caused a large-scale population movement to safer areas,
in particular, the Westem Area and Freetown. The security situation has put additional strain on
an already weak public health system, by disrupting the provision of health services in the
affected districts and by increasing demand for health services in the safe areas. The GOSL, in
parallel to its military efforts, is making increasing efforts to reach a negotiated solution.
Moreover, the Govemment has confirmed its commitment to democratization by announcing
elections for early 1996.
4.    The dire health conditions in Sierra Leone indicate that the health transition has hardly
begun in the country. Life expectancy is only 39 years, the lowest in the world. More than one
child in four dies before the age of five, and adults have the second highest mortality in the world
(World Development Report, 1995). The nutritional situation has changed little over the last ten
years; about one-third of children under five are underweight, and about two-thirds of pregnant
women have iron deficiency anemia. The population of 4.7 million is growing at approximately
2.6 percent per year, with the total fertility rate estimated at 6.5. Infectious diseases such as
pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and tuberculosis are the main causes of morbidity and mortality,
while new diseases, such as tobacco-related conditions and the human immunodeficiency virus,
are emerging threats (about 2.6 percent of blood donors in Freetown were HIV positive, in 1994).
Underlying the poor health status of the population are low levels of literacy and basic education,
particularly among women, limited access to clean water and sanitation, and social disruption and



2
disorganization-each helping to perpetuate a cycle of poverty, illness, high fertility, and
premature death.
5.    Until very recently, the health sector was doing very litde to improve the lives of most
Sierra Leoneans. Few resources were provided to the health sector, and many were
misallocated-in part, because there were limited skills in the DOH, and there was no system for
matching resources with sector priorities. The near absence of responsibility and accountability
within the DOH contributed to the breakdown in public services. At the same time, private
services were inaccessible to the majority of the population and were of variable quality. This
situation resulted in: (a) disconnection between peripheral and central levels of health care
delivery as well as neglect of the former; (b) an inability to regulate the defacto, parallel private
health care system that was operating within the public sector; (c) inefficiencies in use of scarce
resources; (d) disincentives for good performance emerging from poor wage, and absence of non-
wage incentives for health personnel; (e) inadequate planning for human resources development;
and (f) a complete lack of maintenance and repair of physical facilities and equipment. For the
last ten years, with the exception of the more privileged few, Sierra Leoneans did without
modem health care.
6.    Recognizing the chaotic state of health care in Sierra Leone, the DOH began a series of
public discussions on the problems of the health sector in 1992. This led to the development of a
National Health Policy in 1993, which focuses on making low-cost, basic, preventive and
curative health care available throughout the country. Using widespread consultation and a broad
participative approach, the sector policy and NHAP were developed to set up sector priorities, to
provide the framework for health sector reform, and to oudine its overall costs. At the Social
Sector Round Table (SSRT) in May 1994, the NHAP was presented to the donor community, and
a core program based on a sharper prioritization of the NHAP was agreed upon as the basis for
future cooperation during the period 1996-2000. This participative process continued and, in
October 1995, Govemment held another consultation with donors and NGOs, and presented its
social sectors' activity plans and budgets for the next fiscal year. At this meeting, donors
confirmed their willingness to support the core program of the NHAP, and pledged substantial
financial support-thus enabling Government to effectively start its implementation in 1996. The
DOH has also undertaken a series of steps to further advance reforms, including: (a) an
assessment of health services and priorities from the viewpoint of beneficiaries; (b) a
reorganization of the DOH, based on an institutional self-assessment; (c) a comprehensive
manpower plan; (d) a financial management plan, and; (e) a public information campaign about
the NHAP. The DOH is also developing procedures for district health planning, and has
formulated operational plans for the new units of the DOH and the districts. It has outlined its
plan for infrastructure investment, and is further studying its financing options to diversify and
improve health sector resources. Despite the current security situation, the GOSL has continued
to demonstrate commitment to reforming the health sector by increasing the share of budgetary
resources allocated to health, and is aggressively trying to meet the enormous challenge of
assuring the provision of basic social services, and of developing the institutional capacity needed
to maintain and extend them.

7.    Project Rationale. Future growth and social stability will depend-inter alia-on an
increasing labor productivity of a healthier population, and on containing population growth. The
project will address simultaneously Sierra Leone's current severe health problems and the
weaknesses of its health delivery system. It will support, through an integrated approach (for
which donors and NGOs will combine forces with Government and beneficiaries) the
implementation of the GOSL NHAP core program, which aims at: (i) setting up a system which
is able to efficiently deliver an affordable basic health care package of acceptable quality; (ii)
developing a complementary relationship with-and strengthening-the private sector, and; (iii)
diversifying and increasing sector financing. It will also help develop sector capacity in
management, financial management and plamnnng both centrally and, more importantly, at the
district level, and will consolidate donor coordination. The sector investrnent approach is suitable
for the situation in Sierra Leone, as it foresees an annual evaluation of past performance, as well
as a plan and budget for the next fiscal year, thus allowing for adaptation of the project to changes
in funding levels, health or security situations. The sector investment approach-which involves
donors and NGOs active in the sector, each having a different array of skills and expertise-is
also justified by the complexity of the task, i.e., GOSL efforts are, at present, triple-fold: (1) to
provide emergency relief in the zones still concemed by the armed conflict; (2) to restructure the
delivery system in the districts under its control, and; (3) to start preparation of the post-conflict
period.
8.    Program objectives. The proposed IDA Credit would support the Government's NHAP
core program, with the intention of improving the health status of the people of Sierra Leone by
increasing access to and improving the quality of a basic package of health services that would be
better managed and delivered through an increasingly decentralized system. In the prioritization
exercise which led to the definition of the NHAP core program, the DOH identified the following
general development objectives: (i) improve key health status indicators; (ii) increase access to
health care and family planning, particularly in the rural areas; (iii) improve the quality of service
through training, supervision and improved logistic support; (iv) strengthen management,
accountability and community involvement at central and peripheral levels, and; (v) increase
efficiency and improve the financing for health care. The NHAP core program also identifies the
following program priorities: (a) improve child health; (b) improve matemal health; (c) reduce
fertility; (d) reduce the incidence and prevalence of communicable diseases and other common
ailments, including IRV; (e) reduce mental illness; (f) reduce injury and handicaps; (g) assure
satisfactory nutritional status; (h) reduce drug abuse; (i) improve living conditions; and (j)
improve food hygiene. Specific indicators to monitor progress in the achievement of these
objectives have been developed and will be used during supervision. Successfully laying the
foundation for a sustainable, equitable and efficient health system will also contribute to the
attainment of more general societal goals, such as social sustainability of the adjustment program,
improvement of prospects for a lasting peace in the country, and the strengthening of the human
resource base needed for a sustainable economic development.
9.    Program description. In launching the NHAP, the Govemment has taken the lead to
design a common framework for action in the entire sector, under which IDA and other donors
will provide support. The NHAP is an effort to rebuild the health care system in a coherent
manner so as to improve the health of the Sierra Leone people. The project, which is designed as



4
an integrated sector investment credit, will finance a slice of national budgets based on annual
agreements to support the NHAP reforms. Support will focus on ongoing activities for delivering
health services, as well as on: (a) policy development; (b) training of health personnel for
clinical, managerial and community development tasks; (c) designing and implementing support
services and systems; (d) equipping and supplying health facilities, and; (e) rehabilitating and
constructing primary care facilities and first referral hospitals.
10.   In line with the sector investment approach, detailed activity plans and budgets have been
prepared for the first year of the program, with emphasis on strengthening the implementation
capacity of the central DOH while addressing the implications of the current security situation.
Physical rehabilitation and efforts to improve service delivery will focus on the Western Area and
major towns, where populations have concentrated, and where the security situation is more
stable. Institutional development will concentrate on upgrading the DOH's capacity for financial
management, procurement, and repair and maintenance. Human resources development will
comprise a major part of the first-year program, and will highlight management training and the
training of recently rationalized cadres of health workers. Decentralization will be implemented
gradually, starting with one district in the Westem Area in 1996, which has received authority to
plan and to use a discretionary budget allocation. A health facilities infrastructure and equipment
survey will be developed to cover the remainder of the country, which will form the basis for
specific rehabilitation plans in the subsequent years.
11.   The Credit thus supports Govemment in its endeavors in policy development and in its
on-going operations, even as reforms and rehabilitation proceed. IDA will play the role of lender
of last resort, by supporting those elements of the agreed NHAP for which there is no other donor
funding. Financing will be structured so that Sierra Leone assumes an increasing share of the
recurrent budget, and so that IDA will not (explicitly or implicitly) finance ineligible expenditures
(e.g. land purchases or taxes). A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The estimated procurement and disbursement schedules are shown in Schedule C,
and a timetable of key processing events is shown in Schedule D.
12.   Program implementation. The NHAP, and the IDA Credit supporting it, will operate
through the permanent DOH structure which is headed by an Management Team. There will be
no separate project implementation units for individual donor programs. Following an
assessment of the DOH and an analysis of job tasks, the organizational structure of central DOH
has been changed in response to the reform priorities. New key positions have been created in
the areas of management, financial management, procurement, maintenance, etc., and the decision
has been made to gradually decentralize authority for implementation of health care delivery to
districts and hospitals. As a clear focal point is needed for managing and coordinating extemal
relations, and for monitoring donor inputs to the sector at Departmental level, a Director of Donor
Relations has been appointed. Other measures are also being taken to strengthen the
Department's communication and planning with the Department of Development and Economic
Planning (DODEP), responsible for the Govemment's Public Investment Program (PIP).
13.   Each year, a comprehensive annual review of the program will be jointly conducted with
the Govemment, donors and NGOs. This review will focus on the achievement of the annual



5
targets and indicators in the agreed upon annual workplan, and on the reasons for any variation.
The approach to the review will be forward-looking, endeavoring to identify factors which are
likely to impede progress in the following year, and taking necessary steps to overcome these
constraints in a timely manner or to amend objectives in light of changing circumstances. The
review would also assess progress on the indicators of the NHAP and decide whether financial
resources from the Credit would be made available for the implementation of program activities.
The implications of the findings of the annual review for the next year's workplan would also be
examined. This workplan would subsequendy be amended as appropriate-depending upon past
performance, availability of resources, and changes in the health and overall situation in the
country, such as the transition to a post-conflict rehabilitation/reconstruction phase. In the third
year of the program, a mid-term review would be carried out jointly with the Govemment and
other donors. Based on the outcome of the mid-term review, Govemment, donors and NGOs
would agree on the scope of the program.
14.   Lessons learned from previous IDA involvement. The resumption in 1992 of project
activities under the Health and Population Project (CR. 1695-SL) has demonstrated the
institutional weakness of the DOH. The highly qualified staff were over-stretched with
responsibilities, and there was litfle support available to them. Most donors have bypassed
Govemment structures as much as possible in the planning and implementation of their programs,
largely due to limited administrative and operational capacity, the lack of accountability in the
Government system, and the need to meet short-term performance criteria by which project
implementation is usually judged. The lack of coordination among participants in the health
sector has led to a fragmented health system. At one point in 1994, the DOH estimated that it had
at least 47 differentproject implementing units aligned with the various donors. The failure of
such a divisive approach is one of the major reasons that Govemment and donors have opted for
an integrated, sector-wide approach. Implementation of the NHAP provides the means for the
DOH (whose capacity is being substantially strengthened, with due attention to key functions,
such as, management, financial management, procurement, donor coordination, etc.) to become
the coordinator and to guide donor efforts, rather than the other way around.
15.   Lessons from two World Bank health sector studies have also been instrumental in the
development of the program. The 1993 World Development Report was used as a resource in the
prioritization of activities, particularly to identify the more cost-effective services. The
comprehensive review of African experience in the sector, Better Health in Africa, outlines
processes for change in health policy and strategy development, govemment commitment and
collaboration with the private sector, cost-effective approaches to the delivery of care, managerial
development and institutional reform, and donor support to a single country reform program.
These have all been adopted by the Govemment of Sierra Leone in the development of the
NHAP. The program is thus becoming an example of how to apply the Better Health in Africa
study.
16.   Rationale for Bank involvement. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sierra
Leone, reviewed by the Board on October 14, 1993, stresses: (a) macroeconomic stability; (b)
poverty reduction and human resources development; (c) public sector management and capacity
building; (d) private sector development; and (e) sustainable development. Provision of basic



6
health services is central to human resource development and poverty alleviation; it is thus at the
center of Sierra Leone's development strategy and the CAS. Furthermore, the design of the
Credit particularly emphasizes the need for restoring civil service efficiency and the capacity for
service delivery through institutional, personnel and administrative reform of the DOH, while
taking into account the existing, limited financial and human resource base. Hence, the project
specifically addresses public sector management and capacity-building issues on a sustainable
basis.
17.   There are compelling reasons for IDA to continue to support the Government's reform
initiatives in the health sector that started with assistance from a first project, i.e., Health and
Population Project, which ended in December 1995: (a) the Bank has invested heavily in sector
work to promote health system reform (notably the above-mentioned, 1993 World Development
Report and Better Health in Africa) to foster rational priority setting and selection of cost-
effective interventions. The sector reform process in Sierra Leone follows the same objectives
and will benefit from IDA financial and technical support; (b) the policy and type of program
developed in Sierra Leone, and the agreement with donors and NGOs make possible a more
comprehensive and integrated approach to which the Bank is commnitted and will ensure a
sustainable development impact; (c) the health system in Sierra Leone has deteriorated to such an
extent that there is a large financial and technical gap between what is currently available (and
provided by Govemment, donors and NGOs) and what is needed to begin making the health
system work in Sierra Leone. At this point in time, IDA support is decisive for the country's
future. Its contribution as a lender of last resort, filling the gap after other donors have adjusted
their support to meet specific requirements and restrictions, will enable the Government to
address the basic health needs of a very poor population, carry out a fundamental sector reform,
and aid in economic and societal recovery.
18.   The five-year suspension by IDA of disbursements to Sierra Leone, lifted in April 1992,
has had a negative impact on the portfolio performance. Since then, disbursements have
increased steadily. While much of 1992-93 was spent on re-establishing the Health and
Population Project, with increased supervision and technical assistance, project performance has
progressively improved, and the Project is expected to fully disburse its funds. The second
tranche under the ongoing SAP was released in April 1995, after a review of the country's fiscal
performance. Despite an increase in the level of disbursements for investment projects in FY95
(disbursement ratio of 24.3% in FY95 compared with 17.9% in FY94), the number of projects
with unsatisfactory rating has increased to three. This is mainly attributed to the deterioration in
the security situation, and to a stricter and more realistic application of the rating criteria.
Schedule E outlines the status of Bank Group operations in Sierra Leone, including a summary of
actions to improve implementation on particular projects. The security situation currently poses
the greatest threat to the improved portfolio performance but has been taken into consideration in
the design of this project.
19.   Agreed actions. The basis for the IDA Credit and for cooperation with the donor
community is the NHAP core program, submitted by the GOSL and agreed upon with donors and
NGOs at the SSRT consultations. The DOH, which has already been reorganized and
strengthened, has adopted plans for human resources development and decentralization of



7
authority to district health teams and hospital boards. The GOSL, through the DOH, has agreed to
prepare-and submit for review by IDA and other donors-annual work programs and budgets at
least three months prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. The Credit Agreement is structured
to ensure that continued IDA disbursements are contingent upon the GOSL-IDA agreement on
the annual work program, sector performance and Govemment's and donors' financial
commitment (IDA will contribute maximum 25% of the total annual program cost), at any point
in time during the implementation of the program. Govemment has agreed, in its Sector Policy
Letter, to increase its financial commitment to the health sector, to further strengthen its
administrative and management capacity and reform the health delivery system.
20.   Poverty category. The program is sector-wide and addresses the entire population. For
this reason, this operation has not been included as part of the Program of Targeted Interventions.
Due to its emphasis on primary health care, the majority of the population - which compared to
other countries is among the poorest in the world - will benefit from increased access to a better
quality of health and family planning services.
21.   Environmental aspects. This project is classified as category C. Because the program
includes improvements in sanitation, food hygiene, and medical waste, the net effects of the
program are expected to be beneficial to the environment.
22.   Program objectives category. The project is part of IDA's core poverty alleviation
program. It aims at providing accessible, efficient, equitable and cost-effective social services in
the health sector, thereby alleviating and reducing poverty.
23.   Participatory approach. The program has been developed through a highly
participative approach. The NHAP was initially drafted by the DOH through participative
workshops and by using an adaptation of the ZOPP (objectives-oriented project planning)
methodology in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including other Government
Departments, private sector health care providers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
community representatives, and multilateral agencies, including WHO, UNICEF, UNDP,
UNFPA, and IDA. The program was then presented to the donor and NGO communities at two
large consultations. To obtain feedback and prioritize the NHAP, country-wide public meetings,
focus group sessions, consultations with health providers and surveys were used, along with a
formal beneficiary assessment. As a result, there is a broad consensus and popular support for
the program, and agreed upon criteria for prioritization. The Government is commnitted to further
involve key stakeholders and beneficiaries to budget, plan and evaluate NHAP implementation on
an annual basis. This commnitment was demonstrated once more in October 1995 when a second
consultation with donors and NGOs took place to discuss the sector plan and budget for FY1996.
24.   Program benefits. Implementation of the program will enable the Govemment to attain
its sector goals, offering Sierra Leoneans more access to health services of better quality, and
will ultimately lead to, through its emphasis on primary health care, improved health status of the
population with emphasis on the poor, women and children. The main benefits of the project
would be to: (a) reduce excessive morbidity, mortality, and fertility through extension of basic
quality health and family planning services to those most in need; (b) implement a comprehensive



8
reform of the health sector aiming at directing resources to those priority health problems for
which cost-effective intervention strategies are available; (c) strengthen the capacity of central
DOH to use resources in an efficient manner; (d) develop sector capacity in areas such as
management, financial management, human resources development and planning; (e) decentralize
decision-making, and enable communities and districts to make decisions and to have greater
control over budget and service delivery; ad (f) diversify the financing of health services and
help establish a more equitable and affordable basis for it. Schedule B refers to the project
benefits and key performance indicators.
25.   Program sustainability. The preparation of the program relied on soliciting community
support in a deliberate effort to build up the social sustainability of the reform program.
Communities will continue to play an important role in the operation and maintenance of health
services, so that the health system will become more accountable to the communities they serve.
In addition to its popular appeal, the program currently enjoys considerable political support, as
evidenced by the involvement of the Chief of State and Cabinet in the launching of the National
Health Policy and NHAP, and their commitment to making major policy decisions up-front, prior
to Board presentation. In addition to committing greater resources to health, the GOSL has made
a difficult decision not to construct a new tertiary hospital in order to allow for greater investment
in primary care and first referral hospitals. Efforts will be made to maintain the political
support-through continued involvement of key decision-makers-in the planning and evaluation
of health services, and by maintaining the popular support for the program through continued
feedback from beneficiaries. A major challenge of the program is to develop managerial and
technical capacity to ensure sustainability of health care delivery. This is why the program puts
heavy investments in training (both formal and on-the-job), technical assistance, and the
establishment of managerial systems to develop the necessary cadre of appropriately-trained
people. To build up local capacity, local technical assistance and training will be used as much as
possible.
26.   The program aims to be financially sustainable in the long run, but will be dependent on
donor investment in the short and medium term. Government budget allocation to the health
sector, exclusive of funds generated through cost-recovery and donor contributions, is expected
to increase, while donors will gradually decrease their financial contribution. On a per capita
basis, the total program expects to spend about US$5.5 per capita per annum, which represents an
increase by 70% compared to current public and donor expenditures. According to Better Health
In Africa, a well-run system in a low income country would cost around US$9 per capita (1993).
Thus, additional financing will be needed from private sector sources and households. Increased
household expenditures on more effective public and private services, including the development
of cost-recovery and pre-payment systems, are anticipated as the quality of health care improves,
and the country regains stability and economic performance.
27.   Risks. There are a number of potential risks, most notably: (a) the persistence of-or
late solution to-the security situation, which multiplies health emergencies, makes rehabilitation
in parts of the country untenable, and increases the possibility of not obtaining sufficient domestic
resources to implement the NHAP; (b) an over-ambitious program, which over-stretches the
implementation capacity of the DOH, could lead to weak efficiency gains and donor skepticism



9
conceming GOSL potential to coordinate and implement its policy, and; (c) moving too quickly,
before the reorganization of the DOH and the strengthening of its key units are completed, could
lead to a decline in efficiency, further dysfunction and distortions in the provision of health
services, and the inability to use national- and donor-contributed funds.
28.   The risks are minimized by implementing the program in phases, starting physical
rehabilitation in areas free from civil unrest (e.g., Western Area). The sector investment approach
is also appropriate in these circumstances, as it allows a greater deal of flexibility in program
planning, enabling quick response to changing situations. The development phases are also
planned according to the growing capacity of Govemment, investing heavily on training, support
systems, and studies, using pilot initiatives, and reviewing progress frequently, to minimize the
risk of moving too quickly with institutional reform. Particular emphasis on financial
management, accounting and controls will help to ensure that allocated funds are used for
intended purposes in the health sector, which will be critical if the public expenditure program
otherwise begins to falter. The risks are further diminished because there has been a
comprehensive effort to examnine organizational needs and capabilities, incentives, and
institutional culture, and to involve a wide number of Government participants in the reform
process. Decentralization of authority will be accompanied by appropriate financial support and
intensive training in management systems. Annual reviews undertaken jointly by the
Government, IDA, and other donors will enable Government to make required changes in
programming strategies on a frequent basis. A mid-term review will provide an opportunity for
major restructuring, and cancellation, if necessary. Efforts to increase participation with other
Government Departments and stakeholders outside of the Government should help to assure
domestic support, and will diminish the risks due to political instability, by developing a broad
approval for the program and for the process of program development and management. Finally,
through the Bank's assistance by means of the structural adjustment program, there is a consistent
effort to maintain the commitment of the Government to invest in social sectors.
29.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
Economic Analysis and Framework for Prioritization of the Core Program of the National
Health Action Plan (NHAP)
This analysis of the Integrated Health Sector Investment Project (IHSIP) is based on the
public expenditure review' and the health sector policy (NHAP core program), and takes into
account existing resource constraints.
The Sector Investment Approach (SIP) does not lend itself to assessing the rate of return
of the IHSIP because: (i) the IDA level of funding and the breakdown by expenditure categories
are to be determined on an annual basis; and (ii) IDA funds are fungible and will be used as a
last resort source of financing. It is therefore not feasible to prospectively quantify project costs
and benefits. For this reason, a detailed analysis of the soundness of the entire national sector
investmnent program, as presented in the sector policy (NHAP core program), was carried out.
Sector-wide review of public expenditures
Focus on service provision. The review of public expenditures has focused on restoring
the GOSL's capacity to provide basic services, specifically in the health and education sectors.
Consequently, DOH has developed its health sector strategy-as presented in the NHAP-in the
general frame and constraints offered by the review. As a result, the sector refocused its plans
giving greater emphasis to cost-effective interventions, such as preventive and curative primary
health services, and abandoned efforts to establish a new tertiary facility in the form of a
teaching hospital at Jui near the capital Freetown. Efforts have been stepped up to diversify the
funding of the public health sector and to increase private health care provision by actively
facilitating NGO activities3 and by starting privatization of tertiary services4.

Report No. 12618-SL.
2 Sierra Leone: Policiesfor Sustained Economic Growth and Poverty .411eviation. May 14, 1993. Cf. World Bank Report No.
1 1371-SL.
3 In early 1995, the DOH established a donor liaison office. It is now actively assisting a local foundation in the construction
of a new 56-bed hospital near Freetown by facilitating duty-free status and expediting customs and other administrative
procedures. DOH is liaising with all NGOs in order to avoid overlap and duplication by the public sector in the provision
of health care services.
4 A portion of the Connaught Hospital. termed the "Annex," is providing above-standard services (higher staff/client ratio,
air-conditioning, better food. etc.) and is now financed by collecting increased fees.

Page 2 of 11
The status-quo alternative (i.e. no change in Government intervention and donor
support). Regarding the provision of preventive services, such as immunization or vector
control, there is little prospect for private provision and the government's role has been
recognized. With regard to primary health care and related referral services, a good case can be
made for the public provision of these services, especially at the outreach, on the basis of market
failures. It is reasonable to assume that maintaining the status quo in the sector would result in a
further deterioration of the already poor provision of health services to the general public: (a)
consumers in rural areas would not gain access to acceptable health services; (b) the overall
quality of health services, particularly at primary level, would remain low; (c) the lack of
information would continue to hamper rational decision-making by consumers; (d) expenditures
by private households on traditional healers and drug peddlers could not be recouped in favor of
better services; and (e) preventive services such as immunization or vector control would
continue to be supplied below optimal levels.
Macroeconomic environment
Budgetary impact. The Project's program evaluation and programming cycle
incorporates a mechanism, on an annual basis, to review together with Government of Sierra
Leone (GOSL) and other donors not only the IHSIP performance but the entire sector
prograrm-under the leadership of GOSL- and to coordinate both recurrent and investment
health expenditures with the Government's overall budget. The project therefore will facilitate
macro-economic stability while at the same time contributing to the gains in the sector and to the
achievement of a reasonable level and composition of health expenditures (see figures 2.2 and
2.3 in the SAR).
Marginal cost of funds. No country-specific estimate for the marginal cost of public
funds is available. However, to overcome existing data limitations, the GOSL has committed
itself during Negotiations to conduct a national survey on household expenditures and household
economic activities, and to develop a comprehensive health sector financing plan latest by the
end of 1997, addressing the question of the public/private mix of services and diversification of
sector financing. Given that there is a premium on public income (since, generally speaking,
governments resort to distortionary taxation for revenue) and in order to ensure sustainability of
the health sector reform, the GOSL in the context of the IHSIP intends to upgrade and
streamline various existing cost recovery measures into a more coherent and efficient system.
Cost effectiveness
No specific data are available for Sierra Leone regarding the distribution of deaths by
specific cause, age and sex. However, it can be assumed that the country's mortality pattern
follows the model used for sub-Saharan Africa, as it is the case in neighboring Guinea for which
preliminary data exist from an ongoing study. Similarly, intervention costs have been estimated
from NHAP costs, literature and ongoing studies.

The NHAP activities were compared with activities of the minimum package of care,
selected on the basis of demonstrated favorable cost-effectiveness ratios, and presented by the
World Bank in two major publications, i.e., Better Health in Africa (1994) and World
Development Report (1993). The table below demonstrates that NHAP activities concur with
the Bank's recommendations and are economically justified.

Key performance indicators have been developed to monitor programs' progress in inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes and project impact. These indicators will be
used yearly at the evaluation sections with donors and NGOs to assess the achievement of program objectives, and when and if necessary, will be updated to keep abreast of
any changes in the sector.

the suspension of disbursements until 1992 but also by weak
project management, sup-optimal institutional anrangement, and
the secuity sitiation which impeded constuction actvies in
nual areas. Following the March '95 supevision mission,
strengthened implementation arrangements and supervision
reduced the disbursement lag from 54% to cumntly 26%.tt
Following project completion in Dec. '95, an additional four
months grace period was granted to complete disbursements. It is
expected that a large portion of the Credit will not be disbursed.

re-designed and re-launched in 1993, focusing on improving
effectiveness of applied research and extension services; increasing r 
aCCess to rural credit and farm inputs; promoting small-scale ago-

mobility of research and extension staff due to lingerng security  r

management capacity led to delays in restting implementation
after resumption of disbursements in 1992. The security situation,
affected some project activities, which consequently were
resled. Following a s vision mission in March '95, the
recrunitent of a procurement consultant, and inreased technical
advice from IDA, it is expeted that pueject funds wil be fuly
