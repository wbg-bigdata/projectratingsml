APPRAISAL OF THE SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
A. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.        The three major regions of the Philippines are in very different
stages of power development. Most of the past power development has taken
place on the island of Luzon, where about half of the population live and
most industrialization has occurred. Some grid development has also taken
place on the main southern island of Mindanao, particularly in the northern
part where the availability of easily developed low cost hydropower has at-
tracted substatial industrial investment. In the Visayas, which comprises
all other major islands located in the central part of the Philippine
Archipelago, grids are only now beginning to be constructed.
2.        Historically, ownership of the power sector has been fragmented.
The largest utility in the country has been the privately-owned Manila
Electric Company (MECO) which holds the franchise for the greater Manila
area. The National Power Corporation (NPC), which is the second largest
utility and totally Government-owned, generates and transmits power in bulk,
selling to other utilities and large industrial consumers. In addition,
there are a number of small utilities in the country, operating largely in
isolation. In 1970, there were 336 privately-owned and 122 publicly-owned
utilities, most of which were very small and were located in urban areas.
Since then a number have been taken over by rural cooperatives and some
have ceased operating. As of December 1975, about 120 utilities and 51
cooperatives were actually supplying consumers.
3.        This fragmented ownership has made the integrated development of
the sector slow and difficult. To overcome this problem, the Government has
taken steps to consolidate ownership of the sector. In 1972 NPC was made
responsible for constructing all future generation facilities and estab-
lishing island grids. The Government is in the process of purchasing most
of MECO's generating plants, which will be operated by NPC in the future.
When this process is completed, MECO will become primarily a power distributor.
The Government has also established the National Electrification Adminis-
tration (NEA) with responsibility for integrating small utilities and ex-
tending power service to rural areas.
4.        In tlarch 1976, the Government established the Energy Development
Board to be responsible for the exploration and development of primary energy
resources, including geothermal energy, water, oil, gas, and coal. The Board
will work closely with the existing Power Development Council (PDC), the body
responsible for formulating policies and programs on electric power develop-
ment and coordinating the activities of all organizations connected with



- ii -
power. PDC coordinates policy for NPC, NEA, HECO and all other utilities and
is responsible for approving major power projects and tariff rate policies.
It is attached to the Department of Public Works, Transport and Communications,
to which NPC and NEA also report. The sector was organized in this manner
during the first half of 1976 and has yet to be tested in practice.
5.        Since 1957 the Bank has made six loans and one IDA credit amounting
to $160.3 million, net of cancellations, to NPC and the Government for pro-
jects in the power sector. The most recent was a loan of $61 million (Loan
No. 1034-PH) in 1974 to finance the construction of the 100 MW Pantabangan
hydro power plant and expansion of transmission systems in Luzon. Construction
of the generating plant was completed in April 1977 as originally scheduled
and the plant has since been operating at full capacity. Work on transmission
lines has been slow and completion will be delayed by one year. IFC made a
loan of $8 million to MIECO and an equity investment of $4 million in 1967.
Present Access to Service
6.        The electrification of the country has been progressing steadily.
The per capita consumption of electricity in 1974 was estimated at 280 kWh,
compared with 490 kWh in Korea, 184 kWh in Thailand and 120 kWh in India.
Over 30% of the population is currently served with electricity compared
with 23% in 1970. Although regional imbalances presently exist, with 46% of
the households electrified in Luzon compared with 15% in Mindanao and 13% in
the Visayas, NEA's rural electrification program is expected to improve the
situation. The total electricity supply in 1974 was estimated at about
11.9 billion kWh; 50% was provided by MIECO, 20% by NPC, 21% by self-generating
industries, and 9% by small utilities. On the consumption side, industrial
consumers represented about 55%; residential consumers, 20%; and commercial,
agricultural and other users, 25%.
7.        NPC and a few self-generating utilities, including MECO, have pro-
vided reliable and continuous power supply to about 90% of the total consumers,
but services by other self-generating utilities have been substandard with
power available for only a few hours each day. The situation has worsened in
some rural areas because small utilities have lost interest in maintaining
their business in apprehension of being taken over by NEA and some of them
have even ceased operation.  However, within a few years NEA's program will
more than compensate for the deteriorating service from small utilities.
Sector Development Objectives
8.        The Government is committed to a policy of rapid industrialization
which is central to its objectives of fostering growth, employment and exports.
It is also committed to a policy of dispersing industrial growth from the
already congested Manila Metropolitan Area to other regions of the country.
In order to meet these objectives and to realize the planned annual growth in
Gross National Product of 7% during the next 10 years, it is estimated that
electricity consumption in the Visayas and in Mindanao will need to grow at
annual rates of about 16% and 13% respectively, compared with about 8% in
Luzon. This would result in an overall annual growth in consumption of 11%.
Because NPC is the institution primarily responsible for power generation, it
has a critical role to play in helping the Philippines realize its economic
objectives.



- iii -
9.        About 80% of the power generation in the Philippines is currently
dependent on imported oil and the remaining 20% on hydro resources. The Gov-
ernment has decided to diversify energy resources by developing indigenous
hydro and geothermal power and by introducing nuclear energy. The construc-
tion of the first geothermal power plant is underway in southern Luzon, while
explorations for more geothermal energy are being undertaken in several parts
of the country and have already shown promising results. Investigations are
also progressing at several potential hydro power sites. In addition, NPC
has started the construction of its first nuclear power plant with financing
from the United States Export-Import Bank and commercial banks.
10.       NEA has set a target of establishing an electric cooperative in each
province by 1977, completing the country's "backbone" system by 1980, providing
electricity to all barrios by 1984, and attaining total electrification of the
country by 1990. The United States Agency for International Development has
been providing financial and technical assistance for this program. By
December 1975, a total of 75 cooperatives had already been formed; 51 were
operating, serving a rural population of about 2 million on a 24-hour-day
basis. In the course of establishing cooperatives, NEA takes over and inte-
grates some of the existing small utilities, particularly those with exorbitant
rates and poor service. By March 1976, the number of utilities taken over by
NEA had reached 106. NEA's activities in the power distribution sector will
eventually result in only the largest 10-15 private utilities remaining in
business.
Sector Investment Program and Costs
11.       The sector investment program required to meet the expected demand
increase is huge. It will almost triple the country's generating capacity by
expanding it from about 3,100 MW in 1974 to about 8,500 MW in 1985. Emphasis
will be placed on the development of non-oil sources of generation. If imple-
mented as planned, the program would reduce oil-fired generating capacity from
81% of the total in 1974 to 53% in 1985; hydropower would correspondingly in-
crease from 19% to 31%; and geothermal and nuclear power would share the re-
maining 16%. Although the objective of diversifying energy resources is rea-
sonable, the program is very ambitious and involves certain risks. Financial
constraints may hinder the timely development of capital-intensive hydropower
projects, and technical problems may arise in developing nuclear and geothermal
sources of energy. In particular, sufficient geothermal steam may not be
secured in time for the planned development of 745 MW of geothermal genera-
tion. The program therefore needs continuous review and, if difficulties do
arise, it is possible that additional oil-fired thermal plants will be needed.
12.       The rapid expansion in generating capacity will need to be accom-
panied by a vigorous program of extending the transmission network. In 1976,
NPC had a total of 3,600 km of transmission lines and about 1,200 MVA of sub-
station capacity to supply utility and non-utility consumers. About 3,300 km
of transmission network are located in Luzon, 200 km in Mindanao and 100 km
in the Visayas. As noted in earlier paragraphs, the grid system has been con-
centrated in the Central Luzon area, and the population in northern and
southern Luzon and large parts of Mindanao and the Visayas either has no
access to electricity or has to rely on unreliable and costly generation by
small local utilities. NEA is vigorously promoting the rural electrification
program throughout the country, but progress of this important program is



- iv -
dependent on the rapid expansion of NPC's grid system into rural areas. The
Bank Group has been assisting the grid expansion under the loans for Fifth
and Sixth proiects (Loan No. 809-PH, Credit No. 296-PH, and Loan No. 1034-PH),
by financing about 1,100 km of transmission lines and 1,200 MVA of substation
facilities in Luzon. The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan has
provided funds for the first stage of grid expansion in the Cagayan valley in
northern Luzon. NPC is also expanding the grids in Mindanao and the Visayas
with assistance from the Asian Development Bank and an export credit agency
of France. In general, NPC has been able to finance a large part of its
generating program from export credits and other commercial sources on reason-
able terms, but needs to rely more heavily on official sources of development
financing to support its transmission program for which commercial sources of
finance are less readily available.
13.       The total sector investment at the end of 1974 was about $954 mil-
lion with NPC accounting for $405 million, or 42%; MECO, 45%; and NEA and other
utilities, 13%. The development program envisaged through 1983 will require
a total investment of about $6.7 billion (P 50.6 billion) at current prices
including financial charges; this would represent an increase in the share
of power in public investment from 10% in recent years to about 35% in the
future. NPC's share of the investment program will amount to $5.8 billion
(P 43.9 billion) or about 87% of the total. About 65% of this amount will
be invested in Luzon, 19% in Mindanao, and 16% in the Visayas. Investment by
MECO on its transmission and distribution system will be about $450 million
(P 3.4 billion) through 1983. Another $440 million (P 3.3 billion) will be
spent by NEA through 1983 in financing rural cooperatives to acquire the
assets of private utilities and to expand the distribution system in rural
areas. Investment in the remainder of the sector is likely to be small in
comparison as it will cover only distribution costs for small utilities not
absorbed in the NEA cooperative system.
Constraints on Sector Development
14.       NPC was created in 1936 as a non-stock public corporation, but was
converted to a stock corporation wholly owned by the Government in 1960. Its
corporate powers are vested in a Board of Directors which includes the General
Manager. Although NPC was originally chartered to develop hydropower re-
sources in the country, its role and responsibilities have been dramatically
expanded in the past few years following the government's decision to make
NPC the prime force in the development of power generation from all sources.
This change in sector policy was so fundamental that NPC has not yet been
able to adjust fully to the new situation. NPC has constructed five hydro-
power stations and one thermal power station in its 40-year history, but it
will need to construct and operate about 75 large power projects in the next
15 years. To carry out a program of the required magnitude successfully, NPC
will need to greatly improve its capacity to construct and operate a much
larger, more modern, and more complex power system. In particular, NPC needs
to improve its capability for system planning and financial management and
control, to streamline and improve its internal organization and to develop
effective training programs for its personnel.



-v -
15.       The Government recognizes the difficult situation NPC faces and
has taken a number of steps to improve its implementation capability and to
enable the staff to cope with the large development program. Salary scales
and merit systems have been improved to make NPC more competitive with
private industry, specialized engineers have been recruited from other
government agencies for the newly organized nuclear and geothermal units and
basic agreement has been reached to transfer MECO's operating personnel as
well as its generating facilities to NPC. There have also been changes in
the composition of NPC's Board. Its members, including its chairman, now
consist of some of the most highly qualified technocrats in the country.
More recently, a Corporate Planning Staff and a Human Resources Development
Division have been set up in the head office. The Corporate Planning Staff
is responsible for advising NPC management on long range policy planning and
assisting the various departments in NPC in implementing long range plans
approved by NPC's management. The Human Resources Development Division is
responsible for assessing manpower requirements, developing a recruitment
and training program and establishing and managing a proposed NPC training
center. NPC is also planning to engage consultants associated with an
operating utility to review NPC's existing management and administrative
structure and assist in implementing the necessary reforms. While a signifi-
cant beginning has been made, continuous vigorous efforts will be necessary
to enable NPC to meet its rapidly growing responsibilities.
B. THE PROJECT
16.       The project was prepared by NPC.  A Bank mission appraised the pro-
ject in March/April 1976. At the time of the appraisal, the project proposal
included the construction and equipping of the Kalayaan pumped storage plant
in Luzon. However, as the Government subsequently received financing offer
for this component from another source, the Bank was requested to consider
financing the proposed transmission project which is also urgently needed.
Because of the proposed change in content and scope of the project a follow-up
appraisal took place in February 1977.
Project Description and Objectives
17.       The proposed project has been designed to assist the Government in
financing the very large power program needed for the Philippines' future
economic development and to assist NPC in its continuing efforts to improve
its institutional capacity. The requirements of the power sector were dis-
cussed in the Bank's Basic Economic Report (No. 1095a-PH) and have been the
subject of an active dialogue between the Bank and the Government. The main
institutional emphasis of the proposed project is reflected in substantial
assistance to NPC for improving its organization, training programs, and
financial policies and procedures.
18.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) expansion of the transmission system in Luzon;
(b) the first stage of a communication system and control
center in Luzon;



- vi -
(c) support for NPC's training activities; and
(d) consultants' services for management improvement and
a tariff study.
19.       The transmission program supported under the project would include
about 1,360 km of transmission lines and substation capacity of 225 MVA, which
upon completion will extend NPC's transmission grid to cover almost all of the
island of Luzon. The 230 KV and 115 KV facilities to be provided under the
project would either strengthen existing systems which will be overloaded in
a few years or provide a bulk supply of power to areas which presently do not
have power supply but expect rapid load development mainly due to the estab-
lishment of new industries. The 69 KV lines will extend NPC's power supply
to rural areas where NEA is promoting the rural electrification program.
20.       The project would also provide for a communication network linking
all power plants and major substations and a central control center equipped
with system monitoring, data acquisition and remote control facilities. NPC
presently does not have such a control system, which is unusual for a system
as large as the Luzon grid, and even a minor disturbance could easily lead to
a total system collapse. Upon completion, the control center would conti-
nuously monitor all generating plants and major substations so that the cost
of system operation can be minimized, system security improved and, in case
of system disturbances, service restored with the minimum effect on consumers.
21.       As discussed in paragraphs 14 and 15, NPC's present organization,
particularly that of the head office, was designed for the execution of a
small number of projects and was suitable for the situation that existed
before 1973. The currently expanded role of NPC in the sector necessarily
requires a reorganization and redefinition of responsibilities to enable NPC
to meet the challenge of the next decade. In order to assist in this process,
NPC has agreed to engage: (a) a financial manager to plan and manage NPC's
finances and conduct negotiations with financial institutions by not later
than December 31, 1977; and (b) a management advisory team, which would be
financed under the proposed loan, to assist NPC in organizing the head and
regional offices, redefining authority and responsibilities, and executing
day-to-day operations. A qualified systems planning advisor would be a member
of this team and would assist the manager of the Corporate Planning Department
in analyzing the power system, forecasting market demand, and optimizing the
investment program. NPC proposes to appoint consultants associated with an
operating utility for such services. It is estimated that about 108 man-months
of consultants' services would be required, and the team would be appointed
by October 1, 1977. It has also been agreed that NPC implement a management
improvement program within twelve months after the completion of the consul-
tant's report.
22.       A manpower development study for NPC has been carried out by the
College of Public Administration of the University of the Philippines (UP).
The study estimates that NPC will need to expand the number of its employees
from about 5,800 at present to more than 10,000 in 1985 and that training
will be needed in a wide variety of disciplines to support this rapid expan-
sion. The study recommended the immediate establishment of a comprehensive
training program, including the development of an NPC training school. To



- vii -
meet the urgent need for improving managerial capability, funds are included
in the proposed loan to provide overseas training for 12 to 15 of the middle
management staff of NPC. They would be attached to appropriate foreign
utilities for about six months in order to learn utility management practices.
To help with NPC's longer term manpower requirements, provision has been made
in the project for the establishment of an NPC training center. Agreement
has been reached during negotiations that NPC would review its training pro-
gram once a year in consultation with the Bank.
23.       Electricity tariffs in the Philippines are complex and diversified,
reflecting the fragmented structure of the power sector which has precluded a
comprehensive tariff study. The recently initiated reorganization and inte-
gration of the power sector, however, would now facilitate such a study,
which is needed to ascertain the sector's costs and tariffs on a marginal
cost basis and to enable the Government to make more informed decisions on its
pricing policy. The Government and NPC have agreed to initiate such a study
and to establish a unit within NPC which would be responsible for reviewing
NPC's tariffs on a continuous basis. The Government has agreed to consult
the Bank on any significant changes in its power sector tariff policy.
Project Cost and Financing
24.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be about $92 million
(net of taxes) of which $58 million (or 63%) would be in foreign exchange.
The cost estimates include a physical contingency of 12% and an overall price
contingency equivalent to about 30% of total project cost (including physical
contingency). For local costs, price contingencies amount to 9% in 1977-79,
and 8% thereafter; for foreign exchange costs, price contingencies amount to
7.5% in 1977-79, and 7% thereafter. The unit cost for overseas training of
NPC personnel was estimated at $25,000 per participant for six months. Unit
costs per man-month of consulting services were assumed at $6,000.
25.       The proposed loan of $58 million would finance the foreign exchange
component of the project. NPC would finance the balance of project costs.
Project Execution
26.       The transmission project consists of a total of 50 small and simple
subprojects. NPC has gained sufficient experience with this type of work
through the implementation of the Fifth and Sixth Power Project and would be
able to carry out the engineering and construction supervision of the trans-
mission project using its own staff. NPC has agreed to appoint a project
manager for the project, who would report directly to the Luzon regional
manager, in order to ensure adequate coordination and timely completion of the
numerous subprojects. NPC would procure equipment and materials and would
tender civil works contracts, which are expected to be carried out by local
contractors. Since NPC's experience in system control and communication is
very limited, it has agreed to retain qualified engineering consultants for
detailed design, procurement and construction supervision.
27.       NPC would be responsible for retaining consultants for advisory
services and selecting candidates and arranging courses for overseas train-
ing. The overseas training of NPC's middle management staff would be carried



- viii -
out in four phases; each phase would be limited to a six-month course and
3 or 4 participants so that the program would not jeopardize NPC's daily
business acti+ ities.
Procurement and Disbursement
28.       Equipment and materials financed by the proposed loan would be pro-
cured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. Although the project consists of numerous subprojects, contracts
would be grouped into several packages large enough to attract foreign bidders.
For purposes of bid evaluation, qualified local manufacturers would receive a
preference of 15% or the level of custom duties, whichever is less. Civil
works contracts for erection of transmission lines and construction of communi-
cation and control as well as NPC's training center would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally in accordance with local
procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank.
29.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for 100% of foreign exchange cost
of imported goods, 100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured goods
procured under international competitive bidding, 15% for civil works expendi-
tures, and 100% of the foreign exchange cost or 65% of the total cost of
consultants' services and overseas training.
Financial Analysis
30.       To carry out its very large future program, NPC will need to expand
its asset base by ten times over the next eight years. To cover capital
expenditures of $5.8 billion (P 43.9 billion), NPC will borrow about $3.6 bil-
lion (P 26.9 billion) abroad to cover foreign costs. Arrangements have already
been completed for about $1.7 billion (P 13.0 billion) of foreign financing;
accordingly, the prospects appear to be favorable for raising the additional
borrowing required. The balance of NPC's investment requirements of $2.2 bil-
lion (P 17.0 billion) would have to be provided from within the Philippines
either from NPC's internal cash generation or in the form of Government equity
contributions to NPC. On this basis, the debt/equity ratio would not rise
above 46/54, which would allow a margin for debt revaluation during the
forecast period if currency parities change.
31.       Since 1972 NPC has been attempting to earn reasonable revenues.
The rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets in operation rose
from 4.5% in 1971 to 6.4% in 1975; this is primarily the result of a series
of tariff increases. However, the higher than expected cost inflation has
prevented INPC from achieving the 8% rate of return previously agreed upon
with the Bank. In fact, the rate of return for 1976 is estimated to have
fallen to 3.5%. A 35% tariff increase was implemented in November 1976 and
as a result the rate of return is expected to rise to 5.3% in 1977.
32.       Substantial funds are required by NPC over the coming years which
must come from a combination of internal cash generation and Government equity,
as NPC will need to use its borrowing capability primarily for foreign rather
than local borrowing. The rate of return should therefore be fixed in the
future at the highest level possible, taking into account consumers tariffs
and the amount of budget resources that the Government can allocae to the



- ix -
power sector. With an 8% rate of return on its annually revalued net fixed
assets in operation, NPC's internal cash generation would contribute only 4%
of the resources needed to finance the total power investment program proposed
through 1983. Thus, the Government would need to contribute $2.0 billion in
the form of equity contributions. During negotiations it was agreed to
continue the existing covenant which requires NPC to earn an 8% rate of
return. However, in order to provide for a larger share of financing from
internal cash generation, the Government and NPC have also agreed to review
with the Bank, by not later than June 30, 1979, NPC's tariff levels and
determine a schedule of tariff increases which would enable NPC to earn, at
the earliest feasible time, rates of return higher than 8%.
33.       The current debt control test agreed between NPC and the Bank pro-
vides that the Borrower shall not incur debt without the agreement of the
Bank unless its net revenues for the fiscal year next preceding such incur-
rence, or for a later 12-month period ended prior to such incurrence, shall
have been at least 1.3 times the maximum annual debt service requirement for
any succeeding fiscal year on all debt (including the debt to be incurred).
Because of increasing needs to borrow to finance its capital program, NPC
has had to seek the Bank's agreement to incurring each new debt during the past
few years. A change was needed to provide covenants which would give adequate
freedom to NPC to manage its debt and still assure its major creditor, the
Bank, periodic opportunities to review NPC's investment and borrowing program.
Therefore, agreement was reached with NPC that: NPC would submit annually a
copy of its ten-year development program with the supporting financial plan to
the Bank for its review, and NPC would only undertake a major project, invest-
ment, or acquisition (defined as those exceeding $50 million equivalent) after
having established in consultation with the Bank that such investment, project,
or asset (i) forms part of a least cost development program for NPC; (ii) will
be undertaken or acquired through means which will ensure a reasonable cost;
and (iii) will be financed under a reasonable financing plan. These covenants
are expected to provide NPC greater flexibility than in the past and at the
same time allow for adequate discussion between NPC and the Bank to reach
agreement on a least-cost development program. In addition, it has been agreed
that NPC's medium-term borrowings (i.e., debt maturing within 5 years) would
be limited to a total of $50 million equivalent.
34.       NPC has undertaken in the agreement for Loan 1034-PH that by December
31, 1976, outstanding accounts for electricity supplied will not exceed the
previous three months revenues. Efforts have been made to reduce outstanding
accounts and arrangements were made in 1973 with certain utilities to amortise
their accounts receivable over periods ranging from 36-60 months; on December
31, 1975, a balance of P 5.7 million remained from an original amount of P 23.4
million to be amortized. Consumers accounts receivable at end-1975 were P 92.3
million, excluding the unamortized balance remaining, or about four months'
billings. As NPC was unable to disconnect major consumers because of the
effect such action would have on the towns and areas served by delinquent
utilities, NPC did not meet the covenant by end-1976. Therefore, the relevant
covenant has been repeated in the Loan Agreement but the deadline date has
been extended to December 31, 1978.

Economic Analysis
35.       Electricity consumption in Luzon has shown a steady growth during
the last decade and the rate of household electrification increased from 35%
in 1970 to 46% in 1975. However, most of the people who enjoy electricity
live in the central part of Luzon including the Manila metropolitan area.
In the northern and sourthern part of the island only 15% of households
have an electricity supply provided largely by small, self-generating uti-
lities only for a limited time each day at high cost. To rectify the situa-
tion, NEA has embarked on an ambitious program of total electrification, but
its success depends heavily on availability of NPC's power. With the com-
pletion of the proposed project, almost the whole of Luzon except for few
remote areas will be covered by NPC's transmission grid and forty additional
large industries are expected to be connected to the grid by 1981. Thus, the
proposed project would substantially contribute to the country's total elec-
trification and industrialization program by providing low cost, reliable
power supplies throughout Luzon.
36.       Each of the 50 transmission subprojects has been reviewed and is
either the least cost alternative or the only solution available. The basic
design has been standardized by NPC to minimize the engineering, construction
and maintenance costs and a significant reduction in unit cost is unlikely to
result from further design modifications without jeopardizing equipment safety
and reliable operation of the system.
37.       Since the proposed project is a timeslice of NPC's transmission
expansion program in Luzon and forms a part of the generation-transmission-
distribution chain of power supply, it is very difficult to quantify benefits
attributable to the project. Therefore, an internal rate of return calcula-
tion has been made on the basis of NPC's overall investment program in Luzon
for the period 1977/82, including both generation and transmission. Efficiency
prices were used with all taxes and duties excluded and foreign exchange costs
shadow priced. Revenues based on the expected level of NPC's bulk supply
tariffs have been used for the benefit.
38.       The internal rate of return of NPC's program in Luzon for the 1977-82
period is estimated to be at least 10%. By using a discount rate of 12% which
is considered to approximate the opportunity cost of capital, the average cost
of power supply in Luzon was found to be 22.0 centavos per kWh, about 6% over
the expected average tariff of 20.7 centavos. This means that the bulk
tariffs designed to recover NPC's accounting costs would largely recover
the economic cost of power supply in future. The comprehensive tariff study
included in the proposed loan would examine in detail the sector costs on a
marginal cost basis and provide the Government with guidelines for setting a
rational power pricing policy for both bulk supply and retail sales (para 23).
Conclusion, Recommendations, Loan Conditions
39.       Recent policy decisions by the Government on the power sector have
clearly defined the objectives and strategies for the sector's development.
NPC has been given a major role and responsibility in the sector; the
country's economic development will to an important degree depend on NPC's
future performance; however, NPC has not yet fully adjusted itself to the new



- xi -
situation. Much needs to be done: technical capability needs to be rapidly
expanded to cope with the massive development program, financing needs to be
secured, planning improved, a comprehensive training program developed, and
sound public utility management introduced. The proposed loan would help
NPC to improve its overall institutional capability and also to extend power
supplies to industries and rural areas. Works involved in the physical
component of the project are ordinary ones, and project risks are no greater
than can normally be expected for this type of project. There may be some
risks associated with the institutional aspects of the project. However,
these are expected to be minimized as NPC has agreed on principles of mana-
gerial reform and has already taken various steps in the right direction. To
ensure achievement of the project objectives, particularly NPC's institution-
building efforts, the Bank staff will maintain close contact with NPC and the
Government regarding the overall power program and will closely review progress
on the project. The project is suitable for a Bank loan of $58 million equiv-
alent, with a term of 20 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace. Major cove-
nants include the appointment of a financial manager and a management advisory
team (para 21), implementation of the management reorganization (para 21),
implementation of the training program (para 22), the rate-of-return covenant
(para 32), and the debt limitation covenant (para 33).






Chapter 1   THE POWER SECTOR
General
1.01       The power sector in the Philippines has been complex, poorly co-
ordinated and uneven in performance and institutional strength. In 1970
there were 336 private and 122 public utilities. The Manila Electric Company
(MECO) dominated the private sector while the National Power Corporation (NPC)
was the largest public utility. MECO accounted for about 60%, and NPC 30% of
total electricity generated by utilities. Most of the other utilities distri-
buted power purchased from NPC or MECO, but some generated as well which
accounted for the remaining 10%. Of the 458 utilities, only about thirty sold
more than 5 GWh annually, and of about 350 generating plants which they owned,
only about twenty were larger than 1 MW in size. Services by small utilities,
particularly those which generated power, were substandard and very costly.
Because of the unavailability of a reliable power supply, some industries had
to resort to captive power plants to satisfy their needs.
1.02       The fragmented ownership of power generation and distribution
facilities became an increasingly important obstacle to the coordinated
development of the power sector in the main islands of the Philippines. The
Government, therefore, declared in Presidential Decree No. 40 of November,
1972 that the total electrification of the country was a national policy
objective which should be achieved by establishing island grids, integrating
generating systems and consolidating electric distribution franchise systems.
NPC was made responsible for the construction of national grids, the develop-
ment of all future generation supplying the grids and, ultimately for owning
and operating all generating facilities. MECO, presently the largest generat-
ing as well as distributing company, will eventually become only a distributing
utility; negotiations for transferring the bulk of MECO's generating and trans-
mission facilities to the Government are underway (para 1.04). The National
Electrification Administration (NEA), established in 1969, was made responsible
for integrating the distribution sector and extending power supplies to rural
areas. The Power Development Council (PDC), created in 1970, is the policy-
making body for the power sector responsible for formulating policies and
programs on power development and coordinating the activities of all organ-
izations connected with electric power, including approval of major power
projects and rate-making policy. PDC coordinates policy for NPC, NEA,
MECO and all other utilities. It is attached to the Department of Public
Works, Transport and Communications, to which NPC and NEA also report. The
Department Secretary is Chairman of PDC to ensure the coordination of the
Department and PDC. In March 1976 the Energy Development Board was created
to govern the exploration and development of primary energy resources, in-
cTuding geothermal energy, water, oil, gas and coal. Once a primary energy
resource is programmed or developed for electric power generation, PDC takes
over the reponsibility.
1.03      The new policy clearly defines intra-sectoral responsibilities,
in particular those of NPC and NEA. If properly implemented, the policy will
lead to better coordination in the development of the sector. Encouraging
signs of progress are already apparent; NPC has launched a massive generation



development program not only in Luzon where its activities were concentrated
in the past but also in Mindanao and the Visayas; NEA's efforts to establish
rural cooperatives for electrification have already produced positive results.
However, managerial, technical and financial capability to carry out this
ambitious program, particularly for NPC, has yet to be proven.
1.04      Government and MECO contracted in October 1975 that Government
would purchase MECO's Gardner, Snyder and Malaya I plants by March 1976, and
Malaya II when completed in 1979. NPC is expected to own and operate these
plants but may contract their operation to MECO. Agreement on the terms of
the takeover has not yet been reached. The delay has been due to agreeing to
the value of the plants which were to be sold at about 1975 market value for
the Gardner and Snyder plants, and at cost for the Malaya plants. Details
of settlement of the purchase price have not yet been agreed. On completion
of this transfer, MECO will be left with only old plant on a standby basis and
will purchase all of its power from NPC. It will become the largest distri-
buting utility in the country and its future capital expenditure will be for
distribution facilities only, a relatively small amount compared to NPC's
investment (para 1.10). No difficulty is anticipated in transferring plant
operating staff to NPC as salaries at these levels are competitive. Planning
and engineering staff have already formed a consulting firm.
Demand and Supply for Electric Power
1.05      Information about the generating capacities and energy production
of NPC and MECO is readily available (Annex 1.1), but a complete analysis
of past trends in the Philippine power sector is hampered by a lack of data
about the capacities and production of the small utilities and privately owned
plants. Based on information from various sources an estimate was made for
each region on the status of electricity supply in 1974 as shown below:

1.06      The electrification of the country has gathered momentum since
NEA embarked on its rural electrification program in 1970. NPC has also con-
tributed by expanding its transmission systems into rural areas financed
partly by the Fifth and Sixth Power Loans. The table below summarizes the
progress of electrification.

Large disparities among the three regions still exist. However, NEA's effort
to complete the "backbone" system 1/ by 1980 and to provide electricity to
all barrios 2/ in the country by 1984 will rectify the situation very rapidly.
Development Program
1.07      The lack of comprehensive data on past trends, particularly for
small utilities and self-generating industries, hinders a discussion of
the Philippines' future power requirements. However, based on available
informatior, an estimate was made of probable future trends in demand and
supply for each region.
1.08      The demand forecasts and development program for Luzon will be
discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 4. Present power supplies in the
Visayas and Mindanao rely largely on small utilities and private industries
with NPC supplying only 4% and 25% of total energy consumption, respectively.
Demands are presently suppressed. Potential demand growth is considered much
higher in these regions than in Luzon because of the very small starting base
and government's policy of promoting industrial development in the regions.
NPC has embarked on ambitious development programs both in the Visayas and
Mindanao to supply suppressed demands and to absorb the loads of existing
utilities and industries by phasing out small and inefficient plants. How-
ever, much will depend on NPC's capability to carry out such programs and the
demand growth will be largely determined by the rate of capacity increase.
1.09      Based on NPC's development program and assuming that the shares of
generation by small utilities and industries will decrease from the present
level of 30% to 15% of the total in 1985, the overall electricity production
in the country will increase at 10.7% per annum and generating capacity at
9.5% during the period 1974-85 as shown below:
1/   The "backbone" system is the main distribution system (13.8 kV)
linking all towns within each cooperative area.
2/   A barrio is the smallest administrative unit.

As can be seen from the table, significant changes are expected in the share
of power supply among regions as well as among utilities. Another drastic
change will take place in the source of electricity energy. The relative
importance of petroleum will decline to be replaced by hydro, geothermal and
nuclear as shown below:

1.10      The capital investment required for the proposed program is huge.
Since NPC is wholly responsible for generation and transmission, the bulk
of the sector's investment will be required by NPC; NEA, MECO and other
utilities will need relatively small amounts. It is estimated that NPC's



program would require for the period 1976-1983 investment outlays of about
$5.8 billion (P 43.9 billion) in current prices (including P 2.3 billion
for acquiring MECO's assets) divided among the three regions as follows:
P Millions      US$ Millions    %
Luzon                               28,652             3,820        65
Mindanao                              8,169            1,089        19
Visayas                               7,064              942        16
43,885            5,851       100
The above figures include price escalation at 8% per annum and interest during
construction. At 1976 prices the proposed program would require outlays of
about $4.4 billion (P 33.3 billion) compared with actual expenditures by NPC
of about P 1.6 billion during 1967-75, also at 1976 prices. Investments by
MECO and NEA through 1983 are expected to be about P 3.4 billion and P 3.3
billion respectively; investments in distribution by other utilities are not
known.
1.11      The financial implications of such an investment program are con-
siderable. NPC currently has the largest corporate asset base in the
Philippines, P 2.7 billion at end-1975; by end 1983, the asset base will be
P 32.0 billion at current prices (P 20.4 billion at 1976 prices). Because
of its large size, the high foreign exchange component and the limited funds
available domestically, the bulk of this program will have to be borrowed
abroad. It is estimated that 61% will be borrowed, corresponding to
the estimated foreign cost. NPC will require a significant increase in its
equity to enable such financing to be obtainable. The equity contribution in
addition to internal cash generation required to cover local costs would be
about P 15.3 billion (including P 2.3 billion to finance NPC's acquisition of
MECO's plants) in current prices or about one-third of the total program
during the period.

Chapter 2 THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
2.01      The Borrower of the proposed loan would be NPC, a stock corporation
fully owned by the Government. Its corporate powers are vested in a Board
of seven members including the General Manager who is Vice-Chairman. The
Chairman and members are Presidential appointees representing Luzon, Visayas,
Mindanao, labor and the business sector.
2.02      NPC was originally chartered to develop hydroelectric resources in
the country without much responsibility for coordinating and taking the ini-
tiative in the power sector development. In recent years, however, the
Government made several policy decisions to enlarge NPC's role and respon-
sibility in the sector. It authorized NPC to generate power from sources
other than hydroenergy, regionalized NPC's organization in 1971 to accelerate
electrification in Mindanao and the Visayas, and, in 1972, made NPC responsi-
ble for the development of all future generating facilities (para 1.02). In
view of its extended responsibility, NPC is now urgently required to strengthen
and expand its managerial capability to the level of a well organized utility.
2.03      NPC has its head office in Manila and three regional offices in
Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. Its organization, historically oriented for
executing a small number of projects, has been clearly deficient for carrying
out its expanded role. On the one hand, the head office has retained most of
the power on project-related matters such as project design, procurement and
contract administration, leaving little authority and freedom to regional
offices which have actually executed projects. This has tended to delay
project implementation. On the other hand, such important functions of uti-
lity management as formulation of long-range investment programs and system
operation have been almost entirely left to regional offices. This has led
to inadequate planning and coordination of utility activities.
2.04      NPC is aware of the organizational deficiencies and has already
taken certain remedial steps. A Corporate Planning Staff and a Human Re-
sources Development Division have been set up in the head office. The
Corporate Planning Staff has a staff function to advise the management on
long-range policy planning and to assist other departments and regional
offices in implementing such policies as approved by the management. It
has four functional divisions; finance and investment, power development,
management planning and management information. If properly staffed and
given expert advice during the initial stage, this would improve NPC's mana-
gerial capability considerably. The Human Resources Development Division,
which would be expanded into a department, is responsible for manpower
planning and training (para. 2.08). The present organization of NPC is
shown in Attachment (W.B. 16254). NPC is also approaching consultants
associated with an operating utility for management advisory services. The
team consisting of experts in each major field of utility management would
assist NPC in reorganization, orientation of the Corporate Planning Staff,
particularly in system planning, and execution of day-to-day operations.



- 8 -
The objective is not merely to recommend necessary managerial reforms but,
more importantly, to provide continuous, in-house assistance in implementing
such reforms. This is satisfactory to the Bank and funds to cover the foreign
exchange cost of such services are included in the proposed loan. During
negotiations, confirmation has been obtained from NPC that it will appoint
by October 1, 1977 such an advisory team on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank, and that it will implement the management improvement to be
recommended by the team and to be agreed between NPC and the Bank within twelve
months of such recommendations.
2.05      NPC, in the past, has been successful in obtaining foreign financing
for its investment program. However, due to weak financial management, efforts
have been concentrated on obtaining whatever foreign financing was available
without giving due consideration either to optimizing the development program
or to analyzing the financial consequences of the borrowings as obtained. In
view of huge financial requirements of NPC, agreement was reached during
negotiations that a highly qualified and experienced financial manager would
be appointed not later than December 31, 1977. It was further agreed that the
Bank would continuously review NPC's development program and overall financing
plan (para 5.13).
Manpower and Training
2.06      NPC had about 3,500 employees of all kinds as of June 1974.  The
number had grown to 5,842 by December, 1976 as the development program began
to gather momentum. In order to carry out its huge development program and
to successfully operate its business, NPC will have to expand its manpower
rapidly both in quantity and quality. The manpower study carried out by the
University of the Philippines (UP) estimates that over 10,000 employees of all
skills and disciplines will be needed by 1985, excluding MECO's plant operat-
ing staff who will transfer to NPC when Government acquires MECO's generating
plants.
2.07      Because of sporadic construction activities in the past, NPC relied
heavily on temporary staff, even for highly professional positions such as
senior engineers, in order to avoid high administrative costs during slack
periods. In December 1976, only 36% of the total of 5,842 employees were
permanent staff; the majority of the remainder were filling what should be
established positions. This policy, although prudent in the past, has led to
the present situation of under-staffing, particularly in the managerial and
supervisory category. NPC's management has taken a number of steps to improve
its capability. Salary scales and merit systems have been improved to make NPC
more competitive with private industry; specialized engineers have been trans-
ferred to NPC from other government agencies particularly in the nuclear and
geothermal fields; qualified engineering consultants have been employed to
meet the immediate needs for priority projects; and scholarship and training
programs, although in an unorganized manner, have been undertaken for NPC
staff. These measures have proven particularly effective in securing young
engineers and skilled workers.
2.08      Skilled and educated manpower is readily available in the country.
What is required of NPC is long-term manpower planning, a motivative personnel
policy and a comprehensive training program. NPC retained in 1976 a manpower



- 9 -
study team from the College of Public Administration of the UP who have
analyzed the present organization and manpower situation and projected future
manpower requirements, both in terms of quantity and quality. Their main
recommendations are (i) establishment of Human Resources Development Depart-
ment responsible for the overall manpower development program, (ii) a crash
training program for the period 1977-79 to build up engineering and management
skills, (iii) immediate review of personnel policies to better motivate and
mobilize employees and (iv) restructuring the NPC organization to ensure
better utilization of available manpower. The Human Resources Development
Department would be responsible for formulating a manpower development policy,
designing and administering training programs, conducting research on manpower
requirements, establishing a personnel information system and establishing and
managing an NPC training center. The recommendations clearly identify the
present deficiencies and need for future improvement of NPC's manpower policy.
NPC agrees with the recommendations in principle and has already created an
organizational unit for manpower development at division level, and recruited
the chief of the unit from the UP. The 1977-78 training program presently
under review by the NPC Board aims at improving technical and administrative
capability and developing desirable work attitudes through 28 training
courses for about 2,500 employees. During negotiations it has been agreed
that NPC would (i) establish by December 31, 1979 its training center, (ii)
prepare and submit to the Bank during the third quarter of each fiscal year a
detailed implementation schedule of the training program for the following
year, and (iii) review with the Bank during the first quarter of each fiscal
year the accomplishments on training during the preceeding year.
2.09      The proposed loan includes funds for financing the foreign exchange
cost of the training center to support NPC's long-term manpower development
program. Also included are funds for overseas training of 12-15 middle
management staff as a part of the crash program; they will be attached to
overseas utilities for the purpose of learning utility management practice.
The Asian Development Bank has also provided in its latest loan to NPC funds
for a short-term training program to strengthen NPC's engineering and project
management capability; this will supplement our efforts to assist NPC's train-
ing program.
Tariff Policy
2.10      Comprehensive tariff studies of the power sector have never been
made: the way in which the sector was organized in the past precluded such
a study. Large disparities exist in the tariff levels among regions and sup-
pliers. NPC, by its charter, has three different bulk tariffs for its Luzon,
Mindanao and Visayas regions (Annex 2.1). Tariffs in Mindanao are much lower
than in Luzon: 3.08 centavos (4.1 US mills) compared to 11.3 centavos (15.1
US.mills) per kWh including fuel surcharges in FY1975. Small utilities selling
electricity to ultimate consumers also have a wide range of operating costs
depending on such factors as the size of operation, load density, and source
of energy. Therefore, a residential consumer of a utility purchasing cheap
power from the NPC's hydropower system in Mindanao would be charged only 12
centavos per kWh while another residential consumer of a small self-generating
utility would have to pay as high as 80 centavos per kWh. The Bank has sug-
gested that a comprehensive study be made of the sector costs and tariffs on
a marginal cost basis to enable the Government to make decisions on the power



- 10-
pricing policy with full knowledge of the consequential cost of such policy.
It was felt that the local staff could carry out the study adequately, and
agreement was reached during negotiations that NPC would establish not later
than September 30, 1977 a special unit responsible for carrying out the tariff
study in collaboration with the Government and other utilities. The proposed
loan nevertheless include funds for financing costs of consultant services
in case specialized advice is required during the course of the study from
external consultants on a short term basis. In view of the importance of
and the Bank's interest in tariff structures, the Guarantee Agreement provides
for periodic review and consultation between the Bank and the Government on
tariff policy.
Audit
2.11       The Auditor-General is ex-officio auditor of NPC.  He appoints the
Auditor of the Corporation to carry out the audit work at NPC, a situation
previously accepted by the Bank. All transactions are checked prior to pay-
ment and the Auditor can stop payment, overriding the General Manager if he
thinks fit. Although NPC has an internal auditor in addition to the Corpo-
ration Auditor, the main audit concentrates on whether or not individual
transactions are covered by budgets giving less attention than is usual in
other utilities, to broad audit considerations. Undertakings have previously
been received that pre-auditing would be reconsidered but the system is time-
honored for all Government corporations in the Philippines. The Auditor is
employed full-time at NPC but is paid through the government payroll funded
by NPC. Pre-auditing coupled with the employment status of the Auditor makes
him a prima facie official of NPC, casting doubt on the independence and
objectivity of the audit. During negotiations it was agreed that the Govern-
ment would review its auditing procedures relating to NPC and implement, in
agreement with the Bank, a program to improve it by October 1, 1978. If the
audit is still u-nsatisfactory after the changes have been implemented, NPC
would be required to employ a public accounting firm of international standing
as auditors or financial consultants to report on the audit and the annual
accounts.

Chapter 3 DEMAND
Past Trends
3.01      The interconnected system in Luzon comprises the metropolitan Manila
area served by MECO and provincial areas of NPC. MECO's consumers can be
categorized into three major groups; residential, commercial and industrial,
each representing 26, 30 and 40% of the total consumption in 1973, with
the remaining 4% for street lighting and resale. NPC sold 36% of its total
energy to retail utilities, 45% to large industries and 19% to agricultural
and public demands in 1973. In the past MECO and NPC operated their systems
independently from each other, but with a certain amount of seasonal inter-
change of power between them.
3.02      After steady increases of consumption averaging about 13% per year
in the 1960s, the Luzon system shifted to a slower growth pattern with an
annual increase of less than 10% in the early 1970s.  Shown below is the past
trend of power consumption in Luzon:
NPC                        MECO                    Total
Year     Consumption Growth Rate  Consumption Growth Rate  Consumption Growth Rate
(GWh)        (%)         (GWh)          (%)           (GWh)        (%)
1960-1970     -           21.9          -            11.8           -           13.1
1971      1,403         19.0        5,289           5.4         6,692          8.0
1972      1,571         12.0        5,645           6.7         7,216          7.8
1973      1,799         14.5        6,082           7.7         7,881          9.2
1974      1,979         10.0        5,969          (1.9)        7,948          0.9
1975      2,228         12.6        6,493           8.8         8,721          9.7
In 1974, a drastic increase of MECO's tariffs and energy conservation measures
enforced by the Government resulted in an unprecedented decline of electricity
consumption in the Manila area. Most severely affected were residential
demands which registered a 10% decline in consumption over 1973 in spite of a
4% increase in number of customers. It is considered, however, that this was
a temporary phenomenon and the power demand will resume its growth pattern of
8-9% per year.
Future Forecast
3.03      The latest demand forecasts prepared by NPC and MECO in early 1976
are shown in Annex 3.1 and summarized below:

1975       2,228           -          6,493          -          8,721           -
(Actual)
1980       4,544         14.8         8,457         5.4        13,001          8.3
1985       8,344         12.9        11,315         6.0        19,659          8.6
The general trend continues to be a faster growth for NPC's provincial demand
than for MECO. This is a reflection of (a) saturating effects in MECO's
already congested franchise area, (b) the government policy of dispersing
industries to rural areas and (c) the government's ambitious program for rural
electrification. As a result MECO's share in energy consumption continues
to decline from 81% in 1970 and 75% in 1975 to 65% in 1980 and 58% in 1985.
3.04      NPC's provincial load comprises (a) small utilities who distribute
power to ultimate consumers, (b) large industrial consumers and (c) miscella-
neous load. Its forecast is based on (a) the past trend of existing utility
customers, (b) the transmission expansion program to connect new customers and
(c) information on future industrial customers obtained individually and from
the Board of Investment. The utility load is expected to grow at about 11%;
an increase of existing customers at 9% plus 2% contributed by new customers.
The industrial load will increase much faster than utility -- about 19% per
year during 1975-85. The high growth rate for the industrial demand is jus-
tified in view of planned dispersal of industries. The consumption pattern
will change significantly with industrial loads increasing from 42% of the
total sales in 1975 to 62% in 1985, utility loads from 36% in 1975 to 27% in
1985 and others from 22% to 11%, excluding sales to MECO.
3.05      In preparing its demand forecast, MECO utilized four different
approaches: (a) elasticity to economic variables, (b) time series, (c) mul-
tiple regression, and (d) international comparison. However, the final esti-
mates seem to be determined by largely relying on professional judgement. A
low growth rate of 4.8% assumed for industry is a reflection of the other side
of the industrial dispersal policy. Residential and commercial demands are
forecast to grow at 6.4% and 5.6% per year, respectively. This is considered
reasonable as a short-term forecast which inevitably reflects the setback
experienced in 1974, a 10.0% and 1.2% decline in consumption, respectively.
However, as a long-range forecast, it might be on the low side. A forecast
based on elasticity of residential power use to personal expenditures and of
commercial power use to service output (although MECO discarded the results as
unduly optimistic) predicts a growth rate of about 12% and 13%, respectively.
Nevertheless, MECO's forecast has been accepted as a conservative basis for
reviewing the future investment program.

Chapter 4 PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Development Program in Luzon
4.01      In response to the Government's policy of diversifying energy re-
sources and reducing dependence on imported oil, NPC formulated an ambitious
development program for the Luzon grid including MECO's franchise area. The
program envisages introduction of the first nuclear unit of 600 MW in the
early 1980s, development of about 500 MW of geothermal power and about 1,000
MW of hydropower generation by 1985. It does not include any fossil-fuel
thermal plant after the on-going Malaya 2 project.  The program is shown in
Annex 4.1 and summarized below:
/a
Luzon Grid Installed Generating Capacity
Type                        1975          1980          1985

/a   Includes presently isolated plant which will be connected
to the grid by 1980.
/b   Includes 300 MW of pumped-storage plant at Kalayaan.
Ic   Assumes retirement of 156 MW of old thermal plant.
4.02      The significance of the program is a change in the composition of
the energy source; oil-fired thermal would fall from 80% of the total in 1975
to 45% by 1985 to be replaced by hydro, geothermal and nuclear energy. Al-
though the objective of diversifying energy sources is reasonable, the program
involves certain risks, financially and technically. Hydro, geothermal and
nuclear projects, although more economical on a long-term basis, are more
capital intensive than conventional thermal projects and may create finan-
cial constraints which will hinder timely development of such projects.
These projects are also technically more complicated and require higher
contingencies, both in cost and scheduling, than thermal projects. In par-
ticular, sufficient geothermal steam may not be secured in time for the
planned development of geothermal generation. The program, therefore, needs
continuous review so that, should difficulties arise, adequate remedial
actions can be taken. It was agreed during negotiations that the Bank would
continuously review NPC's development program and overall financing plan
(para. 5.13).



- 14 -
4.03      In addition to the above-mentioned generating facilities, NPC
had, in 1976, about 3,300 km of transmission lines with voltage ranging
between 13.8 kV and 230 kV and about 900 MiVA of substation capacity to
supply 116 utility and 95 non-utility customers in Luzon. However, the
grid system is concentrated in the central Luzon area and people in northern
and southern Luzon areas do not enjoy a stable supply of electricity by NPC;
they either receive unreliable and costly power supplies by self-generating
small utilities or none at all. Although NEA is vigorously promoting the
rural electrification program throughout the country, this cannot be achieved
without rapid expansion of NPC's grid system into rural areas. The Bank has
been assisting the grid expansion under the Fifth and Sixth Power Loans by
financing about 1,100 km of transmission lines and about 1,200 MVA of sub-
station facilities. The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan has
provided funds for the first stage of grid expansion into the Cagayan
Valley in northern Luzon. These projects are expected to be completed by
1979. NPC plans to further expand its grid system to meet the growing
industrial demand and to supply cooperatives under NEA's rural electrifica-
tion scheme. The proposed project would make a further contribution to
NPC's grid expansion.
Project Description
4.04      The proposed project comprises:
(a) expansion of the transmission system in Luzon;
(b) the first stage of establishing communication systems
and a control center in Luzon;
(c) NPC's training activities; and
(d) consultants's services for management improvement
and a tariff study.
4.05      The transmission expansion project which covers the entire Luzon
region would build the following transmission and substation facilities:

/a   Although no transformer capacity would be added, some switchgear
installations are included in the project.



- 15 -
4.06      The 230 KV and 115 KV facilities either strengthen existing systems
which will be overloaded in a few years or provide a bulk supply of power to
areas which presently do not have power supply but expect rapid load develop-
ment mainly due to the establishment of new industries. The 69 KV lines will
extend NPC's power supply to rural areas where NEA is promoting rural electri-
fication schemes. NPC will deliver power at 69 KV to NEA which will install
the 69 KV substations; hence no 69 KV substation facilities are included in
the project. NPC and NEA have been closely coordinating their programs so
that timely power supply by NPC is available when NEA's system is ready for
operation. Details of the transmission expansion subprojects are shown in
Annex 4.2 and attached maps (IBRD 3562R3 and IBRD 3563R3).
4.07      Presently NPC does not have a control center and therefore the
operation of its power plants is based on predetermined generator loading
schedules. Telephone communication between the regional office and the power
plants is very limited and the monitoring of the power system is not avail-
able. This is an unusual situation for a system as large as the Luzon grid.
The proposed project would construct a microwave and power-line carrier net-
work linking all power plants and major substations, existing and to be
commissioned up to the end of 1981, and a central control center equipped
with system monitoring, data acquisition and remote control facilities.
Although a computerized system is essential to modern control techniques,
the timing and extent of its introduction require further study and review.
Provision is nevertheless made in the proposed loan for such a computer system
and agreement was reached during negotiations that NPC should seek Bank's agree-
ment on the scope of the control center as a condition of disbursement against
this item. Upon completion, the control center would continuously monitor and
supervise operation of all generating plants and major substations so that the
cost of system operation can be minimized, system security maximized and, in
case of system disturbances, service can be restored with the minimum effects
on consumers.
4.08      The training program and consultants' services for management im-
provement and the tariff study have been discussed in paragraphs 2.04-2.10.

The base cost shown above is in late-1976 prices and does not include customs
duties or taxes since NPC is exempt from such levies. The cost estimate for
the transmission expansion has been prepared by NPC based on recent bidding
experiences under the Fifth and Sixth Power Projects. The estimate for
the communication and control facilities has been prepared by NPC and its
consultants, Electrowatt of Zurich, who carried out a feasibility study
financed under the Sixth Power Loan. The costs for training and advisory
services are based on man-month requirement for such activities (para. 4.14)
except for the estimate for the training center which has been prepared
by NPC and the UP study team. The foreign component includes indirect foreign
costs of local contracts for civil works and erection. These include costs
for fuel, construction equipment and materials, and are estimated at 15% of
the total local contracts.
4.10      Physical contingencies of 15% on the local cost component and 5%
on the foreign exchange component have been provided. In addition a pro-
vision for the computer and telex system has been provided as a physical
contingency for the control center (para. 4.07). Price contingencies
have been applied at different rates; 9% for 1977-79 and 8% thereafter for
the local cost and 7.5% for 1977-79 and 7% thereafter for the foreign cost.
The overall price contingency thus calculated would amount to 30% of the pro-
ject cost including the physical contingency. In calculating contingencies,
percentages for the local cost were also applied to the indirect foreign cost.
Amount of Loan
4.11      The project's foreign exchange component of US$58.0 million equiva-
lent is about 63% of the total cost of US$92.3 million equivalent before
interest during construction. The proposed loan of US$58 million would cover
the full foreign exchange cost. The local cost would be financed by NPC.
Engineering and Construction
4.12      The transmission project which has been prepared by NPC consists
of a total of fifty (50) small and simple subprojects. NPC has gained
sufficient experience of this type of project through the implementation of
the Fifth and Sixth Power Projects and plans to carry out the engineering
and construction supervision of the transmission project using its own staff.
This is acceptable to the Bank.  However, NPC has agreed during negotiations
to appoint a project manager with adequate authority and responsibility, re-
porting directly to the Luzon regional manager.  This is considered necessary
to ensure adequate coordination and timely completion of the numerous subpro-
ject; NPC has normally given very limited responsibility to project managers
who report to the third level of management in regional offices. Contracts
for major equipment and materials would be on a supply basis and erection
would be carried out by local contractors.
4.13      Since NPC's experience in system control and communication is vary
limited, it intends to retain qualified engineering consultants for detailed
design, procurement and construction supervision. An assurance has been
obtained during negotiations that NPC will appoint such consultants on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The estimated foreign exchange cost
of consultants' services is US$0.93 million for 144 man-months at a unit
cost of $6,080 per man-month plus reimbursable costs.

4.14      NPC would be responsible for retaining consultants for advisory
services and selecting candidates and arranging courses for overseas train-
ing. The management advisory services would require 108 man-months of
experts' services during a three-year period at an unit cost of $6,000 per
man-month. The overseas training of NPC's middle management staff would be
carried out in four schedules; each schedule would have a six-month course
limited to 3 or 4 participants so that it would not jeopardize NPC's daily
business activities.
4.15      The transmission project would have a different construction
schedule for each subproject with completion ranging between mid-1980 and
end-1981. The communication system and the control center will be completed
by the end of 1981. Management advisory services would require three years,
the training center and overseas training would take two years and the
tariff study would be completed within one year. The project implementation
schedule is attached.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.16      Equipment and materials financed by the proposed loan will be pro-
cured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Since some of the project materials could be manufactured locally,
the loan documents should include the usual margin of preference for local
suppliers. Although the project consists of numerous subprojects, contracts
would be grouped into several packages large enough to attract foreign bidders.
Competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures is appropriate for
civil works and erection of the transmission lines, substations, control
center and training school because works involved are individually small and
physically scattered throughout Luzon and, therefore, would not attract
foreign firms. Bank staff have reviewed the local procedures and they are
acceptable.
4.17      The Bank loan would be disbursed against 100% of the foreign ex-
change cost of imported goods and services, 100% of the ex-factory price of
locally manufactured items procured under international competitive bidding,
15% of the total cost of contracts procured under local procedures and 100%
of the foreign exchange cost or 65% of the total cost, whichever is higher, of
consultants' services and overseas training. No disbursements would be made
retroactively. The estimated schedule of loan disbursements is shown below:

Environmental Aspects
4.18      No environmental problems are anticipated.  Transmission lines
mostly pass through rural and mountainous areas and compensation will be made
for rights-of-way. Air and water pollution problems will not arise.

Note:  1.  Reserve should not be smaller than the larger of (1) 22% of peak demand or (2) the sum of the largest class and the second largest class unit in operation.
However, this criteria can not be satisfied in the near future.
2.  Capacity shown is net dependable capacity.
3.  The Kalayaan plant was assumed to operate 6 hours a day, 6 days a week, 26 weeks a year during the dry season, at an overall efficiency of 0.7.  Thus the
plant would be a net consumer of 120 GWh per year.
4.  The sequence of future hydro development is tentative and subject to change after detailed studies and priority assessments. Tabu in 1983 will be replaced by Magat (268 MWM991 GWh).
5.  The nuclear plant was assumed to be dependable for only 80% of the rated capacity during the initial two years of operation. NPC hopes to commission the Bagac nuclear
plant in 1982 which is considered optimistic.

Chapter 5 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
5.01      NPC had a chequered financial history until late 1972 when martial
law was declared. Prior to that year legal action by the Philippine Electric
Plant Owners Association (a group of privately-owned utilities) had delayed
or reduced approved tariff increases causing NPC to have cash problems. These
problems were not as serious as they would have been had NPC been responsible
for meeting projected load growth rather than financing selected hydropower
projects. Since 1972, a fuel adjustment clause has been introduced into its
tariff structure and three tariff increases in 1972, 1973 and 1974 have main-
tained the operating ratio at around 50%. The rate of return on currently
valued net fixed assets in operation improved from 4.5% to 6.4% over the
period FY71-75 -- a creditable performance in the situation prevailing fol-
lowing the fuel crisis. The debt/equity ratio at December 31, 1975 1/ was
24/76 mostly due to conversion of government debt into stock, a move made to
put NPC into a good position to obtain foreign borrowing to finance its large
construction program. The current ratio at end-1975 was 2.8 excluding from
current liabilities, current maturities of long term debt. NPC was in a
satisfactory position at December 31, 1975; Income Statements and Balance
Sheets, 1971 through 1975 are shown in Annexes 5.1 and 5.2.
Future Position
5.02      The tariff increase estimated to be needed to earn the covenanted
rate of return of 8% for FY76 was not put into operation on July 1, 1975, as
proposed by NPC; Government failed to authorize its implementation. A tariff
increase of about 35% was implemented in October 1976 and the rate of return
estimated for 1976 is 3.5%. The rate of return to be earned in 1977 is
dependent on the date of takeover of MECO's plants as the tariff charged to
MECO for bulk power will require revision at that time. Negotiations on the
purchase price of the plants are not yet concluded and the takeover date is
not known. The financial forecasts assume that starting January 1, 1978 the
plants will be operated by NPC and MECO will purchase its total power require-
ments from NPC. With a tariff increase only having been imposed in November
1976, it is considered politically unacceptable to impose another soon; no
increase is therefore assumed for FY77 and the rate of return is estimated
at 5.3%.
5.03      NPC requires substantial funds to meet construction costs of
P 43.9 billion (US$5.8 billion) in the period 1976-83. On the assumption
that the bulk of the foreign cost would be borrowed, P 26.9 billion (US$3.6
billion) or 61 percent would come from abroad. About P 13 billion (US$1.7
billion) of foreign loans have already been arranged and the Bank's 1976
Economic Report estimates that the total foreign borrowings can be raised.

5.04      The gap of P 17.0 billion (US$2.2 billion) will need to be raised
within the Philippines, as NPC's credit-worthiness will be required for
foreign borrowing and to refinance loans for the first nuclear plant, some of
which are due for repayment during the construction period and the remainder
between 1987 and 1991. An injection of equity by Government will be necessary
as the rapid increase in construction expenditures precludes the gap being
covered by cash generation; the tariffs required to do so would be unbearably
high. Based on these assumptions and an 8% rate of return on revalued net
fixed assets, the financing plan is as follows:
Financing Plan: FY76-83
P Billions     US$ Billions    %
Internal Cash Generation                     11.1               1.5         25

Borrowings                                   26.9               3.6         61
Equity                                       15.3              2.0          35
Construction Expenditure                     43.9               5.8        100
5.05      The contribution to construction of 4% is low by normal standards.
However, construction expenditures are abnormally high compared to the asset
base both due to the fact that Government has embarked on a deliberate policy
of spreading electricity throughout the provincial areas of the country which
are poorly served; and concurrently, has adopted a policy of diversifying from
fuel-oil based generation, a policy that requires capital intensive programs
although they are the "least cost" economically. Assumptions included in the
forecasts also tend to depress the contribution. Refinancing of about
P 2 billion (US$267 million) of debt for the nucleat plant which falls due
for repayment FY81-83, would increase the contribution to construction by
about 3% for the seven-year priod through FY83; and exclusion of the cost of
MECO's plants from NPC's construction expenditure would also increase the
contribution by about 3%.
5.06      Government faces hard decisions about tariff levels.  The higher the
internal cash generation, the lower the demands on the Government budget for
equity contributions. Accordingly, the rate of return should be the highest
feasible. A 12% rate of return would increase the contribution to construction
to 13% and reduce the equity input to P 11.7 billion (US$1.6 billion). The
following table shows the highlights of the situation at 8%, 10% and 12% rates
of return.

/a Escalation is 8% per annum.
5.07      The level at which the rate of return should be fixed is dependent
both on the amount Government can allocate- to NPC from the budget through 1983
and on the highest politically acceptable level to which the tariffs can be
raised; the required decision can only be made by the Philippines authorities.
An 8% rate of return on revalued net operating assets would assure tariffs at
a level that would charge reasonable costs of supply to consumers over the
next two or three years. Percentage tariff increases required to achieve an
8% rate of return are as follows:
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983
Luzon (%)               23      13      11       11       8       4
Mindanao (%)           282      39       4        6      13       0
Visayas (%)             39       0       4        3       9       2
A 10% rate of return would require an additional 5% for Luzon, 8% for Mindanao
and 5% for Visayas. During negotiations it was agreed that the rate of return
covenant would continue at 8% with a provision for consultation with the Bank
during 1979 on the feasibility of adjusting the rate of return for future
years.
5.08      The current rate of return covenant provides that NPC's net fixed
assets in operation be appraised by independent valuers every four years to
ensure that the rate-base revaluation as updated annually by indices, is rea-
sonable. It was agreed during negotiations to continue this provision.
Future Operating Results
5.09      Energy sales are estimated to increase from 3399 GWh in 1976 to
24,849 GWh in 1983, the large increase being partially due to NPC's sales
tripling to 13,467 GWh in 1978 when MECO's plants are acquired. Based on
the tariffs required to yield a rate of return of 8% after 1977 on revalued



D45/A-13
- 23 -
net fixed assets in operation, revenues are forecast to increase from P 343
million (US$46 million) in 1976 to P 8,346 million (US$1,113 million) in 1983;
operating expenses after escalation at 8% per annum are estimated to increase
from P 271 million (US$36 million) in 1976 to P 6,482 million (US$864 million)
in 1983.
5.10      NPC's capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the fore-
cast period based on assumptions that the rate base will be revalued at an
escalation rate of 8% per annum and that the peso will maintain its current
value (US$1.0 = P 7.5) through the forecast period so that foreign long-term
debt will not require to be revalued. The debt equity ratio is estimated to
vary between 39/61 (1976) and 46/54 (1981) leaving a margin for revaluation of
debt and additional borrowing to refinance short-term loans for the nuclear
project.
5.11      The current ratio has varied in the past between 1.8 (1971) and 3.8
(1975). Consumers receivables at end-1975 were about 3.8 months billing which
is too high. They have been forecast at 3.6 months through 1977, 3 months for
1978-79, 2.5 months for 1980-81 and 2.0 months thereafter. Inventory levels
are about 11.3% of gross plant and are too high. NPC is taking steps to
reduce this item; inventories have been projected at about 5% of gross plant.
Payables have been forecast at about I month's cash expenditures for operating,
construction and interest. Year-end cash balances are adequate throughout the
period of the forecast. The current ratio remains above 2.0 throughout the
forecast period, a satisfactory position. Income Statements, Funds Flow State-
ments and Balance Sheets for each of the regions - Luzon, Mindanao and Visayas
and consolidated for NPC as a whole - at escalated prices are shown in Annexes
5.3 through 5.14, and assumptions for the forecast in Annex 5.15.
Debt Control
5.12      Debt service coverage on an annual basis is predicted to average
about 1.5 times, a satisfactory position. The current debt control covenant
provides that except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree in-
ternal cash generation of the past fiscal year or a later 12-month period
prior to the incurrence of debt shall not be less than 1.3 times future
maximum debt service on all loans incurred. The covenant was intended to
provide a test which would cause the Borrower to consult the Bank before
incurring debt, when the test is not met. Debt is defined as incurred at
the time a debt instrument is executed. NPC has not met the test for some
years. Differences have arisen between the Borrower and the Bank because
NPC has failed to give the Bank sufficient notice of debt being incurred,
on occasions because Government has signed agreements for bilateral aid
on NPC's behalf; in some cases the projects financed from such loans have
not been proven as part of the most economic program of system development.
Strict application of the test would require the Bank's concurrence to each
of the numerous loans which will require to be incurred to finance NPC's
large development program.
5.13      What is needed in the circumstances is a covenant which would
give adequate freedom to NPC to manage its debt while providing for Bank
review of project financing. It has therefore been agreed that:



D45/A-14
- 24 -
(a)  NPC shall submit annually a copy of its development
program with the supporting ten-year financial plan to
the Bank for review.
(b)  NPC shall only undertake or execute any new major project,
make any new major investment, or acquire any major asset
(defined as those exceeding $50 million) after having
obtained the agreement of the Bank that such project, in-
vestment or asset (i) forms part of the least cost develop-
ment program; (ii) will be undertaken or acquired through
means which will ensure a reasonable cost; and (iii) will
be financed under a reasonable financing plan; and
(c)  Except as the Bank and the Borrower shall from time to
time agree, the Borrower shall not incur short and medium
term debt including temporary Bank accommodations, overdrafts
and bonds, if by such incurrence the Borrower's total out-
standing short and medium term indebtedness would exceed a
sum equivalent to US$50 million equivalent. For the purposes
of this section short and medium term debt means debt maturing
by its terms within 5 years.
Receivables
5.14      NPC has undertaken in the agreement for Loan 1034-PH that out-
standing accounts for electricity supplied will not exceed the previous three
months' revenue by Deceber 31, 1976. This understanding was an extension
of a similar undertaking in Loan 809-PH that NPC failed to achieve by
June 30, 1973. Efforts have been made by NPC to reduce outstandings and
arrangements were made during 1973 with certain utilities to amortise their
old outstandings over periods ranging from 36-60 months: the original
amount of P 23.4 million to be amortised had been reduced to P 5.7 million
by the end of 1975. Consumers outstanding of P 92.3 million at December 31,
1975 were about 3.8 months' billings, excluding the balance unamortised.
Because NPC was unable to disconnect major consumers due to the effect such
action would have on the towns and areas served, NPC did not meet the covenant
by December 31, 1976. The problem will resolve itself as NEA acquires more
and more private and municipal utilities, paying off old outstanding accounts
against the asset purchase price and meeting current bills on time. Meantime,
it was agreed to repeat this covenant in the loan agreement and extend the
deadline date to December 31, 1978.

NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION
Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
1.   Revenues
Revenues have been forecast on the average tariffs required to
give a rate of return of 8% on net fixed assets revalued at a rate of 8% per
annum, except for 1976-1977 where an increase in the average tariff of 35%
has been assumed for the last four months of 1976 and for the whole of 1977.
2.   Fuel Costs
Fuel prices have been assumed at P 0.1309/kWh (US mills 17.45)
for new thermal stations (Bataan I and thereafter) and at P 0.15/kWh
(US mills 20.0) for older stations (Gardner and Snyder). Diesel fuel
costs have been assumed at P .15/kWh (US mills 20.0). Steam fees pay-
able to PGI are 5.45 US mills/kWh generated (P 0.041). Nuclear fuel has
been assumed at P 0.03/kWh (US mills 4.03) in accordance with Westing-
house estimates. Escalation of 8% per year has been assumed.
3.   Operating and Maintenance Costs
These costs have been assumed as follows:
(i) hydro stations at P 26.6/KW installed - the 1975 cost
of NPC's hydro operations;
(ii) Bataan 1 thermal station at P 55.1/KW - NPC's cost
for 1975;
(iii) all other thermal stations at 2% of capital cost;
(iv) geothermal at P 9.8 million per year for each 55 MW
as estimated by NPC in conjunction with PGI;
(v) transmission at 1.5% of capital costs;
(vi) administration at 2% of total operating and
maintenance; and
(vii) escalation at 8% per year.



ANNEX 5.15
Page 2 of 2
5.   Construction Expenditures
Construction expenditures are based on estimates prepared by NPC in
April 1976 at 1976 prices using the development programs agreed with the Bank
in November 1975. Escalation at 8% per year has been assumed except for the
proposed Bank and nuclear projects for which the Bank and Westinghouse esti-
mates have been taken respectively.
6.   Depreciation
Depreciation is on a straight-line method calculated on asset
categories (NPC's 1975 rates) as follows:
Hydro Plant              -    1.57%
Thermal Plant            -    3.03%
Diesel Plant             -    5.51%
Geothermal Plant         -    3.33%
Geothermal Wells         -   10.00%
Nuclear Plant            -    3.33%
Transmission             -    3.46%
7.   Acquisition of MECO Plants
Government and MECO agreed in October 1975 that Government would
purchase MECO's Gardner, Snyder and Malaya I plants by March 1976, and
Malaya II when completed in 1979. The delay was due to valuing the plants
which were to be sold at about 1975 market value for the Gardner and Snyder
plants, and at cost for the Malaya plants. The purchase price when agreed
will be settled by Government taking over some of MECO's foreign debts and
signing notes for the equity in the plants.
The forecasts assume Government will acquire the plants by
January 1, 1978, and pass them to NPC without NPC having to assume the
debt burden. Neither the purchase price nor the amount of debt to be
taken over by Government has yet been agreed; the forecasts show the plants
being acquired at MECO's asking price of P 2.3 billion.
8.   Forecast External Sources
Projected sources of finance are shown in Annexes 5.16, 5.17, and
5.18 together with the terms and conditions of the loans. No additional
local loans have been assumed on the premise that NPC will require all its
borrowing capability to raise the foreign costs of its projects.
9.   Geothermal Wells and Supply of Steam
The contract with PGI provides for NPC to pay PGI US mills 4.55/kWh
(in addition to the US mills 5.45 treated as fuel costs above) for each batch
of wells to cover repayment of initial exploration and development, PGI's
share of operating expenses and the drilling of maintenance wells. These
amounts have been treated as repayment of the borrowings for initial develop-
ment and continuing expenditure on maintenance wells and other expenses.

Chapter 6 - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01       Electricity consumption in Luzon has shown a steady growth during
the last decade and the rate of household electrification progressed from 35%
in 1970 to 46% in 1975. However, most of the people who enjoy electricity
live in the central part of Luzon including the Manila metropolitan area.
In the northern and southern part of the island only 15% of households have
an electricity supply provided largely by small, self-generating utilities
only for a limited time each day at high cost. Responding to the Government's
policy of total electrification, NEA has embarked on an ambitious program
which aims at building distribution "back bone" systems to supply all towns
by 1980 and providing electricity to all villages in the country by 1984.
NEA plans to install its own generating facilities in areas where power
supply by NPC will not be available for some time to come, but in Luzon it
relies almost entirely on NPC's power. With the completion of the proposed
project almost the whole of Luzon except for a few remote areas will be
covered by NPC's transmission grid and additional forty (40) large industries
will be connected to the grid by 1981. Thus, the proposed project would
substantially contribute to the country's total electrification and industria-
lization program by providing low cost, reliable power supplies throughout
Luzon.
6.02       Each of the fifty (50) transmission subprojects has been re-
viewed carefully and it has been confirmed that it is either the least cost
alternative or the only solution available. The basic design has been stand-
ardized by NPC to minimize the engineering, construction and maintenance costs
and a significant reduction in unit cost is unlikely to result from further
design modifications without jeopardizing equipment safety and reliable
operation of the system.
Return on Investment
6.03       Since the proposed project is a time slice of NPC's transmission
expansion program in Luzon and forms a part of the generation-transmission-
distribution chain of power supply, it is difficult to properly quantify
benefits attributable to the project. Therefore, an internal rate of return
calculation has been made on a long-range program basis, rather than on a
project-basis. The program chosen is NPC's overall investment program in
Luzon for the period 1977-82 (Annex 41.), including both generation and
transmission. Efficiency prices have been applied, as is normally the case
for a power project, by excluding taxes and duties and by valuing foreign
exchange at 10% above the official rate. Revenues based on NPC's bulk supply
tariffs have been used for the benefit stream. Details of the calculation are
shown in Annex 6.1
6.04       The calculation has shown that the average tariff of P 0.207 per kWh
which would earn NPC a 10% yield on its net fixed assets in operation for 1982
would give an internal rate of return of 10% which is probably lower than the
opportunity cost of capital for the Philippines. Since the program covers a
6-year period starting in 1977 and all costs incurred to supply incremental
demands are included in the calculations, resulting costs per kWh of electricity
sold would represent the long run marginal cost of power at the discount rate

applied to the cost and revenue streams. By using a discount rate of 12%
which is considered to approximate the opportunity cost of capital, the
average economic cost of power supplied to the Luzon grid has been found to
be P 0.220 per kWh, i.e. about 6% over the expected level of P 0.207. This
would mean that bulk tariffs designed to recover NPC's accounting costs would
largely, though not fully, recover the economic cost of bulk power supply in
future.
Power Supply Cost and Tariffs
6.05      As discussed in paragraph 2.10, the tariff system in the Philip-
pines is complex and diverse. A random sampling of average prices per kWh
sold by retail utilities and cooperatives in Luzon shows a wide variety as
shown below:
Sampling of Average Price of Electricity in 1974 (centavos per kWh)
NPC customer                Self-Generating
MECO   24.6    Small Utility A  22.6         Small Utility  G  79.9
B  25.9                       H  83.2
C  12.8                       J  57.4
K 55.4
Cooperative   D   17.4
E   28.9
F   22.5
Although the expected bulk supply tariff level of P 0.207 per kWh is about
20% above the average unit price of P 0.173 at the end of 1976 and would
affect the final cost to consumers by roughly 10-15%, this would still be
considerably lower than the cost to consumers of self-generating utilities.
Electricity consumption is relatively inelastic to price and a 10-15% increase
in price is not considered to significantly discourage the growth of consump-
tion. Moreover, the on-going expansion program of transmission grids would
help reduce electricity tariffs drastically in areas presently served by
self-generating utilities, and, therefore, would further accelerate power
consumption.
6.06      Although NPC's tariffs are expected to roughly cover the long run
marginal cost of bulk power supply, it would not be sufficient to ensure an
optimal rate of expansion of the sector, which in fact requires that retail
prices reflect the level and structure of marginal costs of generation trans-
mission and distribution. Retail utilities who supply ultimate consumers are
permitted to earn a rate of return of up to 12% on their net fixed assets
in operation, but it is not clear whether their present tariffs reflect the
marginal cost of supply to consumers. NEA's cooperatives set their tariffs at
a level which would generate sufficient cash to cover operating expenses
during the initial stage of operation and, after the grace period of loans,
would enable them to cover all operating costs and debt service. The proposed
tariff study which would cover the whole power sector would review the situa-
tion, analyse the cost of power supplies and recommend tariff policies which
would promote better use of resources and contribute to sound development of
the sector (para 2.10).

Average revenue per kWh sold was calculated at P 0.207 in the 1976 price
level which would enable NPC to earn a 10% return on its net fixed assets
in operation in 1982.

(b) Operation and Maintenance Cost (O/M)
Incremental O/M costs were taken as a percentage of capital
costs for new facilities as follows:
hydro plants - 1% with 0.3% in foreign and
0.7% in local component.
thermal and geothermal plants - 3% with
2% in foreign and 1% in
local component.
transmission facilities - 1.5% with 0.3%
in foreign and 1.2% in local
component.
For geothermal plants, in addition to normal O/M costs,
costs of maintenance wells and a service fee to geothermal
contractors, Philippines Geothermal Inc., had to be added.
The total O/M cost of geothermal generation was calculated
at US 7.86 mills per kWh generated, of which US 5.18 mills
would be a service fee to PGI; the foreign component was
US 6.63 mills and the local cost US 1.23 mills equivalent
for each kWh generated. Streams of the O/M cost are shown
below:

It was assumed that the system would be operated in such a way
as to minimize the fuel cost except that the Kalayaan plant
would be operated to supply the peak demand during the dry
season. The yearly operation pattern thus determined is

Hydro and geothermal generation bear no fuel costs.
Fuel costs for thermal A, B and thermal C were
calculated at US 19 mills, US 20 mills and US 21
mills per kWh, respectively.
5.         Internal Economic Return (IER)
Present values in 1977 of the cost and benefit stream for
different discount rates are shown below:
(in Peso million)
Discount Rate                 5%       7.5%        10%       12.5%       15%

The IER for the Luzon system investment was found to be 10.0%.  In order
to obtain an IER of 12%, the average tariffs would have to be raised from
P 0.207 per kWh to P 0.220 per kWh, or by 6%.
