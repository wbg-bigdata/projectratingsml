HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Project and Credit Summary
Borrower:                 Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Amount:                   US$1.7 million
Terms:                    Standard
Project Description:     The project would assist the Government to formulate
an integrated program for the development of the
forest resources of the Hazara region of the North
West Frontier Province (NWFP). To that end, the
project would help to develop improved technologies
in reforestation, reinforce the Forest Department of
the NWFP and other agencies, and prepare follow-up
projects for large-scale reforestation and an inte-
grated pulp and paper industry. The project would:
select suitable areas for large-scale reforestation
by systematic site assessment; update inventory of
existing forests; plant 2,000 ha of pilot plantations
with back-up research trials and a genetic improve-
ment program; finance a training program; develop
working arrangements to embrace private small-scale
forest owners in future development; finance pulping
tests and a feasibility study to define the type,
configuration and timing of pulp and paper industrial
development; and set up a management unit to coor-
dinate activities and prepare follow-up projects.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO PAKISTAN
FOR THE HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Pakistan in an amount equivalent to US$1.7 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a pre-investment project in the Pakistan
Forestry Sector. Approximately US$950,000 would be made available by GOP
as a grant to the Government of the North West Frontier Province.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.        The most recent economic report "Pakistan:    Current Developments
and Issues" (No. 1423-PAK, dated March 15, 1977) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on March 21, 1977. Country data sheets are attached as
Annex I.
3.        The economic development of Pakistan since 1970 compares some-
what unfavorably with the record of rapid growth of output and exports of the
1960's. Starting with the war with India and the separation of Bangladesh,
there followed a series of poor monsoons and floods, and consequently poor
harvests. Added to this were the twin effects of deteriorating terms of
trade and world recession. The magnitude of the problem was intensified by
the loss of momentum of the "green revolution" which had been one of the
mainstays of the favorable economic period of the late 1960's. In addition,
industrial development was discouraged by changed attitudes toward the pri-
vate sector and a series of nationalizations, beginning with the nationali-
zation of a large part of private industry in 1972. As a result, the basic
productive sectors have had an average growth of about 2% per year since
1970, although total GDP has grown by about 4% per annum because of the rapid
expansion of construction, government and other service industries.
4.        Performance in FY1977 continued to be disappointing.    While a record
crop of wheat, rice and sugar cane were realized in FY1977, the cotton crop
was damaged by unusually heavy rains and severe flooding in August, 1976. In
addition, the political disturbances in April and tMay 1977 resulted in the
closing of factories and the loss of about two months of production. Overall,
preliminary indications are that there was little or no real growth of output
in FY1977, and a substantial increase in the budget deficit. Even though the
large balance of payments deficit has not increased over last year, a substan-
tial drawdown in reserves was necessary in FY1977. While the inflation rate
was officially 9% during the year, the true amount of inflation may have been
greater.
1/   Parts I and II are similar with Parts I and II of the President's
Report on the Hill Farming Technical Development Project.



- 2 -
5.        The stagnation of agricultural production during the 1970's con-
trasts with the rapid growth attained during the 1960's. The slowdown is
the result of many factors, including unfavorable growing conditions, a
slower rate of adoption of high-yielding varieties and adverse pricing
policies. Considerable output increases are possible in the medium term
from the further extension of the "green revolution" technology, specific-
ally through increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, improved seeds
and further development of the groundwater potential. Sustainable growth
in the longer term will require more fundamental change in on-farm practices
regarding land and water management, particularly in terms of increasing
the efficiency of the water course distribution systems. Central to im-
proved farmer techniques is an upgraded, more effective extension service,
with greater emphasis on reaching the small farmer, and with better linkages
to an effective research program. In order to increase the basic product-
ivity of the land, a major effort needs to be made to increase investments
in projects designed to reverse waterlogging and salinity. The poor record
in agriculture should not obscure some genuine progress in certain areas.
Fertilizer use has risen by 60% in the past two years, and wheat production
is nearing the point of self-sufficiency. Exports of minor agricultural crops
to the Middle East are increasing. In the case of cotton, however, production
has declined because of adverse weather, insect attacks, and an inadequate
program of pest control, and this has tended to depress the overall results
for the agricultural sector.
6.        For the next few years, further improvements from the extension
of the "green revolution" technology can be expected, particularly through
increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, improved seeds and further devel-
opment of the groundwater potential. Growth thereafter will require more
fundamental change in on-farm practices regarding land and water management,
particularly in terms of increasing the efficiency of the watercourse distri-
bution system. Central to improved farmer techniques is an upgraded, more
effective extension service, with greater emphasis on reaching the small
farmer, and with better linkages to an effective research program. In order
to increase the basic productivity of the land, a major effort needs to be
made to increase investments in projects designed to reverse waterlogging
and salinity.
7.        After agriculture, which accounts for about 32% of GDP, manufacturing
is the second largest sector of the economy, contributing about 16% of GDP and
50% to 60% of total exports. Since 1973, the major change in the industrial
sector has been the expansion of public sector involvement, from about 10%
to about 25% of industrial assets. In January 1972, the Government took over
31 private companies in 10 basic industrial categories. This was followed by
takeover of the vegetable ghee industry, the cotton and rice export trade,
commercial banks, shipping, life insurance and gas and oil distribution.
In July 1976 the Government nationalized the larger units in rice and flour
milling, as well as all of the cotton gins. These actions have adversely
affected the climate for private investment, particularly in the industrial
sector. Rice and flour mills and some cotton gins have recently been returned
to their former owners.



- 3 -
8.        While industrial growth averaged close to 10% per annum during the
1960's, since 1970 it has been only about 3% per annum. The decline in the
growth rate is a result of a number of factors including lower private
investment during the late 1960's and early 1970's and the problems with agri-
cultural production which reduced the availability of some raw materials.
Since FY74, the international recession has had a major impact by reducing
demand for Pakistan's exports, particularly textiles. Output of both cotton
yarn and cloth is estimated to have been lower in FY76 than in FY74.
9.        Exports have remained depressed for the past few years in part
because of the international recession while imports have increased rapidly.
Import prices increased 45% in FY74 and 48% in FY75, but in FY74 the rise was
offset by increases in major export prices, particularly of cotton and rice.
In FY75 the full effect of earlier petroleum price increases, combined with
falling export prices for most products, produced a 37% decline in the terms
of trade, although a slight improvement is estimated to have taken place
in FY76. As a consequence of these developments, the deficit on the current
account of the balance of payments increased from $130 million in FY73, an
exceptionally good year, to $950 million in FY76. Preliminary figures in-
dicate that it rose further to US$1.1 billion in FY77. These large deficits
have been financed by expanded borrowings from foreign sources. Domestic
resource mobilization, on the other hand, has declined markedly, with the
overall savings rate falling from about 10% of GDP in 1973 to 4% in FY75, and
public savings turning negative. Although there *was some improvement during
the past two years, overall savings amounted to only 7%, and public savings
to 2%, of GDP in 1977. The decline in private savings can be traced to lower
corporate profits as well as the lag of interest rates behind the rate of
inflation. Annual price increases averaged over 20% during 1973-75 but
bank deposit interest rates only 7-8%. While the rate of inflation has been
brought down to around 9% during the past two years, deposit rates have been
around 9.5%. Real interest rates have therefore been barely positive.
10        In the past few years the contribution of the public sector to
domestic savings has been unsatisfactory. Recently, a number of steps
have been taken to improve public sector resource mobilization, including
substantially higher prices of electric power, cement, petroleum products,
railway and air fares, and import tariffs. Steps have also been taken to
simplify the income tax and improve its enforcement. Subsidies of various
types which amounted to Rs 3 billion in FY75, or about 15% of current gov-
ernment expenditures, are estimated to have been reduced to Rs 0.6 billion
in FY77. These revenue efforts have not been sufficient, however, to fully
meet the Government's increased spending. In FY77 the overall budget deficit
was Rs 5.6 billion.
11.       Since FY72, the Government has attempted to increase output through
a program of investments in infrastructure, industry and the social sectors.
A large number of projects in heavy industries, chemicals and fertilizers
have been started, as well as substantial new investments in power and trans-
port. While the rate of investment has increased, the long lead times
associated with these projects has reduced their impact on present production



- 4 -
levels. Despite stagnant domestic output and low saving levels, and dete-
riorating terms of trade, the Government was able to continue, and even
accelerate this investment program because of the generous assistance being
received from abroad, particularly from the OPEC countries. However, the
balance of payments deficits in recent years have exceeded the amount
of external assistance available on suitably concessionary terms by a
substantial margin. This is likely to persist if the level of investment
envisaged in the current draft Plan is carried out. The Government is at
present considering possible adjustments to bring investment more closely in
line with available domestic and foreign resources.
12.       By the end of FY77 the total debt outstanding, excluding undis-
bursed amounts, was about $6.6 billion. Debt relief given by the Consortium
countries reduced debt service payments in FY77 to a level equivalent to
only 15% of export earnings and workers' remittances. Rising foreign
exchange remittances from Pakistan nationals working abroad (estimated at
about US$600 nillion in FY77) are expected to continue to temper the increase
in the debt service ratio. Nonetheless, the debt service ratio is expected
to climb to about 18% by FY78 and will go higher thereafter, since the end
of debt relief arrangements will coincide with a sharp increase in repayments
owned to the OPEC countries. With this prospect, Pakistan obviously needs to
exercise great care in protecting its ability to borrow to meet its future
requirements. It clearly cannot afford to continue to borrow on commercial
terms and therefore will have to tailor its plans and programs to the avail-
ability of external finance on suitable terms. For this reason the major part
of Bank Group lending to Pakistan consists of IDA credits. Rough estimates
suggest that, within an appropriate framework of policies and programs,
Pakistan should be able to make substantial progress towards its development
objectives, including improvements in the standard of living of its people,
while containing its debt service ratio to 20%. Pakistan's debt to the Bank
and IDA at the end of FY76 was about 18% of its external public indebtedness;
by 1980 this ratio is likely to fall to about 11%. The share of the Bank
Group in total debt service (after taking account of the debt relief which
Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about 17%, but is expected
to decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
13.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.6 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all sec-
tors of the economy. Through FY77, 41% of total commitments were for public
services, 24% for agriculture, 33% for industry, of which 10% was for indus-
trial imports, and 2% for education. Lending for public services has amounted
to almost US$700 million and has included loans and credits for railways,
electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecommunications and
water supplies. A large part of past lending for agriculture was for Indus



- 5 -
Basin projects. Lending for industry has been mainly through the Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most projects for
which loans and credits are being disbursed, construction is now going ahead
satisfactorily. The principal problems being encountered are that the rates
charged by some of the public services have not kept pace with inflation and,
hence, some utilities are not earning the return which they need. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of August 31,
1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.    One of
these is to support the directly productive sectors of the economy and, in
particular, to increase production of import substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial and
agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for industry
will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as PICIC, which
finances the medium and large-scale private sector, the Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) for the small and medium scale industrial sector,
with possible participation by commercial banks, and the National Development
Finance Corporation (NDFC) for industries in the public sector. The most
important part of future lending for agriculture is expected to be for the
Government's program to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by control-
ling salinity and improving the utilization of surface irrigation and ground-
water. The Bank is the Executing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant
for improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.
15.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion of and
to improve the institutions which are responsible for the principal public
services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely,
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Karachi Port, Water and Power Devel-
opment Authority, Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company and
the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency. In most of these, institutional im-
provements are being made with technical assistance financed by the Bank
Group.
16.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This shift implies
increased lending for agriculture and rural development and will involve
significant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela works.
In the urban sector, Bank missions-have been working with municipal authori-
ties on the plans for the urban development of Karachi, whose population now
exceeds 4 million and Lahore, Pakistan's second largest. A Karachi master
plan was completed in 1974 with the assistance of consultants financed by
UNDP. Within the framework of this plan, a project was proposed and appraised
for urban upgrading in the Lyari section of the city. This project, however,
has been deferred indefinitely due to Government reconsideration of the proj-
ect cost and financial arrangements. Planning in Lahore is at a much earlier
stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is for technical assistance.
Accordingly, the IDA credit for the second Lahore water supply, sewerage and
drainage project includes provision for the financing of urban-studies in
Lahore. The emphasis being given to agriculture and other projects with a



- 6 -
low foreign exchange component justifies the financing of some local expendi-
tures in specific cases, such as the proposed project.
17.       A number of projects for Bank Group financing are currently under
appraisal or being prepared in Pakistan. Appraisal missions have completed
field reviews of an agricultural extension and development project in the
Punjab, a third power project and a petroleum development project. Prepara-
tory work is proceeding on another irrigation and drainage project in the
Northwest Frontier Province, a fourth agricultural credit project, a third
highways project and a Karachi bulk water supply project. A further credit
to help finance the Tarbela project is under consideration.
18.       IFC has made investments in nine Pakistan enterprises for a total
of US$30.2 million, of which US$22.9 million was by way of loans and US$7.3
million by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$11
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three
in the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles and one each in
cement, steel and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - FORESTRY SECTOR
19.       Pakistan has historically suffered from serious deforestation as a
result of population pressures and the need for more farmland. Today, it is
a wood deficit country importing about 35% of its commercial wood needs. Non-
commercial wood requirements, mainly for fuelwood, are also substantial and
are resulting in significant damage to the forests through severe lopping and
premature felling of trees. As a consequence, soil erosion is widespread,
resulting in decreasing soil fertility and a greater amount of silt being
carried by the rivers, shortening the life-span of costly reservoirs and
hydroelectric facilities. Timber prices are high. Sawn lumber prices are
about double those in North America and Europe; firewood is also expensive,
absorbing a large share of the family budget.
20.       While recorded forest areas (8.8 million ha) represent about 10%
of the land area of the country, most are range lands and unproductive scrub
forests, making a negligible contribution to timber supplies. The productive
forests mainly comprise scattered mountain coniferous forests in the North
West Frontier Province (NWFP), Azad Kashmir, and north-east Punjab, totalling
some 1.8 million ha. Development of timber production in these forests has
been severely constrained by the difficult topography, inaccessibility, the
need to protect the watersheds, and by rights and concessions of local
residents.
21.       Most of the wood based industries, including sawmilling, plywood,
particle board, fiber board, pulp and paper, match manufacture, furniture
and sports goods, are present in Pakistan. Many units in these industries,
which are almost entirely in the private sector, are working at low capacity
because of high wood cost and shortage of wood supply. For these reasons,
the pulp and paper industry has concentrated on non-wood agricultural resi-
dues and grasses for its raw material supplies. These materials are well



- 7 -
suited for many grades of pulp and paper but newsprint and long fiber
(coniferous) pulp, needed for mixing with the locally produced non-wood pulp
for strength, must be imported.
22.       Total domestic commercial timber production from government and
private forests is around 1.1 million m /year of roundwood. Imports of timber
aid wood-based products in roundwood equivalent are estimated at 0.38 million
m /year valued at about US$55 million. iawnwood and timber baulks account for
the largest volume, around 0.2 million m (value US$15 milliSn), but imported
long fiber pulp and paper, mainly newsprint, (0.18 million m ), represents the
highest cost - US$40 million. Despite the difficulties of forest development,
Pakistan has the potential to produce all the timber, and virtually all the
pulp and paper products, presently imported and at prices which would be com-
petitive with imports.
23.       The mountain forests in NWFP are the most logical choice for develop-
ing commercial timber supplies since they presently support good indigenous
species which can be significantly improved by selective breeding and intro-
duction of improved varieties. Within the mountain areas, the lower alti-
tude (3,000' to 5,500') Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) zone presents fewest
technical problems and is most easily accessible. The area with the most
immediate potential for increasing forest production is in the lower hills
of the Hazara district of NWFP; development in this area would also make a
major contribution to minimizing the problems of watershed control for the
major river systems.
24.       The gross area of the Hazara forests extends to some 480,000 ha, of
which an estimated 80,000 ha are workable productive areas. Some 24,000 ha
of natural Chir pine forests exist in the area, providing a valuable basis
for establishing an extension of plantations under intensive management and
the establishment of forest industries to meet the present deficits in this
sector. Some 50% of the existing forests in Hazara are owned by the State and
50% are in private ownership but managed by the Provincial Forest Department.
These so-called "Guzara" lands are partly individually and partly communaly
owned. Holdings are small, averaging about 2 ha per family.
25.       The Guzara areas, which were formerly under Chir pine, are pre-
sently used for fodder collection and grazing and are now largely treeless.
Extensive erosion and a decrease in land fertility have been the results.
Steep rockstrewn slopes abound in the areas, which are unsuited to grazing
and forage production. One some, however, sufficient soil remains to
establish a tree crop. Preliminary studies by the NWFP Forest Department
show that owners can obtain a greater benefit from tree growing on these
marginal areas than from the present or any available alternative land use.
26.       The Guzara Forest Rules, 1950, place the management of these lands
under the Forest Department. Under the Rules, owners must have a forest
working plan prepared by the Forest Department for most tree species, and
Forest Department staff must mark all trees prior to cutting and arranging
sales. The Department deducts 20% of the sales value as a levy before
passing on the sales proceeds to the owners. The Guzara owners are dis-
satisfied with the present management system because of the enforced



management, which relies on natural regeneration and 30-year interval low
volume cutting; the levy; and the delay, commonly up to one year, in payment
of sales revenues.
27.       The Government has initiated steps to improve relations between
private forest owners and the Forest Department and to encourage reforesta-
tion of treeless areas. The World Food Program is sponsoring private tree
planting in these areas. The planting techniques and species used can be
substantially improved, thus making the results more attractive to the owners.
Linking the plantations to a secure market would strengthen the incentive for
tree growing.
28.       Forestry and forest industry proposals for the Hazara district have
been under consideration since 1973 when the Federal Government commissioned
a preliminary feasibility study for a long fiber pulp project. The study
recommended the development of a Hazara-based pulp and paper industry but
emphasized the need to expand the forests to sustain the industry. During
the past year the Government of NWFP decided on a broad area to serve the
proposed industrial development and began a preliminary evaluation of suit-
able sites for intensive forest management while ensuring involvement of
the "Guzara" forest owners and users.
29.       The Forest Department is seeking to change the management of these
forests, with the objective of adopting an intensive approach, using arti-
ficial replanting and shorter rotations, in place of the natural regenera-
tion system practiced to date. However, before embarking on substantial
investments in the area, further preparatory work is needed. On the
forestry side, it is necessary to define the areas to be developed and to
assess accurately the existing resource; to improve techniques of reforesta-
tion through trials and pilot plantations; to initiate genetic improvement
to sustain improved productivity; and to secure owner participation. On the
industries side, pulping tests are needed and a full feasibility study made
of the configuration, capacity and timing of the proposed pulp/paper mill.
The proposed project would assist the Government to carry out this prepara-
tory work.

30.       The proposed project would assist the Government to formulate an
integrated program for the development of the forest resources of the Hazara
region of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). Negotiations for the
proposed credit took place in Washington during September 1977. The Pakistan
delegation was headed by Mr. Masud Mufti, Joint Secretary, Economic Affairs
Division, GOP. The project would include:
(a) a site assessment survey to select suitable areas for large-
scale afforestation and exploitation, having regard to the
physical limitations of the forest lands and the require-
ments for wood supplies and grazing to meet local demand;



- 9 -
(b) complementing the survey, a complete updating of the inventory
of the existing forest resource to provide reliable data of
current timber stocking;
(c) pilot plantations with back-up research trials, extending to
some 2,000 ha, to establish a sound basis for large-scale
afforestation and genetic improvement including improved
seed, tree breeding and introduction of new species;
(d) pulping tests of species proposed for planting to establish
their industrial qualities;
(e) training and fellowships involving four man-years of specialist
services and one man-year of fellowships to introduce improved
technologies, including a specialist in plantations development,
an inventory specialist, and overseas study tours for project
staff;
(f) a Guzara Forest Task Force to assess the position of Guzara
forest owners and other forest users, and prepare suitable
institutional and financial arrangements to involve local
people in future forest and forest industrial development;
(g) a feasibility study to provide a firm base for determining
the site, configuration, capacity and timing of a pulp and
paper mill; and
(h) project preparation for proposed forestry and forest
industries projects.
Further details on each of the project components are provided below
(paragraphs 38 to 46).
Project Area
31.       The project area would include forest lands and selected areas for
reforestation extending over a radius of 30 miles (200,000 ha) from the town
of Mansehra in Hazara District. The project would concentrate on the lower
elevation Chir pine zone in the district (see paragraphs 23 and 24). Be-
sides the 24,000 ha of natural Chir pine forest in this zone, about 11,000
ha of steep treeless "Guzara" land adjacent to the forests would be selected
for new plantations, following the establishment of reliable techniques.
This land, together with the existing Chir pine forests, would provide the
raw material to sustain the proposed pulp and paper mill.
Project .Costs and Financing
32.       The total cost of the project including contingencies is estimated
at US$2.56 million (Rs 25.14 million) equivalent. The foreign exchange com-
ponent is estimated at US$1.36 million or 53% of total project costs. The
proposed IDA credit of US$1.7 million, amounting to 66% of total project costs,
would finance the foreign exchange costs and 25% of local currency costs. The
balance of US$0.9 million would be financed by the Government. A special



- 10 -
project fund would be established which would be replenished monthly to a level
equivalent to estimated requirements for the next two months (Section 2.02 of
the draft Project Agreement and Section 5.01 (d) of draft Credit Agreement).
The fund will be administered by the Project Manager (see paragraph 36).
Project costs by expenditure item are shown below. A breakdown of costs by
activity is given in the Project and Credit Summary.

and 9% (1980-82), 8% (1980-82) on all other items.
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       In view of the small amounts involved equipment and materials would
be purchased on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accord-
ance with procedures satisfactory to the Association. Civil works, which would
also be small, would be undertaken by force account by NWFP Forest Department,
Department of Works or local contractors. Consultants and specialists re-
quired for the project will be selected according to IDA guidelines.
34.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against:   (a) 100% of the
foreign exchange expenditures for directly imported equipment, 100% of the
local expenditures (ex-factory costs) for locally manufactured equipment or
60% of the local expenditures for other equipment procured locally; (b) 100%
of the expenditures for consulting services; (c) 100% of training costs; (d)
33% of plantation labor costs, and (e) 50% of civil works performed under
force account or contract. About US$1.2 million of the IDA credit is expected
to finance services of consultants and specialists; US$250,000, equipment and
materials; US$40,000, civil works; and US$30,000 training, with the balance of
US$180,000 at present unallocated. Disbursement requests would be supported



- 11 -
by full documentation, except in the case of civil works performed under force
account for which the Project Manager would submit a certified statement of
expenditures. Documentation of these statements would be retained by the
Project Manager for review by IDA supervision missions. Disbursements are
expected to be completed by December 1982.
Organization and Management
35.       A number of agencies are involved in the Forestry Sector in NWFP.
The Provincial Forest Department is responsible for forest management; Pakis-
tan Forest Institute, a joint Federal and Provincial agency, for research; the
Provincial Industries Department for socio-economic studies; Pakistan Indus-
trial Development Corporation for pulp and paper development; and the Federal
Inspector General of Forests for forest policy. Coordination of inputs from
these agencies would be needed for the project.
36.       The project would be managed by the Chief Conservator of Forests,
NWFP, as Project Director, assisted by a- fulltime Assistant Project Director,
forestry specialists and other suitably qualified staff. The Project Director
would be responsible, through the Secretary of the Provincial Forest Depart-
ment, to the Additional Chief Secretary, Planning and Development of the
Government of NWFP, for coordinating the work of the Guzara forest task
force, pulping tests and the feasibility study. Project headquarters would
be established at Mansehra, which would also be the site for the central tree
nursery and key staff housing.
37.       A Project Development Committee-would be formed to review work plans
and project progress and to provide overall coordination of the project. The
Committee would be composed of the Additional Chief Secretary, Planning and
Development (Chairman); the Inspector General of Forests; the Provincial
Secretaries for Forests and Industries; the Technical Director, Pakistan and
Industrial Development Corporation, and the Project Director (Secretary)
(Section 3.03 of the draft Credit Agreement).
Site Assessment Survey and Inventory
38.       The site assessment survey would identify areas suitable for planta-
tion development and classify them by ownership, soil and climate patterns.
This part of the project would be carried out by a site survey and inventory
section of the Project Director's staff, with support for soils sampling pro-
vided by the Pakistan Forest Institute. The work is scheduled for completion
during the first two years of the project and would produce site maps (scale:
1:25,000) for planning and managing plantation development.
39.       The site survey and inventory section of the Project Director's staff
would also update data on the existing Chir pine forests to enable decisions to
be made for (a) the distribution of present timber resources between pulpwood
and other uses, and (b) the size and timing of the pulp mill construction.
The section would be supported by the Forest Department's existing inventory



- 12 -
staff and assisted by an internationally recruited consultant, acceptable to
the Association, for 12 months. The work is scheduled for completion in the
first year of operations.
Pilot Plantations and Research Trials
40.       The proposed pulp and paper industrial development would require
both long fibre from pines and short fibre from fast growing hardwoods.
Pines may be produced initially on a 20 to 25 year rotation to meet pulpwood
requirements, with a longer-term objective of increasing rotation length to
35-40 years to produce pulpwood requirements and timber. With improved
planting techniques, followed b! genetic improv ment, yields are expected
to increase from an initial 7 m /ha/year to 9 m /ha/year. Many hardwood
species have been planted along roads and streams but no pure plantation
blocks have been established and no yield assessments made. However, with
careful choice of species,3good nursery stock and efficient plantation
techniques, yields of 12 m /ha/year should be obtainable on a 10 to 12 year
rotation. It will be necessary to convince Guzara owners of the feasibility
of these proposals by demonstration in well managed pilot plantations.
41.       Pilot plantations would increase annually over the 5-year project
period from a modest start, 60 ha in year 1, to an annual target of 1,000 ha
in year 5. By the third year improved nursery techniques should yield con-
sistently better stock while improved planting techniques should yield better
survival and initial growth. Throughout the project period, trials of
introduced species and the provision of improved seed would continue. The
objective would be to develop reliable plantation techniques, supported by
continuing genetic improvement of the species used, for follow-up large-scale
plantation development.
42.       These activities would be carried out by the Project Director's staff
assisted by an internationally recruited forestry specialist acceptable to the
Association. The Pakistan Forest Institute would provide technical support.
Five two-month training fellowships for key staff members would include
overseas study tours to ongoing forestry/forest industry projects of relevance
to the Hazara development.
Guzara Forest Task Force
43.       A special task force established by the Project Development Com-
mittee would prepare a detailed action plan for Government approval to secure
private owners' participation in developing commercial plantations (Section
2.04 of the draft Project Agreement). The task force, which would include a
sociologist and a cooperative specialist, would follow up the work of the
preliminary evaluation team (see paragraph 28) and, in consultation with
the owners define a working basis for owner participation, including: pos-
sible forest cooperatives; credit requirements; management system for fodder
collection, grazing and forestry extension; changes in forest rules; and
possibility of rental or compensation payments. The task force is expected
to complete its work in the first two years of the project.

Feasibility study
44.       The study, to be carried out under the Pakistan Industrial Develop-
ment Corporation, (PIDC) (Section 5.01 (b) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement) would determine an appropriate development strategy for pulp and
paper production and evaluate its technical and economic feasibility. A
two-phase study is proposed. Phase one would assemble and evaluate data on
resource base, markets, existing industry and the socio-economic impact of
any proposed pulp and paper development.   A detailed review of the study's
findings would be conducted by the concerned Federal and Provincial agencies,
together with IDA and representatives of any organizations who may be consid-
ering participating in, or providing finance for, the proposed venture. The
purpose of this review would be to agree on a project concept for detailed
analysis. Phase two would be a detailed feasibility study of the proposed
project.
45.       This type of study is highly specialized.   It would be carried out
by internationally recruited consultants whose qualifications, experience and
conditions of employment would be satisfactory to the Association (Section
3.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement) and would be timed for years
two and three of the project.
Follow-up Project Preparation
46.       It is expected that, within three years, sufficient plantations
experience will have been gained, firm conclusions reached for forest indus-
tries development, and effective participation of Guzara forest owners secured,
to prepare follow-up large-scale plantations and forest industries projects.
This work is expected to require additional studies and to involve an expan-
sion in project staff. Studies and other single items of expenditure on
follow-up preparation exceeding US$5,000 would require prior agreement with
the Association (Section 2.09 of the draft Project Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
47.       The project would provide a sound basis for proceeding with the ra-
tional development of the forestry resources of the Hazara region, which has
few other resources for development. The project activities are expected to
provide the incentives needed to ensure private owners' commitment to produc-
tive foresty, and an increase in the living standards of the local population
through employment in timber production and the associated pulp and paper
industry. The country would benefit from the supply of long fiber pulp
and newsprint, both of which are presently imported, and the reduction of soil
erosion and siltation of the river system.
48.       The benefits of the proposed project cannot be quantified since
activities included are essentially technical development elements. However,
a preliminary analysis of the integrated forestry development program which
might emerge from the proposed project indicates a financial internal rate of
return of 11% and an economic rate of return of 14%. This analysis does not
reflect the significant benefits of establishing sound reforestation techniques
which can be replicated in wider areas, and of securing extensive watershed



- 14 -
areas of the major river systems to stable land use. Project risks are no
greater than normally to be expected with operations of this type.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the North
West Frontier Province and the Association, the Recommendation of the Commit-
tee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of the Agreement
of the Association, and the text of a draft resolution approving the pro-
posed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section II of
Annex III. Additional conditions of effectiveness of the Credit (Section 5.01
of the draft Development Credit Agreement) are that: (a) the execution and
delivery of the Project Agreement on behalf of NWFP have been duly authorized
or ratified by all necessary corporate and governmental action; (b) arrange-
ments satisfactory to the Association shall have been made between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and PIDC for its participation in the project (paragraphs
44 and 45 above); (c) establishment of a Hazara Forestry Project Development
Committee with powers, membership, staff and resources satisfactory to the
Association (paragraph 37); (d) authorization by NWFP of staff positions
required for implementation of the project; and (e) the Project Revolving
Fund has been established and the initial deposit in the fund has been made
(paragraph 32).
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

ANNEX II
C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Loan was intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. In September 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage - the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By end-June 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one of
the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir and repair of the
tunnels and outlet structure. Agreement was reached with the parties of the
Indus Basin and Tarbela Development Funds whereby special contributions were
made by a number of parties, including IDA (Credit 581-PAK), to help with the
cost of repairs and additional remedial works. The stilling basins suffered
further damage in August 1975 and again in April 1976. Stilling Basin 3 has
now been redesigned and repaired, and operated satisfactorily during the 1977
irrigation season. The permanent solution for Stilling Basin 4 is still under
discussion. From 1975 through 1977, irrigation requirements have generally
been met. Power generation by the first four units began in 1977. The major
outstanding problem is that plunge pool development has endangered the flip-
bucket of the service spillway, and additional protection works for this
spillway must be completed before July 1978.
Loan No. 621         Ninth Railway:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
Effective Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
Nearly 90% of the Loan has been disbursed, and the project is
virtually complete. To provide for reimbursement of commissioning expenses,
however, the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to
June 30, 1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage
of a new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions, has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975 and has helped to improve
utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight wagons.
Credit No. 177      Development Finance Company - IDBP:   US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk pending settlement of its lia-
bilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31, 1977.
The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA and only $0.9 million remained
undisbursed as of August 31, 1977. IDBP's major problem is the large arrears
in its portfolio.- .IDBP's collection efforts have been improving, but the
long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly on developments in the
political/economic environment, including the textile sector, which accounts
for a large portion of IDBP's outstandings.
Credit No. 206       Engineering Education:. US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
The Credit provides US$4.0 million to finance the relocation of
the NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi (formerly NED
Engineering College) and technical assistance for the upgrading of University
staff.  The new physical facilities are nearing completion and were expected
to be in full use by August 1977. The Closing Date has been extended by
one year, until December 1977, to allow for execution of the technical
assistance program. The Closing Date will be extended further if the
University in time appoints all the technical specialists required to up-
grade its teaching programs.
Credit No. 213      Power Transmission and Distribution:   US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970;- Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Physical construction of the Grid Substation and associated equip-
ment of this Project is underway and can now be considered to be 60 percent
complete. Physical completion of the project is expected during the first
quarter of 1978 and disbursements should end at approximately the same time.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
Nearly four-fifths of the Credit has been committed and disbursed.
The rate of progress on both the Juna Bunder Berths and Napier Mole Road
Bridge has improved in recent months despite strikes and civil disturbances.
Work on the bridge abutments and on the main bridge supports in the Chinna
Creek is proceeding satisfactorily. Completion of the berths and sheds as
well as the bridge is expected by the end of 1978.
Credit No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Construction of the oil berth commenced in January 1977, two years
behind the schedule prepared at the time of appraisal. Some 49% of the
permanent piling has been driven and the causeway at the shore end of the
trunkway has been 95% completed. Consultants are preparing contract
documents for channel dredging works and dredger procurement. Prequalifi-
cation of contractors for the dredging works and dredger manufacture is
presently under evaluation. Disbursements to date total US$2.4 million.
Meanwhile, however Port efficiency and productivity appear to be declining.
IDA has recommended that KPT seek outside assistance to improve this
situation, and is discussing this proposal with GOP.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government and is administered by PICIC.
The loan has been fully committed and disbursements amounted to $20.0 million
on September 23, 1977.
Loan No. 1326        Development Finance Company - PICIC:   US$25.0 million
Loan of September 14, 1976; Effective Date:
November 29, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
As of September 23, 1977, subprojects for US$6.4 million had been
approved by the Bank. Two previous loans to PICIC have not yet been fully
disbursed: Loan 961 should be fully disbursed by the closing date, June 30,
1978; the closing date for Loan 590 was extended to September 30, 1977 for
one subproject in connection with an IFC project in Pakistan. No further
extension is anticipated. PICIC remains a capable institution, but its
operations and collections have been adversely affected by the recent poli-
tical difficulties in Pakistan. Its long-term prospects will depend mainly
on developments in the political/ economic environments, including the
textile sector, which accounts for a large portion of PICIC's outstandings.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 466       Flood Rehabilitation:  US$35.0 Million Credit of
January 31, 1974: Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 was post-
poned to December 31, 1976, to permit completion of procurement of specialized
spare parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery. Because of
delays in the shipment of certain equipment, the Association has agreed to
continue disbursements until the end of 1977.
Loan No. 988         Multan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Delays and escalating prices for civil works and, to a lesser
extent, for foreign equipment have raised the total project cost above the
appraisal estimate by about 84% (US$88 million). Construction delays have
been due to a shortage of civil contractors' capacity in Pakistan and to
late deliveries of critical equipment. Project completion is currently
forecast to be about 18 months longer than the appraisal estimate. The
project's economic return is still close to 28%, because of higher forecast
international fertilizer prices. The company has already obtained US$84
million of the extra financing required, in equity from the Government and
the foreign partner, and in debt from the OPEC Special Fund and local banks.
The remaining US$4 million are in the process of being secured. The project's
corporate and field management has been strengthened. Craftsmen and field
supervisors from Europe have recently been hired to expedite plant construction.
Credit No. 510       Third Telecommunications:  US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project covered by this Credit is proceeding satisfactorily
though somewhat behind schedule. Procurement action for all the main equip-
ment items is well advanced. T&T was required under Credit Agreements of
145-PAK and of 510-PAK to be reorganized to function more effectively along
commercial lines and to be given a greater degree of autonomy. Partly as a
result of political changes and country problems, this reorganization has
not yet been effected. The delay in introducing a satisfactory reorganiza-
tion has been taken up again with the Government.
Credit No. 546      National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):
US$30.0 Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective
Date July 17, 1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
During 1976, the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC)
continued to expand its operations and recorded substantial growth in
approvals, commitments and disbursements. We anticipate that the credit
will be fully committed by June 1978 and fully disbursed by the following



- 26 -
ANNEX II
March. Although NDFC is currently a highly profitable and financially
stable institution there are several aspects of its operation which are of
concern. The orientation of NDFC's activities has been toward commercial
banking; its development impact would be improved if it were to redirect
its efforts toward analyzing sector problems in the public industrial sector.
Its rapid expansion has placed considerable strain upon its limited manpower
resources and newly established systems and procedures and while further
growth is projected over the next few years, staffing and systems develop-
ment may prove limiting factors.
Loan No. 1107        Fourth Sui Northern Gas:  US$60.0 Million Loan of
May 15, 1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
All project activities are on schedule including the new gas
purification and dehydration units which are expected on stream by
December 1977, in time for the peak load period. A recent re-estimate
of the final project cost (including the additional pipelines and dis-
tribution systems authorized by the Bank) indicates that as much as
US$7 million of the loan might go unspent. New oil developments in the
Potwar Basin will greatly increase the future supply of associated gas
which the Borrower will have to market to avoid flaring it. The Borrower
has requested the Bank's permission to apply this unspent portion of the
loan towards equipment and facilities needed for handling the higher Potwar
gas flows as well as toward several other items that are required. The
recent Dhodak oil discovery is also expected to yield sizeable hydrocarbon
liquid (condensate) and gas flows. As in the case of the Potwar fields, the
only practical way to dispose of the gas is for the Borrower to market it in
lieu of Sui gas. The Dhodak field's production potential is expected to be
confirmed next year. The consequences of gas production from this area will
have to be studied, but no major problems are foreseen in the Borrower's
ability to plan and execute the change-over in gas supply nor in the Govern-
ment's cooperation in financing the additional capital and operating costs.
Credit No. 620       Seed Project:  US$23.0 Million Credit of March 29. 1976;
Effective Date: November 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
Production of prebasic and basic seed, and project coordination
and reporting procedures have improved. Progress of the Seed Corporations'
activities is satisfactory. Three of five consultants to be financed under
the credit are in place and designs for processing plants have been drafted.
Minor amendments to the Development Credit Agreement have been made to
simplify procurement procedures for vehicles and civil works.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 630      Second Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage:
US$26.6 Million Credit of June 8, 1976; Effective
Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
Design work and the processing of bidding documents is proceeding
at a reasonable rate under the advice of engineering consultants financed
by UNDP. Part of a management team has been provided by the UK.
Loan No. 1208-T     Second WAPDA Power:   US$50 million Third Window Loan
of February 19, 1976; Effective Date: April 30, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Physical construction of the 336-mile transmission line between
Lyallpur and Guddu and associated equipment will start in December 1977
with a completion date scheduled for mid-1980. The contract for consultant
engineering and supervision was signed in April 1976 and most bidding
documents for equipment and material have been issued.
Credit No. 648      Khairpur Tile Drainage and Irrigated Farming Development
Prolect: US$14.0 Million Credit of July 22, 1976;
Effective Date: March 14, 1977; Closing Date: July 31,
1982
Survey work has begun and the construction colony has been estab-
lished in the project area. Consultants were selected in March 1977 and
began work in May. With their help, the Water and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA), the implementing agency, is expected to begin procurement
by the end of 1977 and to complete project plans and start land acquisition
for construction early next year.
Credit No. 678     Third Education:   US$15.0 million Credit of February 18,
1977; Effective Date: July 6, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The project provides facilities for primary teacher training; a
functional literacy program; agricultural education to assist in developing
higher and middle level manpower; and farmer training. Project management
is generally well organized; technical assistance is on schedule, while civil
works designs are about three months behind schedule because of delays in
finalizing sketch plans.
Loan No. 1366-T    Punjab Livestock:   US$10.0 million Loan of February 18,
1977; Effective Date: August 3, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
Progress has been satisfactory. The first spearhead team, which
will set up Village Associations, is undergoing training. Management of the
Lahore Milk Plant has improved but the Sihala Meat Plant still has cash
flow problems.

Loan No. 1372       Tenth Railway:   US$35 million Loan and US$25 million
and                 Credit of March 8, 1977; Effective Date:   May 9, 1977;
Credit No. 684      Closing Date:   June 30, 1982
Procurement has generally begun smoothly. There has been some delay
in engaging consultants for detailed engineering of the communications component
of the project. This has now been resolved and work is expected to commence
shortly. Pakistan Railways performance on covenants and commitments is gene-
rally satisfactory.
Credit No. 683      Flood Damage Restoration:   $40 million Credit of
March 8, 1977; Effective Date: April 27, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Repair of all major breaches in protective bunds and other priority
works under this Project were completed before the start of the 1977 monsoon
season. However, other components of the project have lagged behind schedule.
Only 40% of the civil works to be carried out by Mechanized Construction of
Pakistan (MCP), the prime contractor, had been completed by September 1977.
In July 1977, the Association agreed to amend the Credit Agreement to permit
the Provinces, in addition to MCP, to be reimbursed for civil works. There
have also been delays in ordering spares and equipment, due to MCP's diffi-
culties in obtaining foreign exchange.
