HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Introduction
1.        The Governments of Pakistan (GOP) and North West Frontier Province
(GONWFP) have requested a credit for technical assistance through a Hazara
Forestry Pre-Investment Project in the Hazara region of the North West
Frontier Province. This project would be the first phase of a program of
development to bring to the region industrial forest plantations, intensive
exploitation operations, and pulp and paper mill. The annexes to this report contain
detailed descriptions of the area, background and proposed project activities.
These are briefly summarized below.
2.        Forestry and forest industry project proposals for the Hazara district
have been under consideration for some tine, including the introduction of
large scale afforestation and the construction of a pulp mill at Mansehra,
based on the lower elevation Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) zone. These
developments would involve exploitation of the existing Chir pine forests,
establishment of short-rotation pulpwood plantations in Government Reserved
and private "Guzara" forests, and management of the whole area on an intensive
sustained-yield basis to meet the needs of the proposed industry as well as
the local population.
3.        To initiqe the pulp mill project, GOP has had a preliminary feasibility
study undertaken. 1. In addition, GONWFP is presently conducting preliminary
studies aimed at :
( i) evaluating the Chir pine forests which fall within
a radius of some 40 miles of the proposed Nansehra
pulp mill site;
( ii) investigating the potential for utilizing the
privately owned Guzara forests lands and forest
wastelands in the region;
(iii) deve]oping techniques for the establishment of
short-rotation plantation forests in the area to
replace the long-rotation system presently being
followed; and,
( iv) developing an institutional framework which would
enable both publicly and privately owned forests
lands to be managed intensively to provide for
regular local needs and the fibre requirements of
the proposed industrial development.

resources of NWFP. Zafar and Associates and Stadler Hurter, 1973.

Proposed Development Plan
4.        The technical development project would support and extend this
work in the Chir pine sone of Hazara and expedite implementation of a
development plan. As presently conceived, the plan would comprise three
phases as follows :
Phase One     This phase would begin with the technical development
1977'U -2    project and extend over a five-year period commencing
in 1977. The project area would be thoroughly
evaluated for inventory and plantation development
areas, plantation management techniques would be
established, institutional frameworks developed, and
project preparation for subsequent large-scale
planting and for industrial development would be
completed.
2
Phase Two     This phase would begin in 1980 with the cmmencement
1980 --85     of large-scale planting of both Chir pine and hardwood
species and the construction and start-up of the first
stage of the pulp mill and associated logging industry.
At present, it appears that a 30,000 to 4o,ooo ton per
annum long-fibred kraft pulp mill. using Chir pine would
be the most logical development but provision has been
made in the Phase One of the program for detailed
feasibility studies to confirm or modify this preliminary
conclusion.
Phase Three   This phase would include a second-stage forestry
7           90  project which would complete the establishment of the
estimated 85,000 acres required to support the proposed
pulp and paper mill. The mill would be expanded during
this phase by the addition of a 40,000 ton per annum
newsprint mil-1 which would use hardwood species pulped
by a semi-chemical process, with a proportion of long-
fibred pulp added to the furnish. Again, this tentative
mill configuration could be modified in subsequent
detailed studies to be carried out during earlier phases
of the program.
ProJect Area
5.        The project area is within an approximate radius of 30 miles of
Mansehra; it contains some 60,000 acres of existing Chir pine forests
of which some 50% is government reserved forests and 50% private Guzara
forests, and some 90,000 acres of treeless Guzara land which is considered
suitable for reforestation. The area is described in detail in Annex 1
and shown in Map 1.
2/ It will be noted that a two-year "overlap" has been provided extending
the Technical Development project into the implementation of Phase Two.
This is a contingent safeguard against any unforeseen problems which
may deveJop and is intended to add flexibility to the program.



-3-
Project Activities
6.        The project would be for five years and would include the
activities described below;. the phasing of activities is presented in
Table 1.
( i) a site assesament surwey to select suitable areas for
large-scale afforestation and exploitation within the
catchient area proposed for the mill, having regard to
the physical limitations of the forest lands and the
requirements for wood supplies and grazing to neet
local demand; compilation of management ago at
scale 1:25,000, (see Annex 1);
( ii) complementing the site assessment, there would be a
complete updating of the inventory of the existing
forest resource to provide reliable data of current
timber stocking for the feasibility study, (see Annex 1);
(iii) Pilot plantations with back-up research trials extending
to some 5,000 acres to achieve early impact of improved
technology and establish a sound bases for large-scale
afforestation; institute longer-term tree breeding
improvement and possible improved species, (see Annex 2);
( iv) training and fellowships to accelerate the implementation
of improved technologLes including a specialist in
p]antations deve]opment for the first three years;   an
inventory specialist in Year 1; overseas study tours
for project staff in Years 1, 2 and 3, (see Annex 3);
( v) a Ouzara Forest Owners Task Force to assess the position
of Guzara forest owners and other forest users and
prepare suitable institutional and financial arrangements
to ensure the integration, participation and cooperation
of the local people with future forest and forest
industrial development, (see Annex 4);
( vi) pulping tests to coordinate the suitability of species
proposed for planting with their industrial qua]ities,
(see Annex 2);
(vii)  a feasibility study to provide a firm base for determining
the location, size, configuration and timing of the forest
industries that could be established, (see Annex 5);
(viii)  project preparation for the proposed phase two forest and
forest industries projects, (see Annex 6);



-4-
Project Management
7.        The project headquarters would be established at Mansehra.   The
project will be under the management of the Chief Conservator of Forests
assisted by a fulltime assistant project director of the rank of Senior DFO/
Conservator. The Project Director would be responsible for all forestry
activities and, through the Secretary for Forests, to the Additional Chief
Secretary, Planning and Development, for coordination of the work of the
socio-economic study, pulping tests and feasibility study. The project
director would also be assisted by a fulltime plantations specialist for
the first three years, an administrative officer, a site assessment section,
an inventory section, and supporting technical and administrative staff.
A discussion of project organization and management and full details of
project staff is contained in Annex 6.
8.        Inputs from a number of other agencies and advisers would be
required including the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation, the
Federal Inspector General of Forests, the Pakistan Forest Institute, the
Department of Industry, NWFP, and various consultants who will be retained
as part of the project. These activities will need coordinating.
9.        A Project Development Committee would be formed, composed of trhe
Additional Chief Secretary, P & D, NWFP as Chairman, the Inspector General
of Forests, GOP, the Secretary for Forests, the Chief Conservator of
Forests, the Secretary for Industry and Technical Director, Pakistan
Industrial Development Corporation. The Chief Conservator of Forests, as
project director, would be secretary. The committee would receive periodic
reports of project progress and give directions to the project director
for coordinating the various activities and inputs of the agencies discussed
in para. 8.
Costs
10.       Project costs are derived in the detailed physical requirements
and cost tables in Table 2 and are summarized.below. Total costs are
PRs. 25.14 million (US$2.57 million) including physical and price contingencies.

Financing
11.       Financing of the project would be by 34% OM and 66% IDA credit.
The project would maintain separate accounts Which would be audited in a
asnner satisfactory to the Association.
Benefits of the Proposed Program
12.       The benefits of the proposed credit per so cannot be quantififd
because the activities included are essentially technical development
which would lead to the implementation of a productive progrm. lowever,
a preliminary analysis of the integrated program discussed in para. 4 has
been developed in Annex 7 to demonstrate the overall profitability of thb
proposed development. In financial terms, this indicates an internal rate
of return of 11%, which is typical for proJoets of this type. The econonic
rate of return would be about 14%. This does not include the benefits of
establishing sound reforestation techniques which will have application in
other areas, securing extensive watershed areas of the njor river systems
to stable land use, and, the incremental employment generation in plantations,
logging, pulp paper mill and ancillary industries.

HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Site Assessment and Inventory
Introduction
1.        The areas provisionally selected for intensive plantations development
to provide pulpwood to the proposed pulp and paper mill operation are summarized
below. These areas are within a 30 mile radius of the proposed mill site and are
shown in Map 1. The areas stated are less than work plan estimates and are con-
sidered to be conservative. An additional chir pine area in the Haripur division
would also be available, although this is considered less fertile; see footnote 4/.

2.        The final areas to be allocated to pulpwood production will depend upon
variables including:
(a) Size and product mix of the pulp/paper mill.
(b) Proportion of existing Chir pine forests to be allocated
for sale as saw-timber.
(c) Possibility of managing some of the Chir pine plantations
on the basis of producing both saw-timber and pulpwood
on, say, a 35-year rotation with intermediate pulpwood
thinnings.
(d) Proportions of hardwood and softwood in total pulpwood
supply.
3.        On the basis of possible pulp/paper mill alternatives discussed in the
main report, the area required for a sustained supply of pulpwood, assuming a
pure pulpwood rotation management, would be about 50,000 acres of pine and 35,000
acres of hardwoods. These areas can be found within the gross area and can be
expanded to meet changes in size of pulpmill and the alternative forest management
objectives discussed in para 2.
4.        In order to make selections of areas with maximum growth potential and
for choice of species to be grown, a detailed site assessment of the total area
will be needed - see para 6.
5.        There will be a trade-off between allocating most of the existing Chir
pine mature forest to pulpwood to enable an early start-up of the mill or, retain-
ing this timber for marketing as saw-timber and delaying mill start-up until the
new plantations are ready for harvesting. In order to assess the implications
involved, a detailed forest inventory will be needed. Preliminary analysis of the
present data indicates that, assuming pulp mill start-up in 1984, the bulk of the
existing Chir pine forests would need to be set aside for pulpwood to ensure an
adequate flow of raw material. However, it is emphasized that no reliable
assessment can be made of mill timing and the allocation of the existing pine
forests until a complete inventory has been carried out. This is discussed in
para 7.
Site Survey and Classification
6.   (a)  Background.  Having regard to the physical limitations of the forests
and the requirements for wood supplies and grazing to meet local
demands,l/ it is necessary to identify, map and classify lands
available and suitable for pulpwood plantations. Site classification
involves compilation and interpretation of data from existing records
and from new surveys; the data refer to topography, climate, soil and
vegetation. The object is to tabulate and map the project area into
1/  Provision for local requirements is discussed in Annex   .



ANNEX 1
Page 3
major classes of environment and accessibility; where possible,
environmental classes are related to actual or predicted tree growth
(for both indigenous and exotic species). Site classification is
undertaken on a more refined scale than that used for example in
establishing the existing Site Quality Classes for Chir pine. The
site survey should be coordinated with the inventory of existing
Chir pine forests.
(b) Soil sampling has been carried out by the Soils Survey of Pakistan
in part of the area in collaboration with the NWFP Aerial Forest
Inventory project. The results of this work would be incorporated
and additional sampling taken as needed and on areas not covered
by the Survey.
(c) Detailed Features. The site assessment survey would identify in
detail areas suitable for industrial plantations and correlate
these with projected industrial requirements and the requirements
for local wood consumption and grazing area. Although the gross
area for the development program has been selected, it is still
necessary to undertake a site classification so that the result
of pilot plantations and research may be extrapolated with confidence.
(d) The site survey should include information from three main sources.
Firstly, the project area should be mapped by ownership, land use
and accessibility/roadability to determine possible plantation areas.
Secondly, all available climatic data should be compiled for the
general district and for the specific project area; this includes
monthly means and ranges for rainfall, temperature and humidity from
as many meteorological stations as possible. (Prescriptions for
additional stations and rain gauges are given in the section on the
central nursery - see Annex 2).
(e) Thirdly, soil samples should be taken at a sampling intensity of
1 soil pit per 250 acres in the defined plantation areas requiring
a maximum of 600 pits in the entire 150,000 acre area.
(f) At a sampling rate of 10 pits per week, this would require 1-1-1/2 years.
A slow initial rate is expected because of the unfamiliarity of local
staff with this type of work and because of the need for detailed
description of geology and topography/aspect, which have critical
influence on chir pine growth, plus estimates of current crop growth,
age and yield (to correlate with site classification). The initial
sampling, laboratory analysis and data acquisition/interpretation/
reporting is expected to take 1-1/2-2 years.   The intensity and rate
of sampling could be increased in subsequent years to accommodate new
areas or to refine the classification of existing areas.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
The main features described for each sample include:
(i) Location (latitude, longitude, altitude, local name).
(ii)  Topography and aspect.
(iii) Vegetation type including estimate of chir pine growth
where applicable.
(iv)  Land use.
(v) Climatic data with indication of nearness of source.
(vi)  Visual description of soil profile including depth and
color of main horizons, down to underlying strata where
possible.
(vii) Mechanical analysis by sedimentation to estimate proportions
of sand, silt and clay.
(viii) Chemical analysis to determine pH, organic content, and
content of N, P, K, Mg and Ca. There is no current evidence
of deficiency of trace elements but these could be analyzed
in the laboratory.
(g) Site mapping would be on a scale of 1/25,000, providing soil
maps, integrated climatic diagrams and base management maps.
They would be clearly related to the inventory of existing
stock (see para 7 below).
(h) Administration. The site assessment program would require
cooperation between project staff (responsible mainly for field
sampling and description) and PFI staff (responsible for mechanical
and chemical analyses of soil). The field survey team would be
led by an ACF with two forest guards, a driver, two peons and two
local laborers. Laboratory analyses would be conducted by the
PFI Soil Chemist (1/4 time) and PFI technician (1/2 time). All
data would be compiled by the ACF and mapped by a PFI
draughtsman (1/2 time).
(i) Both the ACF and the Soil Chemist should spend time in the field
and laboratory with staff of the Soil and Geological Surveys of
Pakistan to standardize sampling, analysis and description as far
as possible. Depending on the experience of the ACF and Soil Chemist
it may be desirable to request for 3 - 6 months the services of a
foreign researcher, possibly a younger doctoral graduate with      1/
practical experience in establishing a soil analysis laboratory. -
1/ E.G. a graduate of Reading or Rothamsted having some experience of tropical
soils whose services could possibly be supplied through the U.K. Overseas
Development Ministry technical assistance programs.

(j) Estimated costs of the initial site survey are PRs. 565,000 and are
summarized in detail in the main report, Table 2.
Inventory
7.   (a)  An inventory will be needed for the existing Chir pine forests in
the project area to enable decisions to be made with respect to: -
(i) The distribution of the timber volumes between pulpwood and
other uses, to be made by GOP and GONWFP.
(ii)  On the basis of (i), the timing of pulpmill construction date and
start-up, in which it is probable that external financial agencies
would be involved.
(b) Present inventory data is contained in the different working plans
for the project area forests. This is based on field measurements within
individual compartments and expresses total over-bark volumes. It does not
indicate the distribution of total volume between tree sizes and log size classes;
nor is any measurement made of defects or bark percentages, which is essential
information needed for making the management decisions discussed in para (a).
(c) The Aerial Forest Inventory project is currently undertaking an
updating of the project area forests based on Working Plan methods. Sampling
for bark %, incidence of defect and log size assortment was introduced into the
work schedules in February 1977. The updated data will provide useful additional
information.
(d) The existing data will need to be examined in detail to determine
whether it can be used as a basis for compiling data to reliably assess:
(i)  The distribution of the standing volume by diameter (DBH) classes.
(ii)  The distribution of the standing volume by Log Size classes.
(iii) Adjustment of the volumes at (i) and (ii) for defect %.
(iv) Adjustment of the volumes at (i) and (ii) for bark %.
(v) Distribution of standing volumes between Forest Reserve and
Guzara forests.
(d) If it transpires that existing data is insufficient to provide this
information, a decision will need to be taken as to whether:
(i) Further field measurements within individual compartments can be
economically made to bring the total data to the required standard.
(ii)  A new inventory, based on forest type maps made from existing aerial
photography, would be more economical. Field data would be gathered
on a sampling intensity to be determined by statistical method to give
results of sufficient accuracy for the basic management decisions to
be taken as outlined in para (a).



ANNEX 1
Page 6
(e) Administration. The inventory work would require cooperation between
project staff and FD Inventory Section, who would supply the specialist staff.
The work is expected to take one year and would be under the direct responsibility
of an Inventory Specialist (ACF), with five field crews each in the charge of a
Range Forest Officer, and support services of two photo-interpreters, two
draughtsmen, a photo-mapping machine specialist and clerical staff. Provision
is included for an international inventory specialist for an initial period of
three months to assist FD Inventory Section to review the existing data and
make decisions under paras (c) and (d) above. If these results are positive,
and an internationally acceptable inventory can be based on existing inventory
data, the Inventory Section could then complete the remaining work. In the
event option (d) (ii) is required, a full 12-month appointment of the inventory
specialist would be necessary. This latter eventuality is provided for in the
cost estimates.
(f) Since the results of the inventory will be required for defining the
timing of the industrial feasibility study, this activity would be completed
in the first year of the project.
(g) Estimated costs are PRs 1.2 million and are tabulated in Table 2 of
the main report.
(h) Terms of Reference for the inventory specialist are contained in
Appendix 1.
Other Base Data for Feasibility Study
8.        During the first two years of the project, the Project Director would
be collating and assembling other relevant data required for the feasibility
study scheduled for years 2 and 3 of the project. (See Annex 5 for Terms of
Reference and additional data needed). The Project Director would consult
with other interested agencies, (e.g., PIDC, PFI, Department of Industries,
NWFP), in preparing this aspect of the work program. Additional staff would
be made available for these duties on secondment from NWFP Forest Department.

Terms of Reference for Inventory Specialist Consultant
The present inventory data for the Chir pine forests of the project
area is contained in the individual 10-year working plans and is based on total
volume assessment of individual compartments. This data requires to be assessed
for its reliability and suitability for basing management decisions for the
allocation of existing forests to pulpwood and the size and timing of the
proposed pulpmill.
Stage 1. As a first stage, the consultant, in collaboration with FD Inventory
Section and Working Plans Officer, would assess the present data for:
(a) Completeness; ensuring all standing timber to be included
in the project area is included.
(b) Reliability for assessing standing volumes to 95% confidence.
(c) Suitability for undertaking volume compilation to provide data on:
( i) distribution of standing volume by DBH classes;
( ii) distribution of standing volume by Log Size classes;
(iii) adjustment of volumes at (i) and (ii) for defect %;
( iv) adjustment of volumes at (i) and (ii) for bark %.
( v) distribution of standing volume between Forest
Reserves and Guzara forests;
( vi) Forecasts of sustainable timber supplies under a number of
alternative management systems to be defined after
preliminary study.
(d) In the event data is insufficient for compilation as under (c) above,
determine the advisability of taking additional field measurements
so the supplemented existing data can be used to provide information
under (c) above.
(e) Assuming results are positive under (a), (b), (c) or (d), designing
the additional sampling method and format for data presentation
for FD. Inventory Section to complete the outstanding work
described in (c) above.

Stage 1 is expected to take three months work in the field, including
two weeks report writing. The report would summarize the activities covered
and set out the format in which the final inventory data would be presented and
recommend updating procedures for the future.
Stage 2.   In the event that findings in Stage 1 are negative, the consultant,
in collaboration with FD inventory staff, would proceed with a new inventory,
based on forest type maps prepared from existing 1/20,000 aerial photography.
The inventory would follow the accepted standards employed in this type of
work and be designed to give data as in (Stage 1 (c)) above to a degree of
accuracy suitable for making the necessary decisions for allocations of wood
to end uses and for pulp mill feasibility and timing.
In the event of Stage 2 becoming operative, it is expected the
consultant would continue his assignment for additional nine months to finalize
this work.

Choice of sRecies for plantation
].    Within Hazara district many species have been used in streetside and
streamside plantings, largely for firewood and fodder. These have not been
compared systematically for either purpose, nor for pole or sawnwood
production. No attention has been given to seed source within any of these
species.
2.    For plantations on a larger scale, several species have been used
in the FAO/World Food Program project, including particularly P. roxburRhtii
Robina pseudoacacia, Ailanthus altissima and Eucalyptus camaldulensis.L2
Sixteen thousand acres are reported to have been planted but the location /3
and'survival percentage of these is not clear. Most planted trees seen by
the Mission members had been planted with the plastic bags still around the
roots. Some species and provenances have been raised at a poor, flooded
nursery at Abbottabad by FRI and a formal trial of chir pine prbvenances
was planted near Mansehra. For rigorous testing improved nursery stock
will be essential.
Nurseries
3.    Within the World Food Program excellent production of fruit trees
and other hardwoods was observed. However, the nursery techniques for
pines were inadequate with a poor soil mixture that allowed little aeration
or irrigation and no root penetration. Nutrient content appeared low but
no fertiliser was applied. Watering was done by hand from watering cans
fitted with coarse spray-nozzles ("roses"); the amount of water reaching
individual plants was inadequate even if it had been able to penetrate the
soil in the plastic bags. Considerable research and development is
necessary to determine suitable nursery techniques for use in a commercial
afforestation scheme.
Yield estimation
4.    in preparing a plantation program and a pulpmill proposal it is necessary
to obtain estimates of wood yield but no formal sample plot      statistics are
available for plantations in Hazara. Many volume tables for different species
have been prepared in Pakistan (see Appendix 1 ) but little informationon yield hs
been published. Many temporary and permanent sample plots have been
measured recently in natural chir pine forests and data are bein; processed;
however, at present the original Indian yield tables for chir piDn (Howard,
1926), blue pine (Champion et 1., 1929) and deodar (Champion and Mahendru,
1933) are used (by PFI staff, not by many local forest officers) and the
post-partition updated publications from FRI, Dehra Dun, are not available
in Pakistan (e.&. chir pine: Seth, Dabral and Lala, 1972; silver fir:
Chaturvedi, 1973a; blue pine (kail): Chaturvedi, 1973b).
5.    Extracts from several sources are given in Appendix 3.    With the
exception of a plantation at Supkhar, India, these are all from limples in
naturally regenerating forests (sometimes of mixed species) with VadDus
ages, stockings, amounts of damage and thinnings; nevertheless tiey suggest
that mean annual increments for total yield of chir pine woos (uderbark to
2 inches diameter) average approximately 100 cu.ft/acre (7 m /ha> to 20-25
years on good quality sites. Data from sample plots in Murree UiLUs slightly

exceed this and these sites are believed inferior to many of the sites in
Hazara District (most of which are placed in the Chir Quality Class 1).
6.    Yields from well managed plantations at 8 x 8 or 10 x 10 ft with little
or no thinning could be expected to be superior because of the better initi4i
growth obtained from vigorous nursery stock, good establishment and weed
control, andthe more uniform distribution of growth to all crop trees w.th
no thinning. Yields should approach 120 cu.ft/acre (8.4 m3tha) at O0-2S
years. On the basis of current yield tables, the mean diameter at this age
would approximate 8-9 inches overbark, approximately 7-8 inches underbark
at breast height. A carefully documented 0.5 acre plot at Supkhar (Madhya
Pradesh, Indk, south of the natural range of chir pine and at 2,280 ft
altitude but still subject to frost) planted at 6 3x 6 ft spacing in 1907,
yielded an average3MAI of 171 cu .ft/acre (12.0 m /ha) at 20 years and 174
cu.ft/acre (12.2 m /ha) at 60 years with mean diameters of 5.5 inches and
12.6 inches (see Appendix 3).
7.    The use of seed from carefully selected provenances, s*ed stands and
seed trees should improve yields by a further 5-10% for plantations
established from the third or fourth year. Another 10-15% gain may be
obtainable from selective breeding for plastations established from the
tenth year.
8.    These yields obtained and predicted are summarised thus:-

These are average underbark figures for the whole project area.   It is
recognised that the considerable variation between geological, pedological
and climatic characters that occur within the area will cause parallel
variation in wood yleld (on both a per-tree and a per-acre basis). These
variations inltensify the need for a detailed site survey of the project
area. Bark thickness itself varies with site and genotype but particularly
with age; up to 25 years it approximates 20%.
9.    In view of chir pine's adaptation to local conditions of high and low
temperature, rainfall distribution, fire and soil type, it is possible that
no other coniferous species will compete with its growth rate. Nevertheless
other,exotic species may yield better and should be tested under good
management.



iTLi
Page 3
10.       Arising from this review, it is possible to consider a joint approach
to timber and pulp production in a single, well-managed project. Long-fibred
pulp may be produced initially on a 20-25 year clear-fell rotation to meet the
initial requLirements of a pulpuill; mean annual icrenents (MAI) should increase
from a conservative estimate of 98 cu.ft/acre (7 m'/ha) initially to 126 ou.ft/acre
(9 m3/ha) when improved species, provenancea and/or trees are available. This pulp
phase should merge into a pulp-plus-timber phase with timber obtained from a 35-40
year rotation to capitalize on maximum MAI's (140-154 cu.ft/acre; 10-11 m3/ha).
Thinnings and smallwood would still be used for pulp.
II.       1hile the production of long-fibred coniferous pulp is desirable in the
Reserve forests, faster-growing hardwood species will be more attractive to Guzara
ouera.   Although many hardwood trees have been planted for fuel or fodder along
roadsides and streacsides virtually no pure plantation blocks have been established
and no yield assessments have been made. However, with eareful ohoice of speopes/
provenances (especially among eucalypts), with good nursery stock and with efficient
plantation techniques, mean annual increments of 168-210 cu.ft/acre (12-15 m /ha)
should be obtainable on 10-12 year rotations. It will be necessary to convince
Guzara owners of the feasibility of this proposal by demonstration in well-managed
pilot plantations.
B. COMPCNENTS
12.       A central core of the proposed project is a progrm of pilot
plantations supported by intensive research into nursery and plantation techniques,
by genetic improvement, and by tests of the suitability of the raw material for
pulping.
Pilot p] antations
]3.     (a)  The proposed program includes the establishment of plantations of
pine and hardwoods (poplars and a-der on wet sites near streams, eucalypts and
other species in drier sites - see Appendix 4 for suggested species); the
plantations would be established in both Reserved Forest and in Guzara Forests
with emphasis on hardwoods in the treeless Guzaras to demonstrate their fast
growth and economic advantages to private owners.
(b) The planting program would increase annually over the 5-year period
from a modest start with current techniques and locally collected seed of chir,
eucalypt and poplar to a final annual target approximately that of the full
commercial afforestation phase. By the third year improved nursery techniques
should yield consistently better stock and improved planting techniques should
yield better survival and initial growth. Throughout the period trials of
introduced species and provenances and the provision of improved seed should continue.
(c) Pilot plantations sho-ald be located in compact blocks on land that is
typical of the major areas to be afforested. Without prejudging the results of the
site survey and classification, it should be possible to select two or three
different site types (different in geology, soil, altitude and/or aspect),
accessibl.e to the project headquarters and central nArsery, and with sufficient land
in adjacent Reserve and Guzara Forests. The proposed planting program would thus
be approximately as follows :-

J4.(a)General. Current nursery practice is poor, particularly for chir pine,
and contributes to poor field survival and growth. The present soil mixture
and watering regimes are not conducive to balanced root development. Some
plants have virtually no lateral roots and those that are present are
concentrated in the upper few millimetres of soil; others have a tap root
that has reached the bottom of the polythene bag and curled around, thus
predisposing the plant to a permanently deformed root system in the field.
A thorough program of nursery research is desirable to determine economic
techniques for the production of rigorous planting stock at the right time
of year.
(k) Almost all nursery operations are subject to significant variation
and these variations have impotant effects on the size, vigour and survival
of planting stock. For each operation a range of techniques should be
tested in designed, comparative experiments. It is most convenient to
locate all nursery research in one central nursery but a satellite sub-
station is provided in case a separate afforestation area is located in
which some conditions differ. The main centre can also supply plants for
the pilot plantations and, later, it can be expanded to form the main
commercial nursery. Provision is made for staff, accommodation and equipment,
including vehicles and irrigation system; the irrigation system would
comprise a diesel engine (e..&. Lister 3 cylinder with life of 6-10 years),
a pump and a conventional, manually-moved, aluminium pipe and sprinkler
system providing approximately 0.30 inches water equivalent per plant per
day. Enquiries of European suppliers indicate that total capital cost (f.o.b.)
for a 5 acre nursery would be approximately PRs. 63,000. Provision is also
made for a meteoroJogical station to be set up in the central nursery (temperature,
rainfall, humidity, wind records) with six satellite rain gauges in the major
site types.
(c) In the discussions below it is assumed that all planting stock will
be tubed. Bare-rooted plants of pine are known to be unsuitable in Hazara
and bare-rooted hardwoods are also unlikely to be successful. In the
calculations of nursery requirements a standard pot size is assumed although
nursery research may indicate that different species require different
tube sizes. No allowance is made for the small area of sowing beds since
all pot requirements have been rounded up. All pots should be covered with
X inch medium gravel to prevent hardening of the soil surface. Most seeds
should be sown at a depth equal to 2-3 times the seed diameter.
(d)The derivations of the numbers of plants required for nursery experiments
are given in Appendix 5.
(e)Sowing time. This is normally related to the required size of planting
stock and to the conditions (rainfall, temperature and insolation) at the
time of sowing. Planting may be practised in winter or in the monsoon and
there is a range of sowing times that could produce suitable planting stock.
(f) Soil mixture and sand fraction. Various mixtures of soil, sand and
humus should be tested to obtain sufficient aeration, irrigation and root
development. Soil should be collected from chir forest to ensure mycorrhization.
Humus is generally undesirable in pine nurseries because it increases
damping-off disease and may transport spores of needle disease (Lophodermium).
In tests of soil mixture a standard NPK fertilizer could be added.

Ct) Fertilizers. Trials of N,P,K and Mg at 3 levels each and trace
elements (boron, copper and zinc at one level) are proposed since nursery
fertilization costs little yet has a significant effect on plant growth.
It is also necessary to determine the frequency of application of fertilizers.
(h) Bag/tube size. Bags have commonly been used in Hazara because it
was believed that tubes lose soil and damage the plants in transit.
Elsewhere this has not been found true; open tubes minimise root curling
and also allow root pruning where necessary. A range of sizes should be
compared; large tubes may produce larger root systems but the costs of
transporting soil to the nursery and tubed plants to the field are high.
Long narrow tubes encourage deep rooting which is suitable for naturally
tap-rooted species.
(i) Root pruning. This is practised to stimulate lateral development
of roots and the production of a dense, fibrous root system. Tubed stock
may be root pruned at various times of the year (depending on the size of
tube and whether roots have reached the bottom). Comfion methods are to
lift each tube individually and cut the protruding roots with a hand-knife
or to prune all the tubes in a nursery section by a long-knife or wire.
(j) Watering regime. Normally the nursery would be watered by the
irrigation system and distribution rates can be calculated from knowledge
of the nursery area, pump capacity, tube diameter, sprinkler density and
hours of operation (see e.g. Paul, 1972). However, water requirements
vary between species and trials of actual amounts are required, using
measured amounts applied by hand.
15. Development of establishment and cultural techniques
(a) General. Current practice requires replacement of 25% of all planted
stock in the first year, 10% in the second year and a few trees in the third
year. Later deaths or poor growth may also be expected from trees planted
with the nursery tubes in place around the roots. This is an expensive
waste of nearly one-third of all nursery stock plus the supervision and
labour of replanting. Also an improvement to 95% survival in the first
year would effectively reduce the rotation age by 1-2 years. An equal
reduction may be caused by improved initial growth (in the slow portion of
the sigmoid growth curve) obtained from better ground preparation and post-
planting cultural treatments.
(b) Throughout the field trials it is recommended that two provenances of
chir pine be used to minimise the chance of using a source that is not
typical of the species. The derivations of plant requirements are given in
Appendix 6. Allowance is made for a representative range of experiments at a
Sub-Station in a different area if one is identified.

(c) Ground preparation. Excavated pits of different sizes should be com-
pared with simple crowbar holes; different reponses may be detected on dif-
ferent soil types.
(d) Spacing. The study of spacing effects is a long-term project but it
should be initiated early in the program since initial spacing affects per
acre costs and yields, especially in plantations that may be managed on a
long rotation for timber. Ideally spacing studies would be coordinated with
thinning studies but, at this stage, thinning trials cannot be initiated
(until pilot plantations reach possible thinning age, although thinning may
not be necessary in pine pulpwood plantations).
(e) Spacing trials may be laid out with systematic designs (Nelder's cir-
cular or "clinal" designs) but these are somewhat difficult to lay out and
analyse. Randomised complete block designs with equal plot areas (i.e.
unequal numbers of tree per plot for the different spacings) are recommended.
(f) Altitudinal effects. These are particularly pronounced in chir pine
and a trial of extreme altitudinal provenances on a range of plantation
altitudes and aspects is recommended.
(g) Size of planting stock. Size of plants and the root/shoot balance are
important in survival and early growth particularly where long dry seasons
occur or where weed competition is severe. In many afforestation programs
plants are too large and a range of sizes from 20-40 cm should be tested.
(h) Fertilization. N, P and K applied soon after planting may have major
effects, depending on the site type, and at least two levels of each (i.e.
none vs. some) should be tested in all combinations.    If significant major
e3fects orinteractions are detected it may be necessary to proceed to a full
3 factorial to determine the economic response surface. It will also be
desirable later to determine the effect of fertilizer on pole-stage crops.
(i) Season of planting. This study should be coordinated with studies of
nursery sowing time and size of planting stock. Late winter, early monsoon
and mid/late monsoon are all potential planting times.
(j) Weeding intensity. The need for weeding will depend on the site con-
ditions. It is expensive but desirable where weed growth is vigorous or
where dry seasons are so severe that competition for limited water is serious.
Tests should compare spot and strip weeding at various frequencies.



ANNEX 2
Genetic Trials
15.(a)General. Although the nearest indigenous species is the safest and
simplest with which to initiate a plantation program, exotic species may be
faster-growing or have superior properties. While chir pine may be grown in
Reserved Forest, its relatively long rotation (20-25 years for pulp) will
not be attractive to Guzara owners and a fast-growing species is required;
in particular short-fibred exotic species such as eucalypts and poplars
would be economically attractive and technically acceptable for pulp. In
addition some introduced species would produce firewood and fodder.
(b)The genetic component of the proposed project therefore includes three
main lines of attack:- (i) species trials (including two or more provenances
of some species) to identify well-adapted, fast-growing species for pulpwood,
timber, firewood and fodder, (ii) provenance trials of wide-ranging species,
including chir pine and the most likely hardwoods, to identify the best seed
sources and (iii) selective breeding of chir pine through plus trees, progeny
trials and seed orchards to improve the growth rate (and later the wood prop-
erties if necessary) of this local, adapted species. The conduct of species
and provenance trials in the nursery and field stages is described in detail
by Burley and Wood (1976)/1. The trials in a given year should be raised
under the nursery and plantation techniques that are currently believed
optimum ("best information technique"). Provision is made in the project for
three range officers to cover nursery development, establishment research
with the pilot plantations, and genetic research. The genetic and silvi-
cultural aspects of the program should be conducted with the advice and direct
participation of the PFI genetic and silvjc&lduial st ff. the Sites., replications and
areas for the trials discussed below are ta UIa ea - Appenlxr.
(c)Species trials. It would be theoretically desirable but practically
uneconomic to proceed through stages of species elimination (trials of many
species for short duration), species testing (fewer possible species,k-k
rotation) and species proving or crop performance (2-3 probable species for
½-1 rotation in plots large enough to estimate yields and undertake manage-
ment studies). In this project it is necessary to compress these stages and
select fewer species for initial comparison with the indigenous chir pine and
with the widely used hardwoods (e.&. E. camaldulensis, Robinia pseudoacacia).
(d) Possible species are listed in Appendix 4 together with indications of
possible seed suppliers. The main groups of species are conifers for long
fibre in Reserved Forests and thardwoods for firewood, pulpwood or fodder;
these hardwoods would largely be grown commercially in Guzara Forests but the
species and provenance trials would be conducted in secure, accessible but
typical sites in Forest Reserves.
(e) Provenance trials. These require careful collection and documentation
of seed from known sources to determine the pattern of variation; if this is
not already known, and to identify the best provenance(s) for individual
sites. In the case of exotic species written requests must be made to
national or international agencies for supply of seed; such material may be
expensive and should be carefully stored, and treated in the nursery and field.
(C) The most promising species at this stage for which provenance trials are
already justified are chir pine (for which a small provenance trial already

exists near Mansehra) and the related eucalypts E. camaldulensis and
E. tereticornis (see Pryor, 1967; Qadri, 1968). Seeds of dry zone prov-
enances of these two may be requested from the Division of Forestry, CSIRO,
Canberra. Considerable work on E. camaldulensis has already been done in
other parts of Pakistan (see Hafeez and Sheikh, 1973; Qadri, 1969) but nob
in Hazara District.
(g)Progeny testing. The last stage of genetic improvement that involves
comparative trials is the phase of progeny testing in species that form a
major and well-established part of the project (initially chir pine here).
It is undertaken for three main purposes:-
(i) Estimation of population variances, based on open-pollinated
progeny of random dominant or co-dominant trees, to determine the
genetic structure of the population, to determine the breeding strategy
and to predict genetic gain.
(ii) Evaluation of plus trees, based on open-pollinated or control-
pollinated progeny of superior phenotypes (see below), to estimate
breeding values and facilitate secondary selection.
(iii) Creation of selection plantings, large blocks of known parentage
to permit between-family and within-family selection.
Seed Production
17.(a)The amount of seed required each year will vary with species and planting
program but it is desirable to be self-sufficient in seed supply at the
earliest opportunity for two reasons. Firstly, purchase of seed places the
buyer at the mercy of foreign suppliers (cost, availability and reliability).
Secondly, local seed may be improved genetically from the outset of the pro-
gram. Provision is made for purchase of simple equipment for extraction and
refrigerated storage of seed (particularly chir pine since this species
flowers at 2-3 year intervals and several years' supplies must be maintained).
Limited facilities for seed and pollen testing are also included.
(b)Seed trees and seed stands. Current seed collection in chir pine is
haphazard, from poor phenotypes and with little or no supervision by pro-
fessional staff. In future seed should be collected from superior trees
(selected at a low intensity of about 5 per acre in uniform forest) and from
seed stands (phenotypically the best stands available at fruiting age and
thinned heavily to stimulate crown development and flower production). This
should secure a small amount of genetic gain, good control of seed origin and
records, a greater interest on the part of field staff, and greater care in
seed handling and nursery treatment. Gradually seed stand seed would be
replaced by seed from orchards derived from superior phenotypes ("plus trees")
selected for form and vigour at moderate intensity (1 per 1-5 acres) in uni-
form forest.



ANNEl 2
Page 9
(c) Seed orchard requirements and vegetative propagation. Estimates of the
age of onset of flowering in chir pine varied between 25 and 60 years with the
PFI geneticists favouring the younger ages. Certainly trees of approximately
20 years were seen to be flowering and by 25 years reasonable commercial
crops might be expected. Nevertheless this is too long to wait for seed pro-
duction from a seedling seed orchard and vigorous attempts should be made to
perfect techniques for vegetative propagation.
(d) Air-layering is successful with chir pine but it is tedious and expens-
ive.   Grafting has so far been unsuccessful, largely because grafts of the
veneer type are difficult with thick-barked species. Tip cleft systems would
be more likely to succeed and should be developed. Successful grafting has
been reported in India (Khosla /1   , 1976).  It is not recommended to study
techniques of rooting needle fascicles since these require careful control
of the rooting and aerial environments.
(e) Assuming that vegetative propagation of mature trees is adopted, grafts
(ramets) should flower within 2-3 years of grafting. Cones yield 50 seeds in
chir pine (cf. 100-130 in blue pine) and a large-crowned tree contains 50
cones, or 2,500 seeds. At a spacing of 15 x 15 ft (to encourage crown and
flower development) this produces 194 ramets and 485,000 seeds/acre at full
production. Assuming 750 plants per acre of plantation (allowing 10% replace-
ment and 8 x 8 ft spacing) one acre of seed orchard would supply 650 acres of
plantation. However, good seed years occur every third year in chir pine so
that a store of seed must be maintained for the two poor years. An effective
yield would thus approximate 300 acres of plantation per acre of seed orchard.
(f) If 50,000 acres are to be afforested with improved seed over 25 years,
this requires 2,000 acres of plantations annually obtainable from 7 acres of
seed orchard or 1,358 grafts (say 30 ramets of 50 plus tree ortets = 1500
grafts = 7.7 acres). For security the orchard should be repeated on two
sites, espectally since excess seed can be used for other plantation areas
(e..&. Azad Kashmir, Murree, Dir and Swat). Thus a total of 15 acres of
clonal seed orchard is desirable, at the rate of 5 acres/year for the last
three years of the project. No allowance for the 2,910 seedling stocks is
given in Appendix 7, since generous allowances for seedlings have been made
in other nursery developments.
(g) The research on vegetative propagation and the seed orchard development
would be undertaken by the Range Officer (genetics) under the supervision of
the project manager and with the advice and cooperation of the PFI geneticist.

Annual phasing of nursery and plantation programs
18. (a)    The pilot plantation and research programs are phased to allow a
progressive build-up in staff, facilities, expertise and information,
beginning with small areas of known species and building up to a plantation
level that is equivalent to annual requirements in the second phase (fully
commercial) of the pulpwood program. Most work is concentrated at the main
center with representative samples in the sub-station.
(b)    The main nursery research should be undertaken in the first two
years and the main silvicultural and genetic research in years 2-4.
However, it is emphasized that research and development of improved
techniques or populations are dynamic processes that continue throughout
a plantation program. Further no research or plantation program can be
meaningful without rigorous protection from animals, men and fires.
(c)    Details of the annual nursery requirements for nursery research,
silvicultural research, genetic trials and pilot plantations are given in
Appendix 8. Field area requirements for silvicultural and genetic
research and pilot plantations are listed in Appendix 11. A summary of
both nursery and planting programs is given in Appendix 12. Including
the possible sub-station, total area planted in five years would be
slightly less than 5,000 acres and total nursery production would
approximate 3.7 million plants.
Management
19.        The foregoing activities would be under the direct responsibility of the
Assistant Project Director who would be responsible to the Chief Conservator of
Forests, NWFP, (Project Director). He would be assisted by an internationally
recruited specialist for the first three years of the project, (see Annex 3),
three Range Forest Officers (Grade 17) and six Foresters (Grade 5). A detailed
description of project management is given in Annex 6.
Costs
20.        Detailed physical requirements and costs of the central nursery,
research trials and pilot plantations are contained in Table 2 of the main
report.
Wood and pulp tests
21.        The Forest Products Research Division of PFI is able to examine
the physical, mechanical and anatomical properties of wood but has no
facilities for testing the suitability of wood for pulping. Most pine
species have long fibres and have usually been found suitable for kraft
pulping, although yields are sometimes low because of low wood density.
Chir pine from natural forest appears to have acceptable density and, with
modern pulping technology, stem resin is no problem.



ANNEX 2
Page 11
22.       Before embarking on a major pulpwood plantations program however,
it would be necessary to evaluate the pulping characteristics on a commercial
basis. This would provide a definitive assessment of timber properties on
which to base forest industries development and associated plantations
development.
23.       The project would finance bulk testing of 1-ton of Chir pine at
an internationally recognized laboratory (e.g., Canada, Finland, U.SoA.)
and include the costs of shipping, laboratory testing, literature search
and reporting. A Pakistan specialist should attend the test and prepare
his own report on the processes and results and these expenses are included
in the costs.  Estimated total costs are PRs. 305,000 and are detailed in
Table 2 of the main report.
24.       The project director would coordinate with the Pakistan Forest
Institute in  arranging for the tests, for which PFI would take primary
responsibility. The timing of the tests would be arranged so that results
would be available for inclusion in the data presented for the industrial
feasibility study - see Annex 5.
25.       Pulping tests of other likely species would be conducted in the
follow-up phase when their growth potential has been confirmed.

ANNEX 2

Notes on some possible species and provenances for replicated,
comparative trials in various environments /1
A. Sub-tropical montane regions (2,500-5,000 ft) with summer rainfall (e.g.
Hazara)
1.  Conifers for pulp /2
Pinus caribaea (var. bahamensis from Bahamas for locations where
frost is rare; seed from CFI, Oxford)
P. elliottii        (as far as possible origins from low
P. palustris        latitude simmer rainfall areas in USA;
P. rigida           seed obtainable from USFS Seed Centre,
P. taeda           Macon, Georgia)
P. densiflora   (origins from north of range in South Korea; seed
P. thunbergiii from Institute of Forest Genetics, Suwon)
P. kesiya (Burma, Thailand origins   possible; also compare Assam)
P. halepensis/ -P. brutia (several provenances within the natural
range, although this is essentially a Mediterranean species)
P. tabulaeformis/P. yunnanensis (northern extension of P. kesiya
in China; seed may be obtainable through FAO)
P. oocarpa, P. patula, P. radiata (unlikely to succeed in this zone
but worth including in species elimination phase)
P. michoacana/P. douglasiana (thick bark, long needles, grass stage,
fire resistant but unlikely to adjust to photoperiod)
P. pseudostrobus/P. tenuifolia (high altitude origins with more
evenly distributed rainfall may have potential; seed from CFI,
Oxford)
P. ponderosa (high temperature, low latitude origins, e.&. Lake
Tahoe, California)
P. roxburghii (include both Pakistan and Indian sources)
Cupressus arizonica/C. lusitanica/C. torulosa (more useful for timber
than pulp but worthy of trial in the early stages)
2.  Hardwoods for pulp, matchwood, furniture, fuel or fodder:
Eucalyptus bicostata
E. camaldulensis   (4-6 dry zone provenances)
E. tereticornisr)
E. citriodora
E. cloeziana
E. globulus
E. melanophloia
E. microtheca (suitable for trial in arid, saline and waterlogged
areas)
/1 Many of these species have already been tested sporadically in Pakistan
or are to be included in ARC/PL480 proposal by PFI.
/2 Even in a short-rotation unthinned pulpwood plantation, some butt logs
may be usable for timber.   Although none of the species would be tapped
for resin during a 20-25 year rotation it may be feasible to inject
trees with paraquat one year before felling to stimulate the production

typical chir pine zone. The same nursery will produce plants for
development of establishment methods and cultural techniques and for
pilot plantations. No spare plants are included for nursery trials since
an assessment of deaths and culls is one object of the experiments.

HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Training and Fellowships
Plantations Development
1.        A critical aspect of plantations establishment is the rapid
development of improved and economic techniques for nursery and plantation
management, followed by dissemination of knowledge to commercial plantation
staff. To achieve these objectives, in the 5-year project proposed above,
provision would be made for the services of an internationally recruited
specialist in nursery and plantation technology. The specialist would be
employed for the first three years of the project, and could be re-employed
on a 1-month consultancy basis for-continuing advice in the last two years of
the project. A job description for this specialist post is included in
Appendix 1.
2.        The plantation specialist would assist the project director in
arranging training fellowships for himself (the project director), the assistant
project director and the nursery range officer. These should include two
2-month visits to on-going plantation projects particularly in east, central
and southern Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Madagascar and possibly
South Africa, Swaziland or Rhodesia) and may include Turkey or India. The assistant
project directorwould study all aspects of nursery and plantation organization
and management; the nursery range officer would spend one visit working in all
operations in a commercial scale nursery and the second visiting several nurseries;
the project director would study the integration of forestry and forest
industries development.
Other Activities
3.        In addition to the inventory specialist discussed in Appendix 1.
provision is made for one month of specialist forestry consultancy in each of the
last three years of the project with flexibility for subjects (e.g., soils,
entomology, genetics, pathology, seed technology or general management), as need
arises. The project manager would arrange these consultancies in collaboration
with the PFI taking account of any special problems being encountered in the
technical support of the project being provided by PFI.
4.        The project itself would provide technical advice to the small forestry
component in the proposed hill farming technical development project by making
available information on technical developments and providing short in-service
training in nursery and planting techniques, funds for which would be provided
for in the hill farming project.
5.        Estimated costs of training and fellowships are PRs 1.9 million and are
detailed on Table 2 of the main report.

HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Guzara Forest Owners Task Force
Background
1.        The total designated forest land area in Hazara district is about
1.25.. acres, of ihich about I m. acres is privately owned land known as
"Guzara". A large proportion of the Guzara land is marginal hill areas
without tree cover and used mainly for grass fodder production and grazing.
The Guzara land is partly privately owned and partly comunally owned
"Shamlat" land. In both ownership patterns holdings are relatively small,
averaging about four to five acres/family. Within the project area, some
50% (30,000 acres) of the existing Chir pine forests are Ouzara and the
gross area of 90,000 acres for new plantations establishment is entirely
Guzara. Developing a positive approach to forestry production and manage-
ment among the Guzara owners is therefore crucial to the launching of the
proposed intensive forestry and forest industries development.
2.        The flrst forest conservancy rules for Hazara district were enacted
in 1857, followed in 1872-73 by the first regular boundary settlement which
established Reserved Forests vested in the government and Guzara forests,
which were recognized as privately owned lands and were declared for
conservancy primarily to ensure the requirements of owners and other
rightholders for timber, firewood, grass-cutting and grazing. Government
declared the right to conservancy management and a share in the proceeds of
any sales. Further legislation in 1879 gave power to government to demarcate
the Guzara forests and by 18846 some 150,000 acres has been demarcated. There
fonlowed some disputes regarding the procedure and in 1894, the original
demarcations were upheld and two types of Guzara forests recognized; demarcated
forests in which new land could not be broken and undemarcated forests in which
new land could be broken for cultivation. Both types continued to be subject
to control of tree felling. The second boundary settlement in l904/5 saw
small adjustments to the boundaries and these were again reviewed in the third
settlement in 3935/6. All Guzara land, both demarcated and undemarcated on
the ground, is recorded in the Land Revenue Maps known as Latha (1" = 220').
The Hazara Forest Act, 1936 codified the regulations for Guzara forest
management.
3.        Up until 1950, executive management of the Guzara forests vested
in the Deputy Commissioner, with the Forest Department (FD) performing the
function of technical managers, supervising the selection of trees for
felling for private use and commercial sales on the basis of conservancy
control. IUnder the Hazara Management of Waste Iand Rules, 1950, executive
management was transferred to the FD. Since then, some 1O0,000 acres of
undemarcated Guzara have demarcated on the ground and 30-year working
management plans prepared for the more richly forested areas.



ANNEX 4

4.        In the procedure for commercial exploitation of the Guzara forests,
the FD select the trees to be felled, authorize the contractors to carry out
the felling operations and receive full payment for the sales. At the time
of marking for felling the local Patwaril/records the names of the owners
on the felling schedules. Upon payment for the trees by the contractor,
FD deduct 20% of the sale proceeds and forward the balance to the Deputy
Commissioner, together with the felling schedules. This 80% of sale proceeds
is then sent to the Tehsil office for payment to the beneficiary owners,
some of whom reside up to 40 miles distance from the Tehsil office. The
procedure results in long delays from time of sale to payment of owner;
with as long as four years elapsing between the two transactions and commonly
a delay of up to one year. Moreover, under the present management system,
which relies upon natural regeneration to sustain 120-year rotation production
of saw-timber, the quantity of timber marketed, per unit area of forest is
very low and the interval between fellings of some 30 years, is excessively
2ong. These are some of the principal reasons why Guzara owners are dis-
enchanted with the present management system, which provide little real
income and no incentive to develop commercial forestry activities. The
present pause in forest exploitation caused by the cessation of private
contractorst operations and failure to implement an alternative harvesting
system is further aggravating relationships between the private forest owners
and FD.
5.        Use of the Guzara forests to supply the domestic needs of owners
and other rightholders is contro]led by FD', see para. 2 above, under the
Guzara Rules of 1950, attached as Exhibit A. The administration of these
rules is a major task occupying a significant proportion of the workload of
FD staff and gives rise, together with infringements of commercial felling
regulations, to numerous legal confrontations between FD and owners/right-
holders. In 1974, there were some 58,000 outstanding cases, equal to about
20% of owners and rightholders, of breaches of forest rules in Hazara district.
This demonstrates the need for a review of the present arrangements.
Approach to increased Guzara forest owner participation and productivity
6.        All agencies at all levels of Government are well aware of the
magnitude of the social problems that will accompany major forestry and
forest industries development in the Hazara region. The Guzara forest
owners presently exercise a land-use pattern which emphasizes grazing and
fodder production rather than tree growth, which stems primarily from the
historical approach to Guzara forest management discussed above. It is
inevitable that the conversion of more land to forest use, and a change to
intensive and concentrated forest management will introduce conflicts between
the local people and those charged with administering the forestry and forest
industry programs unless careful consideration is given to these problems.

7.        However, these changes will enhance the opportunities for revenue
generation on privately owned land which is currently under-utilized, and
also bring employment potential in the forestry and industriai operations.
Under well managed plantations, timber yields of over 100 ft. /acre/year
are expected, compared with present average yields of less than 10 ft.'/acre/
year. Considerable orientation and motivation will be necessary from the
beginning to ensure that the local population is prepared and able to take
advantage of these opportunities.
8.        During the course of the proposed Forestry Pre-investment
project relatively small land areas will be involved, and there should be
relatively little disturbance to traditional land-use patterns. It is
essential that this period be effectively utilized to develop the necessary
institutions and secure the participation of the local population before
the commencement of large-scale planting operations in about 19800
9.        A provincial inter-departmental group with operating funds provided
by the Sarhad Development Authority has already initiated some studies in
this field. The group is represented by the FD, Department of Cooperatives
and the Economics Section of the University of NWFP, Peshawar and expects
to complete a preliminary report by June, 1977. Aspects being studied
include :
( i) the collection of base data of areas, numbers of
forest owners and rightholders;
( ii) assessment of the present operation of the forest
rules and possible improvement to these;
(iii) assessment of the existing land tenure system and
its implications for successful tree growing
program;
( iv) preliminary assessment of the economic returns from
existing uses of the land considered suitable for
tree growth vis-a-vis the proposed use of land under
forestry;
( v) attitudes of the local population towards the chang-
ing land-use and the working through cooperative
societies or through the Forest Department or the
mill;
( vi) collection of bench mark data on present income and
income sources and, demographic information on labor
force/earning member per family and their levels of
employment, existing credit/subsidies facilities for
land management activities, estimation of levels of
the existing land-use technologies, and available
social institutions and characteristics for trans-
mission and adoption of innovations;



Page 4
(vii) possibility of acquiring land for plantations
development by rental, compensation payments,
cash-wage payments to forest owners for
plantations development and maintenQz}ce work,
or a combination of these incomes; ,(
(viii) possibility of forming Guzara forest owner
"cooperatives". The possibility of "co-
operatives" is being seriously pursued and
applications for registration are presently
being prepared for seven societies. It is
envisaged that the societies would be affiliated
to a Hazara Cooperative Board which would provide
technical and management services to individual
societies and be the coordinating agency for
overall management of the forests;
( ix) possible projection of the socio-economic changes
on account of the envisaged program;
( x) assessment of the development support communication
activities needed to ensure public and private
support and development program and formulation
of the needed extension program on the basis of
the socio-economic information collected in the
foregoing study.
10.       These various alternatives will require further study and development
in order to work out satisfactory management arrangements and it is proposed
that additional funds be made available from the proposed credit.
Project Activities
11.       It is appropriate that the necessary studies and preparation of
firm recommendations on which GONWFP can take decisions be undertaken
primarily by a task force composed of qualified and dedicated people from
within existing government institutions. Approaches must be developed on a
flexible basis, responding to the expressed and observed reactions of the
people concerned. The following notes are a guide towards achieving the
desired objectives, and provide a basis for defining the scope of activity
in this field. Detailed Terms of Reference for internal activities and any
proposed external inputs to this effort would be prepared by the Department
of Forestry with assistance from GONWFP and other relevant organizations.
12.       The task force would be appointed by the Project Development
Committee and consist of a forest officer familiar with Guzara forest
administration and capable of conducting extension work; an economist
with knowledge of the customs of the Hazara people, or similar forest

dwellers and competent in evaluating alternative land uses; a sociologist
with know]edge of the customs of Hazara people and experienced in conducting
surveys and interpreting current attitudes to existing customs and
regulations and responses to proposed changes; and a cooperative specialist
knowledgeable in the formation of new community enterprises. A task force
member wou]d be appointed as team leader, who, in consultation with the
project director, would prepare a detailed work program for the team.
Provision is included for employing the services of an internationally
recruited sociologist to assist the team, as necessary, in compilation
and assessment of base data, developing a strategy, evaluating results
of studies and preparing action recommendations. In addition, the team
would be supported by an agronomist and a livestock development specialist
to evaluate and prepare proposals for complementary developments in farming
systems and range management. It is expected these two specialists would
be seconded to the team by the rnWFP Department of Agriculture and/or the
Agricultural Research Council.
13.       Initially the task force would collect and present additions]
relevant data for the proposed development area including :
( i) family structure of the target population; felt
needs; traditional social institutions;
( ii)  educationa) background;  employment patterns;
assessment of employment potential;
(iii) forest land holdings; forest concessions, includ-
ing those of rightholders; traditional patterns
of forest use and forest usufruct;
( iv) attitudes to possible changes in forest land use
and forest usufruct;
( v) agricultural holdings and proportion of family
income derived from holdings;
( vi) numbers of livestock and grazing requirements,
including an assessment of fodder and grazing in
forest lands and rangelands used by the target
population.
(vii) evaluation of present land use patterns in terms
of manpower requirements and money costs; construct-
ion of models of alternative land use under forestry
production and comparison of these with present
land use patterns;
(viii) present taxation (fees) on forest production;
( ix) present systems of payments for forest production
to beneficiary Guzara owners;
( x) chains of communication between individuals, groups
and government agencies.
34.       Based on this information, proposals would be prepared (see also
para. 27) for integrating the local population in the development program,
including :



ANNEX 4
Page 6
( i) new institutions considered necessary; such as
forest extension service; forestry publicity;
"forestry cooperatives";
( ii) forestry training schemes;
(iii)  comp)ementary agricultural improvements, particularly
in fodder production; assessment of possibilities for
improved fodder production; proposals for technical package
development, extension, input supply and credit to develop
range lands pari passu with the proposed forest plantations
development;
C iv) apportionment of areas for commercial forestry, local
forestry and agriculture, including grazing;
( v) arrangements for financing forestry, including the advance-
ment of credit for tree growing and payments for wood
harvested or for land use and the possibility of advance
payments to owners against future tree crops;
( vi) modification to existing forest rules, including present
leve3s of taxes and administrative charges;
(vii) a phased program for the implementation of these proposals;
1$.       The responses of the target population to the various project
proposals and different approaches would be accurately measured and recorded
to indicate the weighting given by these groups.
16.       The task force would consider and make recommendations on
( i) methodology for expJaining to the target population
the new strategies to be developed as the project
progresses;
( ii)  method of implementation of development activities
and work program, including, for example, the role
of "forestry cooperatives"; function of vi3lage
leaders.
17.       The task force would prepare three-monthly progress reports for
the project development Committee and receive guidance from the Committee,
and other relevant institutions as the Committee may direct, in the conduct
of their work. Intermediate consultation between the task force and the
Project Development Committee would be essential to ensure that the task
force work is proceeding along lines acceptable to government and that
specific proposals for approval by GCNWFP resulting from the work have the
full support of the Project Development Committee.
18.       The estimated costs for the task force are PRs. 660,000 and are
detailed in Tab)e 2 of the main report. Provision is made for employment
of 60 man-months of the Pakistan specialists discussed, two study tours
by team members to review arrangements in other countries which have developed
workable solutions to similar problems, six months of outside consul tancy services
and field and office expenses including clerical staff. Draft terms of reference
for the internationally recruited consultant and contained in Appendix 1. It is
expected that the costs of the agronomist and livestock devel opmnt specialist would
be met from the regular budgets of their department although cont&ngency Linano ng
has been included to cover their costs if this is needed.

HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Guzara Forest Owners' Task Force
Consultant Sociologist : Draft Job Description and Terms of Reference
Background
1.        The project aims to prepare a base over the next two to three
years to implement an integrated forestry and forest industries development
program in the Chir pine zone of Hazara district. Within the project area,
some 58,o0o acres of existing natural Chir pine forests would form the
nucleus resource base. About 30,000 acres of these forests are private
"Guzara" forests, partly privately and partly communally owned but managed
by the Forest Department under legislations dating back 100 years. In
addition to the forested areas, there is some 90,000 acres of treeless
Guzara land presently used for fodder gathering and rough grazing. It is
proposed to reforest about 28,000 acres of these former forest lands as
part of the development program. The Government financed in 1976/77 a
preliminary study to evaluate the pattern of forest holdings, which averages some
four to five acres per family, and investigate alternative methods to secure
Guzara owner participation in reforestation. The project would finance an
expansion of the study to a task force, including a forest officer, economist,
sociologist and cooperative specialist, and provides for six months consultancy
services of an internationally recruited sociologist or social anthropologist
to assist the task force. The task force would be responsible for preparing
for Government approval an action plan for achieving a workable system through
which Guzara owners would participate in the development program.
Job Description
2.        The main responsibilities of the sociologist would be :
(a) to provide scientific/methodological assistance in designing
the quantitative and qualitative studies of the Guzara
forest owners and other forest users, in line with the
Project's objectives;
(b) to carry out the specific tasks discussed below and advise
on the direction of the work of the task force;
(c) to participate in the interpretation of the team's findings
and to work out the social engineering part of the project's
overall strategy; and,
(d)  to provide in-service training to the task force sociologist.



ANNEX 4
Appendix I
Page 2
3.        The consultant's six months assignment would be divided in three
time-sequences of two, one and three months respectively, so as to ensure
his presence in the critical periods of the task force's work. During his
work in Pakistan, the consultant will be stationed in Hazara district.
4.        The consultant would prepare a comprehensive analytical report
on his work which could be incorporated in the task force's findings. The
report should cover the research questions defined in his Terms of Reference
and include a description of the social methodology for securing the positive
participation of the target population in the development program. The
consultant would report directly to the Project Director, submitting a copy
o2 his reports to IDA.
Terms of Reference
5.        The consultant will assess the socio-economic information collected
by the preliminary Study Team and will determine the need of further relevant
data in view of the Project's objectives. In close cooperation with the
economist and the sociologist of the task force, he will design the approach
and the research procedures for the study of the project area population.
More particularly, the consultant will assist the force:
(a)  to assess the demographic and socio-cultural structure of
the group of Guzara Forest Owners (size, density, settle-
ment patterns, family and kinship patterns, occupations,
ethnic, tribal and other relevant groups residing in the
project area);
(b)  to identify the prevailing customary Guzara lan&dholding
rights, as well as formal legal rights, on the grazing,
forestry and arable lands; to detenmine the production
and usufruct patterns, share cropping patterns and the
transmittal of ownership or usufruct rights along family
and/or tribal lines, through informal and formal inheritance
rules. This information would form the basis to assess
the economic and cultural acceptability of the changes
promoted through the project in the existing ownership,
production and usufruct systems;
(c)  to study the traditional authority and power structure
in the project area and the customary self-management
institutions and bodies (e.g., village elders, headmen);
based on this analysis, to evaluate the authority mechanisms for
forest owners' participation in forestry development and for
enforcing existing, and any proposed, rules of forestry
management; particular attention should be given to the
accepted systems of dispute/conflict settlement and methods
of community sanction;



AKNNEX 4
APpendix ]
Page 3
(d)  to study the income sources and the subsistence needs
of the typical social unit in the project area and to
estimate the economic impact of the conversion of more
land to intensive forest use; e.g., can the target
group afford the immediate loss of some immediate
benefits in exchange for 3ong-term benefits from forestry?
what incentives or provisions would be needed to meet this
possible interim deficit?
(e)  to work out an appropriate strategy for "socia2 extension",
by which the Project Management would explain the project
and the implementation procedure to the area population.
For this purpose the consultant would help to organize
experimental commmunity meetings and carry out consultations
with informal and formal leaders, so as to establish a
pattern for the task force's work, which could later be
embodied in the management structure for the subsequent program;
(f)  in the last sequence of his work, the consultant would
devote part of his time to a series of training sessions
with the project staff, to impart the findings of the
studies made and convey the recomtended techniques for
the project's social extension methodology.
Qua] ifications
6.        The consultant would be a sociologist or social anthropologist
preferably with a Ph.D or M.A. degree, with field experience in studying
forestry population. Experience in Pakistan or a country with a similar
social structure would be an advantage. Preference would be given to
a consultant with an applied/operational orientation and a keen interest
in development work, particularly in enhancing the productive capability
of the forestry zone population.

PAKISTAN
HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Feasibility Study
I. OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND
1.         The Governments of Pakistan and the North West Frontier Province
are proposing a forestry and forest industry development program in the
Hazara district, in the vicinity of the town of Mansehra. The forestry
program will result in the clear-felling of existing stands of Chir pine,
replacing them with pine and hardwood plantations, and the establishment
of plantations on "waste lands" which do not presently have a forest
cover. The industrial program envisaged would result in the setting up
of a pulp and paper mill to utilize the fiber resources generated by these
forestry operations.
2.         To assist in the development of this program, an IDA credit is
proposed to finance the necessary preparation work including an inventory
of the existing forest, a site assessment for plantation establishment
purposes, the development of plantation techniques, and a socio-economic
study to examine the impact of the proposed program on the private forest
owners and local residents and to develop mechanisms for ensuring their
participation in the project. The IDA credit would also finance an industrial
feasibility study to determine an appropriate development strategy and to
evaluate its technical and economic feasibility. Preliminary detailed terms
of reference for this study are contained in the following chapters.
3.         A two-phase study is proposed.  In the first phase (Section I to VI
below),all of the necessary information concerning the resource base, markets,
the existing industry and the socio-economic impact of any proposed pulp and paper
development would be collected, evaluated and compiled in a series of interim
reports. This information would then be used by the consultant to formulate
one or more development programs for the Hazara region. At that stage, a
detailed review of the consultant's proposals would be conducted, involving
all of the concerned Federal and Provincial agencies, together with representa-
tives of any organizations who may be considering participating in, or
providing finance for, the proposed venture. The purpose of this review
would be to agree on a project concept for final detailed analysis and the
timing of the second phase of the study. The second phase of the study would
entail a detailed feasibility study of the proposed project, presented in
a form acceptable to likely financing agencies so that an immediate investment
decision woulc be made, (see Section VII).

A., General Outline
4.        Fiber resource infomnation to be collected by the consultant would
be of two types:
(i) a general review of all fiber resources in the
country which could be suitable for paper
making, in order to be able to assess the
like)y directions of future developments in
the pulp and paper sector, and
(ii) a specific and detailed analysis of the existing
and potential EIazara resource base in order to
provide a sound basis for planning the Hazara
development.
B. Overall Resource Base
5.        Collect and assess pertinent information relating to the current
use and projected future availability of :
(i) waste paper;
(ii) wheat straw;
(iii) rice straw;
(iv) grass;
(v) bagasse;
(vi) cotton linters; and
(vii) wood.
This information should be developed in a manner suitable for use in an
assessment of the future growth prospects of the Pakistan pulp and paper
industry (Para.31).
C. The Hazara Resource
ProJect Area
6.        Review and evaluate available information concerning the project
area and prepare a detailed statement of land area by vegetation cover and



Page 3
land ownership. Delineate and define those areas to bs excluded from
comaerciaJ exploitation because of topography, erosion control ox othEr
factors.
7.       Assess the land-needs of the Hazara populace for rnon-forestry
uses (e.g.: crops, grain production, and grazing) and therebiy determine
the net areas of land likely to be avai.lable for forestry development.
8.        Review the status of studies and negotiations aizmed at securing
the oooperation of the owners of private forest land (with and without
tree cover). Discuss the form of likely agreements, and determine the
financial implications of any such agreements, including:
(i) likely royalties to be paid to forest-land owners
for existing timber; and
(ii)  the mechanism for reimbursing private land-owners
for establishing pulpwood plantations on their
land.
Existing Forest Resource
9.        Review and evaluate available information concening the existing
forest resource and prepare a detailed statement of wood availability by
species, log class, and land ownership. Conduct any necessary field checks
to verify this data.
lo.       Assess the timber needs of the Hazara populace and the production
of industrial timber for present markets. Thereby determine the net volume
of timber likeJy to be available for industrial usage. Also assess the
present production of resin from chir pine, and take account of the effects
on the resin industry of changes proposed in forest management in connection
with the formulation of industrial proposals. This assessment should consider
the possibility of resin extraction in a proposed mill.
11.       Review current and alternative timber extraction and transportation
methods and in conjunction with local authorities, propose methods suitable
for intensive and large-scale operations.
12.       Prepare estimates of the capital investments required for road
construction, logging and transportation equipment, and of the cost of
logging and transport operations. Develop estimates of the cost of
securing, harvesting and delivering wood from the existing forests to
a possible pulp mill site.
Plantation Potential
13.       Review and evaluate the program of research trials and pilot
plantations which are currently in the initiation stage.  Ch the basis-
of this and any other available information, determine:



ANNEX 
Page 4
(i) the potential suitability of indigenous and exotic
species for reforestation; and
(ii) a realistically attainable planting program,
giving due regard to any physical constraints
which may exist;
(iii) probable rotation ages; and
(iv)  likely attainable annual growth increments.
14.       Compile the preceding data in sufficient detail to enable development
planning to proceed on the basis of a realistic assessment of the future
availability of plantation pulpwood.
15.       Review and comment on projected plantation establishment costs.
Determine the "stumpage" which would have to be paid at the time of harvesting
p]antation wood in order to fully recover plantation establishment costs,
and to reimburse land-owners in an equitable and agreed upon manner for the
use of their land.
16.       Review proposed methods of extraction and transportation from
pulpwood plantations and prepare estimates of the cost of harvesting and
delivering plantation pulpwood to a possible pulp mi.l site.
C. Interim Resource Potential Reports
17.       Prepare and present the information concerning the overall pulp
and paper-making fibre resource potential of the country in such a way as
to facilitate the evaluation of projected expansion and new construction
plans of the existing pulp and paper industry (para. 29).

material collected concerning pulp and paper markets in Pakistan, in
such a manner that it can be used to assist in formulating one or more
project alternatives for evaluation (Para. 33).
IV. REVIEW CF EfT lSTNG INDuSTRY
A. General Outline
29.       The Hazara resource is of particular value in Pakistan because
Iong-fibred pulp produced from pine has characteristics which cannot be
matched by the non-wood fibres which have traditionally been used to make
paper and paperboard. The purpose of reviewing the existing industry is
therefore to ensure that the proposed Hazara Project complements and does
not compete with other potential pulp and paper mill developments in the
country, and that optimum usage is made of the scarce 3ong-fibred resource.
B. Status of the Industry
30.       By visiting each of the sixteen operating pulp and paper mills
in the country, prepare a profile of the industry, including :
(i) Up-to-date capacity and recent production figures,
by grade;
(ii) fibrous raw material sources and costs, including a
review of any problems which may be encountered in
procurement;
(iii)  normal market outlets, distribution channels and
prices; and



ANNEX 5
Page 7
(iv) an assessment of the profitability of the industry.
C. Plans and Potential for Expansion
31.       Review with each company its expansion prospects, including an
assessment of the availability of raw materials, market prospects, financial
backing and other factors.  Also, review with appropriate Government
organizations any other plan for new capacity in the industry, thereby
assess the likely growth in capacity of the pulp and paper industry in
the short and medium term future.
V. SOCIO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT
32.       The active participation of private land-owners will be an
essential element of any Hazara forestry development project. A separate
study is being financed to assist in developing the necessary institutions
and securing the cooperation of the local population. As part of the
Feasibility Study, the consultant will be required to analyze and review
the findings of the socio-economic study and to ensure that these are
fully taken into account prior to final project formu]ation.
VI. PROJECT FORMUIATION
33.       By combining the information described above concerning the
resource base, markets, the existing industry and proposed expansion,
and socio-economic factors, formulate one or more projects designed to
utilize the Hazara resource. The projects proposed should be aimed at
meeting the needs for pulp and paper grades which are unlikely to be
produced elsewhere in the country. Prepare comparative statements of
cost and benefit for each alternative proposed.
34.       At this stage, a detaiJed review of the work performed to
date would be conducted. The review meetings would be attended by
the consultants, representatives of concerned Federal and Provincial
agencies, and representatives of any organization who may be considering
participating in or providing finance for the proposed venture. The
purpose of this review would be to agree on a project concept including
an implementation schedule for final detailed analysis.
VII. DETAILED FEASIBILITY STUDY
A. General Outline
35.       Ilaving agreed on a project concept, prepare a detailed feasibility
study for it, to a standard acceptable to international financing agencies.

PAKISTAN
HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Organization and Management
Project Management
1.         The project headquarters would be established at Mansehra.  The
project will be under the management of the Chief Conservator of Forests
as Project Director, who would be assisted by a fulltime assistant project
director of the rank of Senior DFO/Conservator. The Project Director would
be responsible for all forestry activities and, through the Secretary
for Forests, to the Additional Chief Secretary, Planning and Development,
for coordination of the work of the Guzara Forest Owners Task Force,
pulping tests and feasibility study.
2.         Inputs from a number of other agencies and advisers would be
required including :
(i) the Department of Industry, Commerce and Mining,
NWFP, through its Sarhad Development authority
for continuity of its present involvement in
forestry development in Hazara, (see Annex 4);
(ii) the Forest Research Institute, Peshawar for all
aspects of forest research and pulping tests,
(see Annex 2);
(iii) the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation
for the industrial feasibility study, (see Annex 5);
(iv) the Federal Inspector General of Forests for
national forest policy; and,
(v) the various consultants who will be retained as
part of the project, e.g., inventory and forestry
specialists and Guzara Task Force team member,
(see Annexes 1, 2 and 4), and follow-up project
preparation studies.
3.         A Project Development Committee would be formed, composed of the
Additional Chief Secretary, P & D, NWFP as Chairman, the Inspector General of
Forests, GOP, the Secretary for Forests, NWFP, the Secretary for Industry,
NWFP, the Technical Director, Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation, and
Chief Conservator of Forests (Secretary). The committee would receive 3-
monthly reports from the project director of project progress and give
directions to the project director for coordinating the various activities and
inputs of the agencies discussed in para. 2.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
4.        The project directorwould set-up working relations with the
institutions providing advisory and technical inputs, including Pakistan
Forest Institute, Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation, Department
of Industry, Commerce and Mining Development, NWFP, Sarhad Development
-.it3-oYity, Department of Cooperatives and University of Peshawar, and
schedule timing of these specialist inputs to correlate with the timetable
oC project activities (see Table 1 of main report). Funds for the payment
of these specialist services would be channelled through the project manager,
except that special arrangements would be made for the feasibility study.
He would also undertake the primary arrangements for engaging other
specialist consultants and report progress to the Federal Inspector General
of Forests.
5.        The project director will also be assisted by a fulltime plantations
specialist for the first three years (see Annex 3); an administrative
officer (Grade 17); a site assessment section and an inventory section,
the team leaders of which will be responsible to the project director.
Other project staff would include three Range Forest Officers, six foresters and
supporting clerical and junior staff. The activities of the Guzara Forest
Owners Task Force would be coordinated by the project director (see Annex 4)
and the team leader of this group will make interim and final reports through
the project director to the Project Development Committee.
6.        Based on the various components of the project, the project group
would comprise the staff and specialist services listed in Appendix 1. The
GONWFP would need to assign these staff from existing duties to the project
and, because of the importance of staff continuity in many of the technical
operations, undertake that key staff would remain in post for the project
period.
Costs
7.        The project would finance the construction of a headquarter's office
and store, three senior staff houses, two range forest officer houses, three
forester/forest guard hostels; the office/store and staff houses would be
at Mansehra and junior staff hostels in the plantation areas; transport and
office and field equipment; staff salaries and annual operating costs.
Details of the physical requirements and costs are contained in Table 2 of
the main report.
Follow-Up Project Preparation
8.        By year-3 of the project, it is expected that sufficient plantations
experience wi]ll have been gained, firm conclusions reached with respect to
forest industries development, and, effective participation of Guzara Forest
owners secured, to prepare follow-up large scale plantations and forest
industries projects. At this stage of the project, the project director,
under the direction of the Project Development Committee, would take primary



ANNEX 6
Page 3
responsibility for initiating and monitoring the work, including further
studies as may be needed, of follow-up project preparation. PRs. I million
is included in the project costs for this work Which would provide for
additional studies and an increase in project staff to assist in project
preparation. Studies and other expenditure items exceeding PRs. 50,000
(US$5,000) would require prior agreement with the Association.
Future Deve]opment
9.        As a later development, it is possible that project activities would
be taken over by a newly formed Forest Industrial Development Corporation.
The chart attached at Appendix 2 indicates how the initial linkages would be
maintained and a possible transition from the phase I technical development
project to a phase 2 full-scale plantations organization. A similar transition
could be followed for the industrial development.

HAZARA FORESTRY PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
Pre)iminary Program Evaluation
Introduction
1.        An important objective of the proposed technical development
project will be the selection and detailed evaluation of the overall
program of forestry development for the Hazara region. A broad assess-
ment of likely program results is however, desirable.   On the basis of
the preliminary information now available, one possible program has
been devised which appears to provide a reasonable match between anticipated
fibre availability and the demands of the pulp and paper market. A
preliminary evaluation of this program, has been made to indicate whether
the activities of the technical development project are likely to lead
to forestry and forest industries projects which are viable. This is
discussed in the following paragraphs.
The Program
2.        Key features of the program as presently conceived are as follows :
(i)  The technical development project would commence in
1977 and extend for five years;
(ii) by 1980, large scale commercial planting of both
pine and hardwood species would begin. Planting
would stabilize at a level of about 5,900 acres
annually, sufficient to meet the fibre needs of
the proposed pulp and paper mill;
(iii)  the first stage chemical pulp mill would start up
in I98h, using chir pine from the existing natural
stands. This mi]l would have a production capacity
of 26,000 tons of bleached pulp and 8,000 tons of
unbleached pulp. Pulp would be flash-dried, baled,
and sold to existing paper mills; and
(iv) a chemical-groundwood pulp mill (pulping plantation
hardwood) and a newsprint mill would start up in
the latter part of 1979. Approximately 10,000 tons
of bleached pulp from the chemical pulp mill would
be diverted to newsprint production. At full capacity,
annual saleab]e output from the pulp and paper mill
would be as follows :
- 16,000 tons bleached pulp
-   8,000 tons unbleached pulp
- 4o,000 tons newsprint

Costs and Benefits
3.        The following preliminary cost and price data have been used to
estimate the likely return from such a program.
(i) Although there would be differences due to the
type of land and the species to be planted,
overal1 planting costs would average US$140
per acre;
(ii) the type of forest (natural or plantation) and
the species would give rise to differing logg-
ing and transport costs. An overall average
of US$6.85 per cubic meter has been used.
(iii) payments to the owners of eidsting timber (both
public and private) wil: have to be negotiated.
For this study a figure of PRs 5 per cubic foot
(US$17.65 per cubic meter) has been used. -2/
(iv) the plant capital required for the pulp mill
and subsequent newsprint mill addition would
total US$135 million with an additional US$6
million in working capital. Conversion costs
have been estimated on the basis of chemical,
energy, labor and other costs currently
prevailing in Pakistan.
(v) an average mill-net price for both pulp and
paper of US$550 has been used. Actual delivered
prices in Pakistan have ranged from US$500 to
US$1,000 over the past two years, but are
currently at about the US$500 level.
4.        Using these estimates, a preliminary projection of project financial
costs and benefits has been prepared (Table 1). The financial internal rate
of return determined from this projection is 11%; the economic rate of return,
using a shadow value of 4C% of market wage for unskilled labor and an exchange
rate of PRs. 11 - US$1 ,/is 14%. Additional unquantified benefits are improved
watershed management and employment generation, both of which are significant.
Conclusion
5.        Although not overly attractive, the projected rate of return (which
covers forestry plantations, logging operations, and the pulp and paper
industry) is typical of the levels currently found in projects of this type.
3/ Based on last data available for contract purchase of Chir pine, 1974.
2/ These shadow values have been taken from the Appraisal of the Khairpur
Ti]e Drainage and Irrigated Farming Development Project (Khairpur II)
Report No. 1062-a PAK, June 1976.

It is confidently expected that similar results would be obtained from a
replication of this integrated approach to forestry development, for example
with a combined plantations/sawaill/boirds mill in Mirpur or Murree Mills
Chir pine zones. On the basis of the data presented here, it appears likely
that the Technical Development Project will lead to forestry and forest
industry projects which will be capable of generating acceptable rates of
return.

PreliminarY Prograsm Evaluation
Logging Methods Suitable for the Program
1.        This program, as it is now conceived, wi]l have two different sets of
logging conditions with which to contend. Ultimately it is expected that the
pulp mill will be supplied from 20 year old coniferous and 10 year old hardwood
plantation. This will call for a suitable logging method to annually clear-cut
about 10 million cubic feet of unifornly small diameter trees from about 6,000
acres of plantation. Some of the plantations will be in large contiguous blocks
and some might be very small, scattered areas of private farm forests. Topography
will vary from gently rolling to very steep, with most of the area in the steep
category.
2.        Considering the large numbers of unskilled laborers who are presently
in need of work in Pakistan, it is recommended that pulpwood extraction from
these future plantations use labor intensive methods, with mechanization being
used only in the form of trucks for hauling from the forest to the pulp mill.
Table 1 details estimated costs of the plantation logging.  If, in the future,
availability of labor decreases and labor costs increase, then mechanized
loading methods and possibly cable extraction systems might be considered.
But, at the present time, mechanization, which would require purchase of
sophisticated machinery and spare parts from abroad, is not recommended.
3.        The other set of logging conditions which must be considered in this
prcject are those connected with extraction of the present chir pine forests
preparatory to establishing pulpwood plantations. Many of the trees in this
forest are large, mature trees in stands presently being managed under the
uniform shelterwood system.  The conditions under which these stands will be
logged for this project will depend on GOP decisions regarding timing of
conversion from the present scattered cutting under a 120 year rotation to that
of clear cutting and planting under a 20 year rotation. Logging conditions
will also depend on decisions regarding how much of this present chir pine forest
will be used to supply the proposed new pulp mill instead of being used to
help supply construction timber into the market.
4.        To provide an adequate pulpwood supply for an early start up of the pulp
mill and to accomplish a smooth transition of the existing chir pine forest to a
proper distribution of plantation age classes, it will be necessary to commit all
of the existing chir pine in the project area to an end use as pulpwood only.
This will call for a logging method suited to clear-cutting the existing
58,000 acres of forest over a 16 year period, beginning in ]984 and ending in
1999. It is recommended that the same labor intensive methods be used as are
recommended for plantation logging.  The principal difference is the variability
in diameters of the trees in the natural chir forest.  Some of the trees in
the natural forest will contain logs too large in diameter to be easily
extracted by hand methods, so they will have to be split at the falling site
into manageable sizes. Table 2 details estimated costs of this operation.



ANNEX 7
Appendix 2
Page 2
5.        Present logging methods extract only sawn scants from individually
marked, large trees. These trees are felled and sawn or hewn into scants
averaging about 6 inches by 10 inches by 8 to 12 feet long. These are
usually carried by mules for distances of up to four miles down the L:ountain
side to the nearest collection point on a road. Some small diameter round
posts are also brought out as well as the larger side cuts. These are all
sold at auction at the roadside depot. What remains in the forest is
collected by villagers for firewood, so in effect very little is wasted
except sawdust and chips.
6.        The proposed logging operation will differ from these existing
operations in several ways :
(i)  The entire stand will be clear-cut including small
diameter trees}
(ii) aJl of the wood will be extracted by manual labor
or by animal power down the mountain side, most
in round form, with only logs too large to hand)ne
being split. No sawing will be done, as splitting
is cheaper and produces an acceptable wood form
for pulpwood;
(iii) many contour type truck roads will be built so that
maximum extraction distance downhill frcm stump to
road will be about 400 meters;
(iv)  logs need not be moved to sale depots, as they can
be loaded on trucks for hauling to the pulp mill
from whichever point they most naturally reach the
road.
7.        The principa] preparation for this type of logging will be the planning,
engineering, and construction of many miles of forest truck roads. To estimate
logging costs, we have suggested a road density of one mile of road for each 160
acres of productive plantations (25 meter per hectare) at a construction cost of
R8 40,000 per mile. Actual road costs per cubic foot of wood-produced will also
depend on how much road will have to be constructed across agricultural lands
n*t under forest cover and whether part of the cost of such multi-purpose roads
could come from another source. It is recommended all construction except
drilling and blasting of rock be by hand methods.
8.        For the first five years of the mills operation (1984 through 1988)
all logging will be in the natural chir forests. This will require at least
110 miles of new road to serve between 17,000 and 18,000 acres of reserved
and guzara forests. Since logging must start in 1983 for a mill start up
of 1984, planning and engineering for logging road construction must start
by at least 1980 so that road construction for the first 2,000 acres is
finished by the end of 1982. About 20 to 25 miles of road will need to be
completed every year thereafter until 1989 when logging of hardwood plantations
will commence. For the 10 years after 1989 about 40 to 50 miles of new road
will need to be completed each year. After about the year 2003, all logging



ANNEX^ 7
kopendix 2
Page 3
wlll be in plantations where roads have been previously constructed and
road cost wil thereafter be reduced to the cost of maintenance only.
9.        Two likely sources of bottlenecks in this type of logging operation
are:  an adequate number of trucking contractors with suitable contracts
for hauling pulpwood without delay;  and adequate advance planning, engineering,
and road construction so log extraction distances can be held to a minimum.
J0.       No specific training programs are anticipated for this logging and
road construction operation, since it contemplates essentially the same
manual methods now being used. However, the logistical problems of employing,
caring for, and supervising such a large number of men will. have to be
recognized and allowances made far enough in advance so as not to delay
operations.
11.       There will likely be conflicts between desirable logging block
boundaries for the new system of clear-cutting with short extraction distances
to new roads and the presently existing compartment boundaries as demarcated
on the ground and in working plan maps for reserved and guzara forests.
The locations of the present compartment boundaries were selected so as to
have a homogenous timber stand within each compartment. This facilitated
allocation of each compartment into PBI, PBII, PBI3I, or PB IV status for
control of the uniform shelterwood system. Since this management system
will be replaced by clear-cutting to a plantation system, this previous
criteria for compartment boundaries will no longer be valid. New compartment
boundaries should be selected based on the new logging system of short
extraction to frequent roads and also based on requirements of the even-aged
plantations which will thereafter constitute the forest. Ownership boundaries
within new compartments can be designated and payments made accordingly,
without necessarily making the new plantation compartment boundaries coincide
with ownership boundaries.
