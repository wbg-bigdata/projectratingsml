1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Bank has a long tradition of support to Yemen’s education sector and it has
gained considerable sector experience and the trust of the Government. Over the two
decades prior to project appraisal in 2004, IDA-funded operations have provided
assistance for the development of all education system sub-sectors, including basic and
secondary education, tertiary education, vocational education, and distance education.
Inputs have included both hardware, e.g., construction and rehabilitation of classrooms
and teacher training institutes and provision of equipment, and softer investments, such as
teacher training and curriculum and instructional material development. The Basic
Education Development Project (BEDP) built on the foundation laid by the Basic
Education Expansion Project (BEEP, Credit 3422) which was implemented from 2001 to
2007. The Bank was able to mobilize resources from donors, including the Netherlands
and the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, in the
form of a multi-donor trust fund to support BEDP.

At the time of project appraisal, Bank intervention in the area of quality and
inclusion was considered critical. In addition to classroom construction and
rehabilitation, qualified teachers and effective learning materials were required. Yemen
was reducing its dependency on teachers from abroad and it had no need for additional
urban teachers. However, significant shortages of teachers, especially female teachers,
were found in rural areas. This was due to various factors, including recruitment and
deployment practices that resulted in male and urban biases. The quality of teacher
preparation had also been uneven and generally weak, which led to the need for
significant investment levels for in-service training. The pre-service training curriculum
also needed to be upgraded. To meet Education for All (EFA) goals of universal primary
enrollment, inclusive education and support to literacy programs were considered
essential. It was hoped that the Bank could share global experience in supporting
innovative models in these areas.

The Bank played a lead role in Yemen in the areas of macroeconomic policy
environment, public finance management and civil service reform at the time of
appraisal. It was hoped that Bank experience in these areas would: (i) help ensure that
institutional change and capacity building to be supported by the Project would draw on
international best practice and recent developments in-country; and (ii) target the
knowledge base of international and local experience in implementing programs to
expand educational access, particularly for girls and underserved groups.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal, Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the world, and
still is. The estimated gross national product (GNP) per capita for 2002 was US$460. In
1998, about 42 percent of Yemen’s 18.7 million people lived below the US$2 per day
poverty line and an estimated 5 percent of the population subsisted on less than US$1 per
day. With 76 percent of the population and 83 percent of the poor living in rural areas,



                                            1
poverty was primarily a rural phenomenon in Yemen. The country also faced a rapidly
expanding population. Although the total fertility rate had fallen from 7.6 births per
woman in 1990 to an estimated 5.9 births in 2004, the population growth rate was still
very high at the time of appraisal, estimated by the Government at 3.5 percent. Children
under the age of 15 represented about 32 percent of the total population.

Basic social indicators had improved since 1990 but remained very poor. Yemen’s
infant mortality rate of 76 per 1000, the under-five mortality rate of 94 per 1000 and life
expectancy of 56 years were worse than the regional average. Yemen had made great
strides in improving access to education but was very far from achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) of universal primary completion and gender parity.
Enrolment in primary education had increased from 25,000 students in 1970 to more than
4,000,000 in 2003. However, significant inadequacies in access, quality and efficiency
persisted; enrolment was approximately 65 percent, and the adult literacy rate was only
48 percent. Equity was an especially severe problem, with only 55 percent of primary
school-aged girls in schools country-wide and less than 30 percent in rural areas. There
were also major disparities across governorates. These factors contributed to Yemen’s
low ranking--149th out of 162 countries that were rated on the 2003 Human Development
Index.

With the improvement of its macroeconomic position in the years immediately prior
to appraisal, the Government of Yemen (GOY) had implemented policies and social
programs to help reduce poverty and promote access to basic social services. In
particular, the GOY had made education a high priority. The overall financial allocation
to the education sector was elevated at 7.5 percent of GDP (in 2003) and 20 percent of
total Government spending (in 2003), but results were not commensurate with this
investment. Education was one of the pillars of the Government’s First Five-Year Plan
(1996-2001). Developing human resources remained the strategic objective of the Second
Five-Year Plan (2001-2005), the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and the
Yemen Vision 2025. Education challenges were highlighted specifically in the National
Basic Education Development Strategy (NBEDS), which was prepared with the
involvement of all stakeholders, approved officially by the GOY and endorsed by the
donor partners in 2004. NBEDS is a ten-year program that serves as a schema toward
achieving the MDGs related to education and directly informed the development of the
project.

As Yemen implemented its PRSP and NBEDS, pressures on the education system
were expected to intensify as a result of steady and rapid demographic growth and
an increased demand for improved education quality. The GOY was aware that
improved sector management and utilization of sector resources were crucial to
advancing its educational objectives. To meet the goals of the NBEDS and its obligation
under the MDGs, the GOY also needed to continue ensuring strong participation of
communities in the management of primary level education and the provision of
education facilities and services. The challenges for the GOY and particularly the
Ministry of Education (MOE) were to increase access to education for a growing school-
age population and to improve the quality of teaching and learning within a constrained
financial envelope.


                                            2
The GOY and the MoE were eager to manage and allocate all resources from their
development partners to support the priorities identified in the NBEDS. At the time
of appraisal, there was a significant amount of pressure by partners and the Government
to incorporate a broad spectrum of activities in the project, in alignment with the NBEDS.
The NBEDS offered the opportunity for the Government to manage and direct resources
to priority programs and for donors to jointly support programs rather than isolated
Projects. While the public finance, planning and monitoring conditions were not robust
enough for direct budget support at the time of preparation, it was nonetheless possible
for partners to work together in a common program framework and to reduce the
transaction costs of their support. In order to formalize management, monitoring and
evaluation arrangements, eight donors formally agreed to the Partnership Declaration
signed in January 2004, which laid the foundation for the MDTF.

This operation was jointly financed by IDA and the governments of the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom. It was designed to support the implementation of agreed
priority programs identified in NBEDS and the human development objectives of the
PRSP and MDGs and to lay the foundation for a Sector-wide Approach Project (SWAP).
KfW (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, the German Reconstruction Credit Institute)
financing was provided in parallel, as well as in-kind contributions from GiZ (Deutsche
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, the German Agency for International
Cooperation, formerly GTZ).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO is to assist Yemen in expanding the provision of quality basic education to all,
with special attention on gender equity. The Project will pay special attention to: (i)
increasing the enrollment and retention of girls, and (ii) promoting equity at all levels of
the basic education system by ensuring the inclusion of all children in the education
system, especially those with special needs. This version of the PDO, from the PAD
page 3, is slightly different from that in the Credit Agreement, but most accurately
captures the intent of the Project as designed and will provide the basis for this report.

1.3 Revised PDO as approved January 13, 2010 and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The project was approved on Sept 23, 2004. It was signed on October 2, 2004 and
became effective March 14, 2005. Implementation was slow to begin, but picked up in
the second year of effectiveness. Considerable investments were made in donor
coordination during project preparation and during implementation. KfW joined the
Project as a donor in 2006 with a parallel financing contribution of EU 16.3 million,
reflecting the overall positive perception of the project among Yemen donors. A Mid-
Term Review was conducted in April 2008 as well as a QALP in February 2009, which
identified the need to restructure. There were sometimes tradeoffs between investing in
communication and coordination, and timeliness in making decisions. For example,
restructuring took an extended period of time due to the need to negotiate and sign legal
agreements with all parties to the MDTF. The Project completed a Level I restructuring


                                             3
in January 2010 which extended the project and revised the indicators and a number of
components. Following a number of country context changes, including a suspension in
the WB Yemen portfolio, a Level II restructuring was completed in June 2012 which
extended the project for six months to ensure orderly closure of the project and further
revised the indicators. The project closed December 31, 2012. As 79% of project funds
were disbursed at the time of restructuring, the focus of this review will use the PDO
state in paragraph 1.2, while the second phase of the project implementation under the
revised PDO will be used evaluate subsequent project performance.

The revised PDO from the 2010 restructuring is to: (i) increase enrollment of children in
basic education, with particular attention to gender equity, in ten (10) governorates; (ii)
improve quality of teaching in basic education nationally, and (iii) establish foundations
for improved MOE capacity to carry out its core functions, so as to contribute to the goals
of the national basic education development strategy (NBEDS) of the Borrower. A Level
II restructuring was approved on June 25, 2012, and included a partial cancellation of
funds (US$7.7 million from the IDA credit), and an extension of the project closing date
by six months. There was no further change to the PDO.

There were also changes to the MDTF. In March 2012 the WB was informed that DFID
would not transfer the remaining GPB 1.14 million, out of the total GPB 15 million due,
and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands’ (EKN) final contribution to the
MDTF would be US$21.2 million, out of the total US$24 million due, as noted in the
2012 Restructuring Paper. These changes were due in part to the rate of disbursement of
the MDTF, as well as a reflection of shifts in donor priorities and the assessment that
many of the core BEDP goals could be achieved without these funds: due to the addition
of parallel funds from KfW and favorable movements in exchange rates, the actual
amount of financing available to the project increased according to the 2012
Restructuring Paper.

The key indicators were revised in January 2010 as follows:

 spending on items other than teacher

 spending on basic education (from 29%
 to 35%).

The Level One restructuring followed the recommendations of the Mid-Term Review of
April 2008. Separate legal agreements were required to be reached with EKN and DFID
in addition to the GoY on the details of the changes, an iterative process conducted over
multiple joint missions which considerably extended the time required for successful
restructuring. The intent of the original Project design was to expand in phases to
national scale from the ten governorates identified in the 2004 PAD (page 4). Due to
resource and capacity constraints this expansion was not possible. The 2010 restructuring
brought the indicators in line with the original intent of the PAD while removing the
burden of meeting targets based on the assumption of a phased national expansion. The
changes focused on results directly linked to project activities. For example, rather than
measuring overall access nationwide including governorates that were not served by the
project, the focus of the indicators changed as a part of the restructuring to absolute
numbers of students served. For gender parity, the new target was less ambitious,
reflecting the actual pace of progress toward this goal. Other changes, such as the
capacity building and efficiency targets, were modified to focus on policy development
and process outputs such as procurement.

The changes brought the project into closer alignment with the NBEDS and CAS
priorities and were considered necessary for the following reasons: (a) achievement of the
original targets for enrollments was no longer feasible because the targets were national
and not specific to the project governorates, necessitating a change in the PDO; (b)
achievement of the original targets for civil works was no longer feasible because of a
substantial increase in construction costs in the region; (c) the text of the PDO referring
to improvements in education quality was very broad and therefore open to various


                                            5
interpretations; and (d) the MOE was interested in evaluating interventions piloted
through this project, including those related to increasing the enrollment of girls in basic
education and improvements in the quality of teaching.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries originally included children in Yemen who were the appropriate age for
basic education, particularly girls and those with special needs who may not have been
included in the system at the time of appraisal. In addition, teachers were expected to
benefit from training and hiring schemes, as well as district and central level staff who
were to benefit from capacity building activities. These beneficiary groups were not
significantly changed under the revised PDO, although the project scope was reduced
from all 20 governorates to only ten governorates plus Sana’a municipality. The PAD
explains that those governorates were selected on the basis of several selection criteria,
including (i) areas that were not covered by on-going World Bank projects and other
donors’ programs; (ii) incidence of poverty which affects enrollment of girls and students
with special needs. The initial design paid particular attention to serving “impoverished
districts? in those governorates, where the capacity of school management and district
education offices was relatively weak; and (iii) adequate representation of governorates
from the northern and southern regions of the country.

The actual beneficiaries under the revised Project were to include:
   • communities benefitting from the construction of 213 schools, the construction of
       1,996 classrooms, and rehabilitation of 1,446 classrooms
   • 30,000 female students receiving Conditional Cash Transfer grants
   • 56,000 teachers benefitting from training
   • 15,000 headmasters and deputy headmasters benefitting from training
   • 4,500 inspectors of basic schools
   • 10,000 basic schools receiving three or more inspector visits per year
   • 1,200 MOE staff benefitting from training in core skills related to their official
       responsibilities

1.6 Revised Components

The revised components (Table 2, above) reflect a pragmatic focus on specific and
measurable project inputs, rather than national-level outcomes, and reflect overall a less
ambitious approach, in line with country capacity and constraints. The Project had
originally been designed as a pre-cursor to a SWAP, reflecting strong donor interest and
GoY commitment. Implementation experience showed that this was premature and that
the Project needed to address foundation aspects of the education system, for example
data gathering and analysis. The Level I restructuring in January 2010 required World
Bank Board approval and involved significant changes to funding allocations and the
scope of some components, as detailed below.

1.7 Other significant changes

Significant changes were made in scope, scale, implementation schedule and funding
allocations between disbursement categories as part of the January 2010 restructuring,
allowing the project to adjust to changing circumstances in the country context. The
scope of the project as a whole shifted from improving learning outcomes to assuring
quality inputs in response to measurement and data challenges in a fragile country
context. These data constraints made it particularly difficult to focus on student learning
outcomes. Other components were similarly revised, for example the capacity building
component of the project was changed from “enhancing management and efficiency? to
“establishing the foundations for improved MOE capacity.? The scale of Component 1,
Expansion of Access, was redefined to include 10 governorates, in line with the initial
proposed scope of the Project (PAD p. 5) and pragmatically reflecting actual Project




                                                  7
implementation scope. The closing date was extended from December 31, 2009 to June
30, 2012, and there was a reallocation between disbursement categories.

The Level II restructuring in June 2012 extended the project closing date by six months,
from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 as a result of the delays caused by the country
unrest during 2010-2011 and resulting suspension of disbursements for most Bank-
financed projects. This restructuring also removed one indicator on civil works
procurement from the Results Framework.

The project simultaneously benefitted from other financing sources while also addressing
challenges stemming from multi-donor coordination. Co-financing in the amount of
US$47.1 million equivalent from a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF, TF053721)
financed by EKN and DFID became effective on April 9, 2005. Parallel financing for the
project was also provided from the KFW (EU 16.3 million) signed in 2006 and effective
June 2008, reflecting the priority of the project among donors and within the MOE.
However, there was significant pressure to disburse the MDTF money prior to the IDA
funds, leading to low IDA disbursement rates early in the project life. In March 2012,
DFID and EKN reduced their final contributions to the MDTF due in part to the slow rate
of disbursement, the recognition that the money was no longer essential given favorable
changes in exchange rates, as well as to other, internal strategic considerations.

Notwithstanding the reduction in contributions from the donors, the amount available to
the GOY under the MDTF had increased over the project implementation period because
of favorable fluctuations in exchange rates. The MDTF closed on December 31, 2012 in
parallel with the project itself. This ICR reviews both the MDTF and the IDA credit.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

BEDP was designed at a time of rising hopes and increased external donor financing for
Yemen, and reflected a broad consensus between donors and the MOE as to what was
required for the sector in order to achieve NBEDS goals and MDGs (Education for All).
In line with this consensus, the scope of the project was ambitious, touching on most
elements of the education system, including inter alia school construction, teacher
training, system administration, data and evaluation, textbooks, curriculum, teacher hiring,
student enrollments and gender. This design reflected the lessons learned from the earlier
BEEP which included the importance of using a system-wide, national approach as well
as pressure from other donors and the GoY to take a comprehensive approach. The
operational arrangements such as using the existing Project Administration Unit were
designed to mitigate against a number of important risks.

Project goals were discussed and agreed between the MOE and the donors. There was a
strong consensus among various donor groups, and harmonization efforts were
accelerated through the signing of a Donor Partnership Declaration in January 2004,
which reiterated the donors’ commitment to jointly support MOE for the achievement of



                                             8
NBEDS. The MOE took a very important role in Project design, and in order to promote
MOE ownership of the Project during the design phase, locally-available expertise was
favored over international consultants. The baselines and end-targets were based
primarily on the MOE Annual Education Survey (AES), although these turned out to be
less reliable as it consists of national data collected through voluntary responses to
questionnaires mailed out by the MOE, rather than through actual survey enumerators.

BEDP was designed in close cooperation with the MOE and other donors, particularly the
co-financing partners DFID and EKN. The project was set up so that the Project
Administration Unit (PAU) could use financing from other donors across a range of
activities, and this provided flexibility and mitigation against risk. The project design
included a PAU that had managed similar projects in the past, and did not anticipate
major increases in Ministry capacity to disburse the credit. Compared to the earlier
education project (BEEP), the design gave greater responsibility to the MOE for
implementation. Overall, this was a relatively low-risk approach and favored continuity
in relationships between the Bank and the Client.

The risk analysis carried out during project preparation focused on procurement and
financial risks. Implementation risks that were highlighted included insufficient technical
capacity of MOE and task forces, lack of familiarity with Bank procurement procedures,
weak capacity in monitoring & evaluation, and lack of incentives. However, risk
mitigation measures were clearly defined and capacity building and guidance was
provided by the Bank team based in Sana’a and as well as by Project consultants and
other donors.

Component One - Access - had two sub-components, one focused on general access, and
the other on access for specific populations. The first sub-component, construction, was
designed to create education infrastructure where it was needed most, based on
information from local MOE officials, following procedures established by earlier
projects. It assumed that school designs would become less complex, reducing overall
costs. The second sub-component focused on improving access for girls and children
with special needs, through demand-side interventions such as conditional cash transfers
and supply-side support double-shifting, the hiring of female teachers in rural areas, and
support for disabled children based on analytical work of various NGOs. Two of these
elements, CCTs and what became the Rural Female Teacher program were highly
innovative at the time they were proposed, both for the region and globally. Both also
aimed to address longstanding gaps in gender parity in educational attainment.

Component Two - Quality Improvement - was designed with three sub-components:
curriculum review and textbooks; teacher training, qualification and deployment; and
inspection/supervision. For sub-component one, an ambitious program was developed to
revise the curriculum. The curriculum revision was intended to make the curriculum
more relevant and to create a cascade of other activities, including teacher training linked
to the new curriculum, creation of teaching and learning resources linked to the new
curriculum, and student assessment linked to new curriculum, all under a task force
which would eventually lead to national implementation. This was to ensure sustained



                                             9
support for the new curriculum from design through to classroom implementation. The
second-sub component, teacher training, was designed to deal with: (i) in service training;
(ii) school management; (iii) pre-service training; and (iv) the recruitment, deployment
and career structure of teachers. The in-service teacher training was designed to respond
to the rapid expansion of access to education in the previous decade. Many recently
recruited teachers had never received any teacher-specific pre-service training. For the
second and third sub-components, the activities to be carried out during the first 18
months were defined in detail, with the activities for the remaining years of the project to
be developed by a task force, thereby providing for a high level MOE ownership as well
as an ability to respond flexibility to the changing project needs.

Component Three – Institutional Capacity Building - was also designed with three
subcomponents: institutional change, community participation, and monitoring and
evaluation. Again, much of the detail was left to be defined by task forces which were to
develop comprehensive national plans once the project was underway. This approach
was adopted to allow the project flexibility once implementation began. As noted above,
the implementing agency was the MOE, and day to day management of the project was
the responsibility of the PAU.

2.2 Implementation

BEDP was approved in September 2004 and declared effective in March 2005. The
Annual Work Plan was approved nine months later. There were no conditions of
effectiveness. Project implementation speed picked up in the second year, after a slow
start according to the Borrower ICR (page 20). A contributing factor was the new donor
partnership, which required significant efforts to coordinate between multiple donors.
Much of the first year was dedicated to defining and creating mechanisms (financial,
procurement, administrative and other operational functions) within the MOE and PAU.
One example that came up repeatedly in focus group interviews was a lack of
understanding of operational aspects of project implementation, and different levels of
technical understanding of the project activities among the relevant departments within
the MOE.

The WB supervision teams invested significant time and resources to provide training
and support to both the MOE and the PAU, as noted, for example, in the Aide Memoire
of September 2005. This led to increased capabilities of the staff and a high level of
MOE ownership of the Project, as noted in the Aide Memoires of August 2007 and the
Mid-Term Review in April 2008.

Significant efforts were made by all parties to the MDTF to ensure cooperation and
communication in order to support the NBEDS and the MOE. Project meetings were
held between the MOE, donors and the PAU on a regular basis, including bi-monthly
progress meetings at the beginning of the project. Joint supervision missions were
conducted frequently, even during the suspension period, when efforts were made to meet
outside the country (e.g., reverse missions in Jordan were conducted four times during




                                            10
2011-2012). Support from KfW, for example, allowed some project operations to
continue even while funds from the Bank and DFID and EKN were largely frozen.

A joint Mid-Term Review mission, including representatives from the WB, KfW, DFID
and EKN, took place in April of 2008. The mission noted in the Aide Memoire that “the
delay in launching project activities during the first year of the project has been overcome?
and that most planned activities had been launched or were to be launched within the year.
It found further that the project’s focus and objectives continued to be highly relevant,
but that there were significant problems with the indicators and the Results Framework.
The original set of indicators were not able to measure accurately the progress of the
project; for instance, student enrollment at the national level was not attributable to the
project which had interventions focused on 10 governorates. The Mid-Term Review
highlighted the need for the Council of Deputies to be activated, a body that was
supposed to help guide and govern the project. The review further noted the “lack of
robustness? of education data in Yemen, and the challenges this caused for measuring
project outcomes. The review recommended an extension of the project by two years,
revision of the outcome indicators, and additional financing. The majority of these
recommendations were successfully addressed in the January 2010 Level I restructuring.
The project was restructured in January 2010 in response to the GOY request for an
extension in light of delays in initial project start-up and to fully utilize the parallel
financing provided by KfW as noted in the Aide Memoire of February 2009.

The project was included in a Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio by the Bank’s
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in 2009, which along with a number of positive
comments, noted that the project’s original PDO and key performance indicators were
overly ambitious and monitored the sector as a whole and suggested that these be revised
to capture specifically the results of the project. This assessment was successfully
incorporated by the team and the Client in the January 2010 restructuring.

The project was implemented in a challenging context. For example, at the time of the
2008 Country Performance Portfolio Review, all projects in Yemen had monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) risk flags, reflecting systemic issues in data gathering and analysis in
the country. Further, all projects in Yemen were attributed a Country Record Flag in
early 2007, linked to the 30 percent failure rate of Bank funded projects in Yemen in
meeting their development objectives. The project was rated “Moderately Unsatisfactory?
in the July 26, 2011 ISR, immediately prior to the suspension period.

The PAU had the responsibility of administering the project and was key to project
achievements. The PAU grew over time as additional projects such as the Secondary
Education Development and Girls Access Project (SEDGAP) started, in addition to the
pre-existing BEEP project. Government officials interviewed for the preparation of the
ICR noted that the project could not have been implemented without the PAU. While
staff movement is inevitable, particularly in a seven year project, the PAU itself
experienced a relatively high degree of staff turnover at all levels and across sectors
which negatively impacted its capacity to administer the project. This is noted, for
example, in the ISR of September 2007, which states “over the last five months, project



                                            11
management has suffered due to the loss of 10 key staff including the Project Director,
Procurement Officer, M&E Officer, Finance Officer and internal auditor. One of the
main reasons for these resignations is staff remuneration and workload issues. Only one
procurement staff and one procurement assistant are left… which poses a significant risk
to project implementation.? The issue is raised again in the December 2012 ISR, which
discusses the resignation of the director of the PAU and suggests higher salaries for PAU
staff to improve retention. Despite these challenges, the project continued to disburse
and progress toward achievement of the PDO.

Two years and two months following the 2010 restructuring approval, there were major
changes in the country context which had a large impact on project implementation. The
project was rated “satisfactory? at the time demonstrations began in January 2011, which
eventually led to the fall of the President of Yemen and major changes to the political and
security context in the country. These events occurred in the context of the wider Arab
Spring, and led to WB staff evacuations from Yemen in March 2011 and the suspension
of the entire Bank Yemen portfolio on July 28, 2011. The suspension was lifted effective
January 20, 2012. 1 Reflecting the extremely high value of BEDP to both the GoY and
WB and donor partners, BEDP project administration costs were among a very small
number that were exempted from the suspension as noted in the Aide Memoire of
December 2011. During this time and despite these challenges, many project activities
continued, including the use of alternative sources of funding for the CCT Program,
provided by KfW. Lack of security, lack of electricity, lack of transportation and other
challenges severely impacted the ability of PAU and MOE employees to work during the
crisis. The overall negative impacts of the unrest and the suspension were mitigated by
the fact that the majority of project activities had already taken place and the bulk of the
project had already been implemented before the country unrest. Nonetheless, the
deterioration of the economic and social stability of the country after the conflict coupled
with the suspension caused significant delays and some negative impacts on the project
activities. For example, teacher training was put on hold and the March and October
2011 CCT installments were not delivered. The Bank lifted the suspension of
disbursements in January 2012, project activities resumed swiftly, and the project closed
on December 31, 2012.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design

In general, data availability in Yemen was and is relatively limited. There is a Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) for 2004 and a Household Budget Survey in 2005, but
no more recent census or household survey data covering the entire country, or even the
ten governorates included in the restructured Project, are currently available. There are


1
  A number of project documents indicate the suspension was lifted January 19, 2012. The official letter to
the client on the lifting of the suspension was dated January 19th, and the letter informed that the suspension
would be lifted effective January 20.



                                                      12
two sources of data specific to the education sector, the Annual Education Survey (AES),
and the Comprehensive School Survey (CSS) which is conducted every five years. The
AES data is collected through voluntary responses to questionnaires mailed out by the
MOE, rather than by actual survey enumerators, and is not considered a valid measure.
While much less frequent, the CSS has a higher degree of validity. During the design
phase, the team was unable to use the CSS to monitor Project progress because it was so
infrequent.

Using the AES to monitor Project progress was the only alternative the team considered
viable and highly imperfect, but provided an opportunity for the team to work with the
GoY on improving the tool. Given the lack of alternatives and the need for recent data,
the project selected AES-derived data to measure all of the outcome indicators for the
three components at appraisal. Project progress report data were used for all results
indicators for Component 1 (Access), Component 2 (Quality) and Component 3
(Institutional Change and Capacity Building). Issues with baseline data and data in
general are identified in the early ISRs as well as in the Aide Memoire of February 2009.
In order to address these challenges, the scope and scale of the targets changed as a part
of the Level I restructuring in 2010, and the data sources changed as well. Outcome
indicators were measured post-restructuring using a mix of CSS data (2005-6, 2010-11)
and information from the TIMSS tests (2007 and 2011). Intermediate outcome indicators
were to be measured using project progress reports from the PAU as well as several
independent evaluations and assessments. The project, together with UNESCO, provided
technical assistance to the MOE to improve the validity of the AES and create a more
streamlined survey. The MOE is committed to implement this improved version of the
annual education survey in order to systematically collect core education indicators in a
coherent manner and to improve the accuracy of the annual data.

M&E implementation

M&E was carried out by the PAU in coordination with the MOE and supported by
regular WB supervision missions and field visits by Ministry and PAU staff, although
WB missions were restricted during the suspension period and were limited to the capital
through the close of the project. During the start-up phase of the project, concerted
assistance was provided by the WB and consultants to both the PAU and the MOE to
improve M&E capacities. As a result, regular progress reports were prepared by the
M&E specialist of the PAU, detailing project progress, and were submitted to the Bank
and the relevant coordinating bodies to report on project progress and resolve flagged
issues. The quality of the progress reports was considered “high? by the team, despite the
challenges facing the PAU and MOE in obtaining accurate and timely information.
These progress reports identified early on some of the inconsistencies, which eventually
led to the AES data being largely phased out for project monitoring purposes as part of
the 2010 restructuring. Nonetheless, the need for improved monitoring and evaluation
capabilities was noted in the Borrower ICR, and a need to focus on “outcomes? was
noted in the final ISR, comments incorporated in the design of the follow-on BEDP II.




                                           13
Financial management reports (FMRs) were prepared and submitted to the World Bank
on a quarterly basis, providing information regarding both financial and physical
execution of the project. These reports helped, in particular, to track the implementation
of the school construction and teacher training components. Most of the technical
assistance activities identified in the PAD were conducted, including the Capacity
Building Assessment, the Whole School Improvement Assessment, the Rural Female
Teacher Study, and the In-service Teacher Training Study, while the Impact Evaluation
of the Conditional Cash Transfer Study was only partially completed (baseline study
2008) due to inaccessibility during country unrest.

The Project financed an assessment of capacity building supported by BEDP which was
published in 2012. The Capacity Building Assessment consisted of a desk review of
Project reports and MoE strategy documents, as well as interviews with MoE
representatives at various levels. The report focused on the impacts of teacher training
financed by the BEDP project as a part of Component 2 and 3, and found: (i) Project-
provided training increased the motivation of education staff, particularly teachers and
school management staff (ii) the frequency and quality of inspections have been benefited
from the training and transportation assistance (iii) training programs on community
participation were effective in raising the awareness and responsibilities. Other
conclusions included an affirmation of overarching program impacts on enrollment of
boys and girls, as well as student retention. Delays in the MoE restructuring and reform
process were attributed to “political conflict? and a lack of coherence in the perspectives
of different actors within the Ministry. Delays in curriculum development and the
operationalization of the EMIS system were also noted. Overall, however, the report
finds that the investments in capacity building had high returns and resulted in improved
learning environment for students and improved performance by teachers and other MoE
personnel. (Quality Improvements and Capacity Building Components Final Report, Al-
haj, 2012.)

The specific impacts of teacher training, an element of capacity building, were also
evaluated in a separate assessment financed by the Project. The report produces evidence
that the teacher training financed by the Project and other sources is associated with a
statistically significant improvement in teacher performance by measuring changes in
classroom performance based on observations of teacher beneficiaries in 2006 and in
2012 (Masarwi 2012, p 61-68). The study included Project and non-Project financed
trainings in a random sampling of schools, and included five governorates where project
trainings had taken place. The study relied on information collected from Ministry and
Project documents as well as interviews with Ministry staff including trainers, school
directors and teachers, as well as direct classroom observations from large and small
schools distributed among different geographic areas of the governorates. The study
found that 81% of training participants felt that there needs were served by the trainings,
and 77% felt that the training matches the requirements of teaching. More than 80% of
teachers stated that the trainings were evaluated by pre- and post-tests, data which was
unfortunately not presented in the report (Masarwi 2012, p 41). Some weaknesses were
identified in the report, but overall the findings support the conclusion that the trainings
responded to teacher needs and were delivered in an effective and efficient manner.



                                            14
Another evaluation financed by the project examined the impact of the RFT component
in four governorates. The study collected information from school directors, teachers,
students, parents as well as from school records and project documents. The study found
that there was an “increase in the girl enrolment rate in basic education? as a result of the
Project (Almaswary 2010, p 100). The study confirmed the importance of the RFT
program and identified impacts of the program in student attendance, particularly girls, as
well as the reduction in repetition and drop-out (Almaswary 2010, p 98). The study also
identified shortcomings in areas such as on-time contract renewals and teacher
supervision, which are respectively not uncommon when introducing a new contracting
modality and widespread in the education sector in Yemen.

A final evaluation was commissioned by the Project to examine the impacts of the Whole
School Improvement sub-component (Bisher, 2011). The report notes the “pioneering?
approach of the project, which first introduced this decentralized financing in the country.
The study focused on the pilot stage of the program in 60 schools in two Governorates
from school year 2007/08 to school year 2010/11, and included school visits and
beneficiary interviews. The evaluation found a number of positive impacts of the WSI
pilot, including (i) increases in learning resources in classrooms (ii) improvement in
school environment, such as tree planting and toilet cleanliness (iii) increased
involvement of community members in school activities (iv) increased student
achievement. Some areas for improvement were also noted, such as lack of funds for
district-level teams to visit schools and limited availability of training options for officials
who transferred into the district following the beginning of the program (Bisher 2011, p
27-33). Given this overall evidence of success, the evaluation strongly recommended
expansion of the work undertaken by BEDP, which will take place under BEDP II.

M&E utilization

The information gained from results monitoring and the reports discussed above helped
define key project changes. Results indicators were changed significantly during the
January 2010 restructuring as regards both scope and scale. While the 2010 restructuring
improved the clarity and specificity of project goals, the focus continued to be at the level
of outputs, rather than outcomes. Given the complexity of the project and the difficulty
of the operating environment, this focus on outputs appears appropriate. Data issues
(CSS vs. AES) were an issue at appraisal, and became considerably more challenging
during the suspension period. Considerable project resources were used to continue to
collect project performance data under difficult circumstances following the events of
early 2011. MOE officials and PAU staff noted a greater appreciation of the importance
of outcome based measures due, in part, to their experience with the BEDP project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

For the project as a whole, the GOY complied with Financial Management (FM)
requirements and submitted regular financial reports. Annual audit reports were
sometimes delayed, but no significant breaches were reported. The performance of PAU



                                              15
procurement staff throughout the project was generally fair as ratings shifted between S
and MS. These lower ratings were largely a result of high staff turnover. The
procurement unit suffered from high staff turnover throughout implementation which
sometimes affected the quality of procurement and contributed to delays. Some
observations were made in the course of researching this review which highlighted issues
with the quality of some procurement lots, particularly school furniture. In many cases,
these lots were approved ex-post by the WB, and the responsibility for the technical
specifications lay with the GoY and the PAU. Actions were taken to: (i) reinforce the
PAU procurement unit with additional staff; (ii) assign a staff person full time to control
the quality of procurement documents; and (iii) recruit an international procurement
expert to provide on-the-job training to PAU staff. Despite the disbursement suspension
by the World Bank (from July 2011 to January 2012), the performance of the
procurement unit continued to be MS.

During 2010, school construction related activities were put on hold due to issues related
to sanitation in schools. An environmental specialist and civil engineer from the WB
proposed several recommendations to be included going forward related to sanitation,
types of toilets, ratio of toilets to classrooms, provisions for drinking water, etc. The
Third Party monitoring undertaken for this report and detailed in Annex 5 shows an issue
identified early in project implementation related to drinking water still persists.
Currently, most students prefer to carry drinking water from home. However, this is a
challenge for schools across the country, and identifying alternative solutions will be the
focus of subsequent donor intervention in school construction.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

BEDP followed earlier investments by the World Bank in education in Yemen, and
BEDP II was approved by the Board in February 2013 with an IDA grant of US$66
million, building on experience, capacity and lessons learned under BEDP. BEDP II was
designed to expand and support a number of key elements of BEDP, for example, the
innovative Rural Female Teacher program, the Whole School Improvement program and
the Conditional Cash Transfer program. Incorporating some of the lessons learned from
the project under review, BEDP II includes more of an emphasis on education quality, for
example, including student learning in the PDO and student learning outcomes such as
early grade reading skills in the PDO-level indicators.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Ratings: Before Restructuring: High
         After Restructuring: High
         Overall: High

Objectives. The objectives of the project were and continue to be highly relevant, and
directly support the GOY plans for the education sector as articulated in the NBEDS,
2003-15 and the Medium Term Results Framework (MTRF). The MTRF covers ten


                                            16
pillars of activities addressing all aspects related to access to, equity, quality and
efficiency of general education services. The core project activities contribute to Pillar 1
of the Interim Strategy Note FY2013-2014, Achieving Quick Wins and Protecting the
Poor. They also continue to be relevant to the cross-cutting objective of improving
governance and capacity in the education sector. Evidence of the relevance and priority
of Project objectives can be found in the positive assessments of the project in evaluation
reports and the fact that it was among the few operations whose administrative costs were
exempted during the suspension period. Project restructuring did not greatly change the
PDO. While 79% of project funds disbursed under the original PDO, the nature of the
objectives, namely access, quality, gender equity, did not fundamentally change.

Design. The project design is also relevant to national priorities before and after
restructuring, as evidenced by close alignment with NBEDS at appraisal and the demand-
driven scaling up of the CCT and the RFT components which are continuing in BEDP II.
The basis for the continued demand for those activities is the still large gap between male
and female enrollment, and the lack of qualified teachers, particularly in rural areas.
There continues to be an insufficient amount of school infrastructure in the country.

Implementation. Changes made in the 2010 restructuring improved project relevance by
adapting the project objectives to actual implementation capacities. The scope changed
from a gradual scale-up starting in ten governorates to a total scope of ten governorates.
The 2012 restructuring did not materially affect project relevance. Therefore, the rating
following restructuring remains High.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Ratings: Before Restructuring: Moderately Satisfactory
         After Restructuring: Satisfactory
         Overall: Moderately Satisfactory

The original PDO and indicators were in effect for 79% of fund disbursement. Following
level 1 restructuring, 21% of funds were disbursed under the revised PDO. For this
reason, the project assessment will be separated into two sections, one for the original
PDO and one for the revised PDO, with the focus of the discussion on the original PDO.
The discussion below reviews each component separately.

Prior to restructuring (March 14, 2005 – January 13, 2010): The original PDO was “to
assist the Borrower in expanding the provision of quality basic education for all, with
special attention given to gender equity.? 2 This PDO was largely achieved, in that the
Project was successful in significantly expanding access to basic education, especially for
girls.

Expansion of access and gender equity

Expansion of access was addressed under component 1, which succeeded in building
1,776 new classrooms and rehabilitating 1,251 classrooms and constructing and handing
over 175 new schools prior to restructuring. Schools and classrooms were designed to
accommodate children with special needs. Expansion of access as well as gender equity
was addressed using multiple approaches, including the innovative CCT program, which
provided payments to 36,769 girls in the year prior to restructuring as a part of
component 1. Under the CCT scheme, all girls who were enrolled in grades 4-9 were
eligible to receive the CCT conditional upon: (i) attending school at least 80% of each 2-
month class periods; (ii) successful promotion to next grade except for one repetition of a
grade in the lifetime of the program.; (iii) in addition, Grade 6 and Grade 8 girls have a
chance for an achievement bonus if they achieve 65 percent marks overall (of all
subjects) in the school end of year examinations. Implementation of the CCT program
started later than originally planned, in part because an amendment to the credit
agreement was required.

Nonetheless, the CCT Hodeidah Governorate Qualitative Evaluation Report (2010) notes
that the program demonstrates large positive effects on girls enrollment and attendance
by: (i) reducing dropouts; and (ii) increasing enrollment both in the CCT eligible grades
and the prior grades. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that it impacted positively the
perception of the parents and community towards girls’ education, as attested to in
interviews with over five hundred beneficiaries in eight governorates and described in the
Borrower ICR (2013). The Borrower ICR also clearly identifies increased enrollment of
male and female students in schools benefiting from project interventions (p 59), as do
Project reports. Similar findings were cited by ICR workshop beneficiary participants in
Sana’a in February 2013. This targeted support in the form of CCTs contributed to
gender equity in enrollment. Component two addressed the gender equity objective
while at the same time addressing quality issues through the RFT program, which
benefited 234 schools in rural areas with the hiring of 513 female teachers. This
innovative approach addressed access for girls, as a lack of female teachers constrained
female enrollment. It simultaneously addressed quality, as the teachers were provided
with training and supplies that exceeded the average teacher’s levels at the time of
implementation. Together, the CCT and RFT approaches along with other Project
financed activities expanded access and gender equity, central elements of the PDO.

Quality

The third constituent objective of the original PDO, quality, which was addressed through
multiple approaches, most prominently through teacher training as a part of sub-
component 2.2. The Borrower ICR (2013) identifies some observable impacts of teacher
training, and strongly suggests that there was an improvement in the quality of classroom
instruction as a result of the trainings. The evidence supporting this conclusion includes
classroom observations and beneficiary interviews, which are echoed by various project
evaluation reports, for example Al-haj 2012 and Al-Maswary 2012 and are based on
Project activities completed prior to the restructuring. Further, the fact that many



                                            18
teachers had received little or no initial training in pedagogy or classroom management
whatsoever meant that the Project financed trainings were addressing extreme needs.
However, some comments from interviews with beneficiaries in preparation for this ICR
indicated areas for improvement for teacher training. Another activity supporting the
quality objective was the Whole School Improvement program, involving an innovative
approach to school financing for Yemen. The WSI program provided grants of $1,500
annually to sixty schools in two governorates, and was shown to have impacts on
community engagement, availability of learning resources and student achievement
(Bisher 2011). On balance, there is extensive evidence to support the conclusion that the
planned teacher training took place through Project support and that teacher quality was
improved as a result.

Overall there is substantial evidence that the objective of increased access to quality
education particularly for girls was achieved, even though not all of the original
indicators were completely met. The partial achievement of the original indicators and
the PDO justifies a pre-restructuring rating of “Moderately Satisfactory.?

Post restructuring (January 13, 2010 to December 31, 2012): The revised PDO was to:
(i) increase enrollment of children in basic education, with particular attention to gender
equity, in ten governorates; (ii) improve quality of teaching in basic education nationally,
and (iii) establish foundations for improved MOE capacity to carry out its core functions,
so as to contribute to the goals of the national basic education development strategy
(NBEDS). Three of the six PDO targets from the 2010 restructured matrix were met or
exceeded, one was partially met, one was not met and one was dropped in the 2012
restructuring (please see Annex 2 for details). This revised PDO was largely achieved, as
enrollment in basic education was increased, and there is evidence to support the
achievement of improved quality and improved MOE capacity. Events beyond the
control of the project, in particular civil unrest, slowed Project implementation but were
mitigated through support-at-a-distance and concerted donor coordination. For (i),
enrollment of children in basic education was increased, according to evidence from
multiple sources, including the Borrower ICR, the 2011-122 CSS and project documents.
For (ii), the quality of education was likely improved as a result of trainings and school
inputs provided by the program, based on beneficiary testimony and project reports as
noted in the Borrower ICR and Annex 5. For (iii), improvements in MOE capacity can
be measured indirectly. For example, increased familiarity with WB procedures and
increased planning and M&E capacity at the MOE were noted in multiple ICRs and
allowed the MoE to take an even greater role in SEDGAP project design as well as the
preparation of BEDP II. Interviews with beneficiaries and the Borrower ICR similarly
support increased capacity of the MOE due to Project activities and inputs.

In terms of beneficiaries, eight of the nine stated targets in the restructuring package were
largely met or exceeded: communities benefitting from the construction of 201 schools,
the construction of 1,939 new classrooms, the rehabilitation of 1,768 classrooms, 38,039
girls benefitting from CCT grants, 47,674 teachers trained, 16,186 headmasters trained,
6,666 inspectors trained, 8,779 schools inspected at least three times a year, 2,867 MoE
staff trained. (See Annex 2)



                                             19
According to the resources consulted for this review, increased enrollment, particularly of
girls, was achieved as a result of project investments, as was increased MOE capacity.
There is some evidence from the Borrower ICR and beneficiary testimony that teacher
training and supervision supported by BEDP has resulted in better teaching and improved
student learning, central elements of quality education. Nonetheless, available indicators
on quality outcomes at the country level such as basic literacy in the early grades remain
poor (TIMSS 2011), with continuing challenges in internal efficiency. The primary focus
of the restructured PDO was on access with attention to gender equity and this was
achieved, along with strengthening of MoE capacity. To the degree that quality was
included in the PDO-level indicators and the PDO itself, there is sufficient evidence to
support a successful rating. For this reason the post-restructuring rating is “Satisfactory.?

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The lack of reliable statistics, the limited economic information and the ongoing security
environment have prevented more detailed analysis. Nonetheless, the benefits of the
Project’s investment were expected to be substantial compared to its costs, as it addressed
urgent needs in terms of access to quality basic education. There is good evidence from
school rosters, beneficiary interviews and independent evaluations (Annex 5, IRD, April
2013) that young men and women living in the areas where schools were built now have
increased access to basic education, and the teachers who were trained and or hired under
the project are providing education services that would arguably not otherwise have been
provided. Overall, there is limited but suggestive evidence that the costs involved in
achieving project objectives were reasonable in comparison with the benefits and
recognized norms.

Procurement of goods, involving a large portion of the project, followed World Bank
procedures and ensured least cost, despite a market with few providers and initial low
capacity of the PAU. The procurement of works represented 37 percent of the IDA
funding according to the Amended and Restated Development Credit Agreement of
January 6, 2010 and 35 percent of the MDTF according to the Amendment to the Grant
Agreement of July 3, 2012. The Aide Memoire of February 2009 notes that substantial
school rehabilitation and extension contracts were retendered due to insufficient
competition and price increases. The contracts were retendered to ensure least cost and
maximize efficiency, even under difficult circumstances such as a lack of response to
contract tenders. Significant investments were made in building PAU procurement
capacity which resulted in improved competencies, as evidenced by the level of activity,
e.g., 206 school construction contracts executed. Increased capacity in procurement is
also reflected in an improved procurement risk rating in the follow-on project (BEDP II)
documentation.

The BEDP PAD economic analysis included the assumption of increased internal
efficiency in the primary grades through lowered rates of dropout and repetition. These
rates have improved, but not to the levels targeted by the Project. For this reason, the
overall efficiency rating is “Moderately Satisfactory.?

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Ratings: Before Restructuring: Moderately Satisfactory
         After Restructuring: Satisfactory
         Overall: Moderately Satisfactory

The project’s objectives, design and implementation were and remain highly relevant to
current country priorities and the CAS. The achievement of the PDO is rated “Moderately
Satisfactory? before and “Satisfactory? after project restructuring, based on expansion in
the provision of quality basic education for all. This includes increasing enrollment and
retention of female students and increases in educational quality attributable to the
Project. Efficiency is moderately satisfactory both prior and post restructuring.
Outcomes were largely achieved considering the operational context: of the final five
PDO level indicators (as per the restructurings in 2010 and in 2012), three were met or
exceeded, one was partially met, and only one was not met. This strong Project
performance in a challenging context could arguably be rated “Satisfactory.? However,
the lack of completion on two of the five PDO level indicators support a more
conservative overall outcome rating of “Moderately Satisfactory.?

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In a country with such prevalent poverty, nearly all of the beneficiaries were poor. The
CCT component, believed to be the first of its kind in the region, was successful at
increasing female enrollment, which in some cases overlapped closely with project
investments in increased capacity of education services supply both in the form of newly
hired rural female teachers and educational infrastructure, e.g., newly built classrooms
and schools. Further, the WSI grant program increased the capacity of the Mothers and
Fathers councils in many beneficiary schools, leading to increased accountability for
education services, according to beneficiary interviews. The RFT program similarly
stimulated female enrollment. This Project-supported confluence of increased demand
and supply and social development in specific geographic areas led to major



                                           21
improvements in educational attainment of beneficiaries particularly girls, according to
the Borrower ICR and beneficiary interviews.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

There is evidence for strengthening of the MOE, the focus of Component Three,
supporting institutional change and building the capacity of the Ministry. The “Civil
Service Modernization,? sub-component 3.1, was only partially completed due to
constraints of working with other Ministries, some of which were less amenable to
reform. It was not possible to undertake a civil service reform of the Ministry of
Education in isolation from the rest of the Government. Nonetheless, inter-ministerial
collaboration was significantly improved through the project, for example, through the
implementation of the RFT program. The RFT program required frequent discussion
between several ministries, including MOF, MOCSI, MOE and MOLA, and local
authorities, in order to officially employ the trained female teachers as civil servants.

It was a clear achievement that MOE managed to work with these line ministries and
succeeded in securing a budget line for the salary of the female teachers as an MOE
recurrent cost, so that those teachers could stay at school even after the close of the
project, without further donor support. Another example of MOE strengthening is the
consolidation of capacities to implement innovative programs. The CCT for secondary
education students, part of the SEDGAP project, was able to begin operations in less than
six months’ time since the groundwork for this innovative operation had been laid by
BEDP. Other examples of institutional change at the MOE resulting from the Project
include the development and use of MTRFs and MTEFs, a widespread understanding of
international procurement procedures, and the development of an Educational Monitoring
and Information System (EMIS).

A related component of institutional change was information management. The EMIS
package was designed to facilitate strategic planning and evidence-based policy
development and was approximately 95 percent complete at project close. All required
software and programming were successfully installed at the central level of MOE and
were functional at the close of the Project. However, the EMIS was still not yet fully
operational at the national level at Project close due to some gaps in data availability.
Under the BEDP II Project, the plan is to make the EMIS operational at the school and
district level. The MTRF and associated Medium Term Expenditure Framework were
successfully developed by the MOE with support from the Project and other donors. The
development of the Basic Education Development Strategy, cited in the joint-donor Mid
Term Review of 2008, was also supported directly by the project. Some important
ground work was also completed through the project towards the establishment of
National Integrated Education Vision for Yemen (NEVY) which aims at integrating
various education strategies, from ECD to higher education to TVET. These represent
major policy and capacity advancements for the client that came about in part through
concerted WB investment of expertise, but are not necessarily fully captured in the
Project’s results framework.




                                           22
Increased capacity of the MOE was supported by the Project, even if capacity outcomes
were not directly measured. All eight project indicators measured inputs, processes and
outputs rather than outcomes, and the indicators which measured outputs did not directly
measure increased capacity, e.g., indicator eight, submission of TIMMS data. Another
indicator, training in core skills, was achieved at 239 percent of the target number of
MOE staff trained. MOE officials interviewed for the ICR described the trainings as
“very useful? and felt that the project had contributed significantly to the strengthening of
the MOE. This finding of increased capacity and improved teacher quality is supported
by the Borrower ICR.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

According to interviews with beneficiaries conducted for this ICR, the impacts of the
Project to achieving gender equity were constrained by local culture and social practices
in certain regions, which is to be expected. When the project financed the construction of
schools in certain Governorates where gender segregation was the norm, boys often
benefitted disproportionally, undermining the achievement of gender equity. This is not
true for all regions where the project financed construction, but it was true in some areas
for which beneficiaries were interviewed. The exact extent of this phenomenon is not
known, but in certain districts, new schools constructed were used by boys, and either
excluded girls or forced girls to attend a second shift in the afternoon, which is
considered inequitable given the difficulties of walking and attending school in the
hottest part of the day in buildings that are usually neither cooled nor shaded by trees and
usually lack a water source.

Donors interviewed noted that the efforts and structure of the BEDP, particularly the
MDTF, strengthened donor coordination across the sector. This donor coordination and
cooperation continued with the design of BEDP II, which was completed prior to Project
end. While the overall outcome of increased donor coordination was embraced and
fostered by the project, it was not specifically captured in the results framework.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with multiple stakeholder groups as a part of
this ICR.
Component 1 - Access: When asked: “would you have gone to school in the absence of
the project?, the three secondary school age respondents were unequivocal: no, we would
not have gone to school in the absence of the project. This response was confirmed by
school directors, both male and female, who were interviewed. They described the
construction of schools in their regions and the appointment of teachers to these schools
as “transformative? for the education of boys and girls.

Component 2 Quality: Beneficiaries, including teachers, school directors and inspectors,
were generally positive about the impact of the various training initiatives. While they
could have been better organized, run, and would have benefited from the inclusion of




                                             23
more supplemental materials, the trainings were nonetheless useful and trainees
incorporated the lessons learned into their daily work, according to their statements.

Component 3 Institutional Change: The majority of the trainings for central-level MOE
staff were perceived as helpful, as were the capacity building trainings to support the
PAU staff. Multiple MOE respondents indicated that the most important knowledge
came from meetings and dialogue with the Bank and the PAU that allowed them to better
understand the roles of the respective institutions.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The follow-on project (BEDP II) continues to implement key measures such as demand-
side interventions (CCT, RFT program, school-based development) and aims to support
further institutionalization of those activities as part of MOE normal operations, to be
funded through government resources. Donor financing continues to play a significant
role in the education sector, and this can be seen a risk-mitigating factor in that there are
multiple sources of support to maintain the achievements of the Project. Major capital
investments such as school construction are very likely to continue to be used by students
well beyond the end of the Project. The current government strongly supports education,
as have past governments, despite significant shifts in the political outlook. It therefore
appears highly likely that the outcomes of the Project will be sustained. However, there
are risks. One risk is that, without a strong maintenance program, the capital inputs will
degrade over the long-term. Political and social stability continue to pose risks to the
country. Given the broad-based donor and GoY support to the development outcomes,
the risk is rated “Moderate.?

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank supported a project that was highly relevant to national priorities and was
financed by a partnership of other donors. The project was designed to coordinate and
attract donor financing, a key lesson learned from other contexts and highly appropriate
to Yemen. The scope of the project was very broad, including most sub-sectors of
education from teacher training and recruitment to student and teacher evaluation,
textbooks, curriculum and EMIS as well as school construction, reflecting both Ministry
and donor preferences. One shortcoming relates to the Bank’s overestimation of the
initial capacity of both the PAU and the MOE, which delayed implementation. In
addition, the Bank could have been more selective during the project preparation phase in
the choice of indicators and targets for monitoring.




                                             24
(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

The WB supervision teams worked together with other donors to improve the capacity of
the MOE to achieve the PDO. This enabled the implementation of innovative and
effective approaches to education access and quality issues, for example, the CCT
program, the RFT program and Whole School Improvement grants. The changes to the
project that the Bank supported at the 2010 Level One restructuring were key to
measuring achievement of the revised PDO, as the adjusted indicators and targets
reflected an adjustment of priorities on the part of the MOE. These changes included
scaling-up successful components with additional financing and modifying other
components and implementation mechanisms as needed. For example, the additional
financing for school construction could be utilized as a result of Bank procurement
training support to the MOE and PAU. The strengthening of the MOE and PAU were
particularly important during suspension, when other donor funds could be channeled to
support some project components.

Significant efforts were made to coordinate donors, including joint donor missions to
neighboring nations during country unrest. While other projects were suspended, BEDP
administrative costs were exempted and allowed to continue in order to maintain capacity
and the momentum built up during previous years. WB staff were rarely allowed to travel
to Yemen during the final year of the project, and when they were, they were restricted to
the capital city. This negatively impacted the quality of supervision in the later stages of
the Project, despite great efforts on the part of the World Bank team and the client to
meet in places such as Amman and Washington, DC. However, since most of the project
activities had already been completed at this point, the overall effect on the project
outcomes was limited.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall rating of Bank performance is moderately satisfactory, consistent with the
quality at entry rating, as well as the overall outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Despite a slow start, the teacher training, school construction, rural female teacher and
conditional cash transfer programs gained support at the highest level of government over
the course of project implementation, with active requests for acceleration of project
implementation and additional financing for much of the project implementation period.

       The MoE has motivated key champions of the reform at the central and decentralized
       levels who are expected to play a critical role in maintaining the momentum of the
       reform. In comparison to three years ago when the BEDP was launched, the MTR of the


                                            25
       project exhibited a remarkable level of commitment from various stakeholders in the
       GoY (MoPIC, MoF, all levels of the MoE and the PAU)…
       Joint Donor Mid Term Review, April 2008

The Ministry of Finance provided satisfactory support to the project and was flexible in
processing supplemental funding from other sources when the Bank suspended
disbursements from July 28, 2011 to January 20, 2012.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The PAU exercised fiduciary and administrative control over the project despite high
turnover in staff, at least partly caused by issues of remuneration and benefits, including a
lack of health insurance. Considerable increases have been seen in PAU capacity over
the life-span of the Project, particularly in procurement and M&E. One shortcoming, the
lengthy delay at start-up, can largely be attributed to lack of knowledge of the
requirements to begin implementation of a Bank-financed project. Other bottlenecks in
school construction and elsewhere were often a result of very limited markets with few
potential providers for procurement or the MOE’s lack of familiarity with Bank
procedures, issues that were mitigated to the extent possible during Project
implementation. The MOE and PAU continued to work toward achievement of the PDO
during a period of country unrest, evidencing an extremely high commitment to Project
goals and the overall goal of education in Yemen.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall rating of Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory, consistent with
the implementing agency performance and the overall outcome rating.

6. Lessons Learned

Demand-side interventions such CCTs can be effective in raising the school attendance of
vulnerable populations, particularly girls, as evidenced by the findings of the Hodeidah
Governorate CCT evaluation of February 2010. However, demand-side and supply-side
interventions need to be closely coordinated to prevent issues such as overcrowding in
classrooms which can lead to decreased quality in student learning.

Third-party monitoring can be an effective mechanism of oversight in contexts where
direct follow-up is not possible. For example, country unrest prevented World Bank staff
from visiting project sites as a part of this review. Instead, 12 school visits were
conducted by civil engineers employed by a third-party monitor to gather information for
this review about the achievement of Component 1, access. Information delivered
included whether the construction conformed to the contract, if the school premises were
utilized by students, if staff were present at the time of the visit etc. It is important to
carefully design the monitoring instruments used, and to ensure that the third-party
monitors fully understand the project.


                                             26
Ensuring a quality results framework based on reliable data during preparation will
decrease the need for future restructurings, increasing the quality of supervision and
overall efficiency. For example, the lack of reliability of the ACS meant that the original
results matrix could not be used to reliably measure some Project targets and was one of
several factors leading to Project restructuring.

When innovative approaches such as CCTs or RFT components are newly introduced in
a country context, additional technical assistance and time should be allocated as a part of
project design in order to provide the needed support to implement the activities
effectively. Keeping designs as simple as possible and designing for existing sector
capacity can avoid lengthy delays at start-up.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Due to the recent and continuing unrest in Yemen, there is limited access to reliable
statistics and economic information. No economic analysis was conducted of the Project
or MDTF, and none is expected. Nonetheless, the benefits of the investment were
expected to be substantial compared to its costs, as it addressed urgent needs.

School-age children living near the 201 newly built schools or the 3,707 rehabilitated and
constructed classrooms now have access to basic education services that otherwise would
not have been accessible. The skills of 70,526 MoE employees have been improved
through Project-sponsored training according to their testimonials, and these expanded
skill-sets should improve the quality of education services delivered.

As noted in the ISRs and the Recipients ICR, the majority of goods were procured under
competitive bidding procedures. There were an acceptable number of bidders for each
contract, and when there were not, often due to a lack of interested firms, the bids were
retendered. Based on the information provided by the civil engineers of the third-party
monitoring group (Annex 5), it appears that Yemen got good value for money for the
majority of the construction projects. In the absence of other information and taking the
most conservative view, the rating for efficiency is “Moderately Satisfactory.?

     Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

     Field visits were conducted for 12 school construction sites financed by the project. The
     sites were selected from a project-provided list of all schools that were expanded or
     newly constructed. Three governorates were selected at random (Aden, Joff, Lahj) from
     the 12 governorates where construction had taken place, plus Sana’a City. Four sites were
     selected from each location using a randomization protocol. The inspections were
     conducted by civil engineers during the month of March, 2013, following project closure.
     The main findings from this third-party monitoring are:

         1) Improvements in access were achieved. Many classrooms are not only utilized
            but over-crowded, indicating that the expansion in infrastructure is generally well-
            used.
         2) In many cases, desks and chairs are missing or of low quality; other supplies such
            as classroom learning aids are often missing.
         3) There is a lack of drinking water, a lack of libraries, and many bathrooms are not
            operational either due to use as a storage facility, improper construction or both.

     Despite the major achievement of building schools, assigning teachers and getting
     students to attend, the assessors did not find libraries in any of the schools reviewed. This
     shortcoming likely reflects the use of rooms designed as libraries as classrooms to
     accommodate student demand, though this is not certain. The Project also did not provide
     for drinking water in many of the schools. In some instances this was geologically
     difficult, a result of constructing schools in areas with no centralized water provision in a
     water-scarce country. In most of the sites visited, the assessors noted there was no gravel
     covering the dirt playground. While gavel coverage is desirable, it is not considered a
     significant shortcoming.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Conditional Cash Transfer Semi-Structured Interview 2.25.2013, nine participants
(female beneficiaries, mothers and fathers of female beneficiaries)

Respondents were very enthusiastic about the program, noting that as mothers, they
would be schools for their children as a result of their having gone to school. A number
of them had friends, which they identified by name, that had re-joined school after having
dropped out as a result of the introduction of the CCT program. Interviewees noted that
being in school allowed them to avoid early marriage. They noted that the political,
economic and security crisis led to increased dropouts and in some cases the closure of
individual schools, but for those schools that remained open they feel that the money
from the CCT prevented an even greater level of school abandonment. They also noted
that as information about the program spread, teachers would ask questions if individual
beneficiaries showed up at school without school supplies, applying social pressure to
parents against misdirection of CCT funds.
Both parents and student beneficiaries requested that all of the funds be sent together, in
one tranche, prior to the start of the school year, so that it can be used to purchase school
supplies, clothes etc.
The parents noted that in some cases, the increase in enrollment as a result of the CCT led
to overcrowding in classrooms, which they identified as a risk for increasing dropout.

Mother and Father Council Groups Semi-Structured Interview 2.25.13, six
participants (three female, three male)

Participants noted that the councils were separate (Fathers Councils, Mothers Councils)
and that they had different roles in the two project components (CCT and Whole School
Improvement). They felt that the councils were strengthened by both of the programs as
it forced them to meet more often and strengthened communication. They also noted
competition between schools for the WSI grant program, which also increased
involvement and productivity. The respondents noted that the strengthening of the
councils has helped them work on other school-related issues not directly part of the
program.

The respondents also noted challenge of IDPs in Lahj – many schools are occupied by
IDPs, so children cannot attend school. Those schools that have been vacated by IDPs
are often damaged as a result of their use as living spaces. They request services for IDPs
so communities can use their schools again, as well as assistance in repairing schools.
Other challenges that the councils work on include teachers who never report to the
school for work but continue to be paid, lack of Modern Standard Arabic instruction due
to inadequate knowledge of teachers, and low levels of student learning, for which they
often provide tutoring.

Teacher Semi-Structured Interview, 2.25.2013, six school directors (of whom two
female), four teachers (of whom none female)




                                             38
Respondents noted that some of the teacher trainings and director trainings were helpful,
but that none fulfilled the stated objectives. The focus of the project-supported trainings
tended to be on theory, not on children or actual instruction. There were few if any study
aids provided with the trainings. Some of the directors had received training on
maintenance, not something they were eager to learn about. Trainings usually took place
during the school year, forcing the schools to close while teachers and directors were
trained, which negatively impacted the students, according to the respondents.

They noted that the new EMIS system requires that they submit data electronically, but
they don’t have this capacity (e.g. working computers with internet).

Two respondents noted that some schools were built in areas where there were very few
students, but that overall school site selection conformed to student demand. They noted
that some schools were built with under-sized classrooms, or without playgrounds. All
respondents stated or agreed with the statement that furniture quality was uniformly low,
and funds for transportation were not provided, so schools had to provide money to pick-
up and transport the furniture, which then promptly broke.

Despite construction inputs, including school expansions, respondents noted that many
schools still have problems with overcrowding. Some schools are operating classrooms
in tents, or double-shifting students.

None of the five directors had received school visits from inspectors this academic year,
which was more than half over at the time of the interview, but all of the teacher and
director respondents were dismissive of the importance of the inspections, which they
regarded as purely an administrative exercise with no actual benefit or significance. They
noted further that no instructional inspections had been performed in last four years.

School Engineer Focus Group Semi-Structured Interview 2.26.2033, three
participants (all male)

Role: The engineers described their role as the implementers and supervisors of the
construction projects, from site selection to evaluation of the finished construction and
equipment.

Models: The respondents noted that the three models approved for the design needed to
be adjusted slightly for each individual context, and that in many cases bathrooms were
added later. They noted that getting modifications to the approved design was a very
lengthy process of three or more months, which frustrated them and caused delays to
project implementation.

PAU Performance: They noted that the PAU was not responsive to their requests, and
would sometimes fail to answer project related requests. They complained that they
were not paid for transportation or other costs, which negatively impacted their ability to
monitor the construction process. For example, they stated that the “Engineering
supervision allocation? was still not paid in full at the time of the interview for the



                                            39
previous year. This lack of on-time funding means that they depend on the contractors for
transportation, which corrupts their relationship with them. The allocations should be
sent automatically from Sana’a, they should not have to travel to Sana’a to pick them up.

Cost: They noted that the cost per square meter was lower in this project than for other
projects (example given: Social Development Fund). They attribute this to the
competitive bidding process.

Quality: They noted that the quality of the furniture (desks, chairs etc) was often very low.
Impact: They said the beneficiaries were uniformly happy to have schools built in their
areas, very positive activity with high perceived value.

Interviews with Ministry of Education Deputy Ministers

Interviewees noted that the Ministry greatly appreciates the WB’s support to education.
The discussants noted that more flexibility would be appreciated from the WB on
procedures, particularly procurement. There is a strong interest on their part to better
understand the reasons behind some failures and rejected procurement proposals. They
perceive many of the procurements to be of low-quality, and gave the example of a July
and August 2012 procurement of 500 items for primary school teacher training.
Discussants noted that there is a general feeling among them that the PAU has become
the center of attention for the WB, rather than the Ministry, and that the power and
authority of the Ministry of Education has been usurped by the PAU, who answers to the
WB and not the Ministry of Education. The delays that occur due to the inflexibility of
procedures negatively influence the quality of good procured and the disbursement rate,
which then becomes an issue for everyone even though the source of the delay is the
inflexibility of the WB and the PAU.

The discussants suggested reviewing the Operations Manual in order to clearly define
roles and responsibilities between the PAU, WB and Ministry of Education. The key
goal of the review should be to minimize bureaucracy and increase efficiency, with
greater autonomy and authority for spending priorities residing with the Ministry.

Interviews with Finance and Procurement Department Representatives

Discussants noted long delays in payments to consultants by Ministry of Education, in
violation of contract terms. They noted that in general consultants are not used
effectively in that they could do more and teach more to the Ministry staff, and that the
reports that are generated are underutilized.

They noted slow responses to requests from TTLs, and lack of detailed support from the
Bank and PAU. For example, when procurements based on technical specifications and
cost end up with delivery of low quality products and they complain, they are told by the
PAU and WB to “improve your specifications.? They would like training on how to do
so, and they note that staff change at the Ministry so levels of understanding of WB




                                            40
procedures need to be continually refreshed as they are not uniform across donors. They
also requested closer review of IFRs.

Interviews with PAU staff

A number of PAU staff noted that the PAU is institutionally between the WB and the
Ministry of Education and so sometimes feels pressure in different directions from each
side. A number of staff involved in project start-up noted that the WB staff carved out a
large role for the PAU, which was inappropriate and should have been reserved for the
Ministry of Education.

A number of respondents noted that many of the delays in procurement are linked to lack
of knowledge of WB procedures, not the weakness or inappropriateness of the procedures
themselves. They request additional training and support on procedures for the Ministry.

In terms of the project, perceptions were generally positive, but the training program in
particular was too ambitious. Many subjects were covered over an extended period of
time with inadequate information about who was taking which training when.
Sequencing got confused and quality was not assured.

Many staff noted that the CPPR controls the salary scale for PAU employees. During the
recent evaluation period (end of 2012), there was a detailed discussion of performance
and performance-based pay. Finally, it was determined that there would be a blanket 5%
raise, which some among the staff feel put into question the effort spent on the evaluation
process.

According to multiple interviews, no PAU staff receive health insurance or other benefit
payments, yet they are required to pay 15% taxes. The normal tax for consultants is 8%,
for salaried employees 15%. They state that if they are to be taxed at the salaried
employee rate, they request health and other benefits that go with a salaried position.
They feel this level of support and security is insufficient and contributes to the relatively
high turnover in PAU staff.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                                  Executive Summary

Yemen has embarked on an ambitious program of Educational Reform based on its Basic
Education Development Strategy (BEDS). Its principal objective is the achievement of
quality education for all children with particular attention to gender equity. A wide
support from the Development Partners (DPs) has been given to implement BEDS. One
mechanism of support is the Basic Education Development Project (BEDP). Total
amount allocated for BEDP is 141,006,378 USD (IDA Credit of US$60.7 million
equivalent). Based on the data provided by BEDP financial department the total of the
contracted amount, as by the end of November 2012, is USD 139,857,616 (99.19%) of
which USD 129,356,393 has been disbursed and 10,501,224 is to be disbursed by the end
of the project grace period.

BEDP Project Development Objectives (PDO) are to: (i) increase enrollment of children
in basic education, with particular attention to gender equity in ten governorates; (ii)
improve the quality of teaching in basic education nationally, and (iii) establish
foundations for improving the MoE’s capacity to carry out its core functions so as to
contribute to the goals of the national basic education development strategy (BEDS).

BEDP would be closing on December 30, 2012. The MoE has requested a study of the
project to be conducted to assess the major project interventions to form the base for the
formal project Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The report presents the
following:

1- Assessments of the operations undertaken by the project, reflecting the evaluation of
the project execution from the borrower’s point of view.
2- Information about the project indicators, strengths, weaknesses, obstacles faced,
lessons learned, findings and recommendations.
3- The final assessment and the level of implementations.

The following are the most important findings:

i. BEDP original PDO were too ambitious and had to be revised to better reflect the
outcomes that can be expected from the BEDP’s short-term duration, as opposed to the
comprehensive and long-term objectives of the Basic Education Development Strategy
(BEDS).
ii. The PDO were revised in May, 2009 and the outcome indicators so that they were
aligned with the revised PDO, including the newly developed indicators to measure the
MoE’s improved capacity. The actual project outputs were not anticipated to change,
although the improved measures of these outputs were proposed.
iii. The revised (PDO) were appropriate, relevant and reflected, more realistically, the
interventions and the allocated fund. These objectives are in alignment with the project
activities and based on the revised results’ framework.


                                           42
iv. The initial design was complex in terms of geographical coverage, target groups,
activities, new interventions and programs.
v. Based on a previous project (BEEP) implementation experience, the BEDP is designed
to be implemented by the MoE, with management assistance from the Project
Administration Unit (PAU). An operation manual for guiding the BEDP implementation
was developed in addition to few other specific manuals to regulate and guide some
majored interventions processes.
vi. BEDP Major Project Interventions: 1) Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) had a
significant impact on girls enrolment. 2) Whole school Improvement (WSI) resulted in
improvement of school administration, and enhanced the involvement of the students and
the community in the school activities. 3) The Rural Female Teacher (RFT) interventions
helped in increasing the enrolment and retention among girls, and enhanced teachers’
performance in classrooms. 4)The in-service teacher training programs offered an
opportunity for teachers to gain teaching skills and new experiences. They also improved
the teachers’ performances.
vii. The three project components (Expansion of Access, Quality and Institutional
Capacity Building) had been implemented satisfactorily; they delivered their planned
outputs.
viii. Project Development Objectives have been achieved where enrolments in the 10
targeted governorates have been increased, quality of education has improved and
foundations for improved MoE capacity to carry out its core functions have been
established. However the MoE still needs a lot of support to finalize the restructuring and
making CoME functioning.
ix. The performance of both the Government and the Donors was satisfactory.

Finally, based on the findings, several general learned lessons and recommendations were
identified. The main recommendations were as follows:

I. BEDP has the potential of being a model for future educational reform in Yemen. It can
be deemed ‘first’ in many ways, especially in the range and breadth of its objectives as
well as its serious commitment to fostering a comprehensive change. It synchronizes the
contributions of the donors to achieve a nationally-set educational agenda, and it is also
designed to modernize the MoE itself. The BEDP 2 should continue to strengthen these
achievements, particularly the quality improvement and the MoE’s Capacity Building.
II. There is a need to have all the MoE bodies to be aware of the BEDP 2 plans and its
operation manuals before its official starting date, so as to avoid the slow start of BEDP
1. There is a need to improve the means of the monitoring and the ongoing evaluation of
the project activities from the MoE side and its offices in the governorates; having a
coordinator at the MoE who can take the responsibility of coordinating this among the
MoE people will help in improving this aspect.
III. There is a need to accelerate the procurement processes; so as to avoid noticed delay
in some procurement activities of the BEDP 1, e.g. in the technical assistance, early
preparation of TORs and combining some steps where possible would save time and
efforts.


                                            43
IV. The monthly meeting between the concerned MoE deputies and PAU core staff
helped following up the implementation progress and was a good tool to solve any
implementation issues; such a meeting should continue during BEDP 2.
V. Some technical bottlenecks and limitations happened at the implementation of the
various training programs. However, despite the technical and administrative limitations,
most training programs achieved their objectives of enhancing teaching and learning
practices in general based on other indicators. The real problem in relation to the training
of basic education teachers is due to the low qualification of those teachers that need
training programs of more depth in terms of topics and longer periods in terms of time
rather than short training workshops.
VI. It was evident from many research studies and educational reports that most teachers
at basic education in Yemen are unqualified. Consequently, there is an urgent need to
upgrade the qualification of those teachers, particularly those who are holding secondary
school diploma or non-education university degree. The MOE should update the sub-
strategy plan that was prepared in 2007 for upgrading the qualification of the unqualified
teachers and make plans to approach donors, so as to finance its activities.
VII. There was a cartwheel in implementing the activities related to curriculum
development within BEDP, except what was done during the last three months of the
project life. BEDP 2 should build on those activities and continue supporting this
component to the maximum extent possible. Moreover, the MOE should develop a
strategy for establishing a system for continued review, update and development of
school curricula in accordance with scientific methodologies, so as to meet the society
and student needs as well as the demands of current changes.
VIII. Learning resources are very important and have direct impact on learning.
Therefore, the provision of appropriate learning resources that respond to students’ and
teachers’ needs in both rural and urban areas (models, maps, posters, illustration figures,
etc). This component should include the preparation of a survey to assess the extent to
which the already provided learning resources are utilized and the extent to which they
respond to the needs of school curriculum, so as to be used by the MOE for developing
an effective long term plan for the whole country.
IX. The RFT program proved to be effective in facilitating the parameters of the
recruitment process easily and transparently due in part to community participation in
monitoring the program. BEDP 2 should expand this program to other governorates.
X. The programs and activities that have been directed towards comprehensive schools,
particularly schools where students with special needs were integrated seemed to be
efficient and effective. They have benefited from the support of dedicated sources of
education and teacher training. BEDP 2 should strengthen and widen the implementation
of this subcomponent. It is highly recommended to study the possibility of developing a
wider program that includes activities related to children with special needs.
XI. Some bottlenecks and limitations happened at the implementation of the EMIS; to
resolve these issues, the MOE should prepare a long term plan to create gradually a
database with various levels that starts at the school and ends at the Ministry.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Department for International Development of the United Kingdom

While noting some gaps in the data, DFID found that two of the three outcome indicators
as described in the original PAD were largely achieved and as a result considers the
project successful.

Summary of Ratings:
     This project has been assessed as "Largely Achieved". While BEDP will continue
     to implement activities until mid-late 2012, the final year of implementation will
     face a number of new risks and challenges related to the ongoing political unrest.
     Despite these challenges, the project is on track to meet the majority of its
     qualitative and quantative targets at outcome and output level. The Donor
     Partners remain committed to Basic Education in Yemen, and will continue to
     support the sector, thereby improving the likelihood of the benefits of this project
     continuing. The initial findings from the Comprehensive School Survey (CSS)
     2010/11 suggests that substantial progress has been made in increasing enrolment
     rates and improving gender parity at the national level over the last 5 years. This
     Project Completion Report (PCR) has been completed as DFID has disbursed
     over 90% of its committed £15 million. BEDP is likely to score a 1 [fully
     achieved all results] once the final activities have been completed in 2012.

Highlights:
       The Rural Female Teacher Pilot Project has been a real achievement and
       innovation from BEDP. 500 female teachers in rural areas have received training
       and have subsequently been contracted by the Ministry of Civil Service in
       permanent teaching roles. Prior to this programme there were very few female
       teachers in rural areas, and those that were employed were largely graduates from
       large cities. The female teachers were selected from rural communities and had a
       minimum of a high school diploma. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the
       presence of female teachers has increased girls' participation in basic education
       and has provided wider benefits for women’s empowerment and their role in the
       communities. This project has now been replicated as part of the centrally funded
       Fast Track Initiative (FTI) and continues to produce impressive results.

       Previous reviews have highlighted a number of other successful innovations,
       including the Conditional Cash Transfers Pilot Project and the establishment of a
       Modernisation Task Force to carry forward key reforms, including restructuring
       of the MoE.

Challenges:
       Donor coordination has been an increasing challenge, particularly over the last
       year. This has been exacerbated by the withdrawal of many international donor
       staff from Yemen in recent months. The last Joint Donor review took place in
       October 2010. Since then, Ministry of Education (MoE) reporting has been



                                           45
       infrequent and there has been very little agreed assessment of progress to date.
       While the donor community has continued to meet virtually to discuss BEDP,
       these meetings have been ad hoc and have not included key stakeholders in
       Yemen, such as the Project Administration Unit (PAU) or Ministry of Education
       (MoE). Remote management severely limits donors' ability to effectively
       understand the operating environment, make decisions related to project
       implementation, and to monitor and evaluate programme delivery.

Responses from GiZ to questions submitted for the ICR:
   1) During the preparation and life of the project (2004-2012), how effective was the
       Bank as a development partner to GiZ? What were the strong points of the
       collaborating relationship, and what were the weak points?
       Strong points: The Bank has made use of some of the innovation initiated and
       financed by GIZ (cluster based training), using of training materials developed by
       GIZ (training of teacher 1-3, Female Teacher in Rural Areas), applying of unified
       fee list (agreement between MoE and development partners).
       Weak points: Lack of collaboration in regard to planning and implementation of
       activities like school visits by supervisors. Important for the WB was the number
       of school visits but not the quality. The Bank didn’t have enough technical staff to
       ensure good collaboration with development partners, especially in 2011/ 12.
       WB projects/ PAU should be more involved on donor coordination and
       coordination and cooperation with the MoE. Example: Whenever we demanded
       from BEDP to organize school visits in a different way the answer was: not our
       responsibility, we just finance what MoE does.
   2) Are there any particular lessons learned from the project, in terms of collaboration
       among partners or project outcomes?
       Sharing of results and reports about implemented studies shall be improved. One
       heard that BEDP has implemented lots of consultancies about many different
       issues but sharing can be improved: again the coordination should be with the
       Technical Office of the MoE.
   3) How successful does GiZ perceive the project to have been? Please explain very
       briefly.
       Lots of training courses have been implemented, often with poor quality manuals,
       delayed delivery etc. There is no good mechanism for follow-up and evaluation.
       Some studies were occasionally implemented to evaluate the impacts of the
       interventions but not in a sustainable way. Quality of these studies can be
       questioned. Capacity Development within the MoE is still an issue, also
       strengthening of governance to create more reliability and accountability within
       the system. This is a cross-sectoral challenge.
   4) Any other comments you would like to include.




                                            46
General issue: Implementation of BEDP is done by the MoE, often with focus on
quantity much more than focus on quality. PAU have no role in quality control.
They are procurement specialists, not quality experts. But close monitoring is
needed to see if budget was spent effectively. MoE still needs to develop a
reliable monitoring system using decentralized structures (to avoid waste of
resources).
