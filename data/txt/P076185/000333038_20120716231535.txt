             YEMEN: BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER
A.     SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper seeks approval of the Regional Vice President to introduce changes
to the Yemen Basic Education Development Project (Cr. 3988-YEM and TF053721), following the
Aide Memoire of June 5, 2012. These changes include: (i) an extension of the Closing Date of the
Project (Cr. 3988-YEM) and the multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) financing the Yemen Basic
Education Development Project (TF053721); (ii) a reallocation of the proceeds of both the IDA
Credit and the MDTF; and (ii) changes to the Results Framework. In addition, the Borrower notified
the Bank, as per the Aide Memoire signed on June 5, 2012, of a partial cancellation of funds from
the Credit in the amount of SDR 5,089,230 (US$7.7 million equivalent).

B.     PROJECT STATUS

2.       BEDP (P076185, Cr. 3988-YEM) was approved by the Board on September 23, 2004, for
SDR 44.3 million (US$65 million equivalent), and became effective on March 14, 2005. It was
followed by co-financing in the amount of US$47.1 million equivalent from a Multi-Donor Trust
Fund (MDTF,TF053721) financed by The Kingdom of the Netherlands represented by its Embassy
in Sana’a (EKN) and the United Kingdom Department For International Development (DFID),
which became effective on April 9, 2005. Parallel financing for the project was also provided from
the German Development Bank (KFW) (US$21 million equivalent). In 2009, the Project was
restructured to revise the Project Development Objective (PDO) and update the monitoring and
result indicators, and to extend the Closing Date for 24 months from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012.

3.      In March 2012, DFID and EKN individually informed the Bank of their decision to reduce
the final contributions to the MDTF. DFID would not transfer the remaining GPB 1.14 million, out
of the total GPB 15 million due, as per the Administrative Arrangement between the Bank and DFID
dated December 22, 2004. Further, EKN’s final contribution to the MDTF would be US$3.9
million, out of the total US$6.7 million due, as per the Administrative Arrangement between the
Bank and EKN dated November 30, 2004. Notwithstanding the reduction in contributions from the
Donors, the amount available to the Republic of Yemen under the MDTF has increased. This is due
to favorable fluctuations in exchange rates.

4.      The project was performing well and rated satisfactory when the country unrest started in
January 2011. On June 28, 2011, in response to a much deteriorated political and security situation,
and pursuant to remedies set out in both the General Conditions and the Standard Conditions, the
World Bank suspended disbursements of the entire Yemen portfolio. The suspension of
disbursements was based on the Bank’s assessment that “an extraordinary situation? existed which
made it improbable that Bank projects could be carried out. On January 19, 2012, after reassessment
of the country situation, the Bank lifted the suspension of disbursements. Up to January 2011, there
was steady progress towards achievement of the main outcome indicators and these had been rated
satisfactory since April 2010. In the latest Implementation Status Report (ISR), dated March 19,
2012 progress towards achievement of PDO was rated moderately satisfactory, after taking into
account the effect of a protracted period of suspension of disbursement on the Project.

5.      The severe country environment and suspension of disbursement had a significant impact on
project implementation. A large number of activities that were identified in the 2011 annual work

                                                 3
plan (AWP) were put on hold except for a few high priority activities that KfW agreed to continue
financing. However, on a cumulative basis, most of the activities were implemented well before the
suspension. As a result, the Project achieved substantial progress towards its Development
Objectives as shown by the steady increase in the two main outcome indicators: (i) total number of
students enrolled in grades 1-9 (1.2 million for male and 0.92 million for female), exceeding the end
project target for males and very close to reaching the female target six months before the closing of
the project; and (ii) gender parity index has progressed steadily from a baseline of 0.7 in 2005/2006
to 0.77 in 2010/2011. In terms of output indicators, the project is on target to complete civil works
within the proposed extension period of the Credit and MDTF, with 199 new schools already
constructed out of a target of 219 schools.

6.      Component 1: Access Expansion. During the suspension, the majority of activities that
were identified in the AWP for 2011 were put on hold. However, on a cumulative basis, after five
years of implementation, the project has made remarkable achievement, shown by several indicators:
(i) 103% achievement in new school construction; (ii) 98% achievement in the completion of new
classrooms; and (iii) 122% achievement in rehabilitation of existing schools. As for the Conditional
Cash Transfer (CCT), two installments were not delivered (March and October 2011) due to the
situation in country and the resulting suspension of disbursement. Accordingly, implementation of
the related consultancy work (impact evaluation) was also suspended. According to the Ministry of
Education’s (MOE) assessment, based on the monthly operational reports and collected data, this
scheme has been performing well in the two targeted governorates of Lahej and Hodeidah as the
indicators related to students' enrolment and retention have been improving steadily.

7.       Component 2: Quality Improvement. Almost all activities were affected by the country
unrest and suspension of disbursement. Activities that were put on hold included: teacher training,
school visits by supervisors, provision of teaching and learning resources, and printing of training
manuals. After lifting of suspension, it was decided by MoE that more focus should be placed on
outcomes of training rather than provision of training itself, therefore, only a few key training
activities were resumed. The project accomplished the main goal, to recruit, train and officially hire
more than 500 female teachers in rural areas. For activities related to education grants to schools,
evaluation of the Whole School Improvement (WSI) was completed which points to the importance
of leadership of principals and community involvement for effective school management.

8.       Component 3: Institutional Capacity Building. Despite the country turmoil that posed
serious challenges in day-to-day operations, the MOE completed data collection for the 2010/11
Comprehensive School Survey (CSS), as planned, and produced the first draft summary reports.
Further, TIMSS 2011 data collection was completed and data is being analyzed. Also, other
activities such as national training of procurement and financial management staff achieved 100% of
the target under this Component. About 80% of the technical assistance to establish an Educational
Management Information System (EMIS) for MOE at the central and local levels was completed.
With regard to the modernization of the MOE structure, pending tasks include the presidential
decree for the new organization of the MOE which was planned to be submitted to the Council of
Ministers by the end of 2010 but was delayed due to the unrest in the country. The MoE and the
Project Administration Unit (PAU) are working to put these delayed activities back on track.

9.     Disbursement. To date, about 88 percent of the Credit funds and 94 percent of the MDTF
funds have been disbursed. It is expected that a total amount of about US$12 million would be
disbursed between now and the proposed revised closing dates of the Credit and MDTF. The
Borrower has notified the Bank of a partial cancellation of SDR 5,089,230 (US$7.7 million
equivalent) of the Credit funds that cannot be disbursed from the Credit by December 31, 2012.
                                                  4
10.    Audit. There are no outstanding or unsatisfactory project audit reports. All required project
annual audit reports were submitted to the Bank; the last one was received by the Bank and covers
the period ending December 31, 2010, with unqualified "clean" opinion. It was reviewed by the
Bank and found satisfactory.

C.           PROPOSED CHANGES
11.          There are no changes to the PDOs or to the Project Description.
                Results Framework/Indicators
12.     It is proposed to remove Outcome Indicator 9: “Number of civil works projects procured by
GEOs in 10 governorates using agreed project financial management and procurement guidelines?.
This was intended to measure the level of MOE decentralization and procurement capacity building
at local levels; however, it is considered that progress in such domains (institutional changes and
localized capacity building) can be adequately measured by other existing indicators. Other project
indicators and end targets remain unchanged from the last restructuring approved in November 16,
2009.

13.          Other major facts related to implementation and their likely impact is discussed below.

     (i)         High likelihood of achieving targets: The project efficiently implemented most of
                 activities before the country unrest started; progress towards achievement of targets was
                 steadily made; and it is expected that six months extension will off-set the delays caused
                 during 2011 in the implementation of key activities such as civil works and EMIS.

     (ii)        The impact of partial IDA cancelation is minimal: The amount of SDR 5,089,230
                 (US$7.7 million equivalent), to be canceled out of initial Credit of SDR 44.3 million
                 (US$65 million equivalent) has no significant impact on the Indicators, as the project
                 already generated a saving of US$6 million long before the country unrest. There was a
                 plan to reallocate the IDA Credit to provide more support to the conflict-affected areas in
                 Sada’a governorate (e.g. school furniture; learning kits; support for teachers; socio-
                 psychological support for students). This plan was aborted due to the occurrence of
                 country unrest, but this verifies that the project was able to achieve original targets with a
                 lesser amount of funding; in other words, the cancelation will just affect those planned
                 newly added activities that are outside the original targets.

     (iii)       No major impact is expected from the funding reduction. Notwithstanding the
                 reduction in Contributions from the Donors, the amount available to Republic of Yemen
                 under the MDTF has increased. This is due to favorable fluctuations in exchange rates.
                 The reduction in Donor Contributions has no impact on project planned.
14. Data consistency: It should be noted that a persistent problem in data accuracy and consistency
       has been identified, and affect particularly PDO Indicators 6 and 7 for which two different data
       sources were used depending on the year. The main data source, the Comprehensive School
       Survey (CSS), is conducted every five years, thus the values for interim years have been
       completed using the Annual Education Survey (AES). CSS and AES use different data
       collection methods, resulting in discrepancies and incoherence in the values for consecutive
       years. In order to improve the quality of data and data management capacity, technical
       assistance was provided and a new education survey tools were reviewed and approved (a
       simplified annual CSS) that is replacing the AES. The mini-CSS aims at providing more
                                                          5
      accurate data on annual basis and MoE was ready to implement the first such survey in
      2011/2012. However, efforts were disrupted by the country unrest and the survey was not
      carried out as originally planned. As a result these indicators should be used with caution.

15.    Monitoring and Evaluation: Using the Results Framework, both the PAU and MoE have
been closely monitoring implementation progress. Relevant training has been provided to strengthen
overall M&E capacity. The M&E capacity has progressed at MoE but there is still room for
improvement. Keeping the same Results Framework would help the MoE have a coherent M&E
framework, which will support a solid and in-depth evaluation of BEDP. Several technical assistance
contracts are planned as part of the end-of-project plan, to conduct rigorous evaluation of the project.

             o Financing Plan

17.    As stated above, favorable fluctuations in exchange rates mean that a reduction in
contributions by DFID and EKN will not have a negative impact on the total funding available to
BEDP from the MDTF. The Financing Plan has been revised to reflect the cancellation of SDR
5,089,230 (US$7.7 million equivalent) from the IDA Credit as well as the revised contributions from
DFID and EKN. It is worth noting that, as of May 7, 2012, SDR 44.3 million is equivalent to
US$60.67 million (as opposed to US$65 million equivalent in 2004).

             o Reallocations

18.    Pursuant to the Borrower’s notification of partial cancellation of the Credit no. 3988-YEM,
and their request for reallocation, the following changes will be made within the categories of
expenditure in the Credit:

Category (1):         SDR 736,090 added through reallocation as follows: SDR 474,510 from Cat (2)
                      and SDR 261,580 from Cat (7)
Category (2):         Reallocate SDR 474,510 to Category (1)
Category (3) (a):     Cancel SDR 58,900

Category (3) (c):     Cancel SDR 4,910
Category (4):         Cancel SDR 3,473,200
Category (5):         SDR 208,480 added through reallocation from Category (6) (a)
Category (6) (a):     Reallocate SDR 208,480 to Category (5) and cancel SDR 971,830
Category (6) (b):     Cancel SDR 9,460
                                                    6
Category (7):        Reallocate SDR 261,580 to Category (1) and cancel SDR 25,920

20. Although the amount of the Grant is being reduced, the gains from currency fluctuations led to an increase of
   the Grant amount. In addition, some amounts are being reallocated which results in the following changes:

   Category (1)        The amount increased by US$ 116,669
   Category (2)        The amount increased by US$ 196,103
   Category (4)        The amount increased by US$1,523,056
   Category (5)        The amount increased by US$ 164,561
   Category (7)        The amount increased by US$ 75,000

   Category (3) The amount is being reduced by US$751,688 and mostly allocated to Category (4).
   Category(6) The amount is being reduced by US$10,000 and mostly reallocated to Category (4)

           o Cancellation

22.    The amount of SDR 5,089,230 (US$7.7 million equivalent) is cancelled from the Credit.

          Closing Date

23.     At the Borrower’s request, the Project Closing Date will be extended to December 31, 2012
for the following reasons:

  (a) To resume activities delayed by the country unrest and suspension of disbursement. Those
      activities, which include, among others, the construction of additional toilets, the training of
      maintenance teams for project schools, the completion of the CCT program, and the
      provision of urgently needed equipment for exam centers in order to ensure that the exams
      are properly administered in June 2012, are needed to ensure that progress made is not
      reversed. These activities would not be fully completed without the extension.

  (b) To prevent a gap in donor support to basic education. A new operation to continue support to
      the Yemen Basic Education Development Strategy is being prepared and is expected to go to
      the Board by December 2012. Project extension would serve as a transition period to prepare
      for the new operation and prevent any substantial gap in sector financing. The six-month
      extension will, in particular, allow the project to support the Ministry of Education in
      preparing for the 2012/13 school year.

  (c) To preserve the Project Administration Unit (PAU). Yemen has an effective and well staffed
      education PAU, which so far has been funded through donor aid. A gap in donor aid may
      cause the loss of key PAU staff.

24.    As this extension of the Closing Date of the Credit and Grant would extend beyond two years
cumulatively from the original Closing Date, approval of the Regional Vice President for the Middle
East and North Africa is sought in accordance with BP 13.30.


          Implementation Schedule

25.      The Bank and the Borrower have agreed on an Action Plan in accordance with OP/BP 13.30
and this is attached. The project annual work plan, procurement plan and disbursement forecast were
revised and attached to the Aide-Memoire signed by the Borrower on June 5, 2012. Only the
activities that can reasonably be completed by December 2012 were kept in the plan. The revised
procurement plan will be disclosed as soon as the extensions of the Closing Date of the Credit and
the Grant have been approved by the Bank.
