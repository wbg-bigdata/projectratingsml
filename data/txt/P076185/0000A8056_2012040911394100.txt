                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised Project Development Objective is to: (1) increase enrollment of children in basic education, with particular attention to gender equity, in 10 governorates; (2)
                         improve quality of teaching in basic education nationally, and (3) establish foundations for improved MoE capacity to carry out its core functions, so as to contribute to
                         the National Basic Education Development Strategy (NBEDS) goals.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This report reflects the status of the Basic Education Development Project (BEDP), financed from the IDA credit 3988-YEM and the Multi-DonorTrust Fund (TF053721). Since funds
                         are not earmarked, it is not possible to separate progress based on each source of funding.

                         The World Bank suspended disbursements on July 28, 2011. Several other donors also suspended their disbursement. Suspension was lifted on January 19, 2012.


                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 5

                         It is undeniable that the severe country environment and suspension of disbursement by the World Bank had a significant impact on project implementation (a large number of
                         activities that were identified in the 2011 annual work plan were put on hold). However, on a cumulative basis, most of the activities were implemented well before the suspension. In
                         this respect, it is likely that the Project Development Objectives will be achieved as shown by the steady progress in the two main outcome indicators: (i) total number of students

                         enrolled in grades 1-9 (1.2 million for male and 0.92 million for female) exceeding the end project target for males and very close to reaching the female target six months before the
                         closing of the project; and (ii) gender parity index is progressing steadily from a baseline of 0.7 in 2005/2006 to 0.77 in 2010/2011. In terms of output indicators, the project is on target
                         to complete civil works with 199 new schools constructed out of a target of 219 schools.
