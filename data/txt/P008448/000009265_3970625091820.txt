MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY
FOR A SECOND INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the National Bank of
Hungary (NBM) for US$150 million with the guarantee of the Hungarian People's
Republic is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 15 years,
including three years grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate, and would
help finance a second industrial restructuring project.
2.       Background.  A series of external events and inadequate policy
responses gave rise to increasing convertible currency debt in Hungary during
the 1970s. Thus, in 1979, the Government launched a program of stabilization
and renewed economic reform which was a critical factor in enabling Hungary to
avert a potential debt crisis in 1982, and to begin restoring its balance of
payments position. Stabilization, however, was not accompanied by effective
structural adjustment to address the problems of slow growth in productivity
and stagnant or declining competitiveness in many subsectors. The economy
was, therefore, especially vulnerable to new external shocks in 1985/86, which
created serious external and internal disequilibria. The authorities
recognize that a sound macroeconomic environment is crucial to maintain the
momentum of the reform process, and are taking stabilization measures in 1987
to redress macroeconomic imbalances. To meet the target of reducing the
current account deficit in 1987 to $700-800 million from $1,420 million in
1986, the Government is taking measures to strengthen demand management and to
reduce the budget deficit to no more than Ft 30 billion, or 2.6% of planned
ODP (compared with Ft 47 billion or 4.3% of GDP in 1986), in part by a
reduction of consumer and producer subsidies. The forint was devalued in
March 1987 by 8% in relation to a basket of convertible currencies (following
a 12% devaluation in 1986), and additional incentives for exports are under
consideration. The Government has confirmed its commitment to continously
monitor the trade performance in 1987 and take additional actions as necessary
(including further public expenditure cuts) in order to mfeet the balance of
payments target. The intended reductions in the current account and fiscal
deficits in 1987 are part of a medium-term program of stabilization and
structural adjustment which is based on acceleration of the economic reform,
and is the subject of ongoing consultations with the Bank.
3.       Industry is the largest sector in the economy, contributing about a
third of GDP, employment and investment, and 79% of total exports. Industrial
restructuring is the centerpiece of Hungary's medium-term structural adjustment
program and is accordingly reflected as one of the primary objectives of the
Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90). The industrial restructuring program for
1986-90, developed with the Bank's assistance, is the main vehicle to support
the economic reform in Hungary, to promote structural change of Hungarian
industry, and enhance its international competitiveness, exports and growth.
The medium-term reform program aims at comprehensive improvements in the
economic policy framework in eleven areas, including entry and liquidation of
enterprises, pricing, wages, taxation, foreign trade, banking, capital market,
foreign investment, technology development and enterprise management. This
program was reflected in the Government's letter of intent dated May 6, 1986,
which served as the basis for the first industrial restructuring project (Loan
2700-HU) approved in May 1986. In the year since Board presentation of the
first industrial restructuring project, the Government has implemented fully
the specific actions on schedule as indicated in the letter and accompanying
policy matrix. Among the most important measures taken, the Government has



brought the new two-tier banking system Into operation; amended the existing
law of association to remove some restrictions on the formation of limited
liability companies by legal entities; enacted a liquidation law and unemploy-
ment compensation scheme to promote mobility of capital and labor; and imple-
mented the Import Competition Program. The Government has also committed
itself to a package of coordinated actions to be taken in 1987188 within the
agreed policy reform framework.
4.       Project Obiectives.  The objective of the project is to support the
restructuring of Hungarian industry to enable it to achieve international
competitiveness and increase the potential for exports, particularly to
convertible currency areas.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed project supports the continued
implementation of a comprehensive program of industrial policy reforms (para.
3 above) which creates the necessary economic conditions for industry-wide
restructuring. While actions are planned in all policy areas of the reform
essential to the success of industrial restructuring, the main actions
envisaged for 1987/88 concern the tax reform, liquidation process, competitive
banking system, legal framework for new company formation, and enterprise
accounting (para. 9). The Government has requested continued Bank support and
financing, through this proposed second project, to help maintain the momentum
of the reform process and the restructuring of industry. The proposed project
would, therefore, support specific restructuring actions at the subsector/
enterprise level to facilitate an adequate supply response to the reforms.
6.       The proposed Bank loan of $150 million consists of:
(a) $98.5 million for an industry-wide restructuring component comprising:
(i)    $40 million for import of raw materials and goods needed as a
result of restructuring of steel, coal, plastics and rubber
subsectors;
'ii)   $50 million for a pilot program of development of feeder
industries which produce parts, components and sub-assemblies
for industry; and
(iii)  $8.5 million for technical assistance to support the reform
program in the areas of banking services, enforcement of fair
market practices (e.g., antitrust), labor retraining,
accounting anm auditing as well as provision of hardware for
tax reform administration and for the new banking system.
(b)  $51.5 million for a subsector restructuring component comprising:
(i)    $49 million to support the restructuring of rubber processing,
agricultural machinery, food processing machinery and plastics
processing subsectors, including funds for technological
infrastructure, technology upgrading imports, manufacturing
equipment, spares and tools; enterprise restructuring through
implementation of efficient product/market strategies,
organization development and management systems; and
(ii)   $2.5 million for technical assistance for preparation of
enterprise restructuring programs and for strenghtening the
Restructuring Program Office (RPO).



-3 -
Investments to be supported under the project would have to meet environmental
standards in Hungary which are considered satisfactory to the Bank.
7.       The total cost of the project, which will be implemented over five
years, is estimated at US$406.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$211.0 million (52%). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement of goods and services will be in
accordance with Bank procurement and consultant guidelines. Allocation and
methods of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timeta 'le of key processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations
in Hungary are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 6643-HU dated May 15, 1987) is
being distributed separately.
8.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Lending to support industrial
restructuring forms the core of the Bank's country assistance strategy, in
view of the importance of improved industrial performance for the achievement
of overall economic growth and a sustainable external balance. As part of the
first industrial restructuring project, agreement was reached on the
implementation of a five-year program of coordinated poiicy and institutional
reforms affecting the industrial sector. The Bank's involvement in the
proposed project has contributed to developing the package of actions already
taken in 1986/87, and those envisaged for 1987/88, within the framework of
this medium-term reform program. It has also helped in the preparation of
specific programs to incorporate the restructuring concepts as applied to the
selected subsectors and individual enterprises, and thereby promote their
progressive and wider application to the industrial sector as a whole.
Continued Bank involvement over the medium term is important to assist in
maintaining the momentum of the reform process and of ongoing restructuring
efforts.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has committed itself to the continued
implementation of the medium-term policy reform program. It intends to take
steps in 1987/88, reflected in an updated letter of industrial policy intent,
aimed at implementing the reforms in all eleven areas noted in para. 3 above.
The major actions relate to: reforming the tax system by the introduction of
value-added and personal income taxes in January 1988, and modification of
related price and wage regulations; limiting new commitments of Governmental
support to loss-making enterprises to exceptional cases as defined in the
liquidation law, and making all enterprises subject to the liquidation process
in the event of renewed insolvency; further developing the conditions for
efficient operation of the commercial banking system, including the
implementation of an appropriate monetary policy; preparing a new law of
association to liberalize more fully the conditions for formation of new
companies; and carrying out a program agreed with the Bank to revise
enterprise accounting and auditing standards in order to serve better the
needs of managers and investors. The Government will also: (i) strengthen
the Restructuring Program Office in the Ministry of Industry with adequate
staff, supplemented by external assistance1 to enable it to evaluate and
assist enterprises in the preparation of restructuring programs; and
(ii) carry out a study on constraints for feeder industry development and
implement the major recommendations of the study after review with the Bank.
NBR has agreed that it will ensure that the intermediary commercial banks
would: (i) strengthen their staff training, to enable them to adequately



-4-
appraise subprojects under the loan; (ii) increase their paid-in capital by
June 1988 to ensure they have a sound financial position; (iii) finance only
subprojects with an economic and financial rate of return of 18X, and
enterprises with viable corporate restructuring programs, satisfactory
debt/equity, current and debt servicc coverage ratios.  The Bank would approve
the first four subprojects to be financed by each bank. The signing of a
subsidiary loan agreement between NBf and at least two commercial banks which
will onlend loan funds to beneficiaries, is a condition of Bank loan
eff'ectiveness. The signing of a subsidiary financing agreement between NBH
and other participating intermediary banks is a condition of disbursement of
loan funds to them.
10.      Justification.  The industrial policy reform program is expected to
provide the conditions for efficient restructuring and growth of the
industrial sector by encouraging domestic and international competition,
enhancing efficient resource mobility, and improving financial discipline and
control. The feeder industries component would help to improve the structure
of the industrial sector through development of small- and medium-sized
industries for production of parts and components for which efficient supply
is constrained at present. The subsector restructuring component will support
enterprises in the selected subsectors to develop international competitiveness
through changes in strategies, structure, organization, management and
physical restructuring, and will have a wider impact within industry through
the demonstration of restructuring concepts and actions.
11.      Risks.  The main risk of the policy reform program stems from the
presently inadequate discipline in macroeconomic demand management, and the
related lack of financial discipline at the enterprise level. There are also
risks from the insufficient supply response to the program to date, and the
danger of a slowdown in the reforms. The commitments expressed by the
Hungarian authorities to tighten demand management and take specific measures
aimed at decreasing the current accounL and budgetary deficits and
strengthening incentives for exports reduce these risks. Technical assistance
efforts under the project are designed to strengthen the Hungarian
institutional capacity to prepare, appraise and implement restructuring
projects and should helo to alleviate the risk of inadequate supply response
from the feeder industry and subsector restructuring components.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
