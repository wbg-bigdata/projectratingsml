MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE DIRECTOR
OF THE LAC COUNTRY DEPARTMENT II
TO THE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT
ON A GRANT FROM THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT TRUST FUND
TO THE BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS PUBLICOS
FOR A PROTECTED AREAS PROGRAM
1.    Country/Sector Background. Mexico faces significant challenges in managing its
environmental resources, including problems of air and water pollution in urban areas and management
of agricultural lands, fisheries, forests and coastal areas. High concentrations of ozone, carbon
monoxide, fine particulates, sulfur dioxide and lead in the air in many cities pose a significant hazard
to a wide cross-section of the population. Water is relatively scarce in much of Mexico, and many of
the country's surface waters are polluted with municipal, industrial or agricultural waste. Only two-
thirds of the urban population is connected to a sewer system.
2.    Mexico's environmental legislation is far ahead of that of most developing countries. Article
27 of the Mexican Constitution establishes the obligation of the federal government to conserve the
nation's natural resources and to preserve and restore ecological equilibrium in the public interest.
Article 73 gives the Congress the authority to promulgate laws defining the respective roles of the
federal, state and local levels of government in environmental protection. Exercising this
constitutional authority, the Congress passed the Lev General del Equilibrio Ecologico v la Proteccion
al Ambiente (General Ecology Law) which went into effect in March 1988. It contains rules which
define ecological planning and zoning, environmental impact studies, restoration of degraded
ecosystems, protection of natural areas and plant and animal life, sound exploitation of natural
resources, and pollution prevention and control. The Law contains the framework for ensuring a more
sensitive and sustainable development pattern in Mexico through improved intersectoral cooperation,
increased social participation, and the creation of strong new environmental standards. The law also
defines protected areas in Mexico, and provides the basis for sound management of protected areas by
government in close coordination with society-at-large. Finally, the law defines clearly the respective
responsibilities of the various levels of government with regard to environmental protection and natural
resources management.
3.    In 1982, the government created the Secretariat for Urban Development and Ecology
(SEDUE), consolidating in a single agency most of the environmental protection responsibilities which
had previously been dispersed in several federal agencies. SEDUE is responsible for regulating air
and water quality, ensuring that public and private sector investments meet established environmental
criteria, and managing federal protected areas. While SEDUE suffered the same financial and
institutional problems as other federal secretariats during the fiscal contraction of the mid-1980s, by
1990 the government began to take firm measures to strengthen the agency to take on a leadership role
in environmental protection and natural resources management.
4.    The government's priorities for environmental policies and actions, as summarized in the
1989-94 National Development Plan, are: (i) to strengthen the legal framework to prevent
deterioration of the environment, and use environmental regulation as an efficient instrument of
environmental protection of the country's geographical zones and regions; (ii) to subject all economic
activities and projects to strict criteria of environmental care; (iii) to design policies and take actions to
prevent further deterioration of, and improve, air and water quality, prevent or slow down soil erosion,
and introduce adequate treatment of solid wastes and hazardous materials; and (iv) to increase public
awareness of, and participation in, environmental protection.



5.    In early 1990, SEDUE published the "National Program for Environmental Protection: 1990-
1994." This program is intended to orient the effoits of the federal govermment and social groups in
environmental protection. Key emphases of the program are: (i) decentralization of environmental
control authority to state and municipal levels of government; (ii) ecological planning and zoning,
including appropriate designation of wildlands as natural protected areas; (iii) use of the "Polluter Pays
Principle" to ensure that development decisions intemalize associated environmental costs, and to help
defray the cost of enviromnental management; and (iv) improved interagency coordination.
6.    The territory of Mexico contains a significant proportion of the world's biodiversity, ranking
fourth among the thirteen mega-diversity countries identified by intemational biodiversity specialists.
This biodiversity is characterized by a wide variety of ecosystems and a high rate of endemism: the
country has the largest diversity of reptiles in the world and seven of the eight species of the world's
marine turtles come to Mexico's shores to lay their eggs. Mexico occupies second place in mammal
diversity, and contains more endemic terrestrial vertebrates than any other country in the neotropics.
Mexico's biodiversity is not confined to animal species; its flora is also very diverse, harboring over
22,600 known plant species. Moreover, 14 percent of the plant genera, and an estimated 40-50
percent of the species are endemic. Related to the richness of species in Mexico is the diversity of the
country's habitats. Ranging from temperate to tropical climates, and bisected by a major mountain
chain, Mexico's habitats range from deserts and snow-covered peaks to vast grasslands and wetlands,
to coastal and marine ecosystems.
7.    To protect its rich biological wealth, Mexico has established a national system of protected
natural areas, SINAP, administered by SEDUE. By the mid-1980s, this system included over a
hundred protected areas. A recent re-evaluation of the biological value of these areas recognized that
many were too small to be viable over the long term, or had become too degraded, due to inadequate
protection, to be sustained. Consequently, SINAP was reduced to the 66 natural protected areas of
greatest importance, encompassing 5.5 million hectares or almost three percent of the national territory.
SINAP is currently comprised of 44 National Parks, 8 Biosphere Reserves, 13 Special Biosphere
Reserves, and one Area for the Protection of Flora and Fauna. Given resource constraints, however,
SINAP's parks and reserves still lack the attention necessary to ensure their effective protection from
encroachment.
8.    Mexico is now seeking to strengthen its capacity to protect its biodiversity resources, taking
into account its limited resources and the need to set priorities carefully. The country's strategy
emphasizes the need to stike a balance between conservation and exploitation of the resources
contained in its protected areas. This balance is achieved through careful planning, culminating in the
preparation and implementation of a management plan for each protected area. Based on a detailed
analysis of the physical and social characteristics of the protected area, the management plan specifies
the specific objectives to be achieved in the area, and the regulations and programmatic activities
necessary to ensure the achievement of those objectives. This approach is described in the document,
"Protected Natural Areas of Mexico: Legislation and Management Plans" (translation), transmitted to
the Bank by SEDUE's Under-secretary for Ecology (Annex 1).
9.    Under the Protected Areas Program of the proposed Environmental Project, the government
proposes to support with the proposed grant up to 17 high-priority protected areas, representative of
several important ecosystems around the country. In addition, the government would use the proceeds
of the proposed Bank loan for the Environmental Project to carry out: (i) a study of SINAP to
identify gaps in ecosystem and species representation and propose new protected areas; (ii) a study to



- 3 -
identify appropriate sites and prepare regulations to establish biological corridors between protected
areas; (iii) actions to control wildlife trade; and (iv) actions to protect the nesting sites of endangered
marine turles.
10.   Protected Areas Program Objectives. The principal objective of the protected areas program
would be to assist in the conservation of Mexico's biodiversity by supporting the management of up to
17 high-priority protected areas. The 17 areas chosen are among some 30 Mexican protected areas
that are intemationally recognized as most critically in need of support. Each of the 17 protected areas
contains endemic or endangered species of global importance. Successful implementation of the
program would demonstrate how to protect a variety of fragile ecosystems in the context of a
sustainable development approach in a country where the legal and institutional framework for
effective protection of protected areas is well developed. Lessons learned in the Mexican context are
expected to assist other countries whose protected areas policy and legislation are less advanced, as
they move to enact the laws and regulations needed to underpin an effective biodiversity protection
strategy.
11.   Component DescriDtion. The protected areas program would be an integral part of the
proposed Bank-supported Environmental Project covering the area of biodiversity conservation. The
component design employs a program approach, whereby resources would be available to finance
selected activities in eligible protected areas on the basis of a detailed management plan and a
corresponding operating plan for each protected area. The protected areas to be supported under the
proposed program would be selected by the Bank on the basis of agreed eligibility criteria from among
the following 17 protected areas (see para. 14):
1-   Reserva de la Biosfera El Vizcaino, Baja Califomia Sur
2-   Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Islas del Golfo, Baja California
3-   Parque Nacional Constitucion de 1857, Baja California
4-   Reserva de la Biosfera Calakmul, Campeche
5-   Parque Nacional Cascada de Bassaseachic, Chihuahua
6-   Reserva de la Biosfera Montes Azules, Chiapas
7-   Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Cascadas de Agua Azul, Chiapas
8-   Parque Nacional Canon del Sumidero, Chiapas
9-   Parque Nacional Lagunas de Montebello, Chiapas
10-   Parque Nacional El Chico, Hidalgo
11-   Parque Nacional Izta-Popo, Mexico, Morelos, Puebla
12-   Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Mariposa Monarca, Mexico, Michoacan
13-   Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Isla Isabel, Nayarit
14-  Parque Nacional Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca
15-   Reserva de la Biosfera Sian Ka'an, Quintana Roo
16-   Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Isla Contoy, Quintana Roo
17-   Reserva Especial de la Biosfera Ria Lagartos, Yucatan
12.   Under the protected areas program, GET and counterpart funds would finance: (i) consultant
services to assist SEDUE in preparing a management plan for each of the 17 protected areas (US$1.3
million); (ii) based on the results of the management plan, items contained in the corresponding
operating plan for each protected area, including: (a) basic infrastructure investments (e.g. visitor
administration headquarters, guard posts and houses, fire detection towers, fences and nature trails)
(approximately US$6.9 million for all 17 protected areas), (b) equipment and vehicles (e.g. trucks,



four-wheel drive vehicles, boats, power generators, and radio and first aid equipment) (US$2.7
million), (c) demarcation of protected area borders and consultant services (US$3.4 million), and (d)
incremental operating expenditure for the protected areas (e.g. incremental technical staff and rangers,
materials, maintenance, etc.) (US$20.0 million); (iii) the costs of periodic meetings of local
governmental and non-governmental groups (TACs -- see para. 17, below) to advise and assist the
director of each protected area (US$0.5 million); (iv) training programs for protected areas
administrators and staff (US$0.4 million); (v) preparation of an eco-tourism plan for one protected area
(para. 13, below) (US$0.2 million); (vi) participation of Mexican and non-Mexican specialists in
reviewing management and operating plans, as well as progress in program implementation (US$0.5
million); and (vii) program coordination (US$0.6 million). These estimates are based on indicative
activities in the protected areas; each area's operating plan would provide a firm estimate of the costs
to be incurred under the program. During 1992, while management plans are being prepared for the
17 protected areas, the program would provide a minimum level of support to carry out emergency
protection plans in 13 of the 17 areas (US$2.1 million).' Under the emergency plans, financing
would be provided for such items as construction of entrance posts in some protected areas; the
purchase of one or two vehicles and radio, firefighting, and first aid equipment for each protected area;
and the hiring of a director and between 6 and 12 rangers per area. The total cost of the protected
areas program is estimated at US$38.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$1.5 million (3.9 percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement of the proposed grant, and the
disbursement schedule for the GET grant are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events is given in Schedule C. A map of Mexico indicating the location of the 17
protected areas is also attached (IBRD - 23536).
13.   Several of the 17 protected areas would also be appropriate for limited eco-tourism
development that could generate resources to cover a portion of the recurrent costs of conservation
activities. The protected areas program would not finance any eco-tourism investments, but would
contribute to the development of an eco-tourism strategy for the SINAP by funding the preparation of
an eco-tourism plan for the Special Biosphere Reserve Isla Contoy in the state of Quintana Roo in
Southern Mexico which would determine: (i) the potential market for eco-tourism in the protected
area; (ii) the level of tourism that the protected area could support without compromising its
conservation objectives; (iii) the types and location of infrastructure that would be appropriate to serve
potential tourists; and (iv) the conditions under which SEDUE should auction concessions to
developers to establish and operate tourism facilities. The result of this analysis would provide the
basis for developing eco-tourism plans in other protected areas.
14.   While the protected areas program would be targeted to 17 protected areas, the Bank would
take a final decision on the level and application of GET support for each area based on its review of
the respective completed management plan and corresponding operating plan. The Bank would
determine each area's eligibility for GET support on the basis of criteria agreed by the government and
the Bank. These criteria (contained in Annex 2) include the existence of adequate land-use
regulations, consistency of the objectives of the management plan with GEF objectives, and the quality
of the management plan (and corresponding operating plan) for the protected area. Detailed
monitoring and evaluation indicators would be developed in the context of each protected area's
'The appraisal mission reviewed emergency plans for the following protected areas from the list of
areas presented in para. 11: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17.



- 5 -
management plan. In determining whether each protected area is in compliance with the agreed
eligibility criteria, the Bank would take into account the views of two technical specialists selected
from a group of thirteen Mexican and non-Mexican technical specialists who, after reviewing the
corresponding documentation and visiting the protected area, would submit independent reports of their
findings and recommendations to the government and the Bank. Considerable progress has already
been made in preparing management plans for eight of the 17 protected areas.
15.   Once the Bank has determined that the protected area meets the basic eligibility criteria for
GET financing (referred to in para. 14), the Bank would evaluate the corresponding operating plan to
determine the appropriate level of GET financing. The Bank would determine the level of GET
support to be allocated to each protected area on the basis of the operating plans and information about
other available sources of financing for the protected area. The operating plans would contain detailed
budgets including both capital and recurrent cost expenditures over a four year period. In determining
the allocation of GET resources to be made to each eligible protected area, the Bank would seek to
maximize the diversity of issues to be addressed under the program, as well as the approaches
employed to address those issues.
16.   In order to prevent a substantial amount of GET resources from being tied up to support the
protected areas program in the event that the government is not able to prepare in a timely manner a
sufficient number of satisfactory management and operating plans, the Bank and the government have
agreed to a formula for canceling a portion of the GET grant based on early implementation
experience. By end-September 1992, the Bank would review the level of GET resources already
committed through approved operating plans received by August 31, 1992, and would cancel from the
GET grant any amount determined by applying the following formula:
(US$25 million) - [(1.5) * (Approved GET financing)f2
In this way, progress in preparing satisfactory management and operating plans by August 31, 1992
would ensure the availability of GET resources of up to US$25 million (i.e. the GET grant net of the
resources needed to prepare management plans, to finance emergency plans, and to support the review
by the independent technical specialists, etc.) for carrying out operating plans once satisfactory
management and operating plans are completed for additional protected areas.
17.   Program ImDlementation. In each of the 12 states where the protected areas are located,
SEDUE would establish a Technical Advisory Council (TAC) that would periodically monitor
implementation experience in the protected areas of the state. Each TAC would include
representatives from local communities, scientific groups, local and state governments, SEDUE's state
delegation, NGOs, and the private sector. In addition to their regular meetings, once a year each TAC
would meet with officials from SEDUE's headquarters in Mexico City and with the independent
technical specialists who prepared the initial reports on the protected areas corresponding to that TAC
(see para. 14). That annual evaluation meeting would review progress in reaching the targets
established at appraisal, and refined for each protected area in the context of preparation of that
2For example, if US$12 million of GET financing is approved by September 30, 1992, then the
amount canceled from the grant would be:
(US$25 million) - [(1.5) * (US$12 million)] = US$7 million



- 6 -
protected area's management plan. In addition, the independent technical specialists would prepare
reports of their findings and conclusions from participating in these meetings, and send them to
SEDUE and the Bank.
18.   Mexican law gives SEDUE the authority and responsibility to manage the country's protected
areas. Within SEDUE, this responsibility is lodged in the General Directorate of Ecological
Conservation of Natural Resources (DGCERN). DGCERN administers protected areas through
SEDUE's state delegations, and through contractual agreements with other governmental agencies or
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including research centers or universities. The proposed
protected areas program would be implemented through this same institutional structure, the
effectiveness and efficiency of which is expected to improve as a result of the institutional
restructuring and strengthening supported under the proposed Environmental Project. The Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) would also be responsible for coordinating implementation of the protected
areas program. BANOBRAS, as financial agent for the GET grant (and borrower of the proposed
Bank loan) would be responsible for preparing statements of expenditure (SOEs) requesting
disbursement from the GET grant, and would retain supporting documentation.
19.    Sustainability. The Mexican approach to biodiversity conservation is to allow the cautious
exploitation of the resources held within its protected areas in a manner and to a degree that does not
jeopardize the viability of the protected area, and at minimum public cost. The resources generated by
well managed eco-tourism in some of the protected areas would help meet a portion of the recurrent
costs of protecting the targeted biodiversity during and beyond the project life. The GET would
finance incremental recurrent costs of the program on a declining basis so that, by the end of the
program (December 1995), all of its recurrent costs (estimated at US$6.8 million annually) would be
fmanced from the federal budget or other sources. By that time, the government expects to be able to
recover up to 75 percent of the recurrent costs of the program from receipts in the protected areas.
20.   Rationale for GEF Funding. Mexico's SINAP contains species and ecosystems of global
importance. Given the urgency to of addressing critical air and water pollution problems, the
government is not able to provide SINAP with the level of resources needed to ensure that this
important biodiversity is protected. In light of heavy development pressures on protected areas, if
management of these areas is not improved and additional resources quickly allocated to protection
activities, the potential near-term losses in species, both in variety and in uniqueness, are vast. The
proposed protected areas program would ensure effective protection and management of up to 17
important protected areas covering 80 percent of SINAP's land area. It would also yield lessons that
could be applicable to other countries. An allocation of US$30 million from the GET is justified
because: (i) the program would allow the testing in several ecosystems of a variety of approaches to
protecting biodiversity in the context of specific challenges to the viability of individual protected
areas; and (ii) the approach to financing (i.e. a time-slice type operation) if found successful, could be
used in other countries where the legal and institutional conditions would permit a flexible project
design and allow the rapid absorption of a relatively large amount of donor resources.
21.    Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was confirmed on the following: (i) the
eligibility criteria for GET financing of protected areas; (ii) the initial composition and terms of
reference of the 13 Mexican and non-Mexican technical specialists. Also, assurances were received
that the government will not change the composition and terms of reference of this group without prior
agreement of the Bank; (iii) the process for preparing and reviewing management and operating plans;
(iv) guidelines for the establishment and functioning of the TACs; (v) timetable for phasing out GET



-7 -
financing of the program's recurrent costs; (vi) the process for review of management and operating
plans and the fonnula for possible cancellation of part of the GET funds by September 30, 1992; (vii)
the criteria and process for the annual review of implementation of the protected areas program (to be
held in the context of the overall review of project implementation), including development of
monitoring and evaluation indicators. Prior to effectiveness, the Loan Agreement for the proposed
Bank loan to BANOBRAS would become effective. Prior to disbursements on each operating plan: (i)
the protected area in question would be detennined by the Bank to be eligible for GET financing; (ii)
the operating plan would be satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) the corresponding TAC would have been
established under arrangements acceptable to the Bank; and (iv) satisfactory contractual arrangements,
as appropriate, for the collaborative management of the protected area would be in place.
22.   Environmental Aspects. The management plan and corresponding operating plan would
constitute an adequate environmental assessment of the activities to be permitted in the protected area.
Since all activities to be carried out under the project would be consistent with the management plan,
whose principal objective is to ensure the protection of the area's biodiversity, no negative
environmental impacts are expected.
23.    Benefits. The main benefit of the proposed program would be to protect up to 17 areas of
global ecological importance. Several of the protected zones are unique in the world and contain
animal species which are globally endangered and whose disappearance would be a loss for the whole
world. The component would also serve to demonstrate the possibility of balancing natural resource
exploitation and conservation, addressing area-specific threats in innovative ways. In addition, the
program is expected to strengthen the institutional and financial capability of the government to protect
its protected areas.
24.   Risks. The major risks are primarily technical and managerial. The technical risk concerns
SEDUE's potential inability to produce management plans deemed satisfactory to protect adequately
the biodiversity contained in the selected area. This risk is mitigated by the existence of GET
resources provided through the Bank to help prepare these plans, the review of these plans by
independent Mexican and non-Mexican technical specialists, and the Bank's close monitoring of the
whole process. This risk is further mitigated by agreement that a portion of the GET grant may be
canceled following a review of implementation progress to take place in September 1992 (para. 16,
above). The managerial risk refers to the potential weakness of Mexican institutions to manage
effectively the protected areas. This risk is acceptable, given Mexico's firm commitment to
biodiversity protection and the substantial strengthening of SEDUE, the major implementing agency,
under the Environmental Project.

INTRODUCllON
In recent decades Mexico has been experiencing accelerated processes of economic
development and settlement of its territory which have been accompanied by significant disruption of
its ecosystems. Soil erosion, deforestation, and similar processes of ecological degradation, as well as
the threatened or actual disappearance of wild species of flora and fauna, have created growing
concem at all national levels.
In order to confront these environmental problems, the government of the Republic has
directed its activities--through the National Development Plan, the National Environmental Protection
Program, and the General Law for Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection--toward dealing
with the country's most serious ecological imbalances.
Given the size and complexity of these ecological problems, solving them will call for well-
ordered and organized participation by the three governmental levels as well as the private and social
sector, supported by the institutional foundation of ecological policy.

I.     MEXICAN POLICY ON PROTECTED NATURAL AREAS
One of the principal challenges of the conservation effort has been the need to integrate the
aspects of protection and sustainable development of natural resources with the economic and
modernization processes necessary to the country's developmenL
In this sense, one of the primary strategies of Mexican environmental policy is the
consolidation of the National System of Protected Natural Areas (SINAP), which seeks to make
conservation of the country's representative ecosystems compatible with the need for rational use of
the country's natural resources, as a basis for sustained development of its communities. At the same
time, each of the protected natural areas incorporated (into the national system) itself becomes a
biological unit for the conservation of biodiversity, as well as an in situ bank of gern plasm.
The National Development Plan establishes a strategy for conservation of the country's
representative ecosystems and their natural resources in the particular case of protected natural areas.
This strategy calls for consolidation of the national system of protected natural areas through the
expansion of programs for the conservation, development, and administration of these areas;
diversification of their resource utilization, as well as rational and sustainable use of these resources
through appropriate techniques and methods of reproduction, propagation, and management; and, at the
same time, the creation of a system for ecological inspection and surveillance.
At the same time, the National Environmental Protection Program calls for the country's
economic evolution to encompass respect for nature, conservation of resources, and preservation of the
environment. One of its principal stated objectives is to ensure the recovery, protection, and
conservation of natural resources and the equilibrium of ecosystems; and the principal strategy it
proposes is to increase the area covered by the National System of Protected Natural Areas, and to
strengthen the capacity for protection and surveillance of the System's component areas.
In March 1988 the General Law for Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection went
into effect. Title 2 of this law has the purpose of legally establishing the categories, declarations, and
organization of protected natural areas. This article of the Law also includes a section on the National
System of Protected Natural Areas, and another on wild flora and fauna.
The important features of the above-cited Law are listed below:
The Law stipulates that the Federation, the states, and the municipalities shall establish
measures to protect natural areas, in such a way as to ensure the preservation and restoration of their
ecosystems, especially those that are most representative (Article 38); and it indicates that the natural
areas in the national territory can come under protection as ecological reserves and be govemed by
restrictions imposed by the competent authorities making these areas subject to only such utilization
and exploitation as are determined to be socially and nationally necessary (Article 44).
The Law considers these areas to be protected natural areas; their establishment is in the public
interest, and they have the following goals (Article 45):



-18--
Annex 1
page 6 of 20
I.     To preserve natural settings that are representative of the different biogeographic and
ecological regions, and the most fragile ecosystems, in order to protect the equilibrium and
continuity of evolutionary and ecological processes.
II.    To safeguard the genetic diversity of wild species on which evolutionary continuity depends,
particularly those that are endemic, endangered, or close to extinction.
III.    To ensure rational utilization of ecosystems and their components.
IV.    To provide an area conducive to scientific research and the study of ecosystems and their
equilibrium.
V.    To generate information and technologies that make possible rational and sustained utilization
as well as preservation of the country's resources.
VI.    To protect settlements, communication routes, industrial installations, and areas of agricultural
development by establishing forest zones in mountains that are flood sources or working with
the hydrological cycle in basins, or by using any other approaches that help to protect the
surrounding elements which an area is ecologically linked with.
VII.   To protect the natural surroundings of areas that contain archaeological, historical, and artistic
monuments and remains of importance to the national culture and identity.
In order to encompass the full range of conditions, environments, and situations, SINAP
includes nine categories of protected natural areas:
1. Biosphere reserves;
2. Special biosphere reserves;
3. National parks;
4. Natural monuments;
5. National marine parks;
6. Areas for the protection of natural resources;
7. Areas for the protection of flora and fauna;
8. Urban parks;
9. Zones subject to ecological conservation.
The areas included under sections 1-7 are considered to fall within the domain of the
Federation; in other words, they are to be established and administered by the federal government
Those included under items 8 and 9 are to be local in nature, as are any that are so designated
according the corresponding state or municipal provisions (Article 46).
In addition, when it comes to establishing, administering, and developing protected natural
areas, local communities are considered to play a fundamental role in measures to protect the
ecosystems, through their participation in various programs for the protection, caretaking, and recovery
of resources.

page 7 of 20
The protected natural areas that are considered to fall within federal domain as a whole make
up the National System of Protected Natural Areas (SINAP), as stipulated in Article 76.
At present, the system is composed of 44 national parks, 8 biosphere reserves, 13 special
biosphere reserves, 1 area for the protection of wild flora and fauna, and 1 Natural Monument.
These areas are listed below:

In addition, among its other objectives SINAP aims to enforce the provisions of the General
Law for Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection with reference to protected natural areas in
order to preserve the natural heritage of the nation, coordinate with the appropriate provisions of the
federal public administration in the areas under its jurisdiction, and coordinate with social and private
groups regarding specialized measures oriented around the goals which the natural areas in the national
system have been established to achieve.
Articles 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, and 56 of this same Law define and categorize
protected natural areas, emphasizing the procedures and requirements they should all have with regard
to biological importance, surface area, and the use and allocation of natural resources, among others.
Finally, in order to comply with the provisions and policies of the legislation in force, the
management of protected areas is planned through the preparation of management plans. Such plans
are categorized in the above-cited Law and serve as planning instruments that give the basic outlines
of what needs to be done in order to achieve the implicit objectives behind the establishment of a
natural protected area: preserving biodiversity and banks of germ plasm, and at the same time
promoting comprehensive community development.
II.    MANAGEMENT PLANS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF MEXICAN POLICY ON PROTECTED
NATURAL AREAS
In line with the policies of the National Development Plan, the National Environmental
Protection Program, and the General Law for Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection, the
preparation of management plans is a fundamental stage of the planning process for protected natural
areas that are part of SINAP. These plans incorporate the programming of activities directed toward
the protection, conservation, and promotion of biodiversity and in situ banks of germ plasm; intra- and
inter-institutional coordination; and integration of the public, social, and private sectors into the
processes of conservation and rational utilization of the natural resources in these areas.
In this sense, management plans serve as a planning tool which uses knowledge about the
problems of a protected natural area, as well as information about its natural resources and how they
are used, as a basis for proposals on the organization, classification, and coordination of measures that
will make it possible to achieve the objectives and targets established for that area. A management
plan is thus seen as a dynamic and flexible tool which is capable of gathering feedback and adapting
in accordance with the management policies and standards issued for that purpose, and which always



-22-                                 Annex 1
page 10 of 20
acknowledges the importance of fulfilling the objectives that the protected natural area was established
to achieve.
In this context, Article 65 of the General Law for Ecological Balance and Environmental
Protection stipulates that the agency or agencies of the federal executive branch who propose that a
protected natural area be established under federal jurisdiction (in this case, SEDUE) shall prepare the
management plan for that area, with the participation, as applicable, of any other competent agencies
and local authorities, within the stated time period in the corresponding declaration.
In Article 68, the above-cited Law indicates that the management plan for a reserve must
contain at least the following elements:
1.     A description of the area's physical, biological, social, and cultural features, in the
national, regional, and local context;
2.     The short-, medium-, and long-term actions to be taken, and how they are linked to the
National System for Democratic Planning. These actions will encompass research,
resource utilization, expansion, distribution, operation, coordination, follow-up, and
control;
3.    The specific objectives of the reserve; and
4.     The technical standards that apply, where appropriate, to the exploitation of flora and
fauna, as well as to sanitary, crop-related, and domestic cuttings, or any whose aim is
to prevent contamination of the soil and water.
III.    THE CONTENTS OF A MANAGEMENT PLAN
The following is a description of the principal components of a management plan. It should
be noted that, since national parks and reserves have distinct management objectives, the management
plans for these areas will contain some differences as well. It is therefore noted in the text when
differences between these two types of areas occur.
1.    INTRODUCTION
1.1    Preliminary Information
The geographical location of the area is discussed in both physical and geopolitical terms,
including access routes and the area it occupies. There is also a brief description of the
general characteristics of the locale, which provides the rationale behind its conservation,
management, and sustainable development, along with an explanation of its importance in the
intemational, national, and regional context.

page 11 of 20
1.2    Background
This is a brief description of the area which reviews the infonnation available, the legal
aspects, previous conservation efforts, the current situation, and any general issues.
2.     OBJECTIVES
The general and specific objectives of the management plan are listed.
3.     ASSESSMENT
This section describes the area's physical, biotic, socioeconomic, and cultural features, as well
as its problems.
3.1    Physical Characteristics
a) Physiography and topography
The area is put into context according to its physiographical region and province,
based on the classification system developed by J. Rzeclowski (1983). There is also a
list of such topographical features as ravines, rises, valleys, gullies, etc., in addition to
the names of its main formations, with maps and charts to back up all this information.
b) Geology
The area is classified in terms of its geological roots and evolution, with emphasis on
its most important characteristics (volcanic activity, faults, types of rock, etc.)
c) Edaphology
Based on the FAO soil classification system, the specific features of each area are
listed, providing a profile of soil types.
d) Hydrology
The hydrological basins found in each protected area are looked at from a hydrological
viewpoint, including the principal streams, rivers, bodies of water, etc.
e) Climatology
The area is classified from a climatological perspective based on Koppen's
classification system, as modified by Garcfa E. (1981). Infornation is also included
on the closest meteorological season(s), if any.
The climate data that can be classified includes average monthly temperatures, monthly
rainfall, relative humidity, and the hottest and wettest months during the year.

page 12 of 20
3.2    Biotic Characteristics
a) Flora
The area is classified in terms of its prevailing types of vegetation and their most
important associations, with a description of the representative species in each one, as
well as any species that are endemic, close to extinction, rare, or endangered.
b) Fauna
In this section, the area is classified in temis of its fauna, with a description of the
most important vertebrate or invertebrate species, how they are associated with
ecological units and habitats, and which species are endemic, rare, endangered, or
close to extinction.
3.3    Socioeconomic Characteristics
This aspect involves an examination of the socioeconomic conditions of the
communities present in the area or its zone of influence, and of how these
communities use its natural resources. Particular attention is paid to the following:
Property rights
Current soil use
Here, using supplementary information from the draft Land Tenancy Law under
preparation by the Secretariat, current land uses are indicated (for agriculture, livestock
raising, hunting, mining, tourism, and other purposes), along with information on land
regulation.
3.4    Cultural Characteristics
The protected natural area is classified based on the presence of any archaeological
remains of historic or cultural importance. This includes their state of preservation,
importance, etc., as well as the historical or cultural significance of the area where they
are found.
3.5    Rationale
Here the value and potential uses of both national parks and reserves are specified
according to the criteria in the following paragraphs:



-25-                                Annex 1
page 13 of 20
a) ecological importance
The biological importance of the area is described in terms of the diversity of its
biological components, ecosystems, and genetic material or its genetic diversity; the
representativity of its existing ecosystems; the degree of preservation of those
ecosystems; the preservation of germ plasm because of the presence of species that are
endemic, rare, endangered, close to extinction, or of particular interest; and the features
and break-down of the area's plant substratum.
b) historical and cultural importance (if any)
c) scientific, educational, and recreational importance
In this category, the area is looked at in terms of its value as an area for research on
the ecosystems and their components; for recreational purposes; and for the
development of environmental education plans. At the same time, the area's social
impact is pointed out with regard to the potential number of visitors, the creation of
jobs, etc.
3.6   Issues
Based on the rationale and assessment, in this category the problems, limitations, and
restrictions that hinder conservation in the area are described, along with any obstacles
to the utilization of area resources.
4.    INVESTMENT PROGRAM OR ANNUAL OPERATING PROGRAM
This category details the short-, medium-, and long-term (six-year) investment program needed
in order to carry out the measures stipulated in the management plan for the protected natural
area, in complete correspondence with its horizontal and vertical breakdown and
subcomponents.
5.    SUBCOMPONENTS OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR A PROTECTED NATURAL

Secretariat of Urban Developmentand Ecology
Subsecretariat of Ecology
Mexico City, 3. Feb. 1992
Mr. Rainer B. Steckhan,
Director
Country Department II
Latin America and the Caribbean
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
I am sending you the following pages in order to clarify certain points with respect to the document
"Protected Natural Areas of Mexico, Legislation and Management Plans," which was sent to you on 2
December 1992.
This letter will help to give you a better understanding of that paper discussing Mexican policy on
protected natural areas.
A.    LOCAL COMMUNITES
When the management plan for each area is being prepared, the local communities will
participate and be consulted during the analysis of socioeconomic and cultural concerns of importance
to the plan, and will also help to identify the specific coordination strategies and measures required in
order to implement the management plan for the area in question.
At this stage, it is inadvisable to establish any partial commitments with the communities
residing in the area, beyond those that have already been mentioned. This is to ensure that the
coordination that goes on reflects the overall perspective of the actual management plan once it has
been defined, and that, at the same time, the national strategy of coordination brigades is used, as
described in the policy paper under Section 5.4.2.
Once the management plan has been set up, more formal coordination can be implemented,
along with any improvements that appear necessary in light of the experience gained during this
coordination process. This will also help to ensure that the management plan remains a dynamic one.
B.    CURRENT DELIMITATION OF PROTECTED NATURAL AREAS
Although the process of formulating management plans will yield useful information for
updating the current boundaries of natural protected areas and defining their surface area, any
prospective changes must result from the overall perspective of the National System of Protected
Natural Areas, and must at the same time take into account the possibility of integrating biological
corridors.



-31-                             Annex 1
page 19 of 20
As a result, this aspect needs to be approached in a systematic and integrated fashion, based on
national priorities and the findings of study projects incorporated into the Enviromnental Sectoral
Credit which deal with the restructuring of SINAP and the creation of biological corridors.
C.    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDIES
Here I would like to discuss the procedure for evaluating the potential environmental impact of
any basic infrastructure that might be established in Mexico's protected natural areas as part of the
GEF project in Mexico--such as surveillance booths, administrative buildings, seedbeds, breeding sites,
guided trails, etc.--and which is meant to be used in the management and administration of protected
natural areas and the biodiversity they contain.
On this subject, I would like to point out to you that a management plan is in and of itself a
national instrument for ecological organization and the evaluation of any potential environmental
impact that might result from works or activities for the management, conservation, and exploitation of
the natural resources that make up the biodiversity of a protected natural area.
At the same time, I would like to inform you that the General Directorate of Ecological
Conservation of Natural Resources--a division of the Subsecretariat which is under my charge--is the
unit responsible for evaluating management plans and the works, activities, and measures that are
planned as part of them, as well as for setting technical criteria and standards aimed at mitigating their
potential impact on the environment.
D.    TRAINING FOR PERSONNEL IN PROTECTED NATURAL AREAS
Personnel training is unquestionably an extremely important aspect of the management of
protected natural areas, and constitutes a comprehensive program for aU the areas in the system.
However, we feel that it is inappropriate and economically wasteful to have various, unconnected
programs in the different areas. For this reason, the Subsecretariat has a general program to cover the
training needs of all the areas.
In fact, this program is based on the availability of highly trained personnel, some coming
from central offices and others from the delegations, who have broad experience, on the one hand, and
who have in addition attended courses for refresher training provided through international programs.
These include the course on reserves which has been organized each year in conjunction with US-
FWS, DUMAC, the Technological Institute of Monterrey, and specialized North American
organizations. There is a similar meeting on park management in which the US-NPS, WWF, and the
Antonio Narro Autonomous University take part. The program has been repeated for five years. The
corresponding General Directorate has 18 persons who have participated in this event. Recently
specific training in fire management has been included. These trained personnel serve in turn as
training monitors for the remaining staff. We do not feel that this process should be broken down area
by area and incorporated into the management plans.

E.    INDICATORS FOR EVALUATION
The indicators for evaluation that apply to all the areas have been reported to the Bank under
separate cover.
The specific indicators for each area need to be determined in light of its definitive
management plan, and based on the opinion of the technical advisory council that is associated with
that specific area. They also need to be flexible so that they can be modified as part of the
implementation prcess. The Bank already has a foundation in this area.
In the hope that the Bank finds these details useful for its purposes, I remain,
Yours Sincerely,

Eligibility Criteria For Supportinz Protected Areas
1.   Each of the 17 areas selected for biodiversity protection would have to meet all of the following
criteria to be eligible for financing from the Global Environment Trust Fund (GET) under the
Environmental Project:
(A)   Non-availability of altemative funding for the activities proposed in the operating plan;
(B)   In accordance with Article 98 of the General Ecology Law, the management and
operating plans should ensure that: (i) pennitted land uses are compatible with the
specific characteristics of the soils affected and should not alter the equilibrium of the
protected area's ecosystems; (ii) permitted land uses should maintain the physical
integrity and the productive capacity of the soils of the protected area; and (iii)
permitted productive activities should avoid practices that would lead to erosion,
degradation, or modification of the topographic characteristics of the protected area
with consequent adverse environmental effects.
(C)   The area's management plan should have as a principal objective the
protection of Mexican biological diversity of global importance, with the
pursuit of sustainable development to the extent compatible with the
conservation of that biological diversity.
(D)   Preparation of management plans should be consistent with the strategy and
description of management plans contained in the document "Areas Naturales
Protegidas de Mexico: Legislacion y Programas de Manejo" (attached to this
memorandum as Annex 1).
2.   If a selected area meets the criteria listed above, the Bank will evaluate the corresponding
operating plan to determine the appropriate level of financing from the GET. Each operating plan
would set out the specific activities or investments required to implement the programs in the
management plan (including monitoring and evaluation activities). It would provide for the phasing in
of physical investments and investments in required staff so as to ensure the maximum effectiveness of
these staff. Each operating plan would also describe other activities financed from other sources that
contribute to achieving the objectives of the management plan. Finally, the operating plan would
contain cost estimates of all activities and investments to be financed under the protected areas
program.
