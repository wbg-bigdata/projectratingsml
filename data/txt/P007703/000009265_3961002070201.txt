MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIREC"ORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS PUBLICOS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR AN ENVIRONMETAL PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos (BANOBRAS) with the guarantee of the United
Mexican States for the equivalent of US$50 million to help finance the first phase of the Government of
Mexico's Environmezftal Program. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable rate, with a
maturity of 15 years, includixg 5 yaars of grace.
2.        Country/Sector Background. Over 70 percent of all Mexicans living in urban areas. About
half of the labor force lives in the three largest cities (Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey), and
almost a quarter of the country's industrial establishments are located in these cities. This concentration
of population and industry has led to serious problems of air, water and soil pollution. There are high
concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, fine particulates, sulfur dioxide and lead in the air of Mexico
City, as well as in most of the country's large and medium-sized cities, which pose a significant health
hazard to a wide cross-section of the population. Water is relatively scarce in much of the country; only
15 percent of surface waters are above the elevation of 500 meters where 75 percent of the population
live and where 80 percent of industrial plants are 'ocated. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that much
of the country's surface water is polluted with municipal, industrial or agricultural waste. Only two-
thirds of the urban population are connected to a sewer system. Because of inadequate sanitation,
waterborne diseases are still the number one cause of infant mortality in Mexico. The country also
suffers from environmental problems in the rural areas. Some 80 percent of Mexico's land has been
eroded to some degree; severe erosion now affects more than 40 percent of the territory. An
environmental issue of global concern is the fact that the country's diverse biological resources are under
increasing threat as natural habitats are converted to agricultural uses and cattle ranching. Only one-third
of the country remains under forest, and only 25 percent of the forest lands are considered "intact"
biologically. Similarly, although wildlife trade is strictly regulated by Mexican law, Mexico is one of
Latin America's largest exporters of wildlife, as regulations are only weakly enforced.
3.        The country's severe environmental problems are the result of several factors. In the past,
Mexico encouraged industrialization often without prior assessment of its potential enviromnental costs.
Price subsidies to consumers of water, electricity, petroleum and gas stimulated excess demand and
resulted in inefficient resource use. Also, past government agricultural policy both tended to induce
migration from the rural areas into a few major urban areas and supported colonization programs and
credit subsidies for cattle ranching (which contributed to deforestation and conversion to pasture of large
tracts of land). Consistent with the government's policy of opening the economy and reducing the
intervention of the public sector in the economy, many distortionary policies and environmentally
dianaging programs have now been eliminated.
4.       In 1982, the government created the Secretariat for Urban Development and Ecology
(SEDUE), consolidating in a single agency most of the environmental protection responsibilities which
had previously been dispersed in several federal agencies. SEDUE is responsible for regulating air and
water quality, ensuring that public and private sector investments meet established enviromnental criteria,



-2-
and managing federal protected areas. As the government experienced a severe budgetary crunch and
implemented strong measures to stabilize the economy in the mid-1980s, resources available to SEDUE's
Sub-secretariat for Ecology (SEDUE/SE) fell dramatically, limiting severely its effectiveness in carrying
out its functions. SEDUE/SE's investment budget in 1990, although slighdy higher than the 1989 budget
(the agency's low point), was only 60 percent of its 1986 level in real terms. As a result of the shrinkage
in SEDUE's budget, SEDUEJSE's staff was cut in half, and, with the salaries of all but the top levels
significantly below salaries in the private sector, many of the most qualified staff left. A small core of
highly qualified, experienced and motivated staff have remained in top positions, but the bulk of
SEDUE/SE's staff is relatively inexperienced and has tended to treat the agency as on-the-job training on
their way to more lucrative private sector employment. By the end of 1990, the government began to
take firm measures to strengthen the agency. SEDUElSE's 1991 budget was triple in real terms the 1990
level, and the top levels of government have emphasized the need to ensure a strong federal institutional
capacity for environmental protection and natural resources management, and to reshape and strengthen
SEDUE/SE to play a leadership role in this area.
5.        Mexico's environmental legislation is far ahead of that of most developing countries. Article
27 of the Mexican Constitution estahlishes the obligation of the federal government to conserve the
nation's natural resources and to preserve and restore ecological equilibrium in the public interest.
Article 73 gives the Congress the authority to promulgate laws defining the respective roles of the federal,
state and local levels of government in environmental protection. Exercising this constitutional authority,
the Congress passed the Ley General del Eguilibrio Ecoloeico y la Proteccion al Ambiente (General
Ecology Law) which went into effect in March 1988. It contains rules which define ecological planning
and zoning, environmental impact studies, restoration of degraded ecosystems, protection of natural areas
and plant and animal life, sound exploitation of natural resources, and pollution prevention and control.
The law contains the framework for ensuring a more sensitive and sustainable development pattern in
Mexico through improved intersectoral cooperation, increased social participation, and the creation of
strog new environmental standards. The law also defines protected areas in Mexico, and provides the
basis for sound management of protected areas by govermnent in close coordination with society-at-large.
Finally, the law defines clearly the respective responsibilities of the various levels of government with
regard to environmental protection and natural resources -management. It sets the stage for the
decentralization of many enforcement responsibilities to the states and municipalities, while reserving
critical functions for the federal government. Some implementing regulations and standards, however,
stil remain to be issued. The institutional framework envisioned under the law would gradually free
SEDUE/SE from many direct enforcement responsibilities and allow SEDUE/SE to provide training and
technical assistance to state environmental agencies, and to coordinate the efforts of state and federal
agencies. To date, 27 of Mexico's 31 states have passed environmental legislation. Eventually, this
decentralized approach should provide a broader base for enforcement and public involvement, but in the
short term investments in institutional development at the central and state levels of government, and
further reform and fine tuning of the policy and regulatory framework and of state legislation are
required.
6.       In early 1990, SEDUE pubiished the 'National Program for Environmental Protection: 1990-
1994." This program is intended to orient the efforts of tne federal government and social groups in
environmental protection. Key emphases of the program are: (i) decentralization of environmental
control authority to state and municipal levels of government; (ii) ecological planning and zoning,
including appropriate designation of wildlands as protected natural areas; (iii) use of the "Polluter Pays
Principle" to ensure that development decisions internalize associated environmental costs, and to help
defray the cost of environmental management; and (iv) improved interagency coordination. The



-3 -
government further clarified intentions regarding the role of SEDUE/SE in a letter to the Bank dated
January 31, 1992 describing the transformation of SEDUE/SE into a second-tier institution- an
insftiution that coordinates and supervises the front-line monitoring and enforcement actions of other
federal and state entities, and of the private sector.
7.       Project Objectives. The overall objective of the proposed project would be to support the
government's ability to carry out key environmental protection and natural resource management
functions in the short term and at the samne time to strengthen the institutional and policy framework to
enable the govermnent to carry out these functions in a more efficient and decentralized manner in the
future. The project would support the government's strategy of transforming SEDUE/SE over time into a
second-tier institution as described in the government's letter to the Bank (para. 6).
8.       Project Description. The project would finance the first phase of the government's
environmental program concentrating on key fuictions of SEDUE/SE and setting the stage for a more
decentralized approach. It would also finance activities and studies to support preparation of a second
phase which would focus on state-level environmental agencies, building on the experience of the first
phase. The first phase would have three components. Componej I would finance key environmental
services, namely monitoring and controlling water and air pollution (29% of total costs), minimizing
potential negative environmental impacts of public and private sector investment projects (11%) and
conserving biodiversity (44%). Component II would strengthen sector management and administration,
through institutional strengthening of SEDUE/SE (4%), a pilot decentralization program with five states
(5%), and the commissioning of special studies to explore the use of economic instruments to complement
the current heavily command and control approach to environmental management (1%). Component m
would support the strengthening of the regulatory framework through the preparatior. of additional
technical standards for pollution control and natural resource protection (3%). Preparation for the second
phase of the government's sectoral program would involve carrying out four pre-investment studies and
finacing the activities of a coordinating unit reporting to SEDUE/SE to prepare the program (3%).
9.       The total project cost is estimated at US$126.6 million equivalent, including taxes and duties
(estimated at US$ 13.0 million) with a foreign exchange component of US$ 11.8 million (9.3 percent). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The protected areas program
(US$38.6 million; or 70 percent of the biodiversity conservation sub-component) would be financed in
part by a grant from the Global Environment Trust Fund (GET). Approval for GET financing will be
sought from the Regional Vice President, LAC Region on the basis of the attached Memorandum and
Recommendation of the Director of the LAC Country Department II for a GET grant of SDR 21.4
million (US$30 million) for a Protected Areas Program (Report No. 10358-ME). Approval of the GET
grant would be subject to the approval by the Executive Directors of the Bank loan proposed in this
memorandum. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement of the proposed Bank loan and
GET grant, and the disbursement schedule for the Bank loan are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive
financing from the Bank loan of up to US$5 million would be granted for eligible expenditures incurred
after Maruch 1, 1991. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps (IBRD - 23195 and IBRD
- 23536) are also attached, as is the Staff Appraisal Report No. 10005-ME, dated March 3, 1992.
10.      Proiect Implementation. BANOBRAS would be the borrower and administrator of the loan,
and the administrator of the GET grant. The loan and grant proceeds would be disbursed over a four
year period. Components I (including the protected areas program) and m of the project, and two of the
pre-investment studies for phase II of the project, would be implemented by SEDUE's general



-4-
directorates in the central offices and by SEDUE's state delegations. Component II would be executed by
SEDUE's Coordinating Unit of Advisors to the Under-secretary for Ecology, with a series of studies on
the use of economic instruments for environmental management being carried out under the direction of
an inter-secretarial task fo.ce comprised of high level representatives from the Secretariat of Finance and
Public Credit (SHCP) and from SEDUE. The third pre-investment study (on environmental impacts on
human health) would involve participation by the Secretariat for Health, and the fourth pre-investment
study (on future scenarios of near-term environmental decisions) would involve participation by the
National Ecology Commission (CONADE). O rall authority for project management would be vested in
SEDUE/SE, which would be assisted in project management by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
located in CONADE.
11.      Project Sustainability. The proposed project supports several activities which are intended to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the government's environmental protection and natural
resource management functions beyond the project period. By supporting the transformation of
SEDUE/SE into a second-tier institution, and testing tne decentralization of environmental protection
functions in up to five states, the project would contribute to a more rational and sustainable distribution
of responsibilities for environmental management. In addition, the project would assist the government in
introducing economic instruments to achieve environmental goals. Finally, the protected areas program,
which would seek to manage resource exploitation of Mexico's protected areas in a manner tMat would
not jeopardize the biological diversity contained in those areas, is expected to result in additional
resources required for the conservation of protected areas (e.g. through visitors' receipts, etc.).
12.      Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. A recent review of supervision
experience with several Bank-financed projects in Mexico with environmental components identified three
major implementation difficulties: (i) low remuneration and high turnover of SEDUE/SE staff have made
it difficult for SEDUE to set and enforce technical standards effectively; (ii) inter-institutional
coordination has been limited, reducing the effectiveness of the government's efforts to protect the
environment; and (iii) chronic delays in the provision of counterpart funds for environmental components
of Bank-financed projects have hampered project implementation. The proposed project addresses these
difficulties by: (i) supporting a strategy of transforming SEDUE/SE's staff into a cadre of qualified,
experienced and motivated environmental managers, as articulated in a letter to the Bank from the
Government of Mexico (para. 6); (ii) supporting the establishment of a single national water quality
monitoring network, and harmonization of sample collection and analysis methodologies by SEDUE/SE
and the National Water Commission (CNA, reporting to the Secretary of the Secretariat of Agriculture
and Hydraulic Resources, SARH) and development of a single data base of water quality indicators, all
underpinned by a coordination agreement signed by the respective Secretaries of SEDUE and SARH; and
(iii) requiring the allocation of adequate counterpart funds for FY92 as a condition of loan effectiveness,
and reviewing the adequacy of government provision of counterpart funds in the context of formal annual
project implementation reviews.
13.      A general lesson from other investment projects with relatively weak institutions is the
advisability of focusing efforts on a few line ministries. This simplifies implementation arrangements and
Bank supervision, allowing the government and the Bank to place greater emphasis on technical rat}er
than procedural issues. It also increases accountability within the government for progress on project
implementation. Another lesson is the need to specify specific outputs that allow the government and the
Bank to assess periodically the degree to which the project is achieving its stated goals. By holding
periodic reviews on progress in achieving the expected outputs, the government and the Bank have the
opportuni:y to agree on any necessary modifications in project design at an early date. The proposed



-.5-
project design incorporates both of these lessons.
14.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's assistance program for Mexico is designed to
support the recovery of economic growth, and places special emphasis on strengthening the social sectors
and on protecting the environment. Within the environmental sector, the focus is on efforts to improve
resource use and productivity, as well as to ensure that policy analysis evaluaces the social costs
(including environmental impacts) of potential investments and policies. Given the weaknesses of the
environmental sector, Bank assistance is needed to catalyze institutional and regulatory reform and
strengthening, and policy development in such areas as the efficient use of regulation and the application
of the polluter pays principle. The proposed project would complement on-going and proposed projects
in agriculture, infrastructure and mining that rely on an adequate institutional set-up in the environmental
sector to ensure compliance with existing environmental norms. It we .-' also complement environmental
components of: (i) the Forestry Development project (Ln. 3115-ME); (ii) the Water and Sanitation Sector
project (Ln. 3271-ME); (iii) the Decentralization and Regional Development project (Ln. 3310-ME); (iv)
the Mining Sector Restructuring project (Ln. 3359-ME); and (v) the Irrigation and Drainage Sector
project (Ln. 3419-ME). A proposed Transport Air Pollution project (FY92) in the Mexico City
Metropolitan Area would assist Mexico in reducing air pollution from mobile sources in the metropolitan
area. A proposed Agricultural Technology Project (FY92) would support the efforts of the extension
service to stem on-farm soil erosion. In addition, a work program and projects aimed at phasing out the
use of ozone depleting substances are at an advanced stage of preparation. They would be financed on
concessional terms under the provisions of the Montreal Protocol.
15.       GET support for the protected areas program is iusti'ied because: (i) the urgency of the
threats to Mexican biodiversity of global importance req1uires prompt attention which would not be
financed by other sources; (ii) the program would allow the testing in several ecosystems of a variety of
approaches to protecting biodiversity in the context of specific challenges to the viability of individual
protected areas; and (iii) the approach to financing (i.e. a modified time-slice operation) if found
successful, could be used in other countries where the legal and institutional conditions would permit the
absorption of a relatively large amount of donor resources.
16.       Agreed Actions. At negtations, agreement was reached: (i) on the text of a letter from the
government outlining the strategy for transforming SEDUE/SE into a second-tier institution, progress
toward which would be discussed at each of the annual evaluation meetings; (ii) on the timetable for the
initiation, completion and discussion with the Bank of studies to be carried out under the project; (iii) that
no modifications will be made to the coordination agreement between SEDUE and SARH without the
prior agreement of the Bank; (iv) on the dates by which SEDUE will transfer authority to SEDUE's state
delegations to review environmental impact assessments in agreed sub-sectors and to monitor compliance
with established mitigation plans; (v) on the staffing and training requirements of SEDUE's central offices
and state delegations for reviewing environmental impact assessments; (vi) that new procedures,
satisfactory to the Bank, to facilitate public access to and comment on environmental impact assessments
would be published by December 31, 1992; (vii) regarding ecological planning and zoning, that
SEDUE/SE will publish in SEDUE's Gaceta Ecologica (Ecological Journal) a summary of the ecological
planning and zoning criteria resulting from the exercises carried out under the project, and that the
government shall make operational by June 30, 1992, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, a geographic
information system (GIS) to store the results of these exercises; (viii) regarding the institutional analysis
of SEDUE/SE, that: (a) by July 31, 1992, the government will submit to the Bank for its
recommendations and comment the reports of the consultants carrying out the institutional analysis, (b) on
the basis of the consultants' reports and recommendations, and taking into account the Bank's



-6 -
recommendations and comments, the government would reorganize SEDUE according to an action
program acceptable to the Bank to be prepared by December 31, 1992; and (c) the action plan would
include staffing and budgeting targets to cafry out SEDUE's mandate; (ix) regarding the decentralization
pilot program, that one additional state could be se:ected by the Government and the Bank at the first
annual evaluation meeting, and up to two more at the second annual evaluation meeting based on agreed
criteria; (x) regarding the studies on economic instruments for environmental management: (a) on the
structure and composition of the inter-secretarial task force and its responsiUilities; (b) on the timetable
for contracting the consultants to carry out the studies in the first year; (c) on the mechanism to agree on
the terms of reference of any research and policy work to be carried out in subsequent years; (d) that the
govermnent will submit to the Bank by June 30, 1993 the reports of the consultants carrying out these
studies and allow the Bank one month to comment on the ryorts; and (e) that the inter-secretarial task
force shall take the Bank's comments into account and will ibsue by November 30, 1993 its report on the
results of the studies on economic instruments and envirounmental management and its policy
recommendations and proposed plans of action; (xi) on the timetable for issuing the ecological standards
to be prepared under the p :oject; (xii) that the government would maintain the PCU and continue to staff
it with individuals with exporictIce and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank; (xiii) regarding monitoring
and evaluation, that: (a) the government will hold quarterly evaluation meetings each February, May,
August and November; (b) the Bank would have the opportunity to comment on he agenda prior each
meeting, and will feceive the Bank the minutes of each meeting promptly after the meeting takes place;
and (c) the February meeting shall be designated an annual evaluation meeting and shall include the
participation of the Bank; (xiv) that the annual evaluation meeting will: (a) be based on the results of
project monitoring contained in the minutes of the November quarterly meeting (and based on the
implementation targets and goals agreed at appraisal); (b) pros Me an opportunity for the government and
the Bank to discuss key project issues; and (c) conclude with agreement on an annual plan of action,
including specific goals and projections for project implementation for the calendar year during which the
annual review is held; and (xv) that the government and BANOBRAS would have project records and
accounts audited each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and furnish to the Bank
as soon as possible, but in any case no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, a certified
copy of the agreed audit reports. Prior to loan effectiveness, the government will: (i) demonstrate that
adequate funds have been allocated in the federal budget fok project implementation in 1992; (ii) enter
into contractual arrangement satisfactory to the Bank for the transfer of the proceeds of the loan and the
GET grant from IANOBRAS (as financial agent) to the government; and (iii) issue and make effective
the water pollution prevention and control regulation under the General Ecology Law. Conditions of
disbursement would be, for: (i) each environmental laboratory, the preparation of architectural and
engineering plans acceptable to the Bank; (ii) action programs in each state participating in the
decentralization pilot program: (a) agreement between SEDUE/SE and the Bank on the detailed action
plan for that state; and (b) an operating agreement acceptable to the Bank and signed by the SEDUE/SE
and the state government; and (iii) purchase of satellite imagery to monitor compliance with ecological
planning and zoning criteria, adoption of such criteria by the government.
17.      Environmental Aspects. The proposed project (rated "C") is designed to strengthen the
capability of the Government of Mexico to manage the country's natural resources and to protect the
environment. No adverse environmental impacts are expected.
18.      Proect Benefits. Mexico's environmental problems are grave. The country can benefit from
investment in establishing an adequate institutional and policy framework for systematically addressing
these problems. The key functions component would result in reduced air and water pollution, systematic
evaluation of potential negative environmental effects of public and private sector investments and design



of mitigating activities, and protection of Mexicp's endemic sand endangered species. 'he sector
management component would result in advances in strengthening management within the federal
environmental agency, experience in strengthening states' abilities to carry out front-line environmental
protection functions, and economnic analysis and policy to complement the current command and control
approach.
19.      Rislk. By the time of the closing date, the proposed project is expected to increase the
recurrent costs of SEDUE/SE by about 30 percent above the current level. However, SEDUE/SE's 1991
budget accounts for less than 0Q2 percent of the total federal budget, and this increase should be fully
within its absorptive capacity if the government's current strong political commitment to environmental
improvements is maintained. Two potential risks are: (i) a decline in the govermment's resolve to
strengthen SEDIUE and to address aggressively enviromnental problems; and (ii) inability to establish a
policy framework that would enhance sufficiently SEDUE's ability to sustain increased recurrent costs.
Given the government's strong commitment to improving the environment, and the policies expected to be
developed by the inter-secretarial Task Force on Modernization of Environmental Management and
provisions under the project for monitoring the adequacy of the budget, these risks are considered to be
acceptable.
20.      Recommedatiin. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
