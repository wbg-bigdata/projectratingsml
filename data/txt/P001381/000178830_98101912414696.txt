STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Lesotho, a small mountainous country in southeastern Africa
(30,350 sq km), is completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa
(RSA) including the homeland of Transkei, on which it relies for external
communications (see Map). Altitudes range from about 1,500 m in the western
lowlands to almost 3,900 m in the eastern mountain areas. The country's
rugged topography presents a major obstacle to construction of transport
infrastructure. The climate varies considerably within the country; the
temperature is highest in the lowlands with the majority of the rainfall
occurring during the summer months; in the mountains there are regular night
frosts and frequent snowfalls in winter.
1.02      The population was estimated to be about 1.3 million in 1977, and
to be growing at about 2.2% per annum. As a result of the country's low
level of economic development and the relatively high wages paid in RSA,
about 165,000 Basotho are employed in RSA, while only about 32,000 of the
total work force (about 6%) is in wage employment in Lesotho. This situa-
tion renders the country extremely vulnerable to economic and political
conditions in the RSA. About 80% of the population live in the western
lowlands and foothills and in the Orange River valley, although these areas
comprise only about 40% of the land area. The remaining population live
in the eastern mountain region. Most of the country's social and economic
infrastructure has also been concentrated in the western lowlands, reflect-
ing the area's higher population and level of economic activity.
1.03      Per capita GNP was about US$230 in 1977.  Agriculture is the main
economic activity of 90% of the resident population and accounted for about
41% of GDP in 1976/77; the services sector contributed a further 49% to GDP,
and manufacturing, mining and construction provided the balance. Crop produc-
tion is primarily for subsistence while wool and mohair constitute the main
exports. Except for diamond mining operations which started in 1977, no
major mineral resources are being exploited nor have any been identified; the
country's future development must therefore be largely based on agricultural
production. Remittances from Basotho working in the mines and elsewhere in
RSA are substantial, with the result that GNP is about 60% higher than GDP.
1.04      Although development efforts in the past have been concentrated
on improving crop production in the lowlands and foothills, Government is
now heavily committed to the following goals:



- 2 -
(a)  reduction of its economic dependence on the RSA by
increasing domestic output and promoting domestic
employment;
(b)  development of agriculture especially in the mountain
regions;
(c)  development of the country's water resources; and
(d)  development of the country's potential for tourism.
Toward these objectives, Government has set up a Labor-Intensive Construction
Unit (LCU) under the Bank Group's Second Highway Project to help increase
domestic employment opportunities (see para 1.14). The agricultural sector
is being aided by a Mountain Area Agricultural Development Project financed
by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and by various other
agricultural and agro-industrial projects now under preparation or implemen-
tation. Government is also searching for suitable projects to exploit the
touristic potential of the country.
B. The Transport System
1.05      Lesotho depends almost exclusively on road and air transport for
internal travel. The country has no navigable rivers and no railway except
for a short (1 km) rail link operated by South African Railways, which con-
nects Lesotho to the South African system. Domestic air transport is quite
effective; the road network, however, is inadequate both in length and con-
dition. This is particularly true in the eastern mountain region which
is served by only one engineered road, now being constructed under the
Association's Second Highway Project, and by tracks negotiable only by four-
wheel drive vehicles. The network is poorly maintained, and many roads are
only traversable in the dry season and by four-wheel drive vehicles. Thus,
the most pressing needs of the transport sector are the extension of the
road network, particularly through the construction of all-weather roads to
the mountain areas, and the improvement of road maintenance. For external
travel, Lesotho depends entirely on RSA's well-developed transport system,
particularly the road and rail networks. Because of Lesotho's high propor-
tion of migrant workers and low level of marketed domestic production, demand
for passenger transport is high relative to demand for freight transport.
Roads and Road Transport
1.06      This subsector is discussed in Chapter II.
Air Transport
1.07      Of Lesotho's 31 airfields, two are paved while the rest have grass
or gravel surfaces. Only the airfield at Maseru is equipped with navigation
and communication equipment and terminal facilities; there are no facilities



- 3 -
for night flights in the country. Air transport provides the only access to
mountain areas, other than by foot or animal, but flights are often suspended
because of adverse weather conditions. Although reliance on air services is
expected to diminish with the ongoing construction of all-weather roads, air
transport remains important, and the second Five-Year Plan (1976-80) provides
for improvement of the principal provincial airfields.
1.08      Facilities at Maseru airport are inadequate for the larger planes
needed for international flights and can only accommodate aircraft up to
the Hawker Siddley 748. Consequently, international traffic to Lesotho must
transit through the RSA. To decrease this reliance on RSA facilities, Gov-
ernment has investigated several alternatives. A 1972 study confirmed that
even with major alterations, the airport at Maseru could not be improved to
service larger aircraft because of its surrounding terrain. Government
therefore plans to construct an international airport at Mazenod, about 20 km
south of Maseru. Justification of the new airport on economic grounds might
be difficult, but a final judgment cannot be made until construction costs
are known. Detailed engineering, financed by a loan from the Abu Dhabi
Fund, is now underway; a financing source for construction has not yet been
identified.
1.09      Lesotho Airways Corporation, a government-owned company, provides
most internal air services as well as charter flights into RSA with three
five-seater Cessna planes and two nine-seater Islanders; two additional
nineteen-seater twin Otters will be obtained by early 1979 with CIDA financing.
The airline carried about 14,000 passengers and 217 tons of cargo in 1975, the
latest date for which data are available. Services to Lesotho's southeastern
and northeastern areas are also provided by two South African-owned airline
companies which chiefly transport migrant workers. South African Airways
operates three flights weekly between Maseru and Johannesburg on behalf of
Lesotho Airways; about 7,900 passengers, mostly tourists, were carried on
this route in 1975. The formation of an international airline together with
Swaziland and Botswana has been discussed, but this is not a likely develop-
ment in the near future.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.10      Whereas past transport policy was directed almost exclusively to
serving the main population and production centers along the north-south
lowland corridor on the western border, present policy, as expressed in the
second Five-Year Development Plan (1976-80), emphasizes the objective of
providing all-weather road links to the country's eastern mountain areas in
order to develop their full social and economic potential and to ensure their
political and administrative integration. The Government also aims at the
long-term goal of reducing its transport dependence on RSA.
1.11      The Central Planning and Development Office (CPDO) of the Ministry
of Planning, Finance, and Statistics is responsible for overall policy and
planning in Lesotho and for ensuring intersectoral coordination. CPDO's staff



- 4 -
includes a Director of Planning and 18 planning officers, all with training
in economics or statistics; eight staff members are expatriates. Coordination
among the transport modes is not a major issue, given the lack of internal
rail and water transport and the complementary functions of air and road
transport.
1.12      Transport policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MTC) which took over this function from the Ministry
of Works (MW) in 1975. A Transportation Study, carried out in 1974 by con-
sultants Roughton and Partners (UK) with financing from the British Ministry
of Overseas Development (ODM), assessed the transport needs of the country
and proposed a ten-year road investment program. However, the transport data
base was limited, and the study's principal recommendations and conclusions
were confined to the roads program. The MTC has recently requested financing
from the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) to update the findings of the 1974
study and broaden the study's scope to include an examination of rail and
ferry needs, freight and passenger transport requirements, and rational fare
structures for these services. With the help of this study, which should be
completed by the end of 1980, and the basic transportation statistics it has
begun to compile, MTC hopes to formulate a comprehensive transport policy.
D. Previous Bank Group Projects in the Transport Sector
1.13      There have been two Bank Group transportation projects in Lesotho,
both for roads.  The First Highway Project (Cr. 82-BL, US$4.1 million),
executed between 1967-69, included the construction of 107 km of the main
north-south road from Leribe to the Matsieng turnoff, and a 27 km gravel
feeder road between Leribe and Pitseng. The work was completed satisfactorily
for less than the estimated cost, and the savings were used to pave a further
6 km section of the main north-south road in addition to the 107 km originally
planned.
1.14      The Second Highway Project (Cr. 619-LSO, US$5.5 million, 1976) pro-
vided for construction to all-weather gravel standard of a 147 km section of
the main west-east road linking St. Michaels to Thaba Tseka in the eastern
mountain area. As noted (para 1.04), the project also assisted in establish-
ing the LCU on a pilot basis to prepare Lesotho to provide employment for
any sudden return of Basotho from the RSA; an inventory of projects suitable
for labor-intensive work methods was identified and on-the-job training was
provided for local staff who would form the nucleus of an administrative
set-up if expansion should become necessary. The LCU has already completed
some airstrip construction and road improvement works, and in the future it
will carry out further road improvement work under the proposed project (see
para 3.05), as well as some fish pond construction and land terracing; work
is proceeding satisfactorily.



II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The road network, totalling about 3,450 km, is divided into three
categories according to their function:
(a)  primary trunk roads (about 1,400 km) linking the
major towns, regional centers and border posts;
(b)  secondary district roads (about 900 km) within
and between districts; and
(c)  tertiary subdistrict roads, mostly tracks
(about 1,150 km) serving as feeders to trunk
and secondary district roads.
About 1,800 km of these roads are gazetted. As shown in the following table,
226 km are bitumen paved, about 1,200 km are gravel roads, and the rest are
dry-weather earth roads and tracks. The condition of the road network is
discussed in paras 2.22-2.24.

B. Traffic Growth and Characteristics
2.02      Until 1977 vehicle registration statistics were collected by the
Ministry of Finance, but MTC now collects this information. In 1975, the last
year for which data are available, the vehicle fleet was estimated at about
9,300 units or one vehicle per 134 inhabitants. Of the total vehicle fleet,
about 45% were passenger cars, 29% light commercial vehicles, 9% trucks and
buses, and the remaining 17% comprised tractors, trailers, motorcycles and
scooters. As shown in the following table, between 1971 and 1975, the vehicle
fleet grew at an average annual rate of almost 13% with the fastest growth
occurring in the registration of private cars.

Bulletins, 1970-1976.
The Transport Industry
2.03      Information on the total number of trucks operating in Lesotho is
not available since no record has been kept of the many South African-owned
trucks handling freight between railheads in South Africa and points in
Lesotho. In 1975 there were about 750 trucks and 130 buses registered in
Lesotho. Some 70% of the trucks were privately owned, but the number of
transport companies and the size of their fleets were not recorded. Over
half the bus fleet was privately owned, while the remainder was owned by
the Lesotho National Bus Service (LNBS) which was established in 1973 and
now offers a limited service on most passable routes in the country. In
direct response to the closure of the southern border with Transkei, Govern-
ment has announced its intention to set up a national trucking company with a
fleet of about 30 trucks. The company will initially confine its activities
to Lesotho's southern regions, but Government hopes that this could form the
nucleus for an expanded trucking company operating in the future on a country-
wide basis.

Traffic and Transport Regulations
Couiamercial transporters of goods or passengers must obtain a motor
carrier certificate which MTC's Road Transportation Board (RTB) issues to
licensed drivers on payment of a small fee. Passenger transport vehicles
are required to be tested for road worthiness every six months, and passenger
fares are determined by RTB, taking into account the conditions of transport
routes. The fares are not strictly enforced, and there is evidence of some
passenger-fare undercutting as well as some overcharging; however, fare
undercutting is generally more prevalent than overcharging since competition
in passenger transport is quite intense. Freight vehicles are required to
be tested at yearly intervals; freight tariffs are not regulated, and com-
petition is very keen. The single axle load limit is 18,000 lbs or about
8 tons. Although the limit is not strictly enforced, a recent Government
&T  found that overloading is not common.
2.05      MTC's Transport Division, which administers these regulations, is
currently being reorganized; Chart I gives the proposed new organization.
The Ministry's ability to enforce vehicle regulations is limited by a lack
of trained and experienced staff. The Division's Director is assisted by a
UNDP-financed expatriate transport expert, and although many of his staff
are well educated, they lack experience with the types of activities to be
carried out. Furthermore, driver and vehicle examiners are in short supply.
MTC is working toward improving this situation by providing on-the-job
training to the Division's staff, and while awaiting the recommendations of
the transport study (para 1.12), MTC is attempting to improve its transport-
related data base. Once the results of the study are known, the Association
will review the possibility of assisting Government in implementing the
study's recommendations.
C. Administration
2.06      MW is responsible for the 1,800 km of gazetted roads; the Ministry
of Rural Development (MRD), using labor employed under the Food Aid Program,
is in charge of construction and maintenance of most earth tracks in the
mountainous areas; and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has undertaken
responsibility for the construction of about 670 km of feeder roads under
the Association's Basic Agricultural Services Project (Credit 795-LES, US$6
million, 1978), with cofinancing from the ODM, the European Economic Community
(EEC), the FRG and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). It is
intended that MW will gradually take over the maintenance of some tracks and
feeder roads as traffic on them increases, since neither MRD nor MOA has the
capacity to maintain the roads properly.
2.07      The Roads Branch (RB) under MW is in charge of planning, design,
maintenance and construction of roads under MW's jurisdiction. It also
maintains some of the country's airfields on behalf of the Civil Aviation
Department. RB has centralized services at Maseru for planning, design



- 8 -
and construction, while its regional district offices in Leribe and Mohale's
Hoek are responsible for all routine and periodic maintenance. Since its
present organization does not permit RB to operate efficiently over the entire
country, its administrative structure will be reorganized under the proposed
project (paras 3.05-3.08) and technical assistance provided under the project
(para 3.10) will help Government in restructuring RB and in carrying out its
operations under the new organization (Chart II).
2.08      The Central Mechanical Workshop and Plant Pool (CMW&PP) is in
charge of equipment maintenance and repair and provides equipment for hire
to Government agencies (including RB). CMW&PP's organization and operations
are discussed in detail in paras 2.10, 2.11, and 2.25.
D. Staffing and Training
2.09      A major constraint on RB's operations is the shortage of qualified
staff due to the scarcity of trained Basotho and the departure of skilled
personnel to the RSA which pays substantially higher salaries. The shortage
of qualified engineers is especially severe. RB now employs only two Basotho
engineers in middle management positions while expatriates occupy the position
of Controller of Works in NW as well as RB's two top positions (Chief Roads
Engineer and his deputy). At present some 15 of RB's top level posts, mostly
for engineers, remain vacant. But despite this limitation, which is expected
to persist for several years to come, RB operates reasonably well.
2.10      CMW&PP operations are also hampered by an overall shortage of
qualified staff. Management is weak, which results in operational ineffi-
ciencies and high costs.  In addition, mechanics and equipment operators
are in particularly short supply.
2.11      Recognizing the continuing shortage of skilled personnel in Lesotho,
Government has maintained close links with a number of aid agencies and
foreign governments, most notably the British Government, to obtain technical
assistance for MW, primarily for higher level positions. Training facilities
for other staff are available at the Government-owned Technician Training
School in Maseru, which provides three-year training courses for civil engi-
neering technicians. Fifteen to twenty technicians are graduated annually,
and the school's program is currently being expanded with ODM assistance to
also provide training in mechanical and electrical engineering. In addition,
about 100 craftsmen (mechanics, electricians, plumbers, masons, carpenters,
etc.) are being trained annually at the Lerotholi Technical Institute and
four regional training schools. Although the training provided is quite
satisfactory, trainees usually need further practical on-the-job training
before they are fully operational. The annual output of technicians and
craftsmen trained at these institutions would be adequate to satisfy most
of the staffing needs of RB and CMW&PP if the staff so trained remained in
Lesotho; however, some of the trained workers leave the country for higher
paying jobs in the RSA at least temporarily. Government is now taking steps



- 9 -
to improve its staffing situation and has established a na-LieL which will
periodically review and make recommendations on measures required to meet
these objectives. Government agreed to take all appropriate measures to
retain key personnel within RB and CMW&PP (para 5.01(a)). The proposed
project will assist Government in improving its staffing situation by provid-
ing technical assistance to fill key positions within RB and at CMW&PP's
regional workshops and for on-the-job training of RB and CMW&PP staff as
well as fellowships for training Basotho staff abroad (paras 3.10-3.12). In
addition, assurances have been received by Government that ODM will provide
technical assistance in strengthening CMW&PP's operations at its head office
and central mechanical workshop in Maseru (para 3.10); formal agreement
between Government and ODM on this financing is a condition of Credit effec-
tiveness (para 5.02).
E. Planning
2.12      MW's Planning Unit is responsible for preparing and evaluating
projects (including those for roads), coordinating investments within the
Ministry and with CPDO (para 1.11), framing annual capital estimates and
monitoring the physical and financial progress of MW projects. Neither
the MW Planning Unit nor the RB has any capacity for major road or transport
studies, and these functions are performed by expatriate consultants.
2.13      Road investments scheduled under the ongoing Second Five-Year Plan
(1976-1980) are primarily directed toward opening up the eastern mountain
areas. Annex 1 lists roads to be studied or constructed under the Plan.
Investments included in the Plan are consistent with Government's development
objectives and were recommended in the Lesotho Transportation Study (para
1.12) as part of a ten-year road development plan (1976-1985) which was
adopted by Government and which provides a sound basis for development of
the country's road infrastructure. Design standards and the timing of road
construction are based on the recommendations of individual feasibility
studies and are appropriate. The Association's Second Highway Project is
currently helping Government to carry out the Plan (para 114), and the
proposed project will provide financing for feasibility and detailed engineer-
ing studies for part of the northern access road to the eastern mountain areas
(para 3.13).
F. Financing and Expenditure
2.14      MW's annual budget estimates for the highway sector are prepared
by the RB and are reviewed and where necessary amended by the office of
MW's Permanent Secretary. The capital budget is then submitted to CPDO for
approval before being incorporated into the Government's Capital Budget which
is submitted to the Ministry of Finance for presentation to Parliament. The
recurrent budget is submitted directly to the Ministry of Finance for approval
and presentation to Parliament.

2.15      From 1974/75 to 1977/78, capital expenditures by RB increased by
over 600%:

Over 90% of total capital expenditure during this period was financed by
loans or grants from foreign donors. Most of these funds were earmarked for
specific projects and cannot be reallocated by the Ministry; however, Govern-
ment's contributions can be reallocated to other projects with the permission
of CPDO. At year's end, MW can request from the Ministry of Finance a revote
of unspent funds, and this is generally granted.
2.16      RB's recurrent expenditures have increased at an annual average
rate of 21% since 1974/75; their share in total Government recurrent expendi-
tures is about 3.9% at present.

These allocations have been significantly below the amounts required by RB
to properly maintain the road network, but this situation improved somewhat
in the 1978/79 budget in which the allocation to RB was increased by 35% over
_.-:'i--    f v'. -  Release of the allocated funds to MW is supposed to be on
a quarterly basis but is often significantly delayed because of cumbersome
administrative procedures. The inadequacy of recurrent funds and their
haphazard release severely hamper RB's maintenance and construction activi-
ties and have resulted in a backlog of road maintenance operations (paras
2.23-2.25). Estimated recurrent expenditure requirements for maintenance of
the road network amount to about R 3.0 million (US$3.5 milliorn equivalent) in
current prices for 1979/80, if these funds are utilized efficiently. During
negotiations Government agreed to allocate this amount for RB's road main-
tenance operations in 1979/80 and to exchange views with the Association, not
later than December 31 of each year during the project period, on budgetary
requirements and proposed budgetary allocations for road maintenance for the
following fiscal year (para 5.01(b)).  Furthermore, Governnent agreed to make
RB's budgetary allocation for road maintenance available to RB on a quarterly
basis, no later than the first day of each quarter, for che exclusive use of
RB so that RB's road maintenance operations are not interrupted at any time
(para 5.01(c)).
2.17      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and
duties on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spare parts, and through local
licensing and registration fees. Since Lesotho belongs to a Customs Union
with RSA, Botswana and Swaziland, all customs and sales duties are paid
into a common revenue pool. Lesotho neither sets the customs duty rates
nor collects the duties; its share of customs revenues is calculated in the
RSA on the basis of an agreed formula. 1/ Thus, customs revenues directly
attributable to road users cannot be calculated precisely, but mission esti-
mates given in the following table indicate that these revenues, together
with registration and licensing fees, would be sufficient to cover RB's
recurrent expenditures for the expanded operations under the p>-posed project.

G. Engineering
2.18      Due to a shortage of qualified staff, RB's Design and Planning
Section prepares only minor road and bridge designs, whereas designs for
major projects and construction supervision are undertaken by foreign con-
sultants, one of whom has established an office in Maseru. There are no
local civil works consultants nor is it likely that any local firms will
be established in the near future, given the shortage of qualified local
personnel.
2.19      Design standards for roads are satisfactory, and roads are usually
designed for speeds of 60-80 km/h in the western lowlands and 40-60 km/h in
mountainous areas. Bitumen paved roads normally consist of double surface
treatment on a granular base; gravel roads are constructed with a 15-20 cm
gravel surface with cement stabilization provided in areas of unsatisfactory
soil conditions.
H. Construction
2.20      RB undertakes only minor construction works, most of which are equip-
ment-intensive, with equipment rented from the CMW&PP and supervised by RB's
own staff. RB currently has one equipment-intensive construction brigade,
which carries out about 50 km of road improvement work annually, and a second
brigade will be established under the proposed project in order to increase
RB's construction capacity (para 3.05). In addition, the Labor-Intensive
Construction Unit (para 1.14) has also carried out about 50 km of improvement
of minor roads annually since 1977, employing about 200 laborers, at unit
costs competitive with equipment-intensive methods; and two labor-intensive
brigades for road regravelling works will be established under the proposed
project (para 3.05). All major construction works are carried out by foreign
contractors, with contracts let on a unit price basis following international
competitive bidding or the requirements of the financing agency.
2.21      The few local construction firms active in the country are engaged
mainly in small building construction and are not equipped for road works
due to a shortage of trained staff, funds and equipment. Government is
anxious to reduce its reliance on foreign construction companies, which are
mainly based in the RSA, and has obtained a commitment from the Irish Govern-
ment to set up a national construction company, following recommendations of
a study also financed by the Irish Government. The construction agency is
expected to be created during 1979, with management consultants responsible
for its operations; it is expected to participate in those construction works
now carried out by foreign contractors.



- 13 -
I. Maintenance
2.22      RB, through its two regional district offices (para 2.07), maintains
about 1,800 km of roads of which 226 km are paved. Annual operations are
planned by the regional engineers on the basis of their observations and
judgment, with no formal methodology for establishing priorities and budgetary
requirements. There is no road inventory, and up to now no maintenance
program has been established. RB redistributes the maintenance funds from its
budget to the regional offices in proportion to the length of roads that each
must maintain. The district engineers prepare quarterly reports outlining
only the general maintenance activities in their area, global cost figures and
the progress and expenditures on road improvement projects. No detailed cost
accounting is carried out for these operations.
2.23      Present maintenance operations are inadequate, and most of the
country's roads, and gravel roads in particular, are in poor condition, mainly
due to a shortage of funds (para 2.16) and RB's operational i-nefficiencies.
RB cannot plan and carry out its operations on a continuous basis, and work
is often interrupted awaiting release of funds. It also suffers from a severe
shortage of trained technical personnel, ranging from the foreman level to
middle and top level management, with a consequent loss of efficiency in the
scheduling and execution of works (para 2.09).
2.24      Because of these shortcomings, only about 30% of the network under
RB's jurisdiction receives spot improvements annually. For gravel roads this
consists primarily of patching and grading of road shoulders, spreading of
loose rocky materials in muddy or rough areas of the roadbed, and clearing
of ditches. Paved roads are in somewhat better condition, mainly because
they have been constructed fairly recently and Government is placing more
emphasis on maintaining them; even so, various sections already show deteri-
oration such as broken pavement edges and cracks. Periodic maintenance is
generally restricted to emergency operations. About one-quarter of all paved
roads need resurfacing, and about three-quarters of the country's gravel
roads are estimated to need regravelling. Deterioration on one section of
the road constructed to gravel standard under the Second Highway Project has
become particularly serious because of somewhat higher than expected traffic,
heavy rains and rugged terrain. Since paving of this section is more econo-
mical than frequent regravelling of the road, the proposed project will
finance the paving of this road section (para 3.03).
2e25      RB's performance is further hampered by the inefficient operations
of CMW&PP which is in charge of procuring and maintaining the equipment
rented by RB. Besides the staffing problems already mentioned (para 2.10),
CMW&PP's operations suffer from an imbalance in equipment with shortages
of some items as well as surpluses of others, a wide variety in the make of
equipment with little consideration for standardization, lack of adequate
workshops in the regional districts and shortages of spare parts. As a result
of these factors and RB's somewhat haphazard demand for epUpuent because of
discontinuities in budget releases, equipment utilization rates have only been
about 50% of possible levels.  Rental rates are consequentl-y excessive since



- 14 -
they include high overhead costs, and these rates in turn make RB's mainte-
nance operations more costly. However, with the introduction of a continuous
annual road maintenance program under the project, CMW&PP's equipment will
henceforth be used continuously over the year, which should result in lower
rental rates than CMW&PP currently charges. Government therefore agreed to
review CMW&PP's equipment rental rates based on a continuous annual utilization
rate and to communicate its findings to the Association for its comments by
May 31, 1979 (para 5.01(d)).
2.26      Government is trying to improve its road maintenance organization
and, with financing from the African Development Fund (AfDF), engaged consul-
tants, Brian Colquhoun and Co. (UK), to assess the organizational, personnel,
workshop, equipment and financial requirements for adequate maintenance of the
road network. And, as was agreed under the Second Highway Project, consult-
ants Hugh O'Donnell and Co. (UK) were engaged to make proposals to improve
CMW&PP operations. Both studies have now been completed. However, Government
lacks the capacity and funds either to carry out the consultants' recommenda-
tions for improvement of RB and CMW&PP operations or to reduce the backlog of
regravelling work; the proposed project will therefore assist Government in
these efforts (paras 3.05-3.12).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      As stated in para. 2.13, Government recognizes the need to improve
its road infrastructure and has therefore identified the opening up of the
eastern mountain area and the strengthening of road maintenance as its
priority objectives for highway investment. The proposed project has been
designed to assist Government in achieving these goals.
B. Project Description
3.02      The proposed project consists of:
(a)  paving of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road (about 24 km)
and
(b)  consultants' services for supervision of (a) above;
(c)  improvement of road maintenance, including construction
and equipping of regional offices for RB;
(d)  construction and equipping of CMW&PP workshops;
(e)  technical assistance to RB and CMW&PP;



- 15 -
(f) fellowships for RB and CMW&PP staff; and
(g) feasibility and, if justified, detailed engineering studies
for the Oxbow-Mokhotlong road (120 km).
Road Paving
3.03      The project provides for paving of a 24 km section of the St.
Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road now being constructed to gravel standards under
the IDA Second Highway Project (see Map). Traffic on the road is now about
150 vpd and has increased at a somewhat faster rate than was originally
estimated. In addition to the substantial traffic level, heavy rains and the
rugged terrain cause serious deterioration of the gravel surface course, and
costly repair work is required annually to re-establish driving conditions
after each rainy season. Paving of this section is considered the most
economical solution to preserve the investments made so far, and the proposed
project will therefore provide for a double surface bitumen treatment over
a 5 m width.
Supervision
3.04      Consultants will be employed to supervise the road paving operations
since Government lacks qualified staff for this purpose. Agreement was reached
with Government that suitably qualified consultants would be employed under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association (para 5.01 (e)).
Improvement of Road Maintenance
Regravelling
3.05      To assist Government in reducing its backlog of regravelling opera-
tions, the project provides for the establishment and operation over a three-
year period of one equipment-intensive and two labor-intensive road improve-
ment brigades; an additional equipment-intensive brigade with equipment rented
from the GMW&PP and financed by RB under its annual operations will complement
the work performed by the project-financed brigades. The project will also
provide for the establishment within RB of one central administrative autho-
rity for periodic maintenance, based in Maseru, to plan, organize and supervise
the brigades' work. The brigades will carry out the necessary earthworks for
minor improvement of the horizontal and vertical alignments, the spreading of
a 15-20 cm gravel layer, and construction and clearing of ditches and drainage
structures (para 3.18). Their staff and equipment composition are given in
Annex 2. On the basis of productivity rates now being achieved, it is esti-
mated that under the project about 100 km of roads will be regravelled
annually by the equipment-intensive brigade and about 50 km by each of the
labor-intensive brigades. The work carried out under the project together
with ongoing regravelling works carried out by RB under its annual maintenance
operation will ensure that the country's gravel roads will be improved to an
adequate condition by 1983. A three-year regravelling program, prepared by
the Government, was discussed and agreed upon with Government. Agreement
was also reached that Government will start to implement the program by
October 1, 1979; will annually review and update the program; and at least
three months before the beginning of each year's program, will submit the
updated program to the Association for its approval (para 5.01 (f)).



- 16 -
3.06      The project will finance:  (a) procurement of maintenance equipment
and operating expenditures such as fuel and spare parts for the equipment-
intensive brigade to be created under the project, and imported materials for
the latter brigade and the equipment-intensive brigade to be established by
Government; (b) hand tools, equipment and spare parts, fuel, imported materials
as well as transport of materials, and wages of laborers in the two labor-
intensive brigades; and (c) technical assistance to strengthen RB's staff in
planning, organizing and supervising these works and to train local personnel
(para 3.10). A list of equipment to be procured under the project was agreed
with Government (para 5.01(g)).
Routine Maintenance
3.07      The project will assist Government to strengthen RB's routine main-
tenance operations through reorganization of its administrative structure and
improvement of its operations. The present organization into two regions,
with regional offices in Leribe and Mohale's Hoek, will be restructured and
a third regional office will be added, with headquarters at Thaba Tseka.
About 30 maintenance crews will be set up in the regions to carry out patching
and reshaping of the road surface, repair and reconstruction of shoulders,
clearing and repair of ditches and drainage structures, etc. This system of
routine maintenance operations is expected to ensure adequate annual main-
tenance of the country's road network.
3.08      The project will provide (a) equipment to set up the maintenance
crews, (b) technical assistance to strengthen RB's staff in planning, organiz-
ing and supervising regional district operations (para 3.10-3.11), and (c)
office buildings and housing for RB's staff at the regional offices in Leribe,
Mohale's Hoek and Thaba Tseka. Government has prepared details of the new
organizational structure of RB's regional offices; office and housing require-
ments for RB staff; the number and type of maintenance crews to be established;
length of roads to be maintained by them; and staff, equipment and budgetary
requirements for regional operations. These details have all been found
satisfactory by the Association. Agreement was reached with Government that
an annual routine maintenance program, including budgetary requirements, will
be prepared by RB before the beginning of each fiscal year during the project
period, on the basis of traffic. counts, a road inventory and past maintenance
costs; for this purpose, detailed records of maintenance operations carried
out and their costs will be kept on a continuous basis by the regional district
offices (para. 5.01(h)).
Workshops
3.09      To strengthen the CMW&PP's capacity for equipment maintenance and
repair, the project will provide for construction of workshop and office
buildings, housing for CMW&PP's staff, and procurement of workshop tools and
equipment for the regional workshops in Leribe, Mohale's Hoek and Thaba Tseka
in accordance with recommendations of the road maintenance study (para. 2.26).
This will enable CMW&PP to introduce preventive maintenance and carry out
minor repair of its equipment in the regions; major equipment overhaul, how-
ever, will continue to be carried out at the central workshop in Maseru, which



- 17 -
is expected to be improved by Government with ODM assistance. The project
will also provide technical assistance to organize and supervise operations of
the three regional workshops and to train Basotho staff (para 3.10). Details
of requirements for workshops, staff housing, workshop tools and equipment,
local staff and training have been prepared by Government, and have been found
satisfactory by the Association.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.10      Government's road maintenance effort is presently constrained by
a shortage of qualified staff in RB and CMW&PP (paras 2.09-2.11) which results
in the inefficient operations of both entities. ODM will provide technical
assistance to strengthen CMW&PP's operations at its head office and central
mechanical workshop in Maseru. Effectiveness of the IDA Credit will be
conditional upon agreement between Government and the ODM on this financing,
which is not part of the proposed project (paras 2.11 and 5.02). Technical
assistance included under the project will be used to fill key staff positions
in RB's new maintenance structure and at the CMW&PP regional workshops to be
established under the project and to provide training to local Basotho staff.
An estimated total of 324 man-months of technical assistance will be provided
over a three-year period and will consist of:
(a)  one Deputy Chief Roads Engineer (Maintenance) for a
period of three years to have overall responsibility
for MW's routine and periodic maintenance operations under
the direction of the Chief Roads Engineer. He will be
responsible for the creation of RB's new maintenance
structure under the proposed project, including coordination
of planning, budgeting and follow-up of MW's maintenance
operations carried out by RB's regional offices. He will
also be responsible for introducing a permanent traffic
counting system, an annual road inventory and a cost
accounting system;
(b)  one maintenance supervisor (engineer) for RB for a period
of three years, to be based in one of the three regional
district offices 1/ to plan and supervise recurrent main-
tenance operations and to train local staff;
(c)  four assistant maintenance supervisors (technicians) for
RB for a period of three years each; three to be based at
the regional district offices in Leribe, Thaba Tseka and
Mohale's Hoek to assist the maintenance supervisors to plan
and supervise recurrent maintenance operations; and one to
be based in Maseru to assist RB's periodic maintenance unit
in planning and executing periodic maintenance operations;
1/   The positions of the two other supervisors are already filled.



- 18 -
(d) one foreman/trainer for road improvement works for a period
of one year to be assigned to both the equipment-intensive
brigade to be created under the project and the equipment-
intensive brigade to be operated by Government, to organize
and supervise the brigades' operations and to train local staff;
(e) two training officers for a period of one year each, one
of whom will be assigned to RB and one to CMW&PP to define,
organize and supervise training of local staff; and
(f) three workshop supervisors for CMW&PP, for two years
each, to supervise the organization and execution of
equipment maintenance and repair at the regional work-
shops in Leribe, Thaba Tseka and Mohale's Hoek, and to
train local staff.
3.11      Government agreed that the qualifications and job specifications of
technical assistance and the terms and conditions of their employment would
be satisfactory to the Association, and that it would provide local staff and
counterparts required for project implementation (para 5.01 (i)).
Fellowships
3.12      The project provides for the training abroad of suitably qualified
Basotho in order to strengthen RB and CMW&PP supervisory staff in civil and
mechanical engineering and in specialized aspects of highway maintenance and
equipment repair. Agreement was reached with Government that the number and
specialities of fellowships required will be determined by the two training
officers during project implementation in agreement with the Association
(para 5.01(j)).
Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering
3.13      The project includes financing of a feasibility study, and if con-
struction is economically justified, detailed engineering to be carried out
by consultants, of the Oxbow-Mokhotlong road (120 km). The road will link
the western lowlands and foothills area with the eastern mountain district
center at Mokhotlong. At present much of the road is a track traversable only
by four-wheel drive vehicles. Construction of the road to all-weather stand-
ards is one of Government's highest priorities in the transport sector and is

for expatriates as presently paid in Lesotho. Costs
cover about 324 man-months over a three-year period at
a rate of about US$3,600 per man-month, net of taxes
and contingencies, including salaries, expatriate
allowances, social security and other indirect expenses
and fees as well as housing and external travel;
(i) Fellowships: based on mission estimate; and
(j) Studies: based on costs for similar projects in Lesotho
and assuming about US$1,750 per km for the feasibility study
and about US$2,300 per km for the detailed engineering study.

E. Implementation
3.17      The MW, assisted by consultants, will be responsible for project
execution. Paving of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road will be carried out
by contractor. Consultants will be selected by the Government to carry out
the supervision of the road paving and the feasibility and detailed engineer-
ing studies. Technical assistants will be recruited by Government on an
individual basis to fill the required positions within RB and CMW&PP.
3.18      Because of its sporadic nature, road regravelling will be carried
out by force account, which is the most economical method in the country for
this type of work. RB's Periodic Maintenance Section will be in charge of
organizing and executing these operations. RB's Design and Planning Section
will prepare any engineering drawings required, and RB's Soils Laboratory
will carry out the site investigations and soil tests. Equipment procured
under the project will be maintained and operated by CMW&PP. The equipment-
intensive brigade will operate on the country's heavily trafficked two-lane
roads, some of which require substantial earthworks to improve their alignment.
The two labor-intensive brigades will be used primarily for improvement of
less heavily trafficked single-lane roads which only require regravelling
works and clearing of ditches. Agreement was reached with Government that the
operations of the regravelling brigades to be provided under the project will
be complemented by the work of one equipment-intensive brigade to be financed
from RB's annual budget (para. 5.01(k)). Routine road maintenance operations
will be the responsibility of RB's regional district offices.
3.19      Completion of the project is expected by October 1982.  An imple-
mentation schedule (Chart III), a progress reporting system (Annex 3) and the
preparation of a completion report within six months of the Closing Date were
discussed and agreed upon with Government (para 5.01(1)).
F. Procurement
3.20      Paving of the St. Michaels-MIolimo Nthuse road and procurement
of materials and supplies will be by international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Contracts for groups of equipment,
materials and supplies costing less than US$50,000 will be awarded on the
basis of quotations from suppliers; the total amount of these contracts will
not exceed US$200,000 under each of the IDA and EEC credits. Agreement to
this effect was obtained from Government (para 5.01(m)). Contracts for
equipment exceeding the above limits will be procured by ICB in line with EEC
procurement restrictions.  CMW&PP will call bids for workshop buildings and
tools and for equipment to be procured under the project. RB will call bids
for office buildings, materials and supplies.
3.21      Construction of workshops, office buildings and housing for staff
will be carried out by contractors following local competitive bidding pro-
cedures, which are satisfactory to the Association. Construction is expected
to start during the second half of 1979 and will take one year to complete.

G. Disbursement
3.22      IDA funds will be disbursed as follows:  (a) 85% of total costs for
civil works; (b) 85% of total costs for spare parts, fuel for one equipment-
intensive regravelling brigade, and materials for two such brigades; (c) 85%
of total costs for spare parts, fuel, materials, transport of materials, and
laborers' wages for two labor-intensive regravelling brigades; (d) 85% of
total costs for workshops, offices and staff housing; and (e) 100% of total
costs for technical assistance and fellowships. EEC funds will be disbursed
as follows: (a) 95% of total costs for equipment and tools, and (b) 85% of
total costs for engineering and feasibility studies. A schedule of disburse-
ments for both IDA and EEC credits is shown below.

H. Ecology
3.24      The road construction and improvement carried out under the project
will provide for adequate drainage and thus help to decrease soil erosion,
which is a serious problem in Lesotho. Otherwise, the project will have no
influence on the country's ecology.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The road regravelling and technical assistance program, accounting
for about 86% of total project costs, aims at improving road maintenance
operations along the entire gazetted network (about 1,800 km). In so doing,
it will directly benefit the majority of the population by reducing the
cost of both transport and marketed goods, by ensuring year-round service
on the roads which are maintained and by providing easier access to admin-
istrative and social facilities. The project's civil works component pro-
vides for paving of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road, which is a key
section of Lesotho's primary road network. Benefits from the road paving will
accrue principally in the form of reduced travel costs and reduced maintenance
costs. The road paving, constituting about 9% of project costs, will directly
benefit the approximately 16,000 inhabitants of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse
area.
4.02      As noted in para. 2.04, the determination of official passenger
transport fares takes road conditions into account so that benefits from
road improvements will be passed directly on to consumers where official
fares are enforced. Competition on most routes is very keen, and it is
therefore reasonable to assume that some of the transport cost savings
will be passed on in virtually all cases. Furthermore, since LNBS intends
to expand its bus services to new routes as road conditions along these
routes improve, and since MTC is improving its enforcement of the official
fare structure (para 2.05), the distribution of transport savings to con-
sumers will be even more assured in the future than it has been in the past.
Freight rates charged in Lesotho are not controlled; competition is generally
very keen and some of the benefits from vehicle operating cost savings which
accrue to goods' transporters can also be expected to be passed on to consumers.
B. Economic Analysis
Road Regravelling Component
4.03      In the absence of a detailed road inventory describing actual road
conditions and present traffic levels for all roads, the evaluation of this
component is based on average road conditions and traffic counts on one-
and two-lane gravel roads. The analysis compares the "with project" situation,
in which about 200 km of roads are regravelled annually over the three-
year program, with the "without project" case where the roads would receive no
more than a minimal level of recurrent maintenance. All costs and benefits
are net of taxes and subsidies and are in constant January 1979 prices.



- 25 -
4.04      The costs of the road regravelling component are calculated to
include the cost of labor, equipment, tools, materials, fuel, spare parts
and the cost of technical assistance and building facilities used in the
implementation of this project component. They also include an allowance for
the costs of the additional recurrent maintenance activities which must be
carried out on the regravelled roads if all of the potential benefits from
this component are to be realized. In view of the rather unique labor market
situation in Lesotho where the best alternative productive possibility of a
laborer may range from subsistence farming, where earnings are well below the
minimum wage in Lesotho, to working in the South African mines, where earnings
are considerably higher than the minimum wage in Lesotho, a shadow wage rate
could not be calculated without extensive research. Accordingly no shadow
wage rate has been used in this analysis. The calculations assume a useful
life of 20 years for office buildings and workshops.
4.05      The quantified benefits of the regravelling component consist of
savings in vehicle operating costs based on consultants' estimates of these
costs by road condition. The vehicle operating costs used in the calculations
are presented below:
Vehicle Operating Costs /a

Buses                                     .38         .48          .96
/a   Excluding occupant's time.
All roads to be regravelled are taken to be earth roads at present, while with
the regravelling program their standard will be raised to that of good gravel.
The lifetime of the regravelled surface is taken as five years on the two-lane
primary roads where the traffic volume is presently estimated at about 60 vpd.
The regravelled surface of the single-lane primary roads and all secondary
roads is expected to have a 7-year lifetime. Traffic volumes on the single-
lane primary roads and on all secondary roads are estimated to average
35 vpd. These are conservative traffic volumes reflecting the poor condition
of the road network. Following regravelling, traffic is expected to grow at
10% over the life of the investments. Based on studies of gravel roads
carried out recently in Lesotho, traffic is assumed to be distributed as
follows:



- 26 -
Cars                                   5%
Light Commercial Vehicles             55%
Trucks                                20%
Buses                                 20%
4.06      The analysis of the road regravelling operations to be carried out
on the more heavily trafficked two-lane roads, using equipment-intensive
methods, yields an economic rate of return of 58%; the costs included in
this evaluation amount to about 30% of project costs. The single-lane road
regravelling operations on the less heavily trafficked roads, which will be
carried out by labor-intensive methods, show an economic rate of return of
32%; the costs included in this evaluation amount to about 24% of project
costs. Cost and benefit streams for these operations follow:

Road Paving
4.07      The economic analysis for this investment compares the expected
costs and benefits arising from it in constant January 1979 prices, over a
period of 15 years, taken to be the economic life of the road. Economic costs
of road paving are adjusted to exclude taxes and to include the supervision of
civil works and a 10% allowance for physical contingencies; these costs
amount to about 9% of total project costs. For the reason cited in para 4.04
above, no shadow wage rate was used. The quantified benefits consist of
savings in vehicle operating costs derived from the table presented in para
4.05 above; they assume that the road would be maintained in a good gravel
condition in the absence of the project. There will also be some savings in
maintenance costs as a result of the road paving. The economic analysis
indicates that the paving of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road section is
economically sound, yielding an economic rate of return of 15%.



- 28 -
4.08      The average daily traffic volume on this road is now 149, of which
about 64% are cars, 24% light commercial vehicles and the remainder heavy
buses and trucks. The economic analysis of the road paving component assumes
that, on completion of the civil works, there will be a 20% generation of
light and medium weight traffic but no generation in heavy traffic, and that
total traffic will grow at 10% annually. This rate of growth is in line with
recent observed annual traffic growth rates in Lesotho. However, in later
years, as the absolute level of traffic increases, a reduction in the rate of
traffic growth is likely. Therefore the analysis assumes that the traffic
growth rate declines to 8% for the latter eight years of the project life.
Cost and benefit streams for this project component follow:

Aggregate Economic Rate of Return
4.09      The aggregate economic rate of return for the road regravelling
program (including the technical assistance and building facilities which
could be allocated to this component) and for the road paving component, which
together account for 63% of the project costs, is 42%. This aggregate rate of
return excludes the project components which will improve the recurrent
maintenance organization of the Roads Branch except insofar as they will
affect the road regravelling component. The analysis also excludes the
fellowships and feasibility studies for which the benefits could not be
meaningfully quantified.
C. Project Risks
4.10      The project has no unusual risks associated with it.  Sensitivity
analysis on the returns to paving the road from St. Michaels to Molimo Nthuse
indicates that a 10% increase in costs or a 10% decrease in benefits would
reduce the rate of return to 11% or 13%, respectively. The successful imple-
mentation of the road improvement and maintenance program which would yield
very substantial economic returns could be threatened by difficulties in the
appointment and retention of qualified staff in Government service and the
timely release of adequate maintenance funds to RB. However, these problems,
which would delay project implementation and thereby increase costs and
postpone benefits, were discussed fully during Credit negotiations, and
measures to be taken to minimize these risks have been agreed upon.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Agreement was reached with Government on the following:
(a)  that appropriate measures will be taken so that the Ministry
of Works, including RB and CMW&PP, is able to retain key
personnel (para 2.11);
(b) (i) that Government will provide R 3.0 million in FY1979
for RB's road maintenance operations; and (ii) that Govern-
ment will exchange views with the Association no later than
December 31 of each year during project implementation, on
budgetary requirements for road maintenanance for the
following fiscal year (para 2.16);
(c)  that RB's road maintenance allocation will be made available
to RB on a quarterly basis, no later than the first day of
each quarter, for the exclusive use of RB so that RB's road
maintenance operations are not interrupted at any time
(para 2.16);



- 30 -
(d) that it would review rental rates based on a continuous
annual utilization rate, and communicate its findings to
the Association for its comments by May 31, 1979 (para 2.25);
(e) on the employment of consultants for supervision of road
paving and engineering studies on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (paras 3.04 and 3.13);
(f)  on a three-year regravelling program which Government will
start to implement by October 1, 1979 and which will be
updated annually and submitted to the Association for its
approval three months before the beginning of each year's
program (para 3.05);
(g) on a list of equipment to be procured under the project
(para 3.06);
(h) on the preparation by RB of an annual routine maintenance
program, including budgetary requirements, on the basis of
traffic counts, a road inventory and past maintenance costs;
for this purpose, detailed records of maintenance operations
carried out and their costs will be kept on a continuous
basis by the regional district offices (para 3.08);
(i) that the qualifications and job specifications of technical
assistance and the terms and conditions of their employment
would be satisfactory to the Association, and that Government
would provide the local staff and counterparts required for
project implementation (para 3.11);
(j) that the number and specialties of fellowships required will
be determined by the two training officers during project
implementation in agreement with the Association (para 3.12);
(k) that the operations of the regravelling brigades to be pro-
vided under the project will be complemented by the work
of one equipment-intensive regravelling brigade to be
financed from RB's annual budget (para 3.18);
(1) on an implementation schedule, a progress reporting system,
and the preparation of a completion report within six months
of the Closing Date (para 3.19); and
(m)  contracts for groups of equipment, materials and supplies
costing less than US$50,000 will be awarded on the basis of
quotations from suppliers; the total amount of such purchases
should not exceed US$200,000 under each of the IDA and EEC
credits (para 3.20).



- 31 -
5.02      Credit effectiveness will be conditional upon formal agreement
between Government and the ODM on financing of technical assistance for
CMW&PP's central workshop (para 2.11).  Effectiveness of the IDA and EEC
credits will occur simultaneously.
5.03      With the agreements outlined above, the project is suitable for
an IDA Credit of US$9.0 million on standard terms to the Kingdom of Lesotho
and an EEC Special Action Credit of about US$2.2 million.
