3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objectives of the project were to reduce the quantity of petroleum hydrocarbons entering the
international waters of the Mediterranea, and to comply with MARPOL 73/78 Convention requirements.
The project also achieved, among other objectives, development of a comprehensive and integrated
system for the management of oil pollution caused by marine sources, thus ensuring commonality of
approaches and methodologies, prorroting exchange of information and coordination, enhancing
monitoring capability among the countries in the region for preventing and combating oil pollution, and
improving the quality of the marine environment.
The above objectives were successfully attained and deemed to be appropriate and in line with the
government's intemational commitment to monitor compliance with international conventions related to
marine pollution. They were clear and realistic with regard to the national and regional agreement (
"Union du Maghreb Arabe- UMA).As a consequence, a framework for a comprehensive national and
regional approach to the management of oil pollution has been developed through enhancement of
personnel capability to assess and monitor oil pollution, enactment of national oil spill confingency
planning and response capabilities (NCP), drafting of regional contingency plan (RCP), purchase of
standardized equipment to combat pollution, and initiation of a cost recovery system. Cost recovery at
the port level was achieved through adeiquate tariff restructuring, and at the national level by enactment
of environmental funds, a law regarding fees and penalties, and the polluter-pay principle.
The project was designed to enhance the country's capacity to implement its environmental action plan,
which aims in particular to fight pollution, protect the marine environment and beaches, and encourage
the parficipation of the environmental agencies and others entities in efforts to protect the environment.
In this regard, the preparation of the project called for great attention and commitment from the
government to identify the most appropriate and most representative agency, "Office d'Exploitation des
Ports" (ODEP), to implement the project and represent the country in the regional common effort.
No specific technical risk was identified during preparation, except the risk related to the government's
willingness to maintain its cooperation with the other recipients, Algeria and Tunisia, to enforce the
preparation and adoption of a NCP ancl the cooperative agreement, to enforce regulations dealing with
marine pollution problems, and to implernent adequate cost recovery system. This risk was mitigated by:
(a) the commitment of the three governrents to follow up on the preparation study and implement study
recommendations related to the above aspects, and the project components as defined in para. 3.3; (b)
the national and regional benefits resulting from project implementation, especially the investments
carried out for coastal and ports protection; (c) enactment of an NCP, preparation of an advanced draft
of a Regional Contingency Plan (RCP), and an agreement signed by the three port authorities on a joint
cooperation for combating accidental oil spills; and (d) comprehensive project preparation and
implementation carried out with the cooperation of local authorities through a regional committee for
project implementation (CRCP). The intensive Bank follow-up effort has ensured maximum success of
project implementation during the various stages of the project, and contributed to achieving its
objectives.
3.2 Revised Objective:
NA
3.3 Original Components:
The project consists of two main components: (a) national elements; and (b) regional elements.
(a)    National Elements. The national elements included:
1-    Physical elements:
(i)    construction or rehabilitation of sheds to store equipment for combating
oil spills (floating booms, dispersant, skimmer heads, accessories, etc);
(ii)   provision of oil spill response and cleanup equipment and dispersant,
-2-



and oil spill response training;
(iii)   rehabilitation of the deballasting  station located in the port of
Mohammedia to receive and handle ballast waters and bilge waters;
2- Institutional element:
(i)    Oil spill National Contingency Plan;
(ii)    Monitoring and compliance: The regulatory mechanism included  two
elements: (i) monitoring capability; and (ii) an environmental
management framework.
(b) Regional Elements. Preparation and implementation of a program designed to provide a
multilateral        framework within which the activities referred to in (a) are developed within a
common approach:
(i)    Regional oil spill environmental sensitivity and contingency plans; and
(ii)    Training.
The project was the first experience in its kind in the region. In that sense it was innovative in its design
and conception. The physical as well as the institutional components of the project were designed in
close consultation with the executing agency, and local and regional authorities. All components and
activities were carried out satisfactorily, and were the key factors in strengthening the country's capacity
to handle oil pollution. The project as such increased the awareness of the environmental authority to the
threat of oil pollution and is considered the most important vehicle for abiding by intemational regulations
and enforcing their implementation.
Physical components successfully implemented included the construction of sheds, and purchase of oil
spill response and cleanup equipment and dispersant. Training on operating the equipment was included
in the purchase contracts. Regarding the modernization of treatment facilities and recycling of oily
residues, the deballasting station in Mohammedia was rehabilitated to meet MARPOL standards for
treating ballast waters.
The main national element was the development and implementation of oil spill National Contingency
Plan (NCP). The plan incorporates the concept of risk assessment to identify and prioritize key actions to
be taken at both the port and national levels. The monitoring element, including auditing of sea waters
through sample analysis of oil content, was carried out by selected national laboratories. A baseline of
data and measuring locations needed to assess the project's impact on improving the quality of sea
water was established in designated areas agreed upon with the Bank. Reports on the findings of the
analysis have been produced every six months. The environmental management element has
strengthened the technical elements of port and national regulations, by developing mechanisms for cost
recovery and financial sustainability.
The regional element included two major elements: the RCP and training. The RCP intends to serve as a
template to link the national plans of the three countries. Elements of the RCP and the NCP include
appropriate responses to protect sensitive coastal resources, and potential for transport of spilled product
to other local or foreign ports. These plans include linkage of equipment and manpower to regional needs
and identification of external sources of assistance. Part of this task has consisted of ensuring that
equipment purchased under the project is the same in the three countries, and training courses and
simulation exercises have been undertaken jointly. These have further promoted the concept of a
regional approach to spill response. A joint cooperation agreement was signed among the ports of
Algiers, Arzew, Bejaia and Skikda (Algeria), ODEP (Morocco), and "Office de la Marine Marchande et
des Ports" (OMMP - Tunisia), defining the conditions and procedures for using all available equipment
and personnel to combat accidental oil spills. The cooperation agreement identifies responsibilities in
case of accidental oil spills regarding exchange of information, mobilizing of equipment, actions by each
party, etc.
Training needs have been provided for those responsible for combating oil spills and for controlling
-3-



navigation traffic, deballasting stations, and oil terminals. Three main groups participated in the
program: Level I includes management personnel of port enterprises, supervising officers managing the
civil protection function, and those responsible for coordination of the intervention in case of an
accidental oil spill. Level II includes port officers and civil protection staff responsible for organizing and
managing the protection of coastal siles. Level IlIl includes ground staff of the port enterprises and
assistant civil protection officers likely to be managing the cleanup of sites or to put the equipment into
operation. Training was carried out on a regional basis so as to familiarize the personnel with working
together using the same equipment ancl procedures. Training that was carried out locally made the fullest
use of existing vocational and technical institutions and facilities.
3.4 Revised Components:
There was no revision in project components.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
No review was done.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project achieved all its objectives regarding regional cooperation, standardization of approach, and
strengthening of national and regional capacity to handle oil pollution and comply with the MARPOL
requirements regarding the discharge of oil into the Mediterranean. The most important outcomes are:
(i) prevention as well as preparedness to combat oil spills systems are in place, (ii) enactment of a NCP,
(iii) preparation of an advanced draft FICP, and (iv) joint training carried out for regional staff from the
three particpating countries on operating the contingency plan and preventing and cleaning up oil spills.
Bi-annual reports on sea water analysis (oil content in the water) have been satisfactory and regularly
provided, and effluent from deballasting stations do not exceed 15 ppm. Cooperation is considered
highly satisfactory. CRCP members meet regularly and have been able to handle regional procurement,
and have succeeded in ensuring continuous coordination among involved administrations in their
respective countries.
The project has contributed to efficient cooperation among concemed administrations and within the
region to prevent and control oil pollution. The development of a sub-regional working group and
organization for joint training has contributed to enhancing marine pollution management through
development of a common approach and mechanisms. The project has improved the country's
capabilities to deal with accidental oil spills and has provided equipment and facilities to collect and treat
oily ballast and bilge waters, thus reducing hydrocarbon contamination in the Mediterranean. The project
has created the foundation for permanent cooperation in the region in terms of monitoring and
compliance auditing, state of marine pollution reporting, and a common approach to spill response. It has
also potentially met the GEF objective of protecting international waters, and is responsible for the
re-refining of recovered oily materials in concert with local and national waste management programs.
Its well-identified components have helped to strengthen and enhance port and national regulations,
regulatory mechanisms, and the linkage between environmental monitoring and management.
4.2 Outputs by components:
All originally identified components have been completed satisfactorily. Because of cost savings,
additional means identified in the feasibility study have been procured. The regional components have
been completed to the satisfaction of all concerned parties, including training and procurement of
standardized equipment and dispersant for combating oil spills. One exercise simulating oil spills to test
new equipment and the NCP was organized during project implementation, at the port of Mohammedia.
The project is closed on December 31, 1999. The detailed list of equipment procured and total personnel
trained are in Annex 7.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The project provides significant, although not quantified, economic benefits through provision of
- 4-



environmental benefits. While formal economic and financial returns analysis (environmental economic
benefit, and financial retums were not required for projects of the pilot phase) have not been attempted
for the SAR and the ICR, it is widely recognized that pollution impacts all aspects of the marine
economy, from fishery to recreation. Maintenance of and improvements to the existing coastal marine
environmental are necessary for the continued success of the coastal fishery and tourism, a major
industry in Morocco and neighboring countries. Further, methods and protocols for improving the quality
of the marine environment, as achieved by the project, will serve as a model for establishing similar
facilities in other Mediterranean ports.
The development of a generic oil spill contingency and response led the Govemment of Morocco to
implement the plan on a nationwide basis for all ports. Further, the govemment plans to organize annual
oil spill response exercises at the national level, thereby continuing to enhance the skills of port authority
staff to respond to oil spills.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No formal FRR has been attempted for the SAR and the ICR. The project was based on the need to
address potential negative environmental impacts of discharged ballast and bilge waters, as well as
accidental oil spills, on the southwestem part of the Mediterranean, and the lack of resources to tackle
this issue of global importance. Given the competing demands of the various sectors on their national
budgets, the Maghreb countries were reluctant to, on their own, allocate funds to combat the problem of
marine pollution. The availability of grant funds reinforced the governments' commitment to participate in
reducing the risk of marine pollution. Pollution funds have been set up, and decrees and laws regarding
fees and fines to be paid by polluters have been revised and enforced. A model for recovering the
operating and investment cost of the deballasting station has been developed for port authorities.
Proposals for port tariff adjustments to progressively cover the cost of environmental protection are
being made at the beginning of each fiscal year.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The GOM undertook several actions during preparation and implementation of the project, including the
creation of a pollution fund and enactment of the NCP, and the creation of specialized department in the
Ministry of Environment and ODEP dealing with marine and land based pollution.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Only one factor that partially affected implementation of the joint training program is worth mentioning. It
is related to the security issue in Algeria, which delayed the training scheduled to take place in Algiers by
almost a year. A joint effort undertaken by the Bank and Algerian authorities to overcome the security
issue reassured the consultant that it would be safe to carry out the delayed sessions. The training was
completed in June and September 1999.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project included several elements to be implemented directly through ODEP (national components)
as the implementing agency, and through ODEP as a member of the CRCP (regional components,
including training, studies, and procurement of standardized equipment). This made the project complex
and difficult to implement. Several factors thus affected the project.
(a)   Factors that had a positive influence on the project included:
(i) GOM and ODEP already had an established regulatory regime and institutional setup.
Building on this, the Govemment of Morocco is now implementing a strategy with actions that will reduce
the risk of major environmental hazards and stop major causes of pollution. It has formulated a
comprehensive institutional and legal framework that permits better environmental management and law
enforcement, as well as enhancing institutional cooperation at the national and regional levels. The
- 5 -



overall objective of the policy and strategy consists of strengthening coordination among state and
private institutions at the regional and national levels, in order to improve environmental management
and tackle environmental problems, defining incentives and encouraging implementation of pilot
environmental projects locally and natioiiwide, and strengthening and enhancing institutional cooperation
at the national and regional levels, in order to gain better control over activities that affect the
environment.
(ii) To be able to implement all provisions of MARPOL 73/78, both current and proposed, GOM
recognized the need to improve the efficiency of existing facilities for waste treatment and reception, and
the need to purchase environmental monitoring and cleanup equipment, and develop oil spill
contingency and response plans and training.
(iii) Through this project, Morocco has established a long and fruitful working relationship within
the institutions and agencies in charge of environment, and with the two other participating countries,
through establishment of the CRCP and the mutual agreement for cooperation among port authorities.
This established relationship has created deep trust and confidence within the country's institutions and
among the countries in the region, which was critical to the project's success and made implementation
smoother.
(b) There were also some less positive factors:
(i) All aspects of maritime pollution prevention and combat require considerable investments to
meet requirements set by international conventions, many of which conflict with the demands of
continuing economic growth. This competition for funds means that investments in environmental
improvements are still difficult to promote.
(ii) While the port authorities had responsibility for providing waste reception facilities, the cost
of running such facilities make it difficult to implement cost recovery principles for investments and
operations.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The well-structured and well-managecl implementing agency, ODEP, with significant experience in
dealing with Bank projects, made project preparation and implementation a successful undertaking.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The project was estimated to cost US$6.3 million equivalent, including physical and price contingencies,
of which US$5.6 million equivalent wias in foreign currency and US$0.7 million equivalent in local
currencies. The actual figures at closing were as follows: US$6.7 million equivalent, of which US$5.5
million and US$1.2 million were in foreign and local currency respectively. The increase in local currency
shows the government effort and willingness to expend its investment in oil pollution prevention and
control activities. Changes in foreign currency is due to the variation of the exchange rate between SDRs
and US dollars. A summary of project oasts is given below and details are given in Annex 2. The above
costs are net of taxes and customs duties, as the government waived taxes and duties on all items
procured under the project. The costs reflect actual prices using the prevailing exchange rate during
project implementation. The foreign exchange cost of the project was financed through SDR 4.1 million,
equivalent to US$5.6 million; concessional funding was secured from GET core funds, and the local
exchange cost (MDH1 1.0, equivalent to US$1.2 million) was financed by the implementing agency.
97 percent of the grant was disbursed ty the closing date. The balance of .09SDRmillion was canceled.
The balance was due to savings incurred during implementation because of the regional procurement
process followed to purchase standardized equipment for the three participating countries, and because
of the more favorable international competition and price market.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The existing institutions in Morocco, including the implementing agency, have the capacity and the skills
to operate and maintain the facilities and equipment provided under the project. In addition, the project
provided training to implement and operate the national and regional contingency plans. Technical
assistance was geared toward developing mechanisms to achieve financial sustainability for the facilities
and regional organizations. The government and the executing agency are implementing study
recommendations to cover investment and operating costs. Meanwhile, the legal and institutional
framework, including an environmental fund, have been enacted and will provide the additional funds
needed to operate and maintain the facilities and equipment supplied under the project. Furthermore, the
project make the environmental authority aware of the threat posed by oil pollution. This has resulted into
an additional investment financed through local funds, including port contingency plans, periodic testing
of equipment, and periodic simulation exercises to test the NCP, and request from the countries in the
South Mediterranean Sea (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia) to prepare and implement a
follow project in the region.
The development of a generic oil spill contingency and response led the GOM to implement the plan on
a nationwide basis for all ports. Further, GOM held several national oil spill response exercises in
Mohammedia and Tangiers. The evident success of this exercise (attended by representatives from
REMPEC, CEDRE, Oil industry, MOIG) will shift the program to an annual series, thereby further
enhancing the skills of port authority staff to respond to oil spills.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Based on the foreseen results of the project and its highly satisfactory rating for development and
implementation objectives, GEF provided funds to carry out a feasibility study to expand the benefit of
the project to the south Mediterranean, which includes Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. A
PCD has been prepared and approved by the Bank management; however, the GEF Secretariat, in order
to coordinate among international waters projects, decided not to go with the project until the final result
of the ongoing studies in the straits of Malaca and Bosphoros are published. The first phase of the
proposed project would consist of an institutional arrangement enabling the five countries and the oil
industry to cooperate in protecting the Mediterranean and preventing oil spills.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank identified key issues and prepared the project in a timely fashion. The project was identified in
December 1992 and appraised in August 1993, with the staff appraisal report issued in October 1993.
The grant was approved on April 6, 1994 and made effective on May 20, 1994.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision was also efficient. Bank performance was enhanced by use throughout the project of
the same team, consisting of a financial analyst and a port engineer. This provided a consistency of
approach to the issue and an assurance that the project design would be successfully implemented.
Further, team members had worked with the CRCP and other involved authorities and thus had
established a successful working relationship. The project implementation was supervised on a regular
site-visit basis, with supervision staff including the two key project staff and CRCP members. The annual
average input of staff resources for supervision was 9 staff-weeks, which included various specialties
(see annex 4). This was possible because supervision of three Bank-financed port projects was
coordinated with supervision of this project.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall, the Bank performance was satisfactory. Frequent supervision missions and contact with
countries' authorities and CRCP members smoothed the path for sound project preparation and
- 7 -



implementation.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The strong involvement of the borrower during preparation phase of the project was one of the major
aspects of project success. Its close follow-up of the feasibility study financed under a PPF grant
contributed to the appropriate definition of project scope and components. In addition, its commitment to
the regional activity was a cornerstone for the creation of the CRCP, which became the implementing
body for the regional component of the project.
7.5 Government implementation performantce:
With the exception of the approval of a final Regional Contingency Plan, borrower implementation of the
national and regional components of the project was excellent and timely. The preparation of the final
RCP draft experienced some delays due to difficulty in reaching consensus within each administration
involved, but the final draft was completed before the dosing of the project. It will constitute the major
step towards implementation of regional cooperation provision in the UMA treaty.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
During 1994 and early 1995, the Moroccan authorities focused on facility design, equipment
procurement, and training. Most procurement processes were well advanced by the first implementation
supervision mission, and were essentially complete by the mid 1995. With respect to equipment
procurement for the waste facilities, the borrower was able to obtain excellent prices through competitive
bidding. With respect to monitoring equipment, ODEP has appropriate purchasing power through
consolidated bid packages. This format generated competitive prices and savings have been made
through joint training programs and joint procurement of equipment.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
One of the key objectives of the project was to use successful application of various aspects as a model
for other ports within Morocco. This objective was met and exceeded. The proposed oil spill contingency
and response plan has been made the ,iesignated national model and is being introduced in other ports.
Further, the successful development and implementation of the project components, both national and
regional, provide a model for other countries to use as part of their efforts to manage and reduce ship
and port wastes. As shown in Annex 7, covenants were generally met. The borrower's performance is
evaluated as satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
This project was funded mainly by a grant from GEF and was the first major funded project within GEF's
"Pollution Reduction in Intemational Waters" category. It can be judged to have clearly met GEF criteria.
The regional approach of the project has proven to have a high demonstration value. Through enhancing
and upgrading national and regional standards, policies, and waste monitoring and rehabilitation of waste
reception and handling facilities, the project has convinced GOM of the environmental benefit of the
investments. This has triggered adoption of a multiport program to be implemented over the coming
years, including a ship waste tracking system, port oil spill contingency and response plan for major
Moroccan ports, and oil spill response training exercises for all ports and other relevant agencies.
Further, GOM will be implementing a port fee schedule on a national basis with conjunction of
environmental fund, provide a reserve fund for expanding existing facilities, construct new facilities,
expand training, and purchase and rehabilitate response equipment.
Success of the project can be attributed to both the borrower's and the Bank's approach to the project.
The Bank utilized a multi-disciplinary team of a financial analyst, port engineer, and an environmental
specialist. This provided consistency throughout, from design and appraisal to implementation. While
- 8 -



several administrations and agencies were involved in the project, key leadership was provided by
ODEP, ensuring a national consistency and regional coordination as active member of the CRCP.
Port and coastal environmental management is inherently complex due to overlapping jurisdictions of
different departments and ministries, port authorities, and private interests. If Tunisia, Algeria, and
Morocco had not strongly committed themselves to the project and had not had existing efficient port
institutions, and if they had not created the CRCP base upon which the project could be constructed, this
project would have been much more difficult to implement. Replication and/or extension of this project to
other countries can be successful, if there are established regulatory and management regimes suitable
to the task. Alternatively, such regimes should be first established and stabilized.
Management of ships and port wastes is only one aspect of port and coastal maritime environmental
management. The success of a ship waste project can be further enhanced by (a) adoption of an
environmental coastal zone and port management plan (a concept already being initiated by the Xiamen
Special Economic Zone); (b) implementation of other pollution control activities (e.g., oil spill response);
and (c) control and management of land-based sources of pollution.
