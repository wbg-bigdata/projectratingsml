INTERNATIONAL DEVELCPIMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECaTIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TH-L REX BLIC OF
RWANDA FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Rwanda for the equivalent of
US$3.8 imillion on standard IDA terms to help finance an agricultural
development project.
PART I - THE hONCMY
2.        A reDort entitled "Recent Economic Develooments and Prospects
of Rwanda, (AE-23a) was distributed on April 20, 1972.   Country- data are
given in Annex I. An economic mission is now in Rwanda to update our
information.
3.        Rwanda became independent in 196?.   In July 1973 the army took
power and ended the regirie which had been governing the country S7nce
independence.  A new government has been foried in which several high
officials of the former regime have been maintained. The change in
government was not violent and economic activity has not been affected.
In late August a Bank mission visited the country to review the re-
ltions between Rwanda and the Bank Group. The Government has con-
firmed that it is determined to pursue policies favorable to economic
and social development. Aid agencies active in Rwanda are continuing
their activities and are satisfied with project implementation.
4.        Rwanda is one of the poorest countries in Africa with about $60
per capita income, and is included in the UN list of the 25 Least Developed
countries. The economy is predominantly agricultural. Subsistence produc-
tion accounts for more than half of GDP. Coffee has been for several
decades the most inDortant cash crop and currently accoznts for more than
half of export earnings. Tea and pyrethrum were introduced recently and
their production is increasing.  Prospects for livestock developmrent are
also good. The only significant non-agriclltural resources are limited
quantities of cassiterite and wolfram ore which are being exploited for
export.



5.        The population density in Rwanda is 144 per square kilometer,
one of the highest in Africa. Nearly all the arable land is occupied
except for areas where settlement has been hampered by the tsetse fly.
The available farmland is about one hectare per family and pastures
are over-grazed. The population is increasing at a very high rate
of over 3Y/ per year, thus putting further pressure on land. Over
90,5 of Rwanda's population is rural; most live close to subsistence
level and protein-caloric malnutrition is widespread. The country
has only limited domestic resources available for investment.
6.        Apart from land scarcity, another constraint to development in
Rwanda is the shortage of -trained and experienced manpower, particularly
in the civil service. Unt:il independence in 1962 Rwanda was administered
jointly with Burundi as part of the Belgian Trust Territory of Ruanda-
Urundi. After the departure of the Belgians, the Government administration
was staffed anew and for a number of years suffered from a lack of competent
executives. As a result of greater efforts in education and training,
the shortage of qualified manpower is gradually being alleviated.
7.        Another significant constraint to economic development in Rwanda
is its landlocked situation and distance from the sea, with resulting high
transDort costs. Most externail trade is through Mombasa, some 1,700 km
away, on the Indian Ocean, the rest being directed to Dar-es-Salaam.
d.        TnTe economy,which had been adversely affected after
independence by social disturbances and a slow down in coffee
production, recovered rapidly after 1964.   Real GDP grew by about
6% per year in the 1965-1970 period. This growth represented increases
in incomes due to good coffee crops combined with rising export
prices for coffee and wolfram.   Income growth slowed down to 3.5*
in L971, mainly owing to a decline in world market prices for
the major export products and particularly coffee.   In 197?,
coffee production probably fell to 13,000 tons as compared to
15,700 tons in 1971, and a further slow down in GDP growth
probably took place despite favorable export prices for coffee.
In view of the existing constraints and the uncertainties of
future coffee prices, the rate of growth of the economy over the
next few years will probably not exceed 5^.
9.       Rwanda's first development plan for 1966-70 is still being
implemented as a number of projects have yet to be completed. The
Government has completed the draft of a second five-year plan. In this
plan, the Government continues to give priority to diversifying the
economy and increasing exports. In agriculture, emphasis is placed on
further expansion on tea and pyrethrum cultivation where arable land
is still available.  Coffee production is expected to increase through
yield improvements and concentration in areas most suitable to coffee
growing. High priority is also given to increasing livestock pro-
duction. Livestock raising and ranching will be encouraged on non-



arable lands, particularly in the eastern regions. In the transport
sector, the Government plans to improve road maintenance and to up-
grade road connections with the major export routes towards the Indian
Ocean.
10.       The success of the new development plan, once it is approved, and
future economic performance in general, are largely dependent on the volume,
nature and utilization of external aid. In view of the poverty and the
slow growth of the economy,the Government will not be able, in the near
future, to generate sufficient revenue to finance even its recurrent
expenditures, for which it receives budgetary support from Belgium,
especially for education, public health, agriculture and transporta-
tion. Pablic investment will therefore have to be financed almost
entirely by foreign aid. The Govermnent can reasonably expect to
receive an increasing volume of foreign assistance, particularly
from Belgium and the European Development Fund (FED). Foreign assistance
disbursements increased from $6 million in 1968 to $10 million in 1971.
The main constraint to investment is not likely to be the avail-
ability of project aid but the difficulties the Government may
encounter, owing to shortages of approprintely trained manpower, in
building up and staffing institutions geared to efficient preparation
and implementation of investment projects. Technical assistance
should continue to be provided on a large scale, while increasing
emphasis should be put on training local personnel.
11.       Rwanda is too poor to borrow on conventional terms, and all
aid should be provided on very soft terms. Most of the aid so far af-
forded to Rwanda has, in fact, been in the fonn of. grants so that its
external debt is small. Disbursed debt amounted, at the end of 1971,
to $?.4 million; including undisbursed, external debt amnounted to
$11.5 million, of which $9.3 million was accounted for by the IDA
credit for the Kigali-Gatuna road project. Debt service represented
less than 7''7 of export earnings in 1'71 and this ratio is not expected
to increase over the next few years.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN WANDA
12.       Since Bank Group assistance to Rwanda started in 1970, the country
has received two IDA credits, totalling $12.3 million. Annex II contains a
sumary of the two IDA credits as of August 31, 1973 and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects. There have been no Bank loans or IFC
investments.



13.      The Bank Groun s initial development efforts in Rwanda have
focussed on the imorovement of the road sector on which the country is
almost entilrely dependent for the movement of its domestic and foreign
trade.  The first IDA credit, of ;,'.-3 miillion, was made irn June 1970 for
a road constri-ction project linking the capital, Kigali, withl the
Uganda border at Gatuna.  Tne second, of $3.0 million, was made in March
197? for a highway maintenalice project, based oIn a UiDP-financed
mainternance study for w1lich the Ban'< was Executing Agency. The
first oroject is cofinarced by 3algium and the second by the Federal
Republic of German4y and the UNLP. Despite some dele-ys in project
implementation, boths projects are no, progressing satisfactorily.
iL.       The program for future IDA operations emphasizes transport
and agriculture which are crucial for increase in production exports
and employment. A third highway project -to reconstruct the Ruhengeri-
Gisenyi road will be presented to the Executive Directors this fiscal
year. In addition, we are currently assisting in preparing an in-
tegrated agricultural development project to improve production of
food crops.  Assistance to agricultural education is also envisaged.
PAR?T III - THE AGRICUL17IPAL SECTOR
15.       Agriculture is the principal source of employment, production
and exports. In 1970-71 it contributed about US$1?0 million or 55% to
GDP. The value of agricultural exnports amounted to about $15 million,
or 65-/o of export earnings, with coffee accounting for about 87% of
total agricultural exports.
16.       Most of the fanrland is used to grow food, such as bananas,
beans and sweet potatoes, mainly for peasant subsistence. Farning is
predominantly carried out on simall famlily holdings.  Half of the
holdings also grow cash crops, principaIlly coffee and also tea and
pyrethrum. Yields are low and primitive production methods and in-
adequate extension services hamper intensification of agricultural
production. Total production per farm household is about $?00
annually of which about $t4 is cash income. Although per capita
income in Rwanda averages about $60, per capita income in the
agricultural sector is less.
17.       Due to the heavy population pressure and the resulting lack of
arable land,increases in -i'arm production can orLy be achieved by inprmving
farming methods. The Government attaches high priority to the improvement



of farm productivity. With the assistance of foreign aid, mainly from the
European Development Fund (FED) and Belgium, the Government has
engaged in the establishment of t"paysannats," which are Government-
organized settlements of farmers,to intensify agricultural production.
To establish a paysannat, an appropriate area is chosen and invest-
ments are made in infrastructure such as roads and water supply and
in advisory services. A suitable cash crop is selected and plots
of 1.5 to 2 ha are located on both sides of a central roadtrack which
forms the axis along which the community is built. A Paysannat Authority
appointed by the Government is put in charge of the community. The farmers
enter into a contract with the Paysannat Authority under which each receives
a plot under perpetual usufruct, with land ownership remaining with the
State. In return, farmers commit themselves to follow the paysannat's rules
regarding crop rotation and maintenance, supervised by the Paysannat
Authority.
18.       To date, over 36,000 families have been established in more than
30 paysannats. The majority of paysannats are growing coffee as cash
crop; pyrethrum, tea and groundnuts are also grown. Income per family
in paysannats     is      generally higher than average.   However, crop
yields remain below what could be achieved, as farmers still use traditional
tools and techniques. Emphasis in future paysannat projects should therefore
be placed on the improvement of production methods through better extension
services and agricultural education.
19.       To reduce  the country's dependence on coffee as the major foreign
exchange earning crop, the Government is making serious efforts to diversify
agricultural production. This aim is reflected in the proposed project.
With the assistance of FED and the UNDP, the Government has increased the
production of tea and pyrethrum, an ingredient for insecticides derived from
dried flowers which is in high demand. However, although tea and pyrethrum
yields are increasing, production is still too limited for any significant
diversification of Rwanda's agriculture and exports.
Livestock Subsector
20.       Animal husbandry has been a traditional activity in Rwanda.   Over
700,000 head of cattle, mainly of the long-horn Ankole type, feed on about
820,000 ha of overgrazed pasture land spread over the country. The greater
part of the national herd consists of small herds owned by Hutu tribesmen.
The annual growth rate of the national herd has been less than 0.8% during
the last two decades, as compared to the population growth of over 3% per year.
21.       Livestock and milk production contribute about 6% of GDP.   Total
annual beef production is about 12,000 tons, of which 9,200 tons are
consumed domestically, which is only 2.5 kg per capita. This compares with
about the same amount in Burundi and 1.8 kg in Zaire. About 20,000 head
of cattle, representing some 2,800 tons of beef, are exported on the hoof
each year.  Annual milk production is about 35,000 tons, and is mainly
used for the subsistence of the farming families; together with meat, it
provides an important protein source to the population.



-6-
22.       Although beef prices are fairly low, demand is limited by the low
level of incomes. Demand may increase as a result of population growth
and is expected to rise by at least 1500 tons by 1975. Since beef
production is stagnant, some of this increase may have to be met from
cattle heretofore exported. Due to the scarcity of pasture land, any
significant increase in production would have to come from improved methods
of animal husbandry.
23.       Rwandese cattle  suffer  from malnutrition and disease,
mainly East Coast Fever and trypanosomiasis. These diseases
can be controlled by reguLar dipping and eradication of the tsetse
fly. The Ankole breed is fairly resistant to these diseases and
provides an adequate basis for livestock improvement.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Backgrojd
24.       A report entitled "Appraisal of an Agricultural Develop-
ment Project, Rwanda" (No. PA-112b ) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A Credit and Project Summary is pro-
vided at Annex III.
25.       The project, wh:ich would be IDA's first for agriculture
in Rwanda, was prepared by the Government with the assistance
of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. It was initially appraised by an
IDA mission in June 1971. A $3.3 million credit for this pro-
ject was negotiated in February 1972. The Government's delega-
tion was headed by the Rwandese Ambassador in Washington, Mr.
Nkundabagenzi.
26.       After negotiations, the Government rejected the agree-
mnent reached on the establishmenit of an autonomous agency for the
organization and management of the project. Instead, the Govern-
ment proposed to appoint a foreign consultiing firm to help execute
the project within existing Government institutions. However, as
the organization and management of the proposed project involve a
variety of comrplex functions which require effCicient day-to-day
managemrent (see paragraphs b1-)43), in addition to technical
expertise, the Association sought to convince -the Govern,nent that
an independent Rwandese age; cy should be established in order to
achieve adequate implementation of the project.  Following IDA
missions in May and October 1`72, and in May and August 1273, the
Government and the Association reached final agreement on estab-
lishing an autonomous project authority narTed TOG-fice pour la
Valorisation Pastorale et Agricole du Mutarall (OVARA.l). The
organization tormul.a agreed upon, that of creating a national oCfice,
or board, is not new to Rwanda and is, for instance, successfullv
used in the case of coffee marketing.



- 7 -
27.       The proposed project consists of the development, over
a period of five years, of food and cash crops and livestock pro-
duction through organized cropping and ranching settlement in the
Mutara region, west of the Akagera National Park in the northeast
of Rwanda.
?t3*      Specifically, the project would comprise:
a) the establishment of a "paysannat" comprising 4?25c plots
and about 120 group rcnches, including infrastructure consisting of
plot and grazing area lay out, road construction, water supply, staff
housing and cattle handling facilities;
b) technical and marketing services for project partic-
ipants;
c) the establishment and operation of a bull-breeding
ranch; and
d) tsetse fly eradication from the project area and a
study of the feasibility of completely eradicating the tsetse fly
from Rwanda.
Project Area
29 .      The Mutara region (see map attached) is a rolling savannah at an
average altitude of 1400 m. Average rainfall is 800 mm per year with a
three-month dry season occurring between June and September.
Temperature averages around 21 degrees C with a maximum of 330 and
a minimum of 120 . The area has good arable soils for crop pro-
duction and also good grazing land. The project area, about
L5,000 ha, would provide organized settlements for about 5,700
f'amilies and grazing facilities for about 23,0C0) head of cattle.
A quarter of the area would be for the development of small
family f'arms for food and cash crops production (paysannats)while
the remainder would be allotted to small group ranches.
Paysannat Subproject
30.       The paysannat subproject would be located in the 12,000 ha
southern part of thie project area. About 4(.)(! km of dirt roads would
be constructed in the area where the plots would be sited; two sirmple
bridges wqould be built over small rivers.  A water supp].y system would
channel water from various springs to the inhabitated areas.  Staff
housing and vehicles would be provided for the Project Authority, OVAPAI.
31 .      Two cash crops have been selected for cultivation by the
Paysannat, principally groundnuts and coffee. Groundnuts are becoming an
inicreasingly valuable cash crop and are sold as raw material for ground-
nut oil. Coffee, which is still the largest source of monetary income



for the rural population, would be produced in the higher areas of the
Mutara region. Plot size and cropping rotation would be adapted to the
growing of these cash crops with a cropping program that would yield a
net cash income per family of about $120 at full development, five years
after project inception. Part of each plot would be used for subsistence
farmning.
32.        The project area is one of the few areas of Rwanda which contain
good arable soils and are under populated. Cattlemen and farmers currently
living in the area would have priority in the selection of settlers. We
do not expect the project to displace any current inhabitants, since those
we are aware of meet the main selection criteria of cattle raising or
farming experience, physical fitness and good repute. Furthermore, in
cooperation with the UN High Commission for Refugees, the Government would
settle about 1500 refugee families from Burundi in the area. According to
the rules of the paysannat system, plots will be given in usufruct.
Settlers would be provided with working tools, seleeted seeds and house
building materials. They would also regularly receive technical and mar-
keting advice. The plotholder would have to pay an annual settlement fee
of 1200 RwF (about $14.50) and undertake to carry out prescribed cropping
practices and communal workS. Rights and obligations of the settlers would
be specified in a cont;act between each of them and OVAPAM. During
negotiations the Government has agreed that the form of these contracts
would be submitted to IDA for approval prior to any resettlement in the
Paysannat area.
Group Ranch Subproject
33.       Three fourths of the project area, mainly hilltops and valley
bottoms, comprising about 31,000 ha, are suitab:le for cattle grazing.
This area would be used for the developme-nt of about 10 ranches for
groups of about 12 graziers, each with a herdsize permitting efficient
management f or each group. The subprojecti prcvides for road ccnstruc-
tion, water supply, cattle diipping and handling facili-ties as well as
vehicles and staff housing.
3L.       To make use of the arable land available in the group ranches,
these would also include a number of cropping plots of about 1.3 ha each
for subsistence farning on which participants would have individual
usufruct rights. Each cropping plot would carry an inseparable grazing
right entitling the plot holder to graze a speci.fied numnber of cattle
on adjacent communal grazing land. Participants in a group ranch would
retain individual ownership of their cattle, but the cattle in the
group would be managed as one herd.
35.       A typical herd would be about 230 head including 65 cows and
two bulls, which is adequate for good management in Rwanda. The 120
ranches would have a total of about 1,440 part'icipants.Annual net cash
income per grazier .iamily is estimated at $2L40 at full development
five years after project inception.



-9-
36.       The Mutara region is at present occupied by nomadic cattlemen,
who are good herdsmen and own the better cattle. They would be eligible
for participation in the project. Each group of graziers would be sup-
plied with cattle, fencing material, cultivation tools and other equip-
ment, and would have access to cattle dips. Veterinary services would
be available at an annual charge of 265 Rw. Frcs. (about $3) per head of
cattle. All groups would follow the herd management practices prescribed
by OVAPAM under the latter's supervision.
37.       Under a contract with OVAPAM, the graziers would obtain
cropping and grazing rights including a plot usufruct similar to that
of the paysannat. In addition, each grazier would enter into a partner-
ship agreement to form a group ranch, and each group ranch would agree
with OVAPAM to practice good livestock and pasture management.
Graziers would pay an average annual fee of 3900 RwF (about $47)
for their participation in this project. Holding of the land by
beneficiaries would be subject to continuation of good manage-
ment practices. During negotiations the Government has agreed that
standard forms for these agreements would be submitted to IDA for
approval prior to any resettlement in the Group ranching area.
36.       To improve cattle, a bull-breeding ranch would be established
on 480 ha in a suitable part of the project area. The ranch would
cross Sahiwal bulls and Ankole cows. The Ankole foundation herd would
be purchased from a government ranch and the Sahiwal bulls would be
purchased from Kenya on a negotiated contract basis. Young bulls
would be sold at cost to the group ranches. The bull-breeding ranch
would also recquire investment in infrastructure such as roads, fencing,
water distribution, cattle dipping and handling facilities, and staff
housing.
Tsetse Fly Eradication
39.       About 12,000 ha in the south of the project area are in-
fested with the tsetse fly which lives on acacia trees. Eradication of
the fly would start by felling trees so as to create a 3 km wide barrier
across the fly belt. Acacia trees in the remaining part of the fly
belt in the project area would then be sprayed from the ground with a
suitable insecticide. The eradication would be carried out by project
staff under technical guidance from ISAR ("Institut des Science Agro-
nomiques du Rwanda"), which has eradicated the tsetse fly successfully
in other parts of Rwanda. To this end, ISAR and OVAPAM would enter into
a contract which is to be submitted to the Association for approval.
4ch.     To improve human and animal health in the eastern part
of Rwanda and to permit further agricultural development, complete tsetse
fly eradication is necessary. For this, a feasibility study is required
to determine the location and intensity of the fly, as are some field
trials on methods of extermination. An aerial photographic survey of



- 10 -
the area is necessary to identify areas of tsetse fly implantation. ISAR
would carry out the feasibility study, but IDA funds for the study
would only be released once arrangements for the aerial photographic
survey have been finalized. Belgium has agreed to finance the aerial
photography.
Organization and Management
Li.       The project would be executed by OVAPAM; its establishment
under statutes acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of effective-
ness of the credit. During negotiations, a draft decree for OVAPAM
was discussed and agreed upon between the Government and IDA. OVAPAM
would be directed by a Board of Directors chaired by the Minister of
Agriculture or his delegate, and would include representatives of
the Ministries of Finance and Commerce, Planning, Social Affairs, and
of the Central Bank.  OVAPAM's management would comprise a Project
Director, a Ranching Manager, a Paysannat Manager, a Marketing Of-
ficer, a Chief Development Officer, a Chief Accountant, and a Chief
Mechanic.  OVAPAMI s technical staff would mainly comprise veterinary
technicians and agronomists who would be seconded by the Government.
The Project Director and two representatives of the participants
would also be members of the Board.
L?.       OVAPAM would have four divisions dealing with the paysannats;
the grazing ranches and bull breeding, ranch; marketing; and general
services. OVAPAM would be responsible for construction and maintenance
of infrastructure and provision of technical and marketing services. It
would also supervise the participants' management practices, including
the collection of settlement and grazing fees.
4~3.      The settlers would be selected by a committee consisting of
representatives of local authorities, the Project Director and members
of OVAPAMIs staff. Settlers would be farmers selected according to
customary rules applied in other paysannats such as good conduct,
physical fitness and landlessness (see also para. 32).
Technical G ssistance
44.       During negotia1tions the governmient agreed that the emplojannent
of the Project Directcr and the Chief Development OfJficer would be
a condition of credit effectiveness. As a result of the experience
obtained with paysannats in Rwanda, the Government will be able to
recruit the Paysannit M1anager locally.  ilowever, due to the shortage
of rmanageriql skills in Rwanda, it is likely that other senior staff
of OVi,'.PAM will, have to be recruited abroad.  Thierefore, the credit
provides funds for the foreign cost of technical assistants whose



tasks would include training local counterparts. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that qualifications and functions of the
senior staff of OVAPAM and the terms and conditions of their employ-
ment would be subject to IDA approval.
Production and Marketing
45.        All cash crops and cattle produced under the project would
be marketed by OVAPAM. Groundnut production would be sold prin-
cipally to local oil mills. Incremental production Of edible oil
is estimated at 600 metric tons a year at full development after five
years, which would substitute for about one fifth of present oil
imports. Coffee produced by the Paysannat, which would be
only about one percent of Rwanda's present production (about 14,000
tons) is expected to be sold without difficulty. The annual incremental
beef production would be 800 tons carcass weight at full development.
Most of the cattle would be sold on the domestic market and the rest
would be exported on the hoof to the Kivu region of neighboring
Zaire, a traditional and growing market for Rwandese cattle. No export
difficulties are expected, as the products of the Kivu herd cover only
a small part of local demand and are unlikely to increase substantially
in the short to medium term. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that, in order to facilitate the transfer of project cattle
to Zaire, the Government would assign to OVAPAM three holding grounds
of about 20 ha each located near the Zairian border.
Proposed Financing
46.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $h.3 million including
a foreign exchange component of $2.1 million. The proposed IDA credit
would amount to $3.8 million, or about 88% of total project cost.   The
Government would contribute $260,000 equivalent or 6% of total project
cost, including $80,000 for taxes and duties, and participating
graziers would contribute $2h0,000 equivplent for veterinary supplies.
L7.       Out of the credit funds, the Government would lend $2.7
million to OVAPAM, while the remainder of $1.1 million would be used
to finance foreign and local staff seconded to OVAPAM. The sub-
sidiary loan would be repayable to OVAPAM in 35 years, including a
five-year grace period, without interest. OVAPAM would repay these
funds out of settlement and grazing fees and commissions from sales.
The settlement and grazing fees would represent about 12% of the
income of paysannat settlers and 2&' of grazierst income.   These
proposed fees are judged the maximum that can be expected from the
project beneficiaries. At full development five years after project
implementation, each farmer would pay about $14 equivalent to OVAPAIl,
in settlement fees, and each grazier about $95 eouivalent in settle-
ment and grazing fees. During negotiations, the Government and IDA



agreed on a draft subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and OVAPAMi, covering the above terms of financing. The signature of
this agreement would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
L8.       In addition to its financial contribution the Government would
provide the project area with schools and medical facilities in line with
national standards, and would pay for losses incurred by OVAPAN as a result
of possible defaults in fee payments by participants.
Procurement and Disbursement
t9.        Goods would be procured as follows: (i) contracts expected to cost
Less than $2,000 equivalent would be placed upon tne authorization of tiie Project
Director in accordance with normal Government procedures; (ii) contracts expected
to cost between $2,000 and $20,000 equivalent would be tendered among
local suppliers; (iii) contracts estimated to cost $20,000 or more would
be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA guidelines. Items suitable for international competitive bidding
include building and water supply materials and wire fencing, totalling
about $150,000 equivalent. Sahiwal bulls for the bull breeding ranch
would be purchased on a negotiated contract basis, mainly from Kenya,
while Ankole cows would be obtained from a Government ranch.
50.       The credit would be disbursed over a period of 7 years, against
l00's of foreign expenditures and 95% of local expenditures for infra-
structure and equipment for OVAPAM, and tsetse eradication: 100Z of
foreign expenditures for consultants for tsetse eradication and for
expatriate staff; and 90, of total expenditures for local staff and
initial operating expenses.
Economic Benefits
A major benefit of the project would be that beef production,
including the beef equivalent of breeding stock sold, would increase the
estimated annual national beef production of about 12,000 tons by
7%; cattle would be improved through crossing with bulls bred
the Project's bull-breeding ranch. Groundnut production would substitute
for about 2C% of current edible oil imports.
52.       At full development about five years after project implementation,
farmers would earn annual cash incomes of RwF 10,000 (about $120) and
graziers about RwF 20,000 (about $240). This would be four to twelve
times their estimated present cash incomes, in addition to RwF 15,000
(about $180) per year for products used for the participants' own consump-
tion.   The total annual income of the settlers, who are now barely above



- 13 3
subsistence levels, would be raised to about $54 per capita for
farmers and to about $77 per capita for graziers, or on average,
$60 per capita, which is the national average. In addition, settlers
would obtain substantial social benefits such as security of land
tenure, better housing and water supply, health and education facili-
ties. Moreover, the project would generate employment equivalent to
about 10,000 man-years, or about three times the labor input utilized in
the project area at the present time.
53.       The rate of return of the project to the economy has been
estimated at 12.5%. In addition, the country would derive important
non-quantifiable returns such as the conservation of scarce arable land
and grazing pastures and the development of local managerial skills.
Furthermore, implementation of the principle of fee collection in return
for the provision of infrastructure and services would create a useful
precedent which the Government could extend to similar projects. The
feasibility study of total tsetse fly eradication may lead to improving
health and livestock production in the East of Rwanda.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS
54.       The Draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Rwanda and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for under Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed development credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
55.       The Draft Development Credit Agreement reflects the normal
pattern for credits for agricultural development projects. The relending
of proceeds of the credit will be governed by a subsidiary loan agree-
ment between the Government and OVAPAM, satisfactory to the Association.
56.       The following conditions of effectiveness are specified:
(i) establishment of OVAPAM with a charter satisfactory to IDA;
(ii) execution and delivery of the subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and OVAPAM satisfactory to IDA:
(iii) employment of key management staff satisfactory to IDA; and
(iv) transfer of an initial amount equivalent to $100,000 to
OVAPAMI's project account.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

credit.

1970; Closing Date: September 30, 197h.
The project consists of the construction and maintenance
for one year of a paved road between Kigali and Gatuna
(82 km); the purchase of maintenance equipment; consulting
services and supervision of construction. The project is
cofinanced by the Belgian Government ($0.6 million) to
cover Dart of the local cost of the project.
The road construction is being hampered by unforeseen tech-
nical problems, resulting in a delay of at least 10 months.
To overcome these problems, a cost overrun of about 50% of
the construction cost is expected. However, since the con-
tract awarded for construction work amounted to about $5
million as against an estimated $7.7 million at the time of
appraisal, financing will be available for the additional
cost of about $2.5 million.
Credit No. 299-RI     Highway Maintenance Project: $3 million,of March 21, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is the first phase of a highway maintenance
program, providing for reorganizing and strengthening the
Directorate General of Roads and Bridges to enable it to
maintain the national road system, the purchase of maintenance
equipment and supplies, the construction and equipping of
maintenance workshops, and the improvement of maintenance
operations over the 2,200 km national road network. The
project is cofinanced   by the Federal Republic of Germany
($0.5 million),which covers the foreign costs of a central
workshop at Kigali,and the UNDP ($1.1 million) for the pro-
vision of foreign technical assistance. The project is
proceeding satisfactorily.
