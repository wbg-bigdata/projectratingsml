MEMORANDUM AND RECOMIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A NATIONAL LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Chad for SDR 13.2 million (US$18.6 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a national
livestock development project. The project would be cofinanced by ADF for
SDR 8.2 million (US$11.6 million equivalent), by FAC of France for SDR 0.9
million (US$1.3 million equivalent), and by DGIS of the Netherlands for SDR
1.3 million (US$1.8 million equivalent).
2.        Background. Agriculture is the mainstay of the Chadian economy,
contributing in 1985 about half of the GDP. Livestock production, already
contributing about 40Z of agriculture's share in GDP and 30Z of merchandise
exports, is one of the few sectors with an immediate growth potential, as
the necessary livestock population, husbandry skills, markets and feed
resources exist to permit an expansion. However, this potential is
constrained by policy, institutional and infrastructural deficiencies. The
policy constraints, already being addressed by Government as part of the
preparation of this project, concern: (i; the inadequate cost recovery and
inefficient distribution network of the parastatal veterinary distribution
company (MAGAVET), resulting in severe scarcity of veterinary
pharmaceuticals; (ii) the cumbersome system of livestock export procedures
involving export quotas, the monopoly of the livestock export company
(SOTERA), the complex system of export formalities and the high levels of
export taxation, which severely hinder livestock exports and depress
producer prices; and (iii) the system of common land tenure and
Government's policy of free pastoral water, which preclude rangeland
conservation. The institutional and infrastructural deficiencies concern
(i) poor organization, diminished staff skills and lack of operating funds
of the extension service, which consequently does not reach the producers;
(ii) Government's weak central planning and coordination capabilities
resulting in poor aid coordination and sometimes inconsistent policies; and
(iii) MEHP's dilapidated infrastructure and dearth of equipment and
transport facilities. The proposed project would provide Government with
the technical and financial resources to sustain a process of policy
reforms, underpinned by project activities.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project would be fully
consistent with the development strategy agreed upon between the Government
of Chad and IDA and would complement regional activities financed by other
donors. 1DA's involvement would be essential in having the Government
focus on policy and coordination efforts. It would complement the policy
reforms envisaged under the proposed Financial Rehabilitation Credit



- 2 -
(FY89S) by defining and implementing, for the livestock sector, more
appropriate policies in the areas of parastatals, public finance and fiscal
administration. The project would further complement the IDA Cotton
Emergency operation (FY86) in its pursuit of diversification of the
country's production and export base beyond cotton farming.
4.        Project Obiectives.  The proposed project would represent the
first five-year stage of a long-term program to strengthen Chad's livestock
sector. The project's main objective would be to increase national
livestock production, producer income and Government revenue on a
sustainable basis. This would be achieved through a combination of policy
reforms and investments that would lead to improved access by producers to
livestock health and extension services, and by merchants to export
markets. A subsequent objective of the project would be to improve
rangeland utilization and resource management. The project would
strengthen the private and public sectors in the areas of their respective
comparative advantages, i.e., the private sector in input supply and the
prcvision of services to individual herders, and the public sector in
extension, sanitary control and policy planning and coordination. The
project would further institute policy changes aimed at export promotion
and improved cost recovery.
5.        Proiect Description.  The project would combine policy reforms
with investment and inst:tution building activities. The policy reforms
already implemented or still to be implemented under the project would seek
to (i) improve cost recovery for preventive and curative animal health
services rendered by the public sector; (ii) liberalize and privatize the
import and distribution of livestock inputs and most veterinary services;
(iii) reform the livestock export circuits and liberalize marketing and
export of livestock on hoof, by abolishing the export quota and SOTERA's
monopoly, and simplifying the fiscal and administrative regulations
affecting livestock marketing; (iv) freeze the recruitment of staff at the
Ministry of Livestock and Rural Water Supply and improve their efficiency;
and (v) define appropriate land tenure and water management policies to
achieve long-term resource conservation. These policy reforms would be
underpinned with investment activities to strengthen the sectoral
institutions and improve their infrastructure. The project would provide
funds to (i) create and strengthen livestock producer groups for an
expanded role in basic animal health care, water and resource management
and rehabilitation of approximately 100 water points; (ii) improve input
distribution by strengthening MAGAVET's wholesale functions, increasing its
working capital, expanding its regional network and creating a line of
credit to help about 40 veterinarians and/or livestock technicians
establish private veterinary pharmacies and clinical animal health services
and private traders to take up meat export; (iii) strengthen the Farcha
Laboratory to carry out producer-oriented research on rangeland
conservation, integration of livestock into the mixed farming system and
the economics of disease control methods; (iv) introduce efficient
extension methods in the Livestock Service and retrain its staff,
rehabilitate MEHP field facilities and provide them with basic veterinary
and extension equipment and appropriate transportation; and (v) strengthen



- 3 -
MEHP's capability for planning, coordination and project monitoring and for
water development, and construct and equip an additional office for MEHP in
N'Djamena. The project, to be carried out over 5 years. provides funds for
civil works; vehicles and equipment; training and studies; technical
assistance; veterinary drugs; a line of credit; and incremental operating
costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$37.2 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$25.1 million (67Z). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Chad are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6972-CD dated
April 22, 1988, is also attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  Following credit negotiations, Government has
implemented the following main policy reforms: (i) the introduction of full
cost recovery for all non-compulsory vaccinations and clinical treatments
and the earmarked use of these revenues for non-salary operating costs;
(ii) the opening of MAGAVET to private investors and the abolition of its
distribution monopoly; (iii) the abolition of the export quota system and
the export monopoly and control functions of SOTERA; and (iv) the
introduction of simpler export procedures. Furthermore, the Government has
agreed to implement the following measures: (i) the recovery of the
marginal costs for compulsory vaccinations by May 31, 1990; (ii) the
abolition of MAGAVET's import monopoly before December 31, 1990; (iii) the
stabilization of HEHP staff numbers at the level of January 1, 1988; and
(iv) the preparation and promulgation of a conservation oriented pastoral
land use policy before December 31, 1990. Project related agreements
include: (i) the establishment of a Pastoral Organization Unit in MEHP;
(ii) the employment of key advisors on terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA; and (iii) the employment of a National Project Director, a Director of
MAGAVET and a Head of the Pastoral Organization Unit with qualifications
and experience acceptable to IDA.
7.        Benefits.  The principal benefit from the proposed project would
be a more appropriate policy framework and stronger institutions in input
delivery, extension, marketing and export. This would result in an
increased production of meat and, consequently, in increased government and
producer revenues, and in an increased production of milk, leading to
better nutrition. Export possibilities for the increased production of
meat are good, especially in the Nigerian market. The accompanying efforts
in resource conservation would provide essential elements of a long-term
strategy in this domain. The poor quality of productivity data in Chad and
the nature of the project preclude a conventional economic analysis based
on a rate of return calculation. An alternati-ze type of analysis, more
compatible with the quality of Chadian data, demonstrates however that
significant results can be achieved within a seven to nine years time
frame.
8.        Risks.  Risks concern MEHP's lack of efficiency, poor motivation
of the MEHP staff and a recurrence of drought. However, these risks would



-4-
be mitigated by a well-defined input of technical assistance, a sizeable
training component. a heavy emphasis on producers groups and the national
coverage of the project, which would foster the interaction between the dry
north and the humid south and therefore render the subsector less
vulnerable to drought.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
