                               RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce
changes in the Guinea Health Sector Support Project and accompanying amendments to
the project’s legal documents.

2.      The proposed changes are as follows: (i) a revision of Project Development
Objectives (PDOs) and related indicators; (ii) a streamlining of project activities; (iii) a
revision of institutional arrangements; (iv) a reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v) an
extension of the closing date.

3.     The expected outcome of the restructuring would be a more effective project
implementation resulting in an improvement in mother and child health services in the 18
poorest districts of Guinea and 16 health centers in the poorest peri-urban areas of
Conakry, leading eventually to reductions in maternal and child mortality and
improvements in health status.

B. PROJECT STATUS

4.     The project was approved by the Board on June 2, 2005. The credit of SDR 16.6
million (equivalent to US$25.0 million) became effective on June 26, 2006. The current
closing date is December 30, 2011, as the project was recently extended from the original
closing date of September 30, 2011. The project currently targets 18 districts (16 of
which were the poorest districts and the other 2 had substantial numbers of refugees).

5.      Project Performance. From the start, the project has suffered from
implementation problems, as there was a one-year delay in effectiveness. The Project
rating in terms of ability to reach the PDO was rated unsatisfactory in 2007, and has
remained as such since then. Implementation performance continued to be rated
satisfactory or moderately satisfactory up to the suspension of Bank operations after
December 2008. The Bank provided significant implementation support, with close and
frequent supervision, but soon it became obvious that the project needed to be
restructured. However, this could not be done because of the suspension of Bank
operations after the December 2008 coup.

6.      The last archived ISR, from March 24, 2011 shows all aspects of the project being
rated as 'U', including safeguard compliance. This reflects the fact that given that the
project could not be supervised for a period of more than two years, the project situation
could not be known and it was decided to downgrade all the ratings to U. The first



                                                                                          1
supervision mission after the restructuring will review the ratings, and a number of them
are expected to be upgraded.

7.      Two legal covenants, the presentation to IDA of the Annual Work Plan and that
of a progress report (including M&E indicators) are expected to be complied with soon
after activities restart. The date of the mid-term review would be revised (see section on
dated covenants).

8.      There are no outstanding audit reports and 2009 audit report is acceptable to the
Bank. It is worth mentioning that this report issued a qualified audit Opinion due to
ineligible expenditures of US$72,000. These were reimbursed to the Bank by the
government on April 21, 2011 as part of the arrears clearance.

9.     By November 22, 2011, SDR 8.08 million (USD12.58 million equivalent) or
48.68 percent had been disbursed. Some important project activities have taken place
such as the funding of decentralized action plans and the provision of ambulances in
Component 1, but activities linked to training and supervision have been weakly
implemented or not at all. Only a small part of Component 2 was implemented,
principally the part involving the costs of project management. Monitoring and
Evaluation has been weak.

10.     Yet, the project remains very relevant especially in this period of Bank re-
engagement where the government’s fiscal austerity measures will need to be balanced
with mitigating actions in the social sector. In the health sector, the government has
recently decided that pre-natal consultations and deliveries would be provided free of
charge. As shown in other countries, this is a positive measure that will substantially
increase the demand for these services, but it means that the supply side needs to be
boosted up, which the project will do through the provision of equipment, drugs,
supplies, and training. As explained further in the section “Project Design?, the
restructuring will slightly scale up some activities while dropping others, and overall
simplifying the project design.

11.    Project Management. The project is coordinated by the Secretary-General of the
MOH who is assisted by a Project Administrator and an implementation "Task Force"
made up of MOH department heads. A Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA), a private
firm, was contracted for financial management, procurement, and contract management.

12.     Changing Country Economic and Political Environment. Guinea's economic
situation severely worsened over the last 3-4 years. The population's dissatisfaction with
the country’s general deterioration resulted in violent street riots in 2007 and a military
coup in December 2008, following which Bank operations were frozen. Eventually
Presidential elections were held in 2010, and on December 2, 2010 Mr. Alpha Condé
became President. On January 19, 2011 the Bank initiated its re-engagement.




                                                                                         2
13.     The deteriorating political situation from 2006-2010 resulted in a lot of frustration
and a slowdown in the performance of public administration services, particularly at the
central level. Inevitably this has had a negative impact on project performance.

14.     Deteriorating Sector Context. The 2005 Demographic and Health Survey
(DHS), which became available only after project approval, show that some key
development indicators were getting worse. Maternal mortality deteriorated from 528
deaths per 100,000 births in 1999 to 980 deaths per 100,000 births in 2005. This is
consistent with a degradation of health care services, itself a result of the weakening of
the macroeconomic and financial situation, and the increase in poverty since the year
2000. The Joint Staff Advisory Note of December 3, 2007 showed that the percentage of
people living below the poverty line increased from 49% in 2002 to 54% in 2005. These
numbers are old, but health outcomes are unlikely to have improved in recent years.

15.     Conakry’s population has increased in recent years, reaching an estimated 2
million, many of whom live in poor conditions in peri-urban areas. This has put
tremendous pressure on government services, including health care. Currently the few
partners who are present in the health sector in Guinea (UNICEF, UNFPA, and GTZ)
target their support only on rural areas.

16.    The need for Restructuring. The project suffers from three main problems: (i)
the PDO are unsuitable; (ii) the design is complex; and (iii) institutional arrangements are
not working properly.

17.     First, the PDO should be changed. In the present socio-economic context,
significant reductions in maternal and infant mortality will need more than the project
lifetime to change. Also, some of these outcomes require actions beyond the health sector
that are not part of project activities, such as improvements in water supply, sanitation
and women’s education. To solve this problem, it is necessary to move down the results
chain and select more realistic PDO and indicators that can effectively measure the
project achievements and are likely to be met by project closing.

18.      The second reason for restructuring is that the design which is too complex with
too many components and subcomponents, and places a huge implementation burden in a
country with limited capacity. Component 2 is particularly complicated with numerous
activities and studies, which detract the focus of the project from its main objective which
is to deliver basic health care services. For example, the inclusion of some activities such
as the strengthening of health insurance, while desirable in the medium term, only add to
the complexity of the design and detract from the project’s main objective.

19.     Third, there are challenges with the current institutional arrangements. The
Secretary General of the MOH is responsible for the project, but he also has a demanding
job as number two of the Ministry. As such, his time is mostly taken up by management
of the sector, including policy and strategy, budgeting, and human resources, as well as
day-to-day issues such as attending to the political agenda of the Minister, dealing with



                                                                                           3
personnel issues, or addressing the myriad of other problems affecting the health sector.
All this leaves little time for project management.

20.     The Project Administrator is responsible for the day-to-day management of the
project. However, he currently has not been delegated full authority for decision-making,
resulting in the need to frequently consult the Secretary General whose is not easily
accessible.. The Secretary General is also supposed to be supported by a Task Force
made up of MOH Department Directors, who are in charge of supervising the technical
aspects of the project and reporting back to him. This Task Force has been effective in
some aspects of project implementation but has done little to review annual work plans,
organize training, supervise project activities, and manage the monitoring and evaluation
system. Changes in the institutional arrangements are therefore needed to address the
short-comings that have been identified.

21.    On the positive side, the fiduciary aspects of the project have been handled
successfully by the Fiduciary Management Agent. The latest audit report was submitted
on time. The overall financial management rating has remained satisfactory throughout
(except when all project ratings were downgraded to U for the reasons explained before,
and the qualified audit already mentioned).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

22.     Project Development Objective. The PDO1 as currently stated in the legal
documents is to contribute to reaching the maternal and under-five mortality reduction
objectives of the Borrower’s Five-Year Plan, Program, and Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper, and the Millennium Development Goals.

23.    Project Components. The project has two components and 11 subcomponents as
follows:

Component 1 – Strengthening Health Care Services (US$18.9 million)

    (i) Quality of Care;
    (ii) Community Mobilization; and
    (iii)Quality Insurance

Component 2 - Institutional Strengthening (US$8.4 million).

    (i) Integration of maternal mortality into the health information system2.
    (ii) Support to implementation of Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP).
    (iii)Support to Reproductive Health Training and Research Center.
    (iv) Development of national health insurance scheme.

  The order of subcomponents follows that of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) which is different
from that of the project Appraisal Document (PAD)

       (v) Carrying out an annual tracking survey of health expenditures.
       (vi) Strengthening the leadership and policymaking capacity of the MOH and health
                sector reform.
       (vii) Strengthening the « Direction des Affaires Administratives et Financières »
                (DAAF) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and its decentralized units in
                financial, procurement, and contract management.
       (viii) Project management and coordination.

24.     Revised Project Development Objective. The revised PDO would be to improve
the coverage and quality of maternal and child health services in targeted districts and
targeted health centers in the peri-urban areas of Conakry.

25.     The original PDO indicators (reduction of maternal and infant mortality in the 18
targeted prefectures) are dropped while the following indicators are added: (i) % of
deliveries assisted by trained health personnel; (ii) % of 12-23 month old children fully
immunized (DPT3+M); (iii) % of pregnant women receiving antenatal care (at least one
visit) during a visit to a health provider; and (iv) pregnant women receiving antenatal care
during a visit to a health provider.

26.     A February 2011 mission reviewed the results framework and adjusted it. The
political crisis and the stoppage of the project for over two years resulted in: (i) a
deterioration of health services that affected health indicators, leading to the need to
reduce some baseline numbers; and (ii) a catch-up time of a few months needed for the
project to go back to cruising speed, leading to the reduction in a number of targets to
make them more realistic. The new results framework and monitoring indicators are
presented in Annex 1.

27.   Project Design. The project design will be simplified by dropping one
subcomponent from Component 1 and four subcomponents from Component 2.

(vii) Strengthening the                                   In addition to the financing of the FMA, this
       « Direction des Affaires                           would also include the financing of full-time

       and coordination.



28.      As a result of the above changes (and some variations in cost since project
initiation), the revised project costs would be as follows.

                                                            Current           Proposed (US$
                           Components
                                                          (US$ million)          million)
         Component I - Strengthening Health Services           17.3                 20.4

         Component 2 - Institutional Strengthening             10.5                  5.6

           Total Project Cost                                  27.8                 26.0

29.     The reduction of US$1.8 million in the estimated project cost is the result of
dropping the subcomponents on quality insurance, development of national insurance
scheme, and tracking survey of health expenditures, and the merging of subcomponents 2
(vii) and (viii) into one subcomponent.



                                                                                                      6
30.     On the financing side, there is an equivalent reduction (US$1.8 million) resulting
from the combination of a decrease in government contribution (given that the Country
Financing Parameters of 100 percent were applied) and an appreciation of the SDR vis-à-
vis the US dollar. The IDA contribution of US$25.0 million does not change.

31.      Institutional Arrangements. A Steering Committee, created by an “arrêté?
(order) of the Minister of Health, will provide strategic direction and monitor the overall
progress of the project. It will approve the annual work plans, as well as the annual and
quarterly reports. It will be chaired by the Secretary General of the MOH and composed
of MOH Department Directors, UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO. The day-to-day
management of the project will be the responsibility of a Project Coordinating Unit
(PCU) that will report directly to the Secretary General. The PCU will be composed of a
Project Coordinator, two specialists for Health Care Services Strengthening, one for
M&E. The M&E Consultant will work with his counterparts at the central, regional, and
district levels to strengthen the M&E system so that it provides accurate and timely data
that can be used by the MOH for analysis and decision making. The Fiduciary
Management Agency (FMA) in charge of procurement and financial management will
continue as previously. The contract with the Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA) is
currently being negotiated by the government and is expected to be signed soon. The
contract of the FMA includes a requirement to build the capacity of the key
administrative and financial staff of the MOH every year. The “Task Force?, which was
not functioning properly, will be disbanded. At the decentralized levels, the project will
continue to be implemented by the regional and district health teams.

32.    Extension of closing date. Because of the initial delays and the two-year period
when Bank operations were suspended, there is not enough time for project activities to
be completed by the current closing date of December 30, 2011. Taking into
consideration (i) the remaining program of activities; (ii) the fact that arrears have been
cleared on April 21st, 2011; and (iii) an expected increase in efficiency of
implementation, a two-year extension of the closing date is proposed. This would result
in a new closing date of December 30, 2013.

33.     The further extension will be sufficient to complete the revised project activities,
as shown by the action plan in Annex 2. At closing, the project will be legally more than
8 years old, but given that it has been suspended for more than 2 years, its effective life
will have been 6 years.

34.     Reallocation of proceeds. A reallocation of funds between categories is proposed
as follows. Funds for “goods? will be increased to take into account the need to purchase
a larger amount of drugs and vaccines than originally estimated and the amount for the
refund of PPA will slightly increase to take into account currency fluctuations. Funds will
be reallocated from other categories as a result of: (i) an overestimation of the funds
required for training and consultants; (ii) works, originally to be financed by the project,
will now be undertaken by the Ministry of Health out of its own budget; (iii) activities to
support community health will not be undertaken under the form of grants because of
higher fiduciary risks than expected (the activities will be carried out by MOH staff

                                                                                          7
working with community health workers and financing will be under the categories of
training, operating costs, and goods); and (iv) making use of the “unallocated? category.
The proposed reallocation is presented in the Annex 2

35.     Dated covenants. No later than three (3) months after the date of counter signature
of the amendment agreement, the borrower shall: (a) adopt a revised Project Implementation
Manual and Project Administrative, Financial and Accounting Manual reflecting the
revised implementation arrangements pursuant to the contemplated restructuring; and (b)
recruit for the Project Management Unit (i) a Project coordinator, (ii) two (2) specialists for
health care services strengthening, and (iii) one specialist for monitoring and evaluation.

36.   Since the approval of the Country Financing Parameters and the reallocation of
March 11, 2008 to the credit agreement, all project expenditures are now financed at
100%.

37.    The date of the mid-term review that was due to take place no later than June 26,
2009 (36 months after effectiveness) would be changed to october 30, 2012. This would
allow for about 8 months of implementation after the restructuring is effective.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

38.    The proposed changes have no major effect on the original economic, financial,
technical or social aspects of the project as appraised. They will not change the project
environmental category or trigger any new safeguard policy. This restructuring does not
involve any exceptions to the Bank policies.

39.     The first two risks affecting this operation are: (i) the overall country risk due to
the fragile security situation; and (ii) possible shortfalls in revenue mobilization that
would threaten the sustainability of the macroeconomic path. The recent presidential
elections and the acceptance of the results should help ease domestic political tensions.
On the economic front, the government has started establishing a credible
macroeconomic environment under difficult political and security conditions and in the
absence of external budgetary assistance. Also under its new program, the IMF is setting
up strict controls and adequate early warning systems that reduce the risks of program
slippages. Capacity building and financial support from the Bank and other donors should
help reduce the risks to acceptable levels.

40.     The third risk is a health sector one: the lack of human resources in project areas.
To mitigate this risk, the project will continue to hire retired and private midwives and
nurses that are working in health centers on a volunteer basis and support them with
training and supervision. This has already shown positive results during the first two
years of the project.

41.    The fourth risk is that of governance. The mitigating measures set up by the Bank
at appraisal remain valid. These include a number of precautions to ring fence the
operation against fiduciary risks, including: (i) the use of a Fiduciary Management

Agency for all procurement and financial aspects of the project; (ii) regular independent
audits of the project; and (iii) close supervision by Bank fiduciary staff.

                         The PAD had a baseline of 42% because that also included deliveries by community health workers in addition to deliveries by skilled

                         modified, thus the reduction in the baseline to 38.2.

                            In December 2008, the government made C-sections free of charge. Because of the lost cost recovery, doctors and
Comment                     nurses became less motivated to perform C-sections. As a result, the previous target of 5% (recommended by WHO) is
                            no longer realistic. The Bank will be addressing this issue with the government through policy dialogue.
