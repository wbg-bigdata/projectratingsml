0R    ACLI M              PROWC?OU  hOJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recomendation on a proposed loan to
Jamaica for US$15 million is submitted for approval.  The proposed loan would
be for 17 years' including 5 years grace, at the standard variable Interest
rate. It would finance part of the 1989-91 investment program of the Jamalco
Joint Venture (JAMALCO), a 50-50 joint venture between Alcoa and the wholly
Government-owned company Cqlrendon Alumina Production, Limited (CAP). The
project is also expected to receive parallel financing from the European
Economic Comwmity SYSMIN fund, in an amount equivalent to about US$8.9
million.
2.       Backjjra4.  Bauxitelalumina has traditionally been one of the most
important economic activities in Jamaica, coAtributing about 532 of gross
export earnings and about 211 of Government revenues in the late 19709. The
excess capacity which developed in the aluminum industry in the early 1980s
resulted in a major contraction in production in Jamaica in 1984 and 1985.
this caused the closure of ots bauxite mine and two alumina plants, i.e., the
privately-owned Alpart plant and, in March 1985, the Clarendon Alumina plant,
owned by Jamalco, a joint venture between the Government (62) and Alcoa (94S).
Alcoa closed the plant, despite its basic effiqiency, since other plants in
the Alcoa system could mapet its reduced alumina requirements., After
consultation with the Bank, which supported the proposed course of action, thef
Government negotiated an agreement with Alcoa later that year, which permitted
it to operate the plant and preserved Alcoa's option to return. Despite the
plant's strong performance, Alcoa initiated steps toward outright sale of its
share to the Government in 1986. In September, 1987, however, in part
influenced by the continued strong performance of aluminum demand and prices,
Alcoa reversed this position, and indicated its desire to resume operation of
the plant on its own behalf. Agreement On a new joint venture arrangement,
which provided the Government with a 502 share of the plant, was reached on
March 1, 1988.
3.       The new joint venture agreement provided for CAP' purchase of an
additional 44Z share for US$26.5 million. Against thit amount, a settlement
of US$9.4 million for A-lcoa's inventory purchase was made in favor of CAP,
leaving an outstanding obligation of US$17.1 million.   hiss amount was not to
be paid to Alcoa directly, but was instead to be contributed to the joint
venture in lieu of Alcoa's 50  share of the investment program. After this
obligation is met, responsibility for future investments would be shared
equally by the two partners. It was agreed that the plant would at all times
produce at maximua capacity, unle8s otherwise agreed by the partners, and
would be managed by Alcoa. Finally, in contrast to the previous production-
based taxation policy, the agreement sets out a new profitability-based taxa-
tion regime for JAMALCO. The Government has also adopted this approach vith
other alumina companies operating in Juaaica. The new policy, coupled vith
favorable prices and demand, facilitated the reopening of the Alpart alumina
plant by two private sector partners in 1988.



-2-
4.       In tVis past, the Government has not sought a significant level of
ownership in the alumina sector. In the case of CAP, an exception was made
because the terms of the agreement were favorable to the country and enabled
it to satisfy existing long-term marketing commitments. The new joint venture
agreement provides several advantages to Jamaica, including continued access
to Alcoa's technology and management expertise, sufficient production to serv-
Ice its existing long-term marketing contracts, and a purchase price for the
asset substantially below replacement value. From Alcoa's point of view, the
agreement assures a stable levy regime which reflects the industry's profita-
bility, as well as providing additional financing for the heavy investment
program planned for the next five years. Perhaps most important is the agree-
ment that the plant operate at full capacity, thus maximizing the size and
stability of the plant's contribution to value added and enabling both parties
to minimize unit production costs because of economies of scale.
5.       tationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's current lending strategy
in Jamaica emphasizes the need to expand exports through operations which
promote an improved policy framework, such as the Trade and Finance Sector
Loan tLn. 2848-JA), as well as operations which support the suipply response.
The proposed pro4ect supports improved policy for a key export sector, as well
as providing needed financing for JAMALCO, a reliable generator of foreign
exchange crucial to the future adjustment effort. Moreover, Bank involvemeut
will help launch CAP in its new role as joint venture partner and support
sound environmental policy.
6.       Prolect Objectives and Description.  The proposed project, which
constitutes JANALCO's 1989-1991 investment program, has as major objectives
to: (a) sustain production and increase productivity of JAMALCO's operation;
(b) improve the environmental conditions related to the plant's operations;
(c) help establish CAP as as! effective joint venture partner; and (d) support
sound sectoral policy. The plant's 1989-91 investment program amounts to
about US$90.2 million. The program would consist of the following major
components: (i) completion of a third red mud lake for disposal of the waste
product from alumina processing; (il) feasibility and preparation work toward
the construction of future mud disposal capacity; (iii) the relocation of
Bowens (a small community of 200 families) to free space for future disposal
capacity; (iv) spare parts; lv) mining development; (vi) plant upgrading
investments; and (vii) other investment in plant replacement and improvement,
including equipment for improved environmental monitoring and control. The
Government would onlend the proceeds of the loan in U.S. dollars, at an
interest rate of 115Z of the Bank's standard variable interest rate and with
the same grace and amortization periods. The Government would bear the cross-
currency risk, although the onlen.-ing rate includes a premium to compensate
the Government for this risk. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Jamaica are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7195-JM, dated April 27, 1989 is attached as well.
7.       Agreed Actions.  Before Board presentation, the Government submitted
a sector policy statement; an environmental action program, including the
resettlement plan; and audited FY87 and FY88 accounts for CAP satisfactory to
the Bank. A letter of intent from the EEC with regard to SYSMIN financing for
the project was also received.



-3-
8.       Conditions of loan effectiveness includes  (a) adoption of an Operat-
ing Manual satisfactory to the Bank, setting out lines of authority and job
descriptions for CAP; (b) execution of an Implementation agreement satisfac-
tory to the Bank between the Government, CAP, JBM, and Alcoa; (c) execution of
a subsidiary loan agreement with CAP satisfactory to th* Bank; td) final ap-
proval for the proposed SYSMIN financing or satisfactory alternat$ve financing
arrangements; and (e) submission to the Bank of evidence confirming satisfac-
tory air quality in the vicinity of the plant. As an annual condition of
disbursement, CAP would furnish to the Bank for approval expenditures for the
project to be financed by the Bank by December 31 each year. It was also
agreed that the Bank would have the right to suspend disbursements in the
event that a substantial change is made in the Government's sector policy, as
set out in its document dated March 3. 1989, in such a way as to materially
and adversely affect the project's economic viability.
9.       In addition, agreement was reached at negotiations that:  (a) CAP
would maintain management arrangements satisfactory to the Bank; (b) CAP would
maintain a debtlequity ratio below 65:35 between March 31. 1989 and March 31,
1990, and no higher than 60s40 after March 31, 1990; (c) CAP would maintain a
quick ratio of at least 1; (d) the agreed environmental and resettlement pro-
grams would be carried out; and (e) CAP would furnish to the Bank for comment
Jamalco's annual capital budget by December 31 each year.
10.      benefits.  The project's major economic benefit would be continued
operation of the Clarendon alumina plant. During the next five years, the
plant will generate an estimated annual average of US$53 million in net
foreign exchange earnings, including US$28 million in tax revenues. The plant
also provides direct employment for about 900 people. In addition, -he new
ownership arrangement will permit production at capacity, thus increasing
sales volume and reducing unit production costs. The project also promotes
establishment of a taxation policy which would improve Jamaica's competitive
position in the industry as well as strengthen efforts to monitor the plant's
environmental effects. The project has a rate of return of 542.
11.      Risks.  The principal risks facing the project are:  (i) adverse
developments in aluminum or fuel prices; and (ii) possible lack of sustained
Government commitment to appropriate sectoral policies and good management
both in CAP and Jamalco. These risks are manageable. The plant's efficiency
is such that, as long as it continues to be well-managed, it will be able to
compete in most market situations. In particular, the plant is highly energy-
efficient, and, in the event of fuel price increases, is likely to remain
relatively competitive. The degree of the Government's commitment to
appropriate sector policies and sound management practices has already been
demonstrated in the adoption of a profitability-oriented taxation system, the
recruitment of qualified staff for CAP, and the continued management role of
Alcoa in the plant.
12..     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recomend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
