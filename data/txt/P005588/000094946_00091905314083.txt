3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objectives of the project were to reduce the quantity of petroleum hydrocarbons entering the
international waters of the Mediterranean and to comply with MARPOL 73/78 Convention requirements.
The project also achieved, among other objectives, the development of a comprehensive and integrated
system for the management of oil pollution caused by marine sources, thus ensuring commonality of
approaches and methodologies, promoting exchange of information and coordination, enhancing
monitoring capability among the countries in the region for preventing and combating oil pollution, and
improving the quality of the marine environment.
These objectives were successfully attained and deemed to be appropriate and in line with the
government's international commitment to monitor compliance with international conventions related to
marine pollution. They were clear and realistic with regard to national policies and regional agreements (
Union du Maghreb Arabe -JMA - agreemeEnt). A major institutional outcome of the project has been the
development of a framework for a comprehensive national and regional management of oil pollution
through enhancement of the capacity to assess and monitor oil pollution, enactment of national oil spill
contingency planning and response capabilities (NCP), drafting of a regional contingency plan (RCP),
and purchase of standardized equipment to combat pollution. Furthermore, the project also initiated a
cost recovery system at the port level through an adequate tariff structure, and at the national level
through creation of an environmental fund, enactment of a law regarding fees and penalties, and
enactment of polluter-pay rules.
The project was designed to enhance the country's capacity to implement its environmental action plan,
which aims in particular to fight oil pollution, protect the marine environment and beaches, and
encourage the participation of the environmental agencies and others entities in efforts to protect the
environment. In this regard, the preparation of the project called for great attention and commitment
from the govemment to identify the most appropriate and most representative institutions, such as the
"Office de la Marine Marchande et des Ports " OMMP to implement the project and represent the country
in the regional common effort.
No specific technical risk was identified during preparation, except the risk related to the government's
willingness to maintain its cooperation with the other recipients, Algeria and Morocco, to enforce the
preparation and adoption of the NCPs and the cooperative agreement, to enforce regulations dealing
with marine pollution problems, and to implement an adequate cost recovery system. This risk was
mitigated by: (a) current commitment of the three governments to follow up on the preparation study and
implement study recommendations related to the above aspects, and the project components as defined
in para 3.3; (b) the national and regional benefits resulting from project implementation, especially the
investments carried out for coastal and ports protection; (c) enactment of a NCP, preparation of an
advanced draft of a RCP, and agreement signed by the three port authorities on a joint cooperation for
combating accidental oil spills; and (d) comprehensive project preparation and implementation carried
out with the cooperation of local authorities through a regional committee for project implementation
(CRCP). Furthermore, close Bank supervision has ensured maximum success of project implementation
during the various stages of the project, ancl contributed to achieving its objectives.
3.2 Revised Objective:
N.A.
3.3 Original Components:
The project consists of two main components: (a) national elements; and (b) regional elements.
(a)    National Elements. The national elements include the following:
1-    Physical elements:
(i) construction or rehabilitation of sheds to store equipment for combating oil
spills (floating booms, dispersant, skimmer heads, accessories, etc);
-2 -



(ii) provision of oil spill response and cleanup equipment and dispersant, and oil
spill response training;
(iii) improving of the operational efficiency of the deballasting station located in
the port of Bizerte to receive and handle ballast waters and bilge waters, and
provision of additional related transport equipment to transport waste oils and
related products;
2- Institutional element:
(i) Oil spill National Contingency Plan;
(ii) Monitoring and compliance: The regulatory mechanism included two
elements: (a) monitoring capability; and (b) an environmental management
framework.
(b) Regional Elements. Preparation and implementation of a program designed to provide a
multilateral        framework within which the activities referred to in (a) are developed within a
common approach:
(i) Regional oil spill environmental sensitivity and contingency plans; and
(ii) Training.
The project was the first experience in its kind in the region. In that sense it was innovative in its design
and conception. The physical as well as the institutional components of the project were designed in
close consultation with the executing agency and local and regional authorities. All components and
activities were carried out satisfactorily, and were the key factors in strengthening the country's capacity
to handle oil pollution. The project as such increased the awareness of the environmental authority to the
threat of oil pollution and is considered as the most important vehicle for abiding by international
regulations and enforcing their implementation.
Physical components have been successfully implemented. They included the construction of sheds, and
purchase of oil spill response and cleanup equipment and dispersant. Training in operation of the
equipment was included in the purchase contract. Regarding the modernization of treatment facilities
and recycling of oily residues, STIR and SOTULUB, two private companies invested in and carried out
modernization of their facilities for treating ballast waters in the case of STIR and collecting and recycling
lubricant in the case of SOTULUB.
The main national element was the development and implementation of an oil spill NCP. The plan
incorporates the concept of risk assessment to identify and prioritize key actions to be taken at both the
port and national levels. The monitoring element, including auditing of sea waters though sample
analysis of oil content, was carried out through selected national laboratories. A baseline of data and
measuring locations needed to assess the impact of the project on improving the quality of sea water
was established in designated areas agreed upon with the Bank. Reports on the findings of the analysis
have been produced every six months. The environmental management element has strengthened the
technical elements of port and national regulations, by developing mechanisms for cost recovery and
financial sustainability.
The regional element included two major elements: the RCP and training. The RCP is intended to serve
as a template to link the national plans of the three countries. Elements of the plans include appropriate
responses to protect sensitive coastal resources, and potential for transport of spilled product to other
local or foreign ports. These plans include linkage of equipment and manpower to regional needs and
identification of extemal sources of assistance.  Part of this task has consisted of ensuring that
equipment purchased under the project is the same in the three countries, and training courses and
simulation exercises have been undertaken jointly. These have further promoted the concept of a
regional approach to spill response. A joint cooperative agreement was signed among the ports of
Algiers, Arzew, Bejaia, and Skikda (Algeria), "Office d'Exploitation des Ports"(ODEP), Morocco, and
"Office de la Marine Marchande et des Ports" (OMMP), Tunisia, defining the conditions and procedures
for using all available equipment and personnel to combat accidental oil spills. The cooperative
- 3-



agreement identifies responsibilities in case of accidental oil spills regarding exchange of information,
mobilizing of equipment, actions by each party, etc.
Training needs have been provided for those who are responsible for combating oil spills, and for control
of navigation traffic, deballasting stations, and oil terminals. Three main groups participated in the
program: Level I includes management personnel of port enterprises, supervising officers managing the
civil protection function, and those responsible for coordinating intervention in case of an accidental oil
spill. Level II includes port officers, and civil protection staff responsible for organizing and managing the
protection of coastal sites. Level IlIl includes ground staff of the port enterprises and assistant civil
protection officers likely to be managing the cleanup of sites or putting the equipment into operation.
Training was carried out on a regional basis so as to familiarize the personnel with working together
using the same equipment and procedures. Training that was carried out locally made the fullest use of
existing vocational and technical institutions and facilities.
3.4 Revised Components:
There was no revision in project components.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
No review was done.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project achieved all its objectives regarding regional cooperation, standardization of approach, and
strengthening of national and regional capacity to handle oil pollution and comply with the MARPOL
requirements regarding the norms for discharging oil into the Mediterranean. The most important
outcomes are: (a) prevention as well as preparedness to combat oil spills systems are in place, (b)
enactment of a NCP, (c) preparation oi an advanced draft RCP, and (iv) joint training carried out for
regional staff from the three participating countries on contingency plan and oil spills cleaning and
prevention. Bi-annual reports on sea water analysis (oil content in the water) have been satisfactory and
regularly provided, and effluent from deballasting stations do not exceed 15 ppm. Cooperation is
considered highly satisfactory. CRCP members meet regularly and have been able to handle regional
procurement and succeeded in ensuring continuous coordination among involved administrations in their
respective countries.
The project has contributed to efficient cooperation among concerned administrations and within the
region to prevent and control oil pollution. The development of a sub-regional working group and
organization of joint training contributed to enhancing marine pollution management through
development of a common approach and mechanisms. The project has improved the countries'
capabilities to deal with accidental oil spills and provide equipment and facilities to collect and treat oily
ballast and bilge waters, thus reducing hydrocarbon contamination in the Mediterranean. The project has
created the foundation for permanent cooperation in the region in terms of monitoring and compliance
auditing, state of marine pollution reporting, and a common approach for spill response. It has potentially
met the GEF objective of protecting international waters, and has set the framework for re-refining oily
materials in concert with local and national waste management programs. Its well-identified components
helped in strengthening and enhancing port and national regulations, regulatory mechanisms, and the
linkage between environmental monitoring and management.
4.2 Outputs by components:
All originally identified components have been completed satisfactorily. Because of savings, additional
means identified in the feasibility study were able to be procured. That includes construction and
equipment of a VTS in La Goulette, floating booms, transport equipment, recovery equipment, and spare
parts. The project closed on April 30, ;2000, four additional months after the original date, to allow
disbursement of the balance of the grant against equipment shipped after December 31, 1999. Shipment
delays were due to exceptional circumstances (bad weather in Europe). The regional components were
completed to the satisfaction of all concerned parties, including training and procurement of standardized
- 4 -



equipment and dispersant for combating oil spills. Three exercises simulating oil spills to test equipment
purchased and NCP were organized during project implementation. The detailed list of equipment
procured and total personnel trained are in Annex 7.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate ofreturn:
The project provided significant, although not quantified, economic benefits through provision of
environmental benefits. While formal economic and financial returns analysis (environmental economic
beneft and financial returns were not required for projects of the pilot phase) have not been attempted
for the SAR and the ICR. It is widely recognized that pollution impacts all aspects of the marine
economy, from fishery to recreation. Purchase of equipment, maintenance, and modemization of
reception facilities, as well as maintenance of and improvements to the existing coastal marine
environment, are necessary for the continued success of the coastal fishery and tourism, a major
industry in Tunisia and neighboring countries. Further, methods and protocols providing improvements to
marine environment quality, as achieved by the project, will serve as a model for establishing similar
facilities in other Mediterranean ports.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No formal FRR has been attempted in the SAR and the ICR. The project was based on the need to
address potential negative environmental impacts of discharged ballast and bilge waters, as well as
accidental oil spills, in the southwestern part of the Mediterranean, and the lack of resources to tackle
this issue of global importance. Given the competing demands of the various sectors on its national
budget, Tunisia was reluctant to, on its own, allocate funds for combating the problem of marine
pollution. The availability of grant funds reinforced the govemment's commitment to participate in
reducing the risk of marine pollution. Pollution funds have been set up, and decrees and laws regarding
fees and fines to be paid by polluters have been revised and enforced. A model for recovering the
operating and investment cost of deballasting stations has been developed for port authorities. Proposals
for port tariff adjustments to progressively cover the cost of environmental protection, are being made at
the beginning of each fiscal year.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
In 1995 and 1996, as consequence of the project, the GOT undertook several actions, including creation
of Agence de protection et de l'amenagement du lifforal (APAL), an agency that deals with all marine and
littoral aspects of pollution; and creation of the Centre intemational des technologies de 1environnement
(CITE), which specializes in providing training as well as promoting technology to protect the
environment. ANPE, OMMP, and APAL have established, within their structures, units to deal more
specifically with oil and marine sources pollution. These units have been appropriately staffed and are
working in close cooperation to prevent oil pollution and minimize its impact.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Only one factor that partially affected implementation of the joint training program is worth mentioning. It
is related to the security issue in Algeria, which delayed the training scheduled to take place in Algiers by
almost a year. A joint effort undertaken by the Bank and Algerian authorities to overcome the security
issue reassured the consultant that it would be safe to carry out the delayed sessions. The training was
completed in June and September 1999.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project included several elements to be implemented directly through OMMP, the implementing
agency (national components), and through OMMP as member of the CRCP (regional components,
including training, studies, and standardized equipment). This made the project complex and difficult to
implement. Several factors affected the project.
-5 -



(a)   Factors with positive influencing included:
(i) GOT already had an established regulatory regime and institutional setup. The GOT is
implementing a strategy with actions that would reduce the risk of major environmental hazards and stop
major causes of pollution. It has formulated a comprehensive institutional and legal framework that
permits better environmental management and law enforcement, as well as enhancing institutional
cooperation at the national and regional levels. The action plan under implemeniation includes a
national action program for environmental protection that aims to fight pollution, preserve the quality of
life of urban and rural populations, protect the marine environment and beaches, and preserve the
country's archeological heritage. Tunisia's global and multi-dimensional approach to environmental policy
is based mainly to contain pollution and deterioration of the environment within acceptable limits defined
by monitoring standards, and to establish measures to protect and valorize all aspects of natural or
man-made sites. This approach favors preventive actions based on enforcement of environmental
impact assessment recommendations and implementation of emergency plans to solve current major
environmental issues in selected regions. At the same time, it recognizes the importance of curative
measures in cases of absolute necessity, such as applying the polluter pays principle to damage caused
by pollution. The legal framework for environmental management in Tunisia is an active program that
defines all measures related to pollution control, procedures for environmental impact assessment,
punitive sanctions to safeguard the environment, and incentives to encourage cleanup. In addition,
MEAT has enacted a national contingency plan and drafted a regional contingency plans for combating
accidental oil spills and marine pollution within the framework of UMA.
(ii) To be able to implement all provisions of MARPOL 73/78, both current and future, GOT
recognized the need for improving the efficiency of the existing facilities for waste treatment and
reception, and the need to purchase environmental monitoring and combating equipment and develop oil
spill contingency and response plans and iraining.
(iii) Tunisia had established a long and fruitful working relationship within the institutions and
agencies in charge of environment, and with the two other participating countries through establishment
of the CRCP and mutual agreement -for cooperation among port authorities.  This established
relationship ensured deep trust and confidence within the country's institutions and among the countries
in the region, which was critical to success and made project implementation smoother.
(b) There was also less positive factor:
All aspects of maritime pollution prevention and combat require considerable investments to
meet requirements set by international conventions, which conflict with the demand for continuing
economic growth. This competition for funds made investments in environmental improvements difficult
to promote.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
OMMP already had an established regulatory regime and institutional setup, as well as a long experience
with Bank procedures. While the port authorities were responsible for providing waste reception
facilities, the cost of running such facilities make it difficult to implement cost recovery principles for
investments and operations. To mitigate this difficulty, all existing facilities are run by oil private
institutions.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The project was estimated to cost US$6.3 million equivalent, including physical and price contingencies,
of which US$5.8 million equivalent was in foreign currency and US$0.5 million equivalent in local
currencies. The actual figure at closing were: US$8.29 million equivalent, of which US$5.7 million and
US$2.6 million were in foreign and local currency, respectively. The increase was mainly in local
currency and shows the government effort and willingness to invest in prevention and control of oil
pollution activities. A summary of project costs is given below and details are given in Annex 3. The
-6 -



above costs are net of taxes and customs duties, as the govemment waived taxes and duties on all
items procured under the project. The costs reflect actual prices using the prevailing exchange rate
during project implementation. The foreign exchange cost of the project was financed through a SDR4.1
million equivalent to US$5.7 million, concessional funding secured from the GET core funds, and the
local cost equivalent to US$2.6 million was financed by the implementing agency.
98 percent of the grant was disbursed by the closing date. The balance of 0.07SDR million was canceled.
The balance was due to savings incurred during implementation because of the regional procurement
process followed to purchase standardized equipment for the three participating countries, and because
of the more favorable international competition and price market.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The existing institutions in Tunisia, including the implementing agency, have the capacity and the skills
to operate and maintain the facilities and equipment provided under the project. In addition, the project
provided training to implement and operate the national and regional contingency plans. Technical
assistance was geared toward developing mechanisms to achieve financial sustainability for the facilities
and regional organizations. The government and the executing agency are implementing study
recommendations to cover investment and operating costs. Meanwhile, the legal and institutional
framework, including an environmental fund, have been enacted and will provide the additional funds
needed to operate and maintain the facilities and equipment supplied under the project. Furthermore, the
project make the environmental authority aware of the threat posed by oil pollution. This has resulted into
an additional investment financed through local funds, including port contingency plans, periodic testing
of equipment, and periodic simulation exercises to test the NCP, and in a request from the South
Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia) to GEF to finance a follow up
project in the region.
The development of a generic oil spill contingency and response led the Government of Tunisia (GOT)
to implement the plan on a nationwide basis for all ports. Further, GOT held several national oil spill
response exercises in Tunis and Bizerte in April 20, 1996 and July 7, 1999. The evident success of this
exercise (about 100 interested parties attended, including representatives from REMPEC, CEDRE, Oil
industry, MOIG, and Algeria and Morocco, compared to 50 expected) will shift the program to an annual
series, thereby further enhancing the skills of port authority staff to respond to oil spills.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Based on the foreseen results of the project and its highly satisfactory rating for development and
implementation objectives, GEF provided funds to carry out a feasibility study to expand the benefit of
the project to the south Mediterranean, which includes Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. A
PCD has been prepared and approved by the Bank management; however, the GEF Secretariat, in order
to coordinate among international waters projects, decided not to go with the project until the final result
of the ongoing studies in the straits of Malaca and Bosphoros are published. The first phase of the
proposed project would consist of an institutional arrangement enabling the five countries and the oil
industry to cooperate in protecting the Mediterranean and preventing oil spills.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank identified key issues and prepared the project in a timely fashion. The project was identified in
June 1992 and appraised in August 1993, with the staff appraisal report issued in October 1993. The
grant was approved on April 6, 1994, and made effective on June 20, 1994. Bank supervision was also
satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
-7-



Bank performance was enhanced by use throughout the project of the same team, consisting of a
financial analyst and a port engineer. This provided a consistency of approach to the issue and an
assurance that the project design woulcl be successfully implemented. Further, team members had
worked with the CRCP and other involved authorities and thus had established a successful working
relationship. The project implementation was supervised on a regular site-visit basis, with supervision
staff including the two key project staff and CRCP members. The annual average input of staff resources
for supervision was about 8 staff-weeks, which included various specialties (see annex 4). This was
possible because supervision of three Bank-financed port projects was coordinated with supervision of
this project.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Bank performance at all steps of project preparation, appraisal, and implementation was satisfactory,
thus ensuring that there was no deviation lrom the defined objectives and components, and that the local
implementing agency as well as the CRCP were adequately staffed and equipped to implement the
project. The Bank's role in maintaining and cementing relationships among the countries and CRCP
members has been recognized by all parties.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower was involved from the beginning in the identification/preparation activities. GOT and the
implementing agency closely participated with the consultant in identifying project scope and
components, based on the existing infrastnicture.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
With the exception of the approval of a final Regional Contingency Plan, borrower implementation of the
national and regional components of the project was excellent and timely. The preparation of the final
RCP draft experienced some delays due to difficulty in reaching consensus within each administration
involved, but the final draft was completed before the closing of the project.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Most procurement processes were well advanced by the date of effectiveness, and were essentially
complete by December 1998. With respect to equipment procurement for the waste facilities and
vessels, OMMP was able to obtain excellent price quotations through competitive bidding and joint
training programs. With respect to monitoring equipment, OMMP had appropriate purchasing power
through consolidated bid packages. This format generated competitive prices, provided a commonality of
training and equipment base, and resulted in savings. In response to increased risk of pollution, OMMP
provided timely proposals to use the savings to procure additional equipment, and recovery means. The
delivery of additional equipment experienced some delays due to the difficulties experienced by
suppliers to deliver during the busy end of the year period, and bad weather in Europe, but OMMP had
managed to complete all activities in the first quarter of year 2000. The four-month extension of the
project closing date to April 30, 2000 permitted to use substantial amount of the grant balance.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
One of the key objectives of the project was to use successful application of various aspects as a model
for other ports within Tunisia. This objective was met. The oil spill contingency and response plan has
been made the designated national model and is being introduced in ports. The new port tariff schedule
is to be adopted by all ports, thereby providing a means of financing operating and investment costs in
preventing and combating oil pollution. Further, the successful development and implementation of the
project components, both national and regional, provided a model for expanding this experience in the
country to prevent, manage, and reduce oil pollution risk. Thus, the borrower's performance is evaluated
as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned
This project was funded mainly by a grant from GEF and was the first major funded project in the
Pollution Reduction in International Waters category. It can be judged to have clearly met GEFcriteria.
The project has proven to have a high demonstration value. Its success can be attributed to:
(i) Borrower's and the Bank's approach to the project and commitment to its objectives. The
Bank utilized a multidisciplinary team of a financial analyst, port engineer, and marine environmental
specialist. This provided consistency throughout, from design and appraisal to implementation. While
several administrations and agencies were involved in the project, key leadership was provided by
OMMP, ensuring a national consistency and providing a mechanism to utilize model components in other
ports, and a regional coordination with the other beneficiaries. Furthermore, GOT has a well-established
base of environmental laws and agencies, with trained staff, to monitor and enforce these laws; i.e., the
project could build on a strong existing base.
(ii) Borroweres commitment to contribute to the financing of the project.
(iii) Port and coastal environmental management is inherently complex due to overlapping
jurisdictions of different departments and ministries, port authorities, and private interests. If Tunisia,
Algeria, and Morocco did not strongly commit themselves to the project and have existing efficient port
institutions, and had not created the CRCP base upon which the project could be constructed, coupled
with good organizational arrangement for project implementation, this project would have been much
more difficult to implement. Replication and/or extending this project to other countries can be successful
if there are established regulatory and management regimes suitable to the task. Alternatively, such
regimes should be first established and stabilized.
(iv) Through enhancing and upgrading national standards, policies, procedures for waste
monitoring, and rehabilitation of waste reception and handling facilities, the project has convinced GOT
of the environmental benefit of the investments. This has triggered adoption of a multiport ship waste
tracking system, a port oil spill contingency and response plan for major Tunisian ports, and the holding
of oil spill response training exercises to train all ports and other agencies.
(v) Management of oil spills is only one aspect of port and coastal maritime environmental
management. The success of the project can be further enhanced by (a) adoption of an environmental
coastal zone and port management plan (a concept already being initiated by OMMP); and (b)
implementation of other pollution control activities (e.g., control and management of land-based sources
of pollution).

Commentaires de l'Off ice de la Marine Marchande et des Ports
concernant l'execution du Projet FEM  pour un systeme de gestion
de la pollution Marine par les hydrocarbures dans le
Sud Ouest de la Mediterranee (rapport de
la Banque Mondiale du ler Mai 2000)
* *** *** *** *** ** *
Le projet sus-cite est la premiere experience dans son genre dans la region aussi bien
dans sa conception que dans sa planification.
Celui-ci a fixe a l'avance certains objectifs a atteindre en fin de parcours et partant
de ces objectifs, a etabli des composantes nationales et r6gionales lesquelles
constituent l'ossature du projet.
Parmi les objectifs initiaux du projet, on peut citer essentiellement:
- La reduction des quantit6s d'hydrocarbures deversees dans la mer
mediterranee,
- La conformite aux exigences de MARPOL 73/78;
- La coordination et les 6changes d'informations entre les differents ports
de la region;
* Le renforcement de la capacite de surveillance dans la region pour prevoir
et lutter contre les eventuelles pollutions;
- L'amelioration de la qualite de l'environnement marin;
Depuis la signature de I'accord de Don en Mai 1994 jusqu'a I'achevement du projet en
Avril 2000 (la clo^ture etait fixee au mois de Dlcembre 1999), I'OMMP, en tant
qu'agent d'execution du projet,  s'est efforce avec les moyens se trouvant a sa
disposition et maigre les difficultes rencontrees (d'ordre administratif surtout) de
mener a terme le projet et de realiser le maximum des composantes pr6vues et ainsi
atteindre la majorite des objectifs fixes.
Aussi, le bilan du projet FEM demeure largement positif, en ce sens que le taux de
realisation de ses composantes est maximum et que les acquis et les avantages
resultant de ce projet sont manifestes, a savoir essentiellement:



Une mise en place d'un plan national d'urgence et des plans d'urgence
portuaires dont il faudrait accro'ltre la performance en yapportantles
retouches necessa3ires.
Un renforcement de la capacite institutionelle du pays par la creation et la
participation  a differents organismes  concernes par la protection de
l'environnement, d savoir:
. Le Ministere de l'Environnement et de l'Amenagement du Territoire;
. L'Agence Natonale de la Protection de J'Environnement;
. L'Agence de la Protection et de l'Amenagement du Littoral:
L'Off ice National d'Assainissement;
• Le Centre International des Technologies de l'Environnement de
Tunisie;
L'observatoire National du littoral:
. Le  reseau  des  Communicateurs  Environnementaux  du  Bassin
Mediterraneen;
Le projet de Conservation des zones humides et des 6cosystemes en
mediterrane:e.
- Une constitution d'une banque de donnees pour le suivi et le controle de la
teneur en hydrocarbures des eaux des ports et rades tunisiens ainsi que
certains points du littoral. Cette composante contribue dans une grande
mesure, a travers l'anaiyse des resultats des rapports trimestriels 6labores
par la SOTULUB cu controle et a ia reduction de la pollution dans les eaux
nationales et celles attenantes a la Tunisie, ainsi qu'a l'evaluation de l'impact
du projet.
- L'acquisition d'un materiel specifique de lutte contre la pollution marine
affecte & chaque port de commerce, permettant a la Tunisie dans une
certaine mesure d'etre prete dans le cas d'un deversement petrolier de
moyenne ampleur (< a 100 T).
- Une  formation   continue et adequate du  personnel des differents
d6partements concernes.
- Une sensibilisation plus accrue du personnel d'execution et d'encadrement
de I'OMMP en particulier et des responsables des institutions publiques en
general, dans le domaine de la prevention et la lutte contre la pollution
marine.



- Une organisation de plusieurs operations blanches permettant de tester les
plans d'urgence et de familiariser les differents intervenants aux
techniques de lutte
* 1994 dans le port de Tunis-Goulette
* Fin 1999 dans le port de Bizerte
. Une operation blanche d6clenchant le plan national d'urgence est
prevue pour Septembre 2000.
- La budgetisation au niveau de l'OMMP des projets suivants:
. Acquisition de deux VTS portuaires;
. Elaboration des plans d'urgence portuaires:
. Audit s6curite et vuln6rabilit6 des ports:
. Etude d'identification des sites de rejet des materiaux de dragage
dans les ports de commerce;
. Traitement des boues de dragage du poste p6trolier au port de Tunis-
Goulette.
En outre, sur le 'plan regional, le projet a permis d'instaurer une cooperation etroite
entre les trois pays a travers les agences d'execution pour la pr6vention et la lutte
contre les pollutions marines par les hydrocarbures.
Parmi les consequences directes de ce projet, il y a lieu de noter:
- L'instauration d'un Comite Regional de Coordination du Projet (CRCP);
- La signature d'un Accord de Cooperation et d'Assistance entre les
organismes portuaires d'Algerie, du Maroc et de la Tunisie;
- L'elaboration d'un draft du plan regional d'urgence, dont les grandes lignes
ont ete trac6es et qui sera bientot op6rationnel;
- La formation commune du personnel d'tat major et d'intervention des trois
pays.
Il est a signaler que ['existence dans les trois pays d'un materiel standard de lutte
anti-pollution, de personnes qui ont regu une formation communeatous les niveaux
ainsi que l'existence d'un accord de cooperation sont autant d'6l6ments de base qui
leur permettent de conjuguer leurs efforts pour lutter contre une eventueile pollution
marine d'envergure.
Cependant, comme nous l'avons exprime dans notre rapport final d'achevement, la
description du projet a subi une lgere modification. En ce sens et pour des raisons



essentiellement budgetaires, il fallait etablir des priorites et par cons6quent
certaines composantes initiales du projet n'ont pas ete r6clis6es, 6 savoir:
- I'acquisition des camions-citernes;
- les etudes techniques et de commercialisation concernant le devenir des
produits recuperes.
Quelques actions ont et6 entreprises en ce sens, c'est ainsi que la Societ6 Tunisienne
des Industries de Raffinage 'STIR) a procede6 a 'amelioration du rendement de la
station de debaliastage du Port de Bizerte et une etude sur la gestion des dechets
des navires a ete realis6e sous l'gide du Ministere de l'Environnement et de
I'Amenagement du Territoire.
Ceci reste insuffisant et nettement en dega des besoins. En effetet eu egard aux
dispositions de MARPOL 73/78, les ports de commerce et surtout ceux ayant des
terminaux  petroliers  doivent  etre   equipes d'installations  de  r6ception, de
pretraitement et de traitement des huiles usees, des eaux de cale et des eaux de
ballast contaminees par les hydrocarbures.
Les besoins de la Tunisie se trac'uiront essentiellement par:
- I'installation de stations de reception dans les ports;
- l'installation de stations de pretraitement et de traitement des produits
recuperes;
- I'acquisition de stockages temporaires et de barges de stockage;
- la surveillance des cote.s par l'installation de VTS cotiers ...
Ceci permettra 6 la Tunisie ainsi--qu'6 ses partenaires de la region de repondre
favorablement aux exigences de la Convention MARPOL 73/78 et de contribuer d'une
maniere efficace a la preservation de l'environnement marin du bassin mediterraneen.
A  cet effet, nous emettons 1tespoir que le projet FEM  II, initie par la Banque
Mondiale et qui se trouve etre une suite logique et necessaire au present projet
puisse voir le jour et etre concretise.
