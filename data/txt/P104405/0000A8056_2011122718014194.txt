                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main goals of the project are as follows:
                          1.       Encouraging low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plans as a way to access affordable primary and maternal care, as well
                         as treatment for prevalent diseases;
                          2.       Increasing the utilization and efficiency of idle private sector capacity to meet the country#s healthcare needs, instead of constructing new public
                         facilities;
                          3.       Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care in the private health sector, thereby restoring confidence among insurance beneficiaries; and,
                          4.       Demonstrating the viability and long-term sustainability of community health plans to encourage other HMOs to offer affordable and appropriately
                         designed health insurance plans to low-income populations.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. Enrollment
                         Enrollment is 12.800 (June 2011), which is 57% of the contractual enrollment target of 22,500 since the inception of the program.
                         Re-enrollment rate rose to 59% in June 2011 (when adjusted for an estimated migration rate of 24%). This re-enrollment percentage compare favorably to other projects within the
                         African context and to international practices in the field of private voluntary health insurance in resource-poor settings. As suggested in the article Community health insurance in
                         Africa published by the Tropical Medicine and International Health (2009), the benchmark retention rates (i.e. the number of enrollees continuously renewing) are typically 1-10%.
                         Based on a Price Sensitivity Study carried out by PharmAccess, nearly 64% of the enrollees are estimated to have low incomes i.e. having Living Standard Measures (LSMs) 1-5 .
                         2. Utilization
                         Between August 2009 and June 2011, about 28,000 patient visits took place in the CAPDAN project.
                         3. Quality of service standards
                         Between October 2009 an? July 2011, approximately 190 staff of health care providers were trained on issues such as guidelines on data management, adherence to medical
                         guidelines and pharmacy management . As a result, 80.83% of quality targets (standards of care) have been reached by participating health care providers.
                         Two network Hospitals have received a Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation in May 2011, the first hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa to have shown compliance to such
                         quality standards. JCI (the international arm of the US-based Joint Commission Resources) improves the safety of patient care through the provision of accreditation, certification and
                         educational services.
                         In addition, five providers have undergone COHSASA/SafeCare baseline assessment of capacity and standards towards a future international accreditation. COHSASA (Council for
                         Health Service Accreditation of South Africa) is an initiative which assists health care providers to meet and maintain quality standards. Both JCI and COHSASA are accredited by the
                         International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua).
                         4. Based on an elaborate Price Sensitivity Study (PSS) the team proposes to increase the co-payment gradually to reach the level agreed by the end of the project. This will be
                         achieved by a 3-step increase .

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Based on the delay in the project start up of approximately one year (mainly reaching the appropriate project enrollment level), the team proposes a one-year extension of the

                         project duration to July 2014.
                         2. Based on the PSS and following the Output Based Aid requirements as set in the Operations Manual (OM), the team proposes to increase the premium co-payment gradually to
                         reach a level that is still affordable by the community, and that comes near to the co-payment target set out in the OM.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
