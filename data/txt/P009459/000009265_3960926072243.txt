MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR THE ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed development credit to Bangladesh
for SDR78.1 million (US$102 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would help
rehabilitate about 305 km of national and regional highways and provide
deferred maintenance for another 335 km as well as strengthen the institu-
tions involved in the road subsector.
2.      Background.  Bangladesh, with a population in excess of 100 million
people, has an economy largely dependent on agriculture. Northwest
Bangladesh, bounded by rivers on the south and east, and the border with
India on the north and west, is an important food-surplus area of the country
and depends on road and river transport to move produce to other areas. Due
to inefficient project selection procedures, poor technical standards, inade-
quate supervision, an almost total lack of compaction, high construction cost
resulting from substandard soil characteristics, periodic flooding and scar-
city of traditional construction materials and insufficient road maintenance
budgets over the past years, the condition of the primary national road
network has deteriorated. Much of this network now needs a major rehabilita-
tion effort to restore it to a level at which its roads can be maintained by
normal procedures. IDA has supported two road projects in Bangladesh.
Although the first project faced considerable difficulties due to heavier
than expected traffic, inadequate design and poor workmanship, these problems
were eventually overcome, and both projects, after some delays, have been
successfully completed. Even though the objectives of these projects were
largely met, IDA curtailed lending to the road subsector due to the
Governmentts lack of commitment to maintain the existing national road
network. Recently, however, the Government has recognized the necessity for
proper maintenance and has asked for further assistance.
3.      Project Objectives.  The project objectives are to reduce the costs
of transporting passengers and goods by road by: (a) restoring, through
rehabilitation and maintenance, the priority road network in the northwest
to maintainable condition; and (b) strengthening the institutions concerned
with road transport infrastructure.
4.      Project Description.  The project includes:  (a)  a civil works
program in the northwest of Bangladesh, to be carried out by qualified
private contractors under the supervision of consultants employed by the
Roads and Highways Department (RHD), comprising rehabilitation or reconstruc-
tion of about 305 km of roads and bridges, deferred maintenance (made neces-
sary by the backlog of periodic maintenance) on about 335 km of other major
roads, and detailed engineering studies; and (b) an institutional develop-
ment program, to be implemented by RHD and the Ministry of Planning with
appropriate technical assistance, consisting of preparation and use of a Roaa
Master Plan for identifying and ranking future road investments, implementa-
tion of an agreed action plan including budgetary allocations for improved
road maintenance, and carrying out of a study of the domestic construction



-2-
industry and implementation of the resulting action plan to strengthen the
industry. The project, to be carried out over nine years, provides funds for
civil works and technical assistance, fellowships and training. The
project's total cost is estimated at US$157.6 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$51.2 million equivalent (32Z). A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6731-BD dated
May 26, 1987, are also attached.
5.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's involvement in the road subsec-
tor has already led to a recognition of the need for proper maintenance, the
efficacy of making contractors fully responsible for works using their own
equipment and materials, and the consequent reduction of force account main-
tenance works in favor of works by contract. IDA's proposed involvement in
this project, in collaboration with OPEC Fund, ODA, UNDP and ADB, is designed
to foster a program of policy improvements for the road subsector focussed on
a better balance between road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance
works, improved efficiency in planning and implementation, use of more
appropriate technical standards and materials, and upgrading of the
capabilities of the local contracting industry. The development of a Road
Master Plan under the present project will help prepare a framework for
suitable future road projects in Bangladesh.
6.      Agreed Actions.   The Government has agreed to:  (a) establish, by
July 1987, a new Project Civil Works Director's (PCWD) office with respon-
sibility for implementing the civil works program under the project and
appoint, as a condition of effectiveness, the PCWD to fill the position and a
Project Coordinator to oversee implementation of all project components;
(b) sign the six contracts for the first phase of rehabilitation works and
the supervisory consultant services contract as a condition of effectiveness;
(c) commence preparation, by April 1988, of a Road Master Plan for identify-
ing future expenditures for road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance
and ranking them in terms of economic priority, finalize the Plan by October
1989 and thereafter ensure that investments in the road subsector substan-
tially follow such Plan; (d) implement the action plan for improved road
maintenance agreed during negotiations including in particular progressive
introduction of maintenance by contract, establishment of Maintenance
Planning and Monitoring Cells and training of RHD staff, and beginning in
FY88, ensure the budget allocations specified therein are appropriated and
used exclusively for road maintenance; (e) commence, as a condition of
effectiveness, a study of the domestic construction industry and begin to
implement, by October 1989, an action plan to strengthen the industry based
on the findings of the study; (f) carry out, starting by October 1989, a
study of road materials and standards and implement its findings and
recommendations; and (g) prepare, by July 1989, a proposal to ensure the
levels of road user charges remain adequate and are equitable and commence
implementation, by October 1989, of actions necessary to achieve the above.
Disbursement of the credit for the second phase of rehabilitation works under



-3-
the project is conditional on the Government's satisfactory implementation of
the action plans for road maintenance, construction industry and road user
charges, finalization of the Road Master Plan and initiation of the Road
Materials and Standards Study.
7.     Justification.  The roads in Bangladesh have deteriorated to the point
that they require restoration before they can be made maintainable. The
proposed rehabilitation and deferred maintenance of project roads will reduce
vehicle operating costs, road maintenance costs and travel times. The
primary beneficiaries are the users and providers of road transport in the
agricultural surplus northwest. The economic rate of return of each project
component is 28% or more, and that of the overall project is 38%.
8.     Project Risks.  The first project risk involves the Government's
failure to maintain project roads. This will be minimized by implementation
of the Road Maintenance Action Plan agreed during negotiations and its
linkage to disbursements for the second phase of rehabilitation works. The
second project risk arises from tying IDA disbursements for the second phase
of rehabilitation works to satisfactory implementation of the institutional
development program which may delay the civil works program. While clearly a
risk, it is necessary to minimize the greater risk of failure of the institu-
tional development program. Furthermore, it has been minimized by the
program's design which includes a limited number of elements all of which can
be closely monitored and the appointment of a Project Coordinator to oversee
all aspects of project implementation. The third project risk is that of
civil works failure due to insufficient engineering and management capacity
within RHD to cope with the sharp increase in the overall volume of work.
This risk has been minimized by scheduling the rehabilitation works to be
contracted in two biddings two years apart, the establishment of a new
Project Civil Works Director's office with appropriate technical assistance
located in the northwest, and training of RHD staff for the supervision of
contracted works.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
