MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
FOR A POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan of US$110 million to the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be at the standard variable ra:e for 17 years includ-
ing 4 years of grace with a guarantee by the Kingdom of Thailand. The
proceeds of this loan would help finance a power transmission project.
2.        Background.  Electricity in Thailand accounts for 13% of the
commercial energy demand (383 kWh per capita in 1985). More than 90% of the
electricity generation and all the power transmission in Thailand is the
responsibility of EGAT which sells power in bulk to two distributing
companies, the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA); all three are autonomous state enterprises.
During the Fifth Plan period (FY82-86), the energy sector accounted for 26% of
total public investment, 66% of that share corresponding to EGAT. During the
Sixth Plan period (FY87-91), electricity demand is projected to grow at 7.6%
p.a. and EGAT's investment to approach US$1,400 million equivalent. Faced
with external and fiscal imbalances, the Government has set as two urgent
priorities: (a) to reduce investments and operating outlays in the energy
sector; and (b) to enhance the profitability of state entterprises and their
contributions to the Treasury. The energy planners in Thailand are also
concerned about the possible decline in the production of domestic oil,
natural gas and lignite, and about the increased dependency on energy imports
that it would entail in the long run. An Energy Assessment Report jointly
prepared by the Government and the Bank in 1985 dealt extensively with these
issues and emphasized the ;mportance of (a) the development of the most
economical gas fields, (b) a strict screening of energy investments, and
(c) adjustments in the structure of energy prices. A Joint strategic study
followed up recently on the impact of low and uncertain oil prices on energy
sector investments.
3.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to expand and strengthen EGAT's transmission system consistent with the
continued development of urban and rural electrification; (b) to achieve a
better integration of the national power grid and help choose the optimal
generating options without unduly restrictive regional constraints; (c) to
deal with demand and supply uncertainties with minimum reserve margin
requirements for the generating system; (d) to upgrade the existing load
dispatch centers into a state-of-the-art countrywide control system. The
project will also promote improvements in power load forecasting methods and
power tariff structure.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project will comprise the supply
and construction of the following items of which the first two form EGAT's
Transmission System Expansion Project No. 7: (a) 740 ckm of lines and



associated substations at 115 kV/230 kV; (b) National and Regional System
Control Centers with advanced software and access to 116 remote stations;
(c) a Central-Southern Transmission tie-line (350 km double-circuit, 230 kV)
and expansion of line end substations; (4) a transmission line for Mae Moh
Unit No. 9 (215 km, single circuit 500 kV) and associated substations; and
(e) consultancy services for the 500 kV and system control centers components.
5.        The project would be carried out over five years and executed under
supply and erection contracts for materials and equipment. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$197.1 million with a foreign exchange component
of US$115.7 million (59%).  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and
the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank operations in Thailand are given in
Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing project locations is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6773-TH is being distributed
separately.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of the Bank's comprehensive assistance for the development of Thailand's
energy sector on the basis of the studies carried out jointly by the Govern-
ment and the Bank. The implementation and further review of these recommenda-
tions require a continuing dialogue through project lending in the major sub-
sectors. As the single largest investor and user of primary energy, ECAI
plays a decisive role in resolving major issues. The project objectives are
consistent with the Government fiscal and energy sector related priorities.
In particular, it will promote the improvements in load forecasting methods-
and tariff structure which are needed at this stage of power market develop-
ment.
7.        Agreed Actions.  EGAT has agreed to the following:
(a) an independent audit of EGAT's financial statements;
(b) adequate self-insurance arrangements;
(c)  a fuel cost adjustment clause in EGAT's tariff and a periodic review
of rates adequacy;
(d) a strict control of ECAT's debt to equity ratio and medium to long
term debt ratio; and
(e) a self-financing ratio of not less than 25% based on a three year
average of capital expenditures.
8.        The Government has agreed to the following:
(a) to carry out a study to improve power load forecasting in Thailand
in accordance with terms of reference and timing agreed with the
Bank and to exchange views with the Bank on the progress and results
of the study;



- 3 -
(b) to carry out a time-phased action plan for tariff structure
improvements agreed with the Bank; and
(c) to review power rates to ensure that both ECAT and the subsector as
a whole earn a 25X self-financing ratio based on a three year
average of capital expenditures.
9.        Justification.  The major benefits of the project would be fuel sav-
ings and reduction of likely outages on the transmission network. All project
components belong to ECAT's least cost expansion program. The project compo-
nents were shown to be the most economical alternative for discount rates of
9X and above. The overall economic rate of return of EGAT's expansion program
based on current tariffs is estimated at 18.5X.
10.       Risks.  The project faces minimum risks as it relies on arrangements
that have proven sound in the past. EGAT will employ its own work force for
substations installations at 230 kV and 115 kV; procurement for lines and
other equipment is well underway. As most transmission lines traverse flat
agricultural areas and woods, little problem in obtaining and clearing the
right-of-way for line construction is expected. Construction and mining
arrangements are already underway for the Mae Moh power station which will
provide the incremental power to these lines.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
