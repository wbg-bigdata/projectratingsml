variable interest rates.
Project Objectives
and Description:    Based on Thailand's pro:ected growth of power demand,
substantial shortages of electric energy could develop
in the Central and Southern Regions by 1990/91. The
objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to expand
and strengthen EGAT's transmission system consistent
with the continued development of urban and rural
electrification; (b) to achieve a better integration of
the national power grid and help choose the optimal
generating options without unduly restrictive regional
constraints; (c) to deal with demand and supply uncer-
tainties with minimum reserve margin requirements for
the generating system; (d) to upgrade the existing load
dispatch centers into a state-of-the-art national
control system; and (e) to promote improvements in load
forecasting methods and in power tariff structure.
The proposed project will comprise the supply and
construction of the following items, of which the first
two form EGAT's Transmission System Expansion No. 7:
(ai 740 ckm of lines and associated substations at 115
kV/230 kV; (b) national and regional System Control
Centers with advanced software and access to 116 remote
stations; (c) a Central-Southern transmission tie-line
(350 km double-circuit, 230 kV) and expansion of
associated substations; (d) a transmission line for Mae
Moh Unit No. 9 (215 km, single-circuit 500 kV) and
associated substations; and (e) consultancy services for
the 500 kV and System Control Centers components.

POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
I   THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.1       Due to the rapid economic growth in the period 1960-85, energy
consumption in Thailand has increased twelvefold to 23 million tojns of oil
equivalent (MMtoe) at an average annual rate of 11Z. The share of biomass
fuels, chiefly wood and bagasse is now peaking at about 30% of the total. A
large part of the commercial energy supply is met by petroleum (77%) of which
more than 90% is imported. Domestic natural gas (13%), hydropower (7%) and
lignite (3Z) make up for the remainder. End-use demand of commercial energy
is mostly for petroleum products (85%) and increasingly electric power
(13%). In meeting Thailand's increased demand for commercial energy, a
massive investment program has been undertaken in power generatio. and for the
exploration and development of petroleum, gas and lignite. It is estimated
that over the Fifth Plan period (FY82-86), energy sector investments expendi-
tures represented 50% of total state enterprise investments with power
accounting for 85% of that share. As regards the future, natural gas is
expected to substitute increasingly for petroleum products, reaching about 27%
of the commercial energy supply by 1996 with petroleum declining to 55% and
lignite rising to 11%. However, these projections are based on the assumption
that appropriate policies are in place to sustain the exploration and develop-
ment of indigenous gas, oil and lignite resources. Any failure in the timely
implementation of such policies could again increase the need for imported
energy by the early 1990s.
S. Resource Endowment
1.2       Thailand has a diversified energy resource base, consisting of
biomass, hydropower, natural gas, petruleum, lignite, and geothermal energy
which is still at an exploratory stage in the Northern Region. Two thirds of
the biomass, i.e. charcoal and wood, are widely used for cooking by rural
households at the rate of 10 MMtoe/year and forests near inhabited areas are
being heavily overcut. One third of the biomass supply corresponds to bagasse
and paddy husk and is used as fuel in the sugar and rice industries.
1.3       The total hydro potential of Thailand's rivers is estimated at about
9,300 MW, not including the potential of 25,000 MW from the international
rivers (Mekong and Salween). About 2,000 MW of hydropower capacity, with an
annual energy generation capability of 5,000 GWh, is now in operation; 240 MW
will be commissioned in 1987 and about 2,500 MW in 25 projects is in various
stages of identificaticn or feasibility study. The poter:ial for minihydro
schemes is estimated at 3,000 MW at over 100 sites; 75 MW of such projects are
now under construction.



- 2 -
1.4       Proven and probable economically recoverable natural gas reserves in
Thailand are currently estimated at 19.2 trillion cubic feet (tcf), of which
about 3.7 tcf are being exploited. Natural gas production began on a
commercial scale in 1981 at a rate of 128 million standard cubic feet per day
(MMscfd) and is currently about 400 MMscfd, 95% of which comes from two
offshore concessions with Union Oil and the remaining 5% from an onshore
concession with Shell. Based on the present contracts, natural gas production
is expected to peak at 480 Mlscfd in 1990 and decline to less than 360 MMscfd
by 1995. However, if account is taken of the projection of gas production
from an expected third Union contract (from offshore discoveries), another
onshore concession with ESSO, and a possible offshore contract with Texas
Pacific, the total gas production could rise to a peak of 1,200 MMscfd in the
mid 1990s.
1.5       Proven economically recoverable reserves of petroleum liquids are
presently estimated at about 140 million barrels. Current production is about
34,000 barrels per day (bpd) out of which 18,000 bpd is gas condensate ari
16,000 bpd is crude oil. The level of production from the presently
contracted fields would decline to less than 30,000 bpd by 1990 and drop
further to less than 12,000 bpd by 1995, 100% of which would be gas conden-
sate. However, if production from the prospective gas supply contracts are
taken into account, the level of production would remain around 30,000 bpd
until the late 1990s.
1.6       Known lignite reserves are around 1,700 million metric tons (MMt)
i.e. 450 MMtoe, 86% of which are in the Mae Moh basin in the Northern
Region. Most reserves elsewhere occur at depths too great, or consist of
seams too thin, to make them economically mineable at today's prices. Cur-
rently known mineable reserves total 474 MMt; 452 lMt at Mae Moh, 10 MMt at
Krabi, and 12 MMt at other basins. Lignite production in 1986 was about
4.3 MMt out of which 80% was at Mae Moh. Currelt investments at Mae Moh will
expand the annual output capacity to 7.3 MMt by the end of 1990 and 9.7 MMt by
the end of 1991.
C. Energy Consumption
1.7       The industrial sector, principally cement, iron., steal and textiles
consume 25% of the commercial energy, consisting of oil (47%), diesel (24%)
and electricity (29Z).
1.8       Demand for commercial energy by services and households accounts
respectively for 6X and 7t of the total. In 1980, charcoal and fuelwood were
used as cooking fuel in 42% of households compared with about 90% of the
households in the early 1960s. Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity are
now used in place of tradiL;inal fuels for cooking by more than 70% of urban
households. Overall, electricity has become the most important commercial
energy used in urban households (about 45Z of their total consumption)
follotwed by kerosene (33%).
1.9       The transport sector accounts for 52% of total commercial energy
consumption, and 62% of petroleum products consumption. During the 1970s the
consumption of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in transport grew at annual rates



- 3 -
of 6.4%, 6.61 and 8%, respectively. This pattern was dramatically changed
between 1979 and 1984 mostly due to absolute and relative price increases and
the slowdown in economic activity. During this period gasoline consumption
declined by 2.7% p.s. while diesel and LEG consumption increased by 15Z and
50% p.a. due to a price structure which provided incentives for substituting
diesel and LPG for gasoline.
1.10      Agriculture and fisheries consume about 10% of total commercial
energy, mostly diesel oil. Rice and sugar mills consume more than 80% of that
energy.
1.11      Over the next five years, the consumption of commercial energy is
projected to grow at 7.3% p.a. with industry, household and services increas-
ing their respective shares to 32%, 9% and 8%, while transport and agriculture
would decrease theirs to 44% and 7%, respectively.
D. Energy Sector Institutions
1.12      Private sector involvement is strong in the petroleum and gas
industry, particularly oil and gas exploration and production, oil products
import and distribution and petroleum refining. The Petroleum Authority of
Thailand is the dominant public entity responsible for purchasing, trans-
porting, processing and selling natural gas. Except for a little captive
generation in industry (para. 2.3) the power subsector consists of three state
enterprises: the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (ECAT), the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electric ty
Authority (PEA). EGAT is responsible for power generation and transrmission,
but hydroelectric development must be coordinated with the Royal Irrigation
Department. The private sector has only played a small role so far in lignite
mining where EGAT is a dominant figure and the principal user of the resource.
1.13      Energy sector policy and planning involve three major entities.  The
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) oversees investment
planning and hosts the secretariat of the recently created National Energy
Policy Committee chaired by the Prime Minister to coordinate energy related
policies and research. The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) is respon-
sible for regulating oil/gas exploration and production. The National Energy
Administration (NEA), under the Ministry of Science and Technology is primar-
ily engaged in promoting energy conservation and the development of renewable
resources. Both DMR and NEA act as catalysts in lignite exploration and in
the exploitation of some small basins. Recent reforms have introduced strin-
gent procedures for debt control. All state enterprises loans, both foreign
and domestic which require government guarantee must be approved by the board
of the enterprise, the parent ministry, the National Debt Policy Committee and
the Cabinet, and they must be negotiated and signed by the Fiscal Policy
Office of the Ministry of Finance. In 1985, a National State Enterprise
Committee was appointed under the Prime Minister for ensuring that all state
enterprises comply with government guidelines in matters of pricir.g regula-
tions and state enterprises restructuring.

E. Energy Sector Issues and Strategy
1.14      Thailand's heavy dependence on petroleum imports along with rapidly
escalating oil prices in the 1970s prompted the Royal Thai Covernment (RTG) to
pay special attention to the energy sector. Detailed policies, plans and
programs, have been implemented through the Fifth Plan; more remain for
incorporation in the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (FY87-91). Most
notably, the share of indigenous energy resources has increased and, in the
next five years, will increase substantially (para. 1.1). Energy conservation
has received considerable attention. Energy prices have been increased to
reflect international price developments and electricity prices have been
raised to reflect the increasing cost of power generation. However, there are
still opportunities to increase the efficiency of resource allocation in the
sector by improving the structure of energy prices. During the Fifth Plan,
the enargy sector accounted for about 26% of total government spending as
compared to 181 during the Fourth Development Plan. Under the Sixth Plan, the
RTG, concerned about the impact of energy sector investments on the level of
public sector indebtedness, is exploring means of increasing private sector
participation in the energy sector. The energy planners in Thailand are also
concerned about the possible rapid decline in the production of oil and gas
from existing contracts. The above issues were extensively discussed in the
1985 Energy Assessment carried out jointly by NESDB and the Bank, and its
recommendations were used to formulate the energy strategy of the Sixth Five-
Year Plan. These recommendations emphasized the particular importance of (a)
the development of the most economical gas fields, (b) a strict screening of
energy sector investments, and (c) adjustments in the structure of energy
prices. The proposed project addresses (b) and (c) through the strengthening
of EGAT's transmission network and by promoting improvements in load fore-
casting methods and in power tariff structure. Also, during the appraisal of
this project, NESDB and the Bank have followed up with a study of the impact
of low and uncertain oil prices on energy sector investments. This study has
validated the power expansion program which underpins the proposed
transmission project (paras. 2.7-2.9).
II. THE POWER SECTOR
A. The Power Market
2.1       The electricity market in Thailand has grown at a very rapid pace
over the past two decades. Total sales of electricity and per capita electri-
city consumption increased from 467 GWh and 19 kWh, respectivel-, in 1961 to
19,814 GWh and 383 kWh in 1985. Prior to 1973, electricity demand grew by
about 20% p.a. However, during the two periods of sharp energy price
increases and economic slowdown, i.e., 1974 and 1980-1982, the growth rate of
demand dropped to 5-6% p.a. In other periods when GDP growth picked up, in
1975-1978 and again in 1983, electricity demand grew at 1. 14% p.a. The
growth rate of electricity demand was about 10% in 1985.
2.2       The industrial sector has, since the 1970s, become the major
electricity consumer, accounting for 4415 of the electricity sales in 1986.
Residential (26%), business and services (30%) account for the balance.



- 5 -
Future growth in total electricity demand is projected to average 6.6% p.a.
through 1995, consisting of 4.6%, 7.4% and 5.6% in the industrial, residential
and commercial sectors respectively.
B. Generation and Transmission Facilities
2.3       EGAT is responsible for all major generation and for the transmis-
sion of bulk power to MEA, PEA, and a small number of large industrial con-
sumers. The privately owned generators represent less than 10% of ECAT's
installed capacity: 240 MW of small diesel sets and 380 MW of steam raising
units chiefly in sugar mills; all these units generate power for the exclusive
use of their owner. MEA is responsible for distribution within the greater
Bangkok metropolitan area, and PEA for distribution throughout the rest of the
country and for minor generation by diesel plant in certain isolated areas.
Highlights of EGAT, MEA and PEA operations are presented in Annex 1.
2.4       EGAT's facilities include all generation plants, excluding isolated
diesel and mini-hydro generation, and transmission installations down to
voltages of 115 kV and 69 kV, excluding some 69 kV transmission installations
operated by MEA. In December 1986, as detailed in Annex 2, EGAT's installed
capacity was 6,410 MW consisting of oil-fired plants (47Z), hydro (28%)
lignite (14%) and natural gas (11%); 2,400 MW of oil-fired capacity have been
converted to use natural gas also. The share of oil-based generation was
reduced from 64% in 1981 to 20% in 1986; natural gas has reached 38%, hydro
17%, and lignite 22%; purchased power from Laos makes up the remaining 3%. By
1996, natural gas is expected to account for about 42% of power generation
with lignite and hydro amounting to 22% and 12%, respectively. Oil based
generation would represent about 23% of the total. The proposed transmission
project imparts EGAT's operations enough flexibility to increase the share of
natural gas and lignite, where and when available. It does not affect the
contributions of hydropower and of energy imports from Laos, which are both
projected to increase slightly.
2.5       EGAT's transmission facilities are tabulated in Annex 3.  In addi-
tion1 to the construction of transmission lines and substatiovs associated with
generation plants, EGAT, in successive stages, has developed the transmission
system to serve various areas of the country. Since the formation of EGAT in
1969, seven plans of transmission system expansion have been implemented. At
present, EGAT operates 15,936 circuit kilometers (ckm) of transmission lines
consisting of 326 ckm at 500 kV, 5,969 ckm at 230 kV, 8,789 ckm at 115 kV and
852 ckm at 69 kV. A total of 73 provinces are served by EGAT from 144 substa-
tions with a total capacity of 11,207 MVA (see Annexed Map). The only pro-
vince that is not yet connected to the EGAT system is Mae Hong Son in northern
Thailand.
C. Power Sector Institutions
2.6       In addition to EGAT, MEA and PEA (para. 2.3), many other government
entities are involved in planning, policy making and coordination of the power
sector. These are: Committee for Power Policy and Development, National Debt
Committee and National Energy Policy Committee, the Budget Bureau, NESDB, NEA
and the Ministry of Finance. These agencies review a large number of issues



- 6 -
including tariffs, major project proposal- budgets for submission to the
Council of Ministers, annual financial petLormance and requests for government
equity and loans. No one agency has overall policy responsibility for the
power sector and most decisions are made by consensus of all the agencies.
Also of significance is the coordination facilitated through two arrangements.
The first is the Load Forecasting Working Group made up of representatives
from the NESDB, NEA, EGAT, PEA and MEA. The second arrangement relates to the
power rate coordination between EGAT, PEA and MEA to ensure that each utility
generates an adequate proportion of its investment while at the same time
preventing cash imbalances. These arrangements work reasonably well.
D. EGAT's Development Program
2.7       The load forecasts of September 1986 project Thailand's electricity
peak demand and energy sales to grow at 7.1X and 7.6% p.a. respectively during
the Sixth Plan period (FY87-91). Because of market saturation in urban areas,
the growth is exDected to slow down to 4.6% and 5.3% p.a. respectively during
the Seventh Plan period (FY92-96). The breakdown of sales forecast by end use
sector and selling entity is given in Annex 4.
2.8       To meet the growth in demand, EGAT in early 1987 prepared a long-
term Power Development Plan (Annex 5 and Chart 2) which is summarized in
Tables 2.1 and 2.2 below.

This Power Development Plan (PDP) has been designed with built-in flexibility
to deal with uncertainties about the demand growth and about the price and
availability of various fuels. It includes 2x300 MW of lignite-fired units at
Mae Moh, 2x100 KW of gas turbines and 4x300 MW cf combined cycle units. Under



-7-
a low demand scenario, the commissioning of gas turbines could be deleted with
a one year decision lead time. Under a high demand scenario, which is corre-
lated with one of low oil prices, one or two additional combined cycle units
could be commissioned and fired with the natural gas which is now committed to
existing dual fired plants in the Bangkok area. The supply reliability stan-
dard would be kept at less than 3 days/year of loss of load probability in all
cases. EGAT capacity and energy balances projected on this basis are given in
Annex 6.
2.9       EGAT's transmission expansion program is aimed at extending 230 kV
and 115 kV transmission facilities to all provinces of Thailand by 1994. The
500 kV transmission system, which is being superimposed on the 230 kV system,
is required for bulk power transmission to accommodate the large-scale
development of lignite-fired power plants at Mae Moh.

2.10      Since the preparation of the development plan discussed above, there
have been several important developments in the power sector: (a) a much
higher than anticipated demand in 1987 (a growth of 13% instead of 10%);
(b) increased predictions of load growth by the Load Forecasting Working Group
(9% instead of 7.6% between 1987 and 1991) based on more recent economic and
end use data; (c) higher expectations oG gas availability; and (d) altered
fuel price projections for oil, gas, lignite and imported coal. Because of
these factors, EGAT prepared in 1987 a substantially larger investment
program, which calls for bringing on line 2,430 MW of new generating capacity
by 1993, compared to 1,735 MW envisaged in the earlier program (see Annex
5). With commensurate increases in transmission and mining developments, the
total capital investment over the period FY88-92 is projected to increase from



- 8 -
Baht 52,450 million (para. 5.16) to about Baht 87,000 million. The revised
piogram is yet to be fully reviewed and approved by the Government.
Preliminary analysis indicates, however, that a substantial increase in the
investment is justified and would be within EGAT's finacnial capacity
(para. 5.14). Since the power development plan includes several low capital-
intensive short-gestation projects, it lends itself to adjustment to changing
conditions.
E. Experience with Past Lending
2.11      The Bank has made fourteen loans to Thailand for power, of which
eleven have been made to ECAT and its predecessor, for financing expansion of
electricity generation and transmission, and three to PEA for rural electrifi-
cation. The Bank also is su.pporting two projects to assist EGAT in increasing
lignite production and another project to help the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand finance the submarine pipeline to transport natural gas. Of the
eleven loans to EGAT, ten have been fully disbursed and one is almost so. Of
the loans to PEA, one has been fully disbursed, the other two are proceeding
satisfactorily. The first loan to EGAT for lignite production is almost fully
disbursed, and the second loan is underway since 1985.
2.12      EGAT recently completed three Bank financed projects, all of them
for power generation: Bang Pakong thermal and Khao Laem hydro in 1985, and
Pattani hydro in 1981.  The corresponding ?roject completion reports highlight
EGAT's financial recovery following the oil price increases of the 1970s from
a -2% rate of return on revalued assets in FY79 to 9.1X in FY86. These proj-
ects were completed on schedule and within the appraisal cost estimates with
the exception of the Khao Laem hydro which was 12 months behind schedule and
suffered a 4X cost overrun because of unexpected complications in civil works.
2.13      Bank participation in the sector has helped EGAT to develop into a
technically competent and efficient power utility (paras. 3.8-3.14). The
Bank's association with PEA is also oriented towards achieving strong institu-
tional improvements. Through its continuing dialogue with the subsector
institutions, the Bank has been instrumental in the implementation of adequate
overall electricity tariff levels, ensuring the sector's financial soundness
and the cost effectiveness of power generation investments. The Bank spon-
sored sector work in investment planning and energy pricing (para. 1.13)
represented also significant contributions towards improving sector coordina-
tion. Overall, the Bank's presence in the power subsector has helped ensure
that utilities are soundly managed and has encouraged other lenders to provide
investment financing for the subsector on favorable terms.
F. Rationale for Further Bank Involvement
2.14      Following the 1985 Energy Assessment, the RTG and the Bank are
jointly re-examining various energy policy and planning issues amidst the cur-
rent fiscal and borrowing constraints, and uncertainties affecting the energy
outlook. The Bank's policy dialogue in the power subsector is being focussed
on the following:



- 9 -
(b) upgrading of the existing mode of grid operation into one capable of
getting the most out of generating facilities nationwide;
(c) setting appropriate tariffs to meet Thailand's fiscal and social
objectives and to encourage the efficient use of electricity; and
(d) improving the subsector regulatory framework.
2.15      As part of this ongoing dialogue, the Bank, in its preparation and
appraisal of the proposed project, carried out an extensive review of EGAT's
long-term levelopment plan in the face of low arnd uncertain oil prices (para.
1.14 and 2.8). Through this review, the Bank recommended:
(a) screening the expansion planning strategy against contrasted sce-
narios of oil prices, gas availability and load forecasts;
(b) postponing energy investments which entail large risks in the face
of such uncertainties;
(c) reducing the reserve margin of the generating system;
(d) evaluating the socioeconomic cost of power outages to determine
appropriate load shedding policies under critical conditions;
(e) upgrading the load forecasting methodology; and
(f) improving the power tariff structure.
2.16      The above recommendations relating to modifications of planning
methodology and consequent adjustments in the investment program have been
accepted and implemented by EGAT. The outage cost study has been completed
and is under review. However, before translating other recommendations inte
specific actions, there is a need for the RTG to undertake additional work and
for the Bank to provide continuous assistance in this process. Some critical
aspects, which impinge upon the sector's investment program and which estab-
lish the basis of Bank's policy dialogue through the proposed project, are
discussed in the the ensuing paragraphs (2.17-2.18).
2.17      Load Forecasting.  The present load-forecasting process consists of
projecting the electricity demand for EGAT, MEA and PEA customer groups and
reconciling these with projections based on econometric studies made at the
national level. At this stage of power consumption development, interfuel
substitutions and market saturation in urban areas are beginning to appear.
In order to appreciate the importance of these new phenomena, both sectoral
and econometric approaches would need to take into account more economic and
demographic variables than they do at the moment. The current reconciliation
procedure between different forecasts also calls for some critical review.
The Bank has prepared a detailed proposal for a study to improve the load
forecasting methodology which would also provide useful data for demand man-
agement. This proposal has been accepted and NESDB who will coordinate the
study is actively making arrangements to carry it out with the concerned



- 10 -
agencies' own resources and a grant from Canada. During negotiations, an
agreement was reached with the RTG to ensure that the study will be carried
out in accordance with terms of reference and timing acceptable to the Bank
and that views will be exchanged with the Bank on the progress and results of
the study.
2.18      Tariff Structure.  Although in the past the focus of the policy
dialogue between the RTG and the Bank was to secure adequate power rate
levels, there is also a need for rationalizing the structure of tariffs
applicable to MEA, PEA and EGAT's direct customers. This structure currently
involves substantial cross-subsidies. Industries and businesses are charged a
price which generally exceeds tha long-run marginal cost (LRMC) by a percent-
age comparable to the tax rates on primary fuels. Although some amount of
cross-subsidization may be desirable to meet social and regional development
objectives, tariffs are unnecessarily low at 30% to 50% of the LRMC of elec-
tricity supply for the vast majority of residential consumers. As the number
and consumption of residential consumers are increasing rapidly, the ability
of other consumers to continue the cross-subsidy is being strained. The
tariff structure would also need to take more into account peak load manage-
ment objectives and reflect fully the cost differential between the principal
voltage levels of service. A tariff study has been completed by local consul-
tants under NEA's coordination in September 1986. However, the study has
failed in inspiring a reform proposal acceptable to the Government. NESDB is
now responsible for preparing the revised tariff structure for Cabinet
approval. During negotiations, the Bank reached an agreement with the RTG to
carry out within the next few years a time-phased action plan for tariff
structure improvements agreed with the Bank. These improvements relate to:
(a) cross-subsidies between residential and nonresidential users; (b) peak to
off-peak rate differentials; and (c) rate differentials between high and
medium voltage levels. The current rate structure and the agreed action plan
are presented in Annex 7.
III. THE BORROWER
3.1       The Borrower of the proposed loan will be the Electricity Generating
Authority of Tnailand (EGAT), which was established in 1968 by a merger of
three generation and transmission authorities. EGAT comes under the direct
jurisdiction of the Prime Minister and also is affected by numerous other
Government entities (para. 2.6).
A. Organization and Management
3.2       EGAT functions as a modern public utility with a considerable degree
of autonomy. Its management provides the predominant inputs for decisions
concerning planning, contracting, pricing, and financing of investment.
EGAT's operational and policy decisions are made by a Board of Directors,
which consists of a Chairman and not more than ten other members, including
the General Manager. With the exception of the General Manager, the Board
members, who are appointed by the Council of Ministers, act in a part-time
capacity. The implementation of the Board's decisions is the responsibility
of EGAT's management.



- 11 -
3.3       ECAT's operations are divided into six departments each headed by a
Deputy General Manager: Administration, Accounting and Finance, Hydropower
and Transmission System Development, Thermal Power and Mine Development,
Transmission and Power Plants Operations. EGAT also has inter alia a Legal
office, an Internal Audit office, and a Security office, which report to the
General Manager (see Chart 1). EGAT's organizational structure is sound and
appropriate for its operational needs.
3.4       EGAT has a Power System Planning Department responsible for survey,
site investigation, planning of generation and transmission projects, economic
studies, power development programming and system planning, financial fore-
casting and review of tariffs. This department is well staffed and makes an
extensive use of computer models. The scope and quality of system modeling
are among the best in East Asia. The Planning Department also oversees all
electronic data processing activities; :t plans, installs equipment, and
develops and maintains all the users' software in relation to teleprocessing
within EGAT. Consultants are used whenever necessary to assist in the prepa-
ration, engineering and design of major projects. For substation works unJer
500 kV, EGAT installs the equipment using its own work force under the super-
vision of the manufacturers. Transmission lines are procured on the basis of
supply and erection contracts.
B. Staffing and Training
3.5       Management and staff within EGAT are competent and well qualified.
Table 3.1 below shows that half of the staff have received some form of higher
education. EGAT staffing ratio is six employees per MW installed. The main
reason for this relatively high ratio is that EGAT carries out most of its
field investigations, survey and geological explorations using its own staff
and maintains a large construction force for access road construction, site
preparation works and installation of equipment. Since construction workers
are not given permanent employment status, EGAT has been able to reduce its
manpower over the last two years after the completion of two generation
projects. EGAT's staff which amounted to 31,157 as of September 30, 1986 is
expected to be reduced further in FY87.

- 12 -
3.6       Training is handled by an internal unit which was recently upgraded
to a department; it arranges courses and seminars for all levels of staff. In
FY86, over 6,000 employees attended training programs. With the introduction
of advanced technology into its system, EGAT established in 1982 a Technology
Training Center with state-of-the-art facilities in three regions. This
training arrangement appears adequate.
C. Performance
3.7       EGAT's efficiency can be compared favorably with that of the better
run utilities in the developing world. In particular, EGAT has been operating
its plant and equipment properly and efficiently. It has been conducting
regular maintenance within stipulated intervals. The standards it has
observed for major maintenance are satisfactory. Estimated transmission
losses account for slightly less than 9% and auxiliary consumption accounts
for about 3.6% of generation. Network losses are relatively high when com-
pared to those recorded in East Asia for more compact high density power
grids. They are projected to decline in the 1990s; in the meantime, the
detailed analysis carried out for each component of the proposed project indi-
cates that, at today's fuel prices and cost of capital, significant reductions
in the current loss rate would not be economical.
3.8       EGAT has an excellent record on project cost control, implementation
and management (para. 2.12). It has been borrowing from the Bank since 1957
and has followed the Bank's procurement guidelines. Processing of tenders and
award of contracts is undertaken equitably and expeditiously.
D. Accounting Arrangements
3.9       EGAT's accounting system conforms to modern power utility practices.
The staff is well qualified and competent. Accounting applications such as
general ledgers, payroll, inventory transactions, accounts payable, and
accounts receivable have been fully computerized. EGAT prepares annual
budgets for its capital and operating expenditures. Periodically, reports are
prepared enabling management to compare actual results against budgeted
amounts. The budget process has been operating satisfactorily.
3.10      EGAT's billing and collection system is adequate.  Accounts
receivable averaged 70 days at year end 1986. In FY87, in accort. -,ce with a
1986 government regulation requiring all state enterprises to collect re:eiv-
ables within 60 days, EGAT's accounts receivable have declined and are projec-
ted to be 60 days by year end. In fact, EGAT's receivables could be reduced
further except that PEA's inability to collect its own bills promptly keeps it
from paying EGAT in less than about 70 days. Given this constraint, the
60 days of receivables for EGAT is satisfactory.
3.11      EGAT has been developing an on-line Management Information System
since 1984. Currently, 180 reports on operational and financial matters can
be retrieved, with another 120, mainly on construction, procurement and per-
sonnel planned for 1987. Although the system is not fully integrated--a step
which depends on the procurement of a mainframe computer--it already is used



- 13 -
by EGAT's top management. Appropriate plans to purchase a computer and to
complete the MIS system are underway. An outside consultant has been hired to
help with the project.
3.12      Internal Audit within ECAT is carried out in a separate department
including 58 staff and reporting directly to the General Manager. The Inter-
nal Audit department reviews the accounts of each operating unit throughout
the year as they are compiled by the Controller's Department. Once ECAT's
year-end financial statements are completed, they are reviewed by Internal
Audit, primarily to check for accuracy and compliance with MOF regulations.
They then are given to Cooper's and Lybrand and to the Office of the Auditor
General within the Ministry of Finance (paraa 3.13).
3.13      EGAT's audit is performed by the Office of the Auditor General, the
Government organization responsible for auditing all state enterprises. The
private sector accounting firm Coopers and Lybrand (United Kingdom) is
retained as financial consultant to cooperate with the Auditor General and
issue a separate report on the annual accounts. To date, reports have been
submitted on time and the performance of the consultants has been satisfac-
tory. As under the existing loan (2000-TH), EGAT has agreed to continued
employment of independent auditors and submission to the Bank of EGAT's
financial statements and of the auditor's report thereon within six months of
the close of each fiscal year.
E. Insurance and Taxes
3.14      In FY79, EGAT shifted to a self-insurance program and established a
sinking fund with the amount that it would have paid for insurance premiums.
Under the Loan 2000-TH, EGAT's self-insurance policy and procedures were eval-
uated by an expert and deemed satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations,
agreement was obtained from EGAT that provisions satisfactory to the Bank will
continue to be made to provide insurance against such risks and in such
amounts as shall be consistent with appropriate practice.
3.15      Prior to September 30, 1982, EGAT had been exempted by a Cabinet
Resolution from the requirement to remit any of its net income to the Ministry
of Finance because power tariff increases had lagged behind the rise in oil
prices. EGAT requested an extension of this exemption, but this was not
accepted. Under a January 1983 Resolution, EGAT must remit a portion of its
net income to the Ministry of Finance as determined by the Ministry on a year
to year basis according to the Government's financial needs for that year.
EGAT pays taxes each year to the Ministry of Finance at a level which has
risen from 5% of net income in FY82 to 14% in FY86.
3.16      Customs duties and business taxes on the import of all equipment and
materials for the EGAT projects included in the Fourth and Fifth Five-Year
Development Plan (1977-1986) were paid or reimbursed by the Government in the
form of equity contributions. However the Government did not agree to EGAT's
request for similar concession for projects in the Sixth Five-Year Development
Plan. Therefore, these duties and taxes are met from EGAT's own resources.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin and Status
4.1       Based on the projected growth of power demand, substantial shortages
of electric energy could develop in the Central and Southern Regions by
1990/91. To prevent such shortages, EGAT's earlier plans included the con-
struction of combined-cycle plants in the South, with natural gas to be
supplied from Texas Pacific by a new submarine pipeline. There is, however,
considerable uncertainty regarding the availability and price of this natural
gas. In keeping with the optimal development strategy (para. 2.8), a decision
was made to construct a second Central-Southern transmission tie-line and
extend the existing Mae Moh-Tha Thako 500 kV line to the Central Region.
Additional energy from the Mae Moh units Nos. 8 and 9 could then be transmit-
ted to the South until such eventuality when gas-fired capacity would be
installed there and the flow of energy could be reversed.
4.2       The scope of the proposed transmission project was defined during
Bank project preparation missions to Thailand in the first semester of 1985
and confirmed during the preappraisal mission in November 1985. By that time,
the Government had approved the transmission system for Mae Moh Unit No. 9 and
EOAT is currently preparing designs for this component with the help of its
consultants (Young and Associates, USA). Invitations to bid for the 500 kV
line have been issued in May 1987. Transmission System Expansion No. 7 (TSE7)
was approved by EGAT's Board in July 1986 after minor streamlining of the
version examined by the preappraisal mission. Based on a study carried out in
early 1986 by consultants (SwedPower), EGAT's Board recently approvcJ the
construction of the Central-Southern tie line as a 230 kV alternating current
line rather than as a direct current scheme. EGAT prepared the bidding docu-
ments for these two components largely on its own. Land acquisition for sub-
stations is now completed and securing the right-of-way for the lines is at an
advanced stage.
B. Project Objectives
4.3       The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to expand and strengthen EGAT's transmission system consistent with
the continued development of urban and rural electrification;
(b) to achieve a better integration of the national power grid and help
choose the optimal generating options without unduly restrictive
regional constraints;
(c) to deal with demand and supply uncertainties with minimum reserve
margin requirements for the generating system;
(d) to upgrade the existing load dispatch centers into a state-of-the-
art countrywide control system; and



- 15 -
(e) to promote improvements in load forecasting methods and in power
tariff r!ructure.

(i)   a double circuit .30 kV line of about 350 km from Prachuap
"niri Khan to Surat Thani; and
(ii)   expansion of Prachuap Khiri Khan and Surat Thani substa-
tions.
(d) Construction of a Transmission System for Mae Moh Unit No. 9
(i)   a single circuit 500 kV line of about 215 km from Tha Tako
to Yong Chok;
(ii)   a 500 kV substation at Nong Chok; and
(iii)   expansion of the Mae Moh and Tha Tako 500 kV substations.



- 16 -
(e) Consultancy Services
(i)   engineering, supervision and inspection for the 500 kV
transmission components of the project (about 300 man-
months); and
(ii)   assistance with detailed engineering and supervision for
the SCCs (about 30 man-months).
D. Cost Estimates
4.5       The following table summarizes the project cost estimates based on
June 1987 price levels. The consultancy services are expected to cost about
US$3 million for the 500 kV component and US$0.4 million for the System Con-
trol Centers. These costs include salaries, fees, international travel and
subsistence. The cost of local offices, local transportation and local taxes
will be borne by EGAT; it is included in the local cost component. Indirect
foreign costs consisting chiefly of fuel and equipment for line fabrication
and stringing amount to about US$5 million.

total project cost net of taxes is B 4,667 million (US$172.9 million).
/b   Physical contingencies are about 6.5% of base cost; local and foreign price contin-
gencies are about 1.7% of base cost plus physical contingencies.



- 17 -
4.6       Physical contingencies are based on EGAT's experience in tranEais-
sion projects. Price contingencies for foreign costs were derived by applying
the following annual rates of escalation: 1% for 1988, 1989 and 1990 and 3.5%
for 1991 and thereafter. The price contingencies for local costs were calcu-
lated with the same inflation rates. Most of the procurement relates to
equipment and is expected to be carried out through contracts to be signed in
FY88 and FY89. The total project cost excluding duties and taxes and inter-
ests during construction is B 4,664 million (US$172.9 million equivalent).
Detailed project cost estimates are provided in Annex 8.
E. Financing Plan
4.7       The Bank loan would finance all the foreign costs of the project,
except those relating to the Tha Tako substation under the Transmission System
for Mae Moh Unit No. 9. EGAT has identified possible export credits to
finance the direct foreign costs of the Tha Tako substation, and commercial
bank loans to finance the Tha Tako substation downpayment, and interests
during construction on all foreign borrowings. About 10% of the indirect
foreign costs and all local costs of the project would be financed from EGAT's
own resources and local borrowings. The financing arrangements are shown
below:

Total               126.3      86.8       213.1
4.8       The Bank loan would be made to EGAT at the standard variable
interest rate for a 17-year term including a 4-year grace period. EGAT would
bear the foreign exchange risk. The Kingdom of Thailand will guarantee the
loan.
F. Project Implementation and Reporting
4.9       EGAT will be responsible for implementing all the subprojects
financed under the proposed loan over a five-year period. Chart 3 exhibits
the implementation schedule for the various elements of the project. The
500 kV line from Tha Tako to Mae Moh is due for completion by the end of 1990
and is to be followed by TSE7-Part A and the Central Southern tie-line in
1991. The SCCs would be the last components to be commissioned by the end of
1992.



- 18 -
4.10      Quarterly progress reports to indicate the current status of
procurement and construction works, and to update the project cost estimates,
procurement and financing plans for the completion of the project will be
submitted by EGAT. Not later than six months after nompletion of the project
or such later date as may be agreed for this purpose between EGAT and the
Bank, ECAT will provide a report, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank
shall reasonably request, on the execution of the loan, the performance by
EGAT and the Bank of their respective obligations under the loan agreement,
and the accomplishment of the purposes of the loan.
C. Procurement
4.11      Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3 below.  Equip-
ment and materials to be financed under the proposed Bank loan, i.e., about 35
bid packages will be procured under international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Most of those bid packages
include the supply of equipmec and the construction works required for its
installation. Conductors f,r the transmission lines will be manufactured in
Thailand from ingots procurelx through ICB. The local conductor manufacturing
industry is efficient and this mode of procurement will not affect satisfac-
tory execution of the project in terms of costs, quality and completion time.
For contracts for equipment, materials and construction works expected to cost
above US$2.0 million, prior review of the bid documents and prior approval of
bid award by the Bank would be required. This procedure is expected to cover
about 90% of the total value of contracts under ICB and about 20 bid packages.
For equipment, material and construction contracts expected to cost less than
US$2.0 million, prior review would be at the option of the Borrower. For bid
evaluation, a preference of 15% or applicable customs duty, whichever is less,
will be granted to the bids of local manufacturers who qualify under the
Bank's guidelines. In the case of the contracts for the supply and erection
of transmission lines, bids from qualified contractors who offer locally
fabricated towers will be granted a similar preference on the value of the
towers. In the case of smaller contracts (short lines, minor substation
extensions and maintenance equipment) expected to cost less than US$200,000
equivalent each and not exceeding, in the aggregate, the equivalent of US$5
million, contracts may be awarded in accordance with local shopping or local
competitive bidding procedures open to foreign suppliers. EGAT's procedures
are generally deemed acceptable to the Bank. Local contractors are expected
to be competitive for 230 kV and 115 kV components.
4.12      The consultants services contract for the 500 kV components has been
awarded to Young and Associates (USA) who have supervised the construction of
the Mae Moh to Tha Tako section of the line to EJAT's satisfaction and are now
preparing the bidding documents for the proposed extension. The consultancy
contract for the System Control Centers, the scope of which is defined at
Annex 15, will be awarded in accordance with the Bank guidelines.

ment of equipment under bilateral credit (US$5.2 millicn), and
engineering and supervision to be carried out by EGAT (US$4.8 million)
and consultants (US$3.5 million).
H. Disbursement
4.13      Disbursements for equipment and materials will be made against
(a) 100X of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment; (b) 100%
of ex-factory cost for equipment manufactured locally; and (c) 65X of total
expenditures for other equipment procured locally, such as equipment for com-
munication and uninterrupted power supply in the SCCs. For consultant
services, disbursements will be against 100% of expenditures.
4.14      For contracts above US$2.0 million equivalent, disbursements will be
made against full documentation in respect of EGAT's expenditures or commit-
ment for expenditures. Reimbursements of expenditures relating to contracts
valued at less than US$2 million equivalent would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs need not
be submitted to the Bank but should be retained by EGAT and be made available
for review by the Bank supervision missions. To facilitate project disburse-
ments, a Special Account in a fully convertible currency on terms and condi-
tions acceptable to the Bank will be established. The authorized allocation
to the Special Account would be US$10 million, representing four months aver-
age project expenditure. Replenishments to the Special Account would be made
quarterly or whenever the Account is drawn down by about 50% of the initial
deposits. No withdrawals will be made in respect of payments made for expen-
ditures prior to loan signing, except that withdrawals in an aggregate amount



- 20 -
not exceeding US$5.0 million may be made on payments incurred after Febru-
ary 5, 1987 for consultancy services.
4.15      Annex 9 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan
as well as the East Asia standard profile of disbursements for power projects.
The loan is expected to be disbursed faster than the standard because:
(a) transmission projects are more quickly implemented than the generation
?rojects which largely determine the Region's average profile; (b) consultants
have already been appointed and are producing designs of the 500 kV compo-
nen.:s; (c) EGAT has already produced designs for lines and substations at
lower voltages; (d) the acquisition of land and right-of-way is at an advanced
stage; and (e) the call for bids of major packages is taking place in FY87.
This schedule is in accordance with ECAT's past implementation performance for
this kind of projects. On this basis, tne loan closing date would be Decem-
ber 31, 1993 which allows for adequate time after the project completion for
the payment of performance retention monies,
I. Environmental Aspects
4.16      Thailand has a National Environmental Board responsible to the Prime
Minister's Office which reviews the environmental aspects of power projects
including the protection and management of ecological systems, the control of
pollutants and wastes and the protection of public health. All the projects
to be undertaken by ECAT have to be reviewed and cleared by the National Envi-
ronmental Board. In addition, it has been made a condition of project
approval by the NESDB that an environmental mitigation plan to address the
various environmental aspects of a project be prepared and coordinated among
the agencies concerned before submitting it to the NESDB for approval.
4.17      Ecological factors have been taken into account in the design of the
proposed transmission project in accordance with internationally accepted
safety practices, particularly with respect to radio interference, audible
noise, visual nuisance and ground gradients. The line routes have been selec-
ted to cause minimum disturbance to the environment. Substation sites have
been selected away from densely populated areas. No unusual safety hazards
are foreseen.

5.2       During the period FY81-86, ECAT's energy sales increased from
14,562 GWh in FY81 to 22,509 GWh in FY86--an average annual growth rate of
about 9%. As a result of substantial increases in electricity prices during
FY80 and FY81, as well as energy conservation measures and slower economic
growth, energy sales grew at an average annual rate of only 6.1% in FY81 and
FY82.   With higher economic growth and stable prices, energy sales increased
14% in FY83, and an average of nearly 10% in FY84 and FY85. The rate of
increase in FY86 was 6.2%.
5.3       EGAT has been a strong financial performer during the recent six
years. This strong performance was the direct result of a three step tariff
increase in FY81 (para. 5.23). Before that, the Government had been slow in
adjusting electricity tariffs to compensate for the dramatic fuel price
increases of 1979, and EGAT had experienced an operating loss in FY80. The
1981 tariff increases enabled EGAT to earn a net income of B 1610 million in
FY81, which then doubled in three years to B 3373 million in FY84. EGAT's
self-financing ratio, which was 23% in 1981, increased to 47% in 1984, and
averaged 32% during the FY81 to FY86 period. Its ROR, which was negative in
FY80, increased to 9.4% in FY81 and has remained at or above 8% between 1981
and 1986.



- 22 -
5.4       A 4% tariff reduction was implemented in April 1983 to correspond
with the decline in EGAT's operating costs which resulted from the oil price
decrease. EGAT's self-financing ratio fell from 311 in 1982 to 181 in 1983,
and its rate of return dropped from 10% in FY82 to 9.71 in FY83 and 81 in FY84
and FY85. Substantial foreign exchange losses (B 1,289 million in FY85 and
B 2,821 million in FY86) further reduced net income below the 1983 levels
(para. 5.15), and net income fell to B 1,702 million in FY85 and B 1,188
million in FY86.
5.5       EGAT, which was not obligated to pay income tax before FY82, has
been required since then to remit to the Ministry of Finance a portion of its
net income, at a level determined at year's end by the Ministry according to
the needs of the National Treasury. For FY82 and FY83, EGAT paid remittances
of about 5% of its net income. The remittance level was increased to 10% for
FY84, 131 fcr FY85 and 141 for FY86.
5.6       EGAT's borrowings have been heavy and debt service coverage fell
from 2.4 times in FY84 to 1.4 times in FY86. Nevertheless, EGAT's capital
structure has remained satisfactory. Debt as a percentage of total capitali-
zation has increased from 451 in FY84 to 50% in FY85 and 53% in FY86. These
ratios would have been even higher except that EGAT's revaluation of assets
inflated its revaluation reserve, an equity account. Much of the increase in
EGAT's long-term debt has resulted from the appreciation of the Japanese Yen,
German Mark and Swiss Franc, the currencies in which most of EGAT's debt is
denominated (para. 5.15). Long-term debt in foreign currencies is exchanged
into Bahts at the exchange rate effective on September 30 of the year for
which the financial statements are prepared. For FY86, the unrealized
exchange losses on the revaluation of loans for completed projects was B 9.9
billion. Both the long-term debt and the deferred foreign exchange liability
accounts were increased by this amount (before being reduced for realized
gains).
B. Present Financial Position
5.7       EGAT's financial position remains sound in FY87, with the self-
financing ratio expected to be 52%, the ROR estimated at 9.6%, and the debt
service coverage expected at 1.7 times. Energy sales are projected to
increase about 10%, and operating income is expected to rise by 12%. Net
income is estimated nearly to triple from FY86 levels, to B 3,294 million;
much of this increase results from a foreign exchange loss decrease in FY87
(from B 2.8 billion to B 1.5 billion) and assumes that exchange rates for FY87
will be similar to those at year end 1986. While the currency movements of
late 1986 and early 1987 suggest that projected foreign exchange losses may be
understated, EGAT's financial strength should enable it to withstand further
swings in its borrowing currencies.
C. Future Financial Performance

5.9       It was agreed at negotiations that EGAT would be required to produce
funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of the annual
average of its capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for
that fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following fiscal
year. A similar self-financing covenant would apply to the power subsector as
a whole. According to current projections, existing prices for EGAT sales to
MEA and PEA would be adequate to stay above the covenanted EGAT 25% self-
financing ratio level until FY93, when a price increase of 2.4% would be
needed. Further increases of 6.3%, 3.5% and 3.7% in 1994, 1995 and 1996,
respectively, would be required. In turn these would be passed on to the
consumer in tariff increases, as outlined in Table 5.4 below. If the volume
of EGAT's investment increases over the projected amounts (para. 2.10) and/or
if the remittance to the Government is higher than assumed here (14%), rate
increases would be required sooner.
5.10      Because of market saturation in urban areas, EGAT's energy sales
growth is currently projected to increase an average of 8% per year until
1991, and then about 5% p.a. between FY92 and FY96. Growth rates could
however be significantly higher in the short term if the Thai economy improves
faster than predicted. EGAT's operating income is projected to remain fairly
constant through the projected period, with reductions in PY92 and FY93. The
ROR is projected to remain between 6% and 10% through 1996. EGAT's power
assets, which are revalued each year according to an index published by the
Ministry of Finance, will increase at 4.7% p.a. from B 85,170 million in FY87
to B 127,161 million in FY96. Due to price-related increases in operating
income after 1993, as well as to decreases in losses on foreign exchange and
to increases in mining income, EGAT's total net income will more than double
between 1993 and 1996. The operating ratio for power sales will range between
75% and 87% during the projected period, increasing in later years as the
self-financing ratio declines to 25%.
5.11      The percentage of net income remitted to the Government is assumed
to remain at its present level in FY87 and each year thereafter, i.e. 14% for
EGAT, 35% for MEA, and 30% for PEA. If these percentages are increased for
EGAT to meet the 30-35% government guidelines, appropriate tariff increases
would be required to compensate for the additional expense.
5.12      EGAT's debt service coverage ratio will range between 1.3 and 1.7
times throughout the projected period. The capital structure will remain
satisfactory: the debt/total capital ratio is expected to average 46% and
remain below 53%. ECAT's current debt control test provides for Bank review
of borrowings when the debt equity ratio exceeds 60/40; this test will be
continued for the proposed loan. In addition, EGAT has been required not to
contract short and medium term debt (debt which matures within five years) in
excess of 15% of its total debt outstanding. EGAT has always complied with
this covenant and it will be repeated in the proposed loan.
5.13      EGAT has maintained a current ratio averaging 90% over the past six
years, with the ratio never falling below 80%. Projections show this trend
continuing, with the current ratio averaging 89%, although projected to fall
to 76% in FY90. Since EGAT has easy access to short-term borrowing in the
case of cash constraint, its liquidity position is satisfactory. Its current
ratio as projected through FY96 is acceptable.



- 25 -
5.14      The revised development program approved by the EGAT Board of
Directors in November 1987 but not yet authorized by the Government includes
investments more than 50% higher than the current Government approved forecast
(para 2.10). If this investment program is approved by the Government, EGAT
would need a 7% tariff increase in 1989 to meet the covenanted 25% self-
financing ratio; and adjustments averaging 3% per year would be required
annually between 1990 and 1996. With the revised development plan and
corresponding tariff increases, EGAT's rates of return on revalued net fixed
assets would be 11-12% between 1989 and 1992, 9-10% in 1993 and 1994, and 7-8%
for 1995 and 1996. The debt/total capital ratio would not exceed 52% during
the projected period, while the debt service coverage ratio would average 1.4
times and not drop below 1.2 times.
D. Foreign Exchange Exposure
5.15      As of September 30, 1986, EGAT had long term debt (net of current
maturities) of B 63,382 million, of which approximately 54% was denominated in
Japanese Yen, German Marks, or Swiss Francs. The Baht has weakened substan-
tially against these currencies: 40% against the Yen, 31% against the Mark and
33% against the Swiss Franc. EGAT has incurred considerable foreign exchange
losses, which it plans to write off over the respective terms of the loans.
This policy reflects a 1986 Ministry of Finance directive that all state
enterprises revalue foreign currency loans as of September 30 of each year
starting in 1986, and either expense the entire exchange loss in FY86 or
spread the loss over the remaining terms of the loans. In the past, EGAT had
deferred such losses and charged them against revenue only when the loans were
repaid. Now, EGAT has adopted the policy of revaluing the loans each year and
writing the exchange losses off over the remaining terms of such loans. The
policy change caused EGAT to expense B 1.3 billion more in FY86 than would
have been the case under the previous approach. The Government policy and the
alternative adopted by EGAT are appropriate: spreading the foreign exchange
losses is a far better alternative than affecting the net profit of one single
year by the entire amount of the 1v., i.e. B 14.6 billion in FY86.  The
deferred exchange adjustment account .nables EGAT to reflect the loss in a
timely manner and at the same time smooth out the effect of the exchange rates
swings on the net income of any given year. Even with the B 14.6 billion
increase in EGAT's debt, the debt to equity ratio remains well within the
covenanted 60/40 figure.

5.17      EGAT's investments represent 69% of the power subsector's total.
this share is expected to increase further by 1994 when EGAT's new plants will
be more capital intensive, and rural electrification has been completed. The
proposed project, including interest during construction, represents 11% of
EGAT's investment program for the period, and 7% of the subsector investment
program. The proposed Bank loan is expected to meet 5.5Z of EGAT's total
financing requirement for the period.
5.18      During the 1988-92 period, EGAT and the power sector both expect to
meet 36 to 40X of their total capital requirements from internally generated
funds. Less than 1% of EGAT's financing requirements will be met from govern-
ment equity contributions, which are expected to be restricted to reimburse-
ments of a portion of the cost of some of EGAT's multipurpose projects.



- 27 -
5.19      Borrowings from external sources amount to 59% of EGAT's financing
requirements between FY88 and FY92. EGAT has a long standing association with
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
(OECF) of Japan and more recently with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (KFAED) and the OPEC Fund. A list of EGAT's loans and their terms
is included in the project file (Annex 16). No difficulties have arisen in
the past in obtaining bilateral financing and suppliers credits. Since funds
were first obtained from commercial banks in 1978 for cofinancing the Pattani
hydroelectric project with the Bank, EGAT has made increasing use of Euro-
dollar and other sources, and has obtained several commercial bank loans for
its projects. Commercial bank loans are now raised annually to cover any
financing gap.
F. Subsector Finances
5.20      Substantial tariff increases in FY80 and FY81 brought the electri-
city price in Thailand to a level which was at or above long-range marginal
cost (LRMC) of supply, and went a long way towards restoring the financial
viability of the power subsector. Although the April 1983 tariff reduction
and the effect of inflation weakened the financial position of the power util-
ities between FY83 and FY85, the 1986 drop in fuel prices helped to keep the
self-financing ratio above 25% for both EGAT and the power subsector as a
whole.
5.21      With rate increases beginning in FY92 and averaging 5% per year
through FY96, the subsector is expected to produce an average self-financing
ratio of 33%, and to remain at or above the covenanted 25% level throughout
the projected period. With the estimated tariff increases, the subsector will
remain financially strong through 1996. Energy sales will increase at an
average annual rate of 7.2% until 1991 and at 5.1% per year thereafter.
Revalued net fixed assets will grow at about 5% per year throughout the ten
year period. The rate of return for the subsector is projected to remain at
or above 5.3%, and the debt service coverage to be at least 1.2 times. Debt
as a percent of total capital will fall from 51% in FY87 to 44% in FY93.
5.22      The 25% self-financing ratio covenant applied to the power subsector
as a whole ensures that the subsector will remain financially sound. It
avoids interferring with the question of whether it is right for PEA's and
MEA's customers to pay the same tariff in spite of substantially different
costs; it does not determine the precise subsidies that MEA and EGAT should
pay to PEA.  In 1986, when the subsector earned an 8% ROR, ayd ECAT earned
over 9% ROR, PEA and MEA earned 3.3% and 5.5%, respectively.-   Without the
B 227 million direct subsidy paid by EGAT and MEA to PEA, the PEA rate of
return would have been 1.9%, and MEA would have earned 7.3%. This differen-
1/   These returns take direct payments from EGAT and MEA to PEA into account,
and also reflect the cross-subsidization implicit in EGAT's rate sched-
ule: in 1986, PEA paid B 1.17/kWh, while MEA paid B 1.49/kWh for energy
purchased from EGAT. The PEA rate is close to the marginal cost of gene-
ration and transmission, while the MEA rate exceeds cost by about 25%.



- 28 -
tial is caused largely by the fact that PEA--with its extensive distribution
system and low-density coverage--charges its customers less than the cost of
service while MEA charges more.
G. Tariff Levels
5.23      Power rates were increased in February 1980 and, on the basis of the
Plan of Action agreed under Loan 1852-TH, were adjusted further on October 1,
1980, January 9, 1981 and April 1, 1981. In addition, a surcharge for heavy
consumers was established in August 1980. These adjustments represented a
total increase of about 158% on the rates charged by EGAT to PEA, MEA and
large direct consumers; they were 111% for PEA's consumers and 131% for users
in MEA's service area. A small rate reduction was implemented, effective
April 1, 1983, to reflect the reduction in EGAT's operating costs due to oil
prices decreases. This reduction amounted to about 4% for EGAT, 5% for PEA
and 1% for MEA. With the 1985 decline in fuel prices, the RTG implemented
another modest reduction on February 1, 1986, reducing electricity prices for
business and industrial uses, and some clarses of residential consumers.
5.24      Under Loan 2000-TH, EGAT agreed to review quarterly the adequacy of
its rates and to maintain a fuel cost variation charge clause in its tariff
schedule. But these rate adjustments are not automatic and may be either
delayed or omitted--as in the case of the fuel price decreases of July 1986--
following review by the Government. In addition, RTG has undertaken periodic
reviews of the tariffs of the three utilities to ensure that: (a) they are
adequate to meet the financial covenants for EGAT and for the power subsector;
and (b) they accomplish the required cross-funding among the three utilities
necessary to enable each of them to carry out its respective investment pro-
gram. EGAT and the sector have complied substantially with these covenants.
5.25      Annex 12, Table 1 shows the calculation of the average rate levels
for the power subsector that are necessary to keep a minimum self-financing
ratio of 25%, as agreed at negotiations. The rate levels projected at current
prices (in Baht per kWh) are presented in Table 5.4 below. They are within
15i of the average revenue that would result from strict LRMC pricing. The
estimated average self-financing ratio between FY87 and FY91 is 41% for the
subsector, without any rate increases.

H. Financial Covenants
5.26      To summarize, the covenants concerning corporate financial perfor-
mance will be continued as agreed under previous loans, as follows:
(a) EGAT shall furnish to the Bank financial statements and accounts
audited by consultants satisfactory to the Bank within six months of
the end of each fiscal year;
(b) EGAT's total debt shall not exceed 1.5 times its equity. Short and
medium term debt--having terms of less than five years--shall not
exceed 15% of total debt for the duration of the loan;
(c) EGAT and the subsector will be required to produce funds from
internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of the annual
average of expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred for
that fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following
fiscal year;
(d) EGAT will maintain in its tariff schedule a provision for fuel and
power purchase adjustments to compensate for changes in the price of
fuel and purchased power; and
(e) the Government will review periodically the adequacy of EGAT, PEA
and KEA tariffs and make adjustments as necessary to produce the
covenanted self-financing ratio for each fiscal year within the
period of the loan. For this purpose, the Government shall provide
to the Bank consolidated financial statements for the power subsec-
tor not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Rate of Return on EGAT's Program
6.1       Since the transmission project consists of numerous dispersed items,
its benefits are not attributable to a specific region or a specific group of
consumers. It is, therefore, inappropriate to calculate the economic rate of
return of this project in isolation from the rest of the investment program.
Accordingly, the appraisal estimates refer to: (a) the equalizing discount
rate for each component of the project; this would represent the economic rate
of return if the cost of the next best alternative is taken as the benefit
from the project; and (b) the economic rate of return for EGAT's investment
program for the period 1986-96 of which the proposed project is a part.
6.2       The economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated on the basis of the
incremental cost and benefit streams associated with the 1986-96 time slice of
EGAT's least cost expansion plan of which the proposed project forms a part
(Annex 13). The ERR on this expansion plan is 18.5X. Incremental costs were
based on the Bank defined scenarios for international fuxl prices. The level
of EGAT tariffs producing the minimum covenanted 251 self-financing ratio was
taken as a proxy for benefits. This approximation leads to underestimating
the ERR: the surplus enjoyed by final customers with a willingness to pay
more than the tariff, brings the ERR to about 30% as can be inferred from the
price elasticity embodied in the load forecasting models.
6.3       Sensitivity calculations have been carried out for other fuel price
profiles and correspondingly other rates for EGAT as determined by the exist-
ing financial covenants. The ERR stays at about 18.5%. It is also insensi-
tive to variants in the projected demand since the expansion plan selected by
EGAT can be adapted to the load level with a short decision lead time
(para. 2.8).
6.4       Equalizing discount rates for various project components show that
they all are least cost. Details are given in paras. 6.7-6.10.
B. Justification of Project Components
6.5       The project is an integral part of EGAT's least cost core develop-
ment program in the face of uncertainties for the period 1987-96. Power load
flow and stability analyses were carried out for the total EGAT system for the
next ten years in order to identify the needs for transmission network rein-
forcements. The criteria used by EGAT require that the system can be main-
tained stable during and after the most severe of the following contingencies:
(a) permanent three-phase fault on any generator, transmission circuit, trans-
former or bus section, with normal fault clearing; (b) permanent phase to
ground fault on any transmission circuit, transformer, or bus section with
delayed fault clearing; (c) loss of any single element without a fault; and
(d) permanent phase to ground fault on a circuit breaker, with normal fault
clea; ing.  In addition, the syssem performance is examined against the follow-
ing extreme contingencies: (a) permanent three-phase fault on any generator,

ing; (b) sudden dropping of a large load or major load center; and (c) failure
or maloperation of a special protection system such as a generation rejection,
load rejection, or transmission cross-tripping scheme. The above planning
criteria are consistent with sound utility practice.
6.6       After identifying the weak circuits of the transmission network
through the process described above, the feasible alternatives for reinforcing
each circuit are specified from which the least cost option is selected.
Finally, for each project component, an estimate is made of the cost differ-
ential with respect to the best alternative and the equalizing discount rate
(EDR) between the two is calculated. The detailed results of this least cost
analysis are presented in Annex 14.
TSE-7 Part A
6.7       EGAT has screened these subprojects at 115 and 230 kV out of a much
longer list of candidates. These subprojects were all found to be justified
mostly because they avoid power shortages worth several times the investment
cost; a higher design voltage is in a few cases justified by savings in losses
where the line capacity factor is sufficiently high. The EM with respect to
alternatives ranges from 131 to more than 1502. Each subproject is least cost
for discount rates smaller than the EDR.
TSE-7 Part B
6.8       Existing Control Centers in Bangkok and Region 4 (Mae Moh) must be
upgraded for two reasons. Major plants and lines now existing or under con-
struction cannot be adequately monitored for lack of equipment capacity.
Moreover, this extension upgrading will also allow for state-of-the-art soft-'
ware for on-line contingency analysis and economic dispatch at the National
Control Center. The expected benefits are lower fuel costs, smaller trans-
mission capacity margins, and quicker restoration of service after emergency
situations.
Central Southern Tie-Line
6.9       Based on existing power rates aad supply costs, the strengthening of
this interconnection by about 300 MW capacity yields an ERR of 30X or more; it
is justified on the following counts:
(a) a better grid integration will permit EGAT to opt for cheaper
generating options and save on reserve margins in Region 3;
(b)  an alternative based on gas would require a costly submarine pipe-
line which cannot be used to its full capacity for a number of
years;



- 32 -
(c)  if, in the future, these gas related investments in the South prove
justified then the tie-line would be very valuable in exporting
power to the Central Region and meet demand along the way. It can
also be used later in combination with direct current schemes which
would now be least cost only for discount rates under 9Z.
Tha Tako - Nong Chok 500 kV Line
6.10      When Mae Moh Unit No. 9 is commissioned, this new line will add
needed capacity to transfer low cost energy to the metropolitan area.  From
the first year, the line will be sufflciently loaded even when a 300 MW unit
at Mae Moh is out of service, and if the 500 kV line was not constructed on
time, the power flow on existing circuits would be so high that a line fault
on these circuits would cause an unacceptable overload of the grid. A 230 kV
variant of this line was considered, but energizing the line at 500 kV from
the start and thereby saving on network losses during five years is the least
cost solution for discount rates of 12% and under.
C. Risks
6.11      Since the main objective of the 500 kV component is to transmit bulk
power from the minemouth Mae Moh thermal power stations to the Bangkok area,
any problem affecting the output from Unit No. 9 would also affect the success
of this component. In 1991 even under a scenario of modest demand growth the
energy shortage would be huge without the 300 MW of this unit. Accordingly,
its construction is now underway; the additional 2.3 million tons of lignite
required annually for the unit will be mined by EGAT under an ongoing expan-
sion plan of minor proportions. No slippages are anticipated in any of these
two undertakings.
6.12      The realization of other project components does not depend on any
particularly large works prerequisites. EGAT will rely on its own labor force
for the installation of substations at 230 kV and 115 kV. The procurement
arrangement for the lines is well underway. As most transmission lines
traverse flat agricultural areas and woods, little problem in obtaining and
clearing the right-of-way for line construction is expected. The right-of-way
for the sections close to the outskirts of Bangkok is in the process of being
secured. There is no risk that the new control center facilities may not be
fully tested for lack of incoming data since most of the data acquisition
equipment in remote stations already exists.

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECO*MENDATION
A. Agreements
7.1       During negotiations, agreements were obtained from ECAT regarding
the following:
(a) Independent external auditors will continue to be called upon to
review EGAT's annual financial statements and issue a separate
report. ECAT shall furnish to the Bank these audited financial
statements within six months after the close of each fiscal year
(para. 3.13).
(b) ECAT will continue its self-insurance arrangements as approved
through a review procedure under Loan 2407-TH (para. 3.14).
(c) SCAT will hire and continue to employ consultants for the engineer-
ing and supervision of the SCCs and the 500 kV project components in
accordance with Bank guidelines (para. 4.12).
(d) ECAT will provide a quarterly review of the adequacy of its rates
and maintain a fuel cost adjustment clause in its tariff schedule as
agreed under existing covenants, Loan 2407-TH (para. 5.24).
(e) ECAT's short and medium term debt (maturing within five years) will
not exceed 151 of ECAT's tol,al debt outstanding. A debt control
test will provide for Bank. review of EGAT borrowings when the debt
to equity ratio exceeds o0/40 (para. 5.12).
7.2       During negotiations, agreements were obtained from the Government
regarding the following:
(a) The Government will carry out a study to improve power load fore-
casting methods in Thailand in accordance with terms of reference
and timing agreed with the Bank and exchange views with the Bank on
the progress and results of the study upon completion (para. 2.17).
(b) The Government will carry out a time-phased action plan for tariff
structure improvements agreed with the Bank that will reconsider (i)
cross subsidies between residential and nonresidential users, (ii)
peak and off-peak rate differentials, and (iii) rate differentials
between high and medium voltage levels of service (para. 2.18).
(c) The Government will undertake periodic power rate reviews to ensure
that tariffs are adequate (i) for both ECAT and the power subsector
to produce funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than
25% of the annual average capital expenditures incurred, or expected
to be incurred, for that fiscal year (para. 5.9), the previous
fiscal year, and the next following fiscal year, and (ii) for
accomplishing the cross-funding among the three utilities required
for each to carry out its respective investment program



- 34 -
(para. 5.24). For this purpose, the Government shall provide to the
Bank consolidated financial statements for the power subsector
within six months after the end of each fiscal year.
B. Recommendation
7.3       The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$110 million
made to ECAT at the standard variable interest rate for a 17-year term includ-
ing a 4-year grace period. The Guarantor will be the Kingdom of Thailand.

Action Plan for Power Tariff Structure Improvements
Background
The cost structure of electric power service over Thailand's inter-
connected grid can be reflected in the national tariff structure with
acceptable and often minor departures. The most important areas for
improvements in the existing tariff structure are three:
(a) reflecting cost differences between the main voltage levels of
delivery;
(b) reflecting cost differences arising from marked variations in
consumers' usage patterns viz load factor, power factor and
intensity of peak time demand; and
(c) reducing subsidies for consumers falling outside low income groups.
In the pursuit of these objectives, the Government of the Kingdom of
Thailand has agreed to take all measures required to implement the plan of
action described below.
Program to be Executed by the First Year
(a) For large and medium size business and industrial customers,
(i)    reduce or eliminate existing tariff surcharges;
(ii)    increase the kW demand charge and reduce the kWh charge to
reflect the relative marginal capacity costs and energy costs;
and
(iii)    introduce tariff differences between high, medium and low
voltage to reflect network costs and energy losses.
Program to be Executed by the Second Year
(b) For residential customers, reduce the size and/or number of tranches
in the existing increasing block tariff.
(c) For large and medium size business and industrial customers,
(i)    introduce kW charge billing on the basis of contracted rather
than metered maximum demand; and



- 45 -                            ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 4
(ii)    introduce optional time-of-day kWh tariffs and reduced kW
charges for low load factor uses and incremental demand
contracted off-peak.
Program to be Executed by the Third Year
(d) Extend further the use of cost-based, time-of-day tariff options in
light of the previous year's experience.
Program to be Executed when Tariffs are Adjusted
(e) Adjust rates of large and medium size residential customers in line
with the economic cost of low voltage service.

POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
Assumptions in the Financial Forecasts of ECAT
Revenues
1.        The average price of electricity is about B 1.32 per kWh sold in
1987. As lower price sales to PEA become predominant, it is projected to
decline slightly to B 1.31 until FY93, when a price increase will be necessary
to maintain ECAT's 231 self-financing ratio. Prices are increased on average
41 per year between FY93 and FY96 in order to keep the self-financing ratio at
251. EGAT's average electricity price annual increases, and self-financing
ratios for FY87 through FY96 are shown below:
FY87   FY88   FY89  FY90  FY1  FY92  FY93  FY94  FY95  FY96
Average energy
price (B/kWh)    1.32   1.31   1.31  1.31  1.31  1.31  1.34  1.42  1.47  1.53
Price increase                                             2.4   6.3   3.5   3.7
Self-financing
ratio            521    401    44X   451   291   371   25X   251   251   251
2.        Energy sales will grow at 6.51 on average based on projections made
by the Load Forecasting Working Group (Annex 4). These projections are
basically extrapolations of recent trends checked against econometric models
involving assumptions on the growth of the gross domestic product (para. 2.16).
Growth rates average 6.51 over the ten year period 1987-96.
Fuel Costs
3.        The fuel mix is based on ECAT's least cost generation plan (Annex
6). Financial prices for these fuels are based on the economic projections of
Annex 13, Table 1, after inclusion of taxes and royalties which -smount to 251
for fuel oil, B 15/ton for lignite, and 10.31 for natural gas. The resulting
price profiles are as follows:
(a) Fuel oil and diesel prices escalate from 1987 prices of B 2.79 and
B 6.17 per liter, respectively, to B 5.07 per liter and B 11.18 per
liter in 1996, increasing at approximately 6.81 per year.



-52 -                            ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 6
(b) Lignite prices are based on the current EGAT transfer price of
B 517/ton and are assumed to escalate at approximately 41 per year
over the study period.
(c) Natural gas prices escalate from the current B 70/MMBtu at
approximately 5S per year, with an initial increase in 1988 of over
11%.
Operating Costs
4.        Generation expenses are based on current EGAT experience, with
projections for future plants based on historical costs for similar plants and
escalated with inflation rates of 3Z for FY87, 1Z per annum for FY88 through
90, and 3.51 per annum thereafter.
5.        Power purchased from Laos is priced at .81 Baht/kWh and from Malaysia
at 1.0017 Baht/kWh throughout the projection period.
6.        Transmission expenses are projected on the basis of unit costs and
additions in line length and transformer capacity in EGAT's expansion
program.  Other operation and maintenance expenses including General and
Administrative expenses, are based on current levels, inflated at the rates of
inflation listed in para. 6 above.
7.        Depreciation is based on the straight-line method on revalued fixed
assets. The average rate of depreciation is 1.33X for hydropower plants, 41
for other generating facilities, 2.51 for transmission lines and 4X for
substations.
8.        The rate of remittance to the Government of Thailand is assumed to be
141, which is the' FY86--and so far the highest--tax rate levied by the
Ministry of Finance on EGAT a net income (based on unrevalued depreciation).
Capital Investment
9.        Construction costs are those estimated to provide the additional
plant and equipment required to meet the demand forecast, escalated in
accordance with the latest projection of inflation rates (shown in para. 6
above). The expenditure schedule is included in the project file and listed in
Annex 16.
Equity
10.       Equity contributions represent the Government of Thailand's
reimbursement for import duties on construction equipment and partial payment
with respect to the irrigation portion of multipurpose dams.
Foreign Exchange Losses
11.       Deferred foreign exchange losses represent the profits and losses
from exchange rate variations on long term debt. The projected figures amount



- 53 -                          ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 6
on EGAT's accounts at the end of FY86 less the incremental amounts which are
scheduled to be written off over the remaining periods of EGAT's existing
loans. The amounts shown in the income statement and balance sheet reflect
currency movements against the Baht through September 30, 1986.
Borrowings
12.       Future foreign loans have been assumed at annual interest rates
varying from 3 to 9% and for terms of up to 20 years, including from 3 to 5
years of grace. Local borrowings have been assumed at annual interest rates of
8 to 10, and for terms of up 13 years, including 3 years of grace. Actual
loans outstanding and their terms are listed in the Project File (Annex 16).
13.       Accounts receivable are projected to be approximately 2 months of
revenues in accordance with a recent government regulation affecting State
Enterprises.

Economic Rate of Return
Power Development Plan
1.        The calculation of the ERR is based on the incremental costs and
incremental sales associated with the base case Power Development Plan (PDP)
for the period 1987-96 (Annex 5 and Chart 2).
2.        This PDP is the least cost solution for the demand forecast as
revised by the Load Forecasting Working Group as of September 1986 (Annex 4)
and for fuel prices intermediate between those of the "Status Quo" (SQ) and
"Tightening Oil Market" (TOM) Scenarios defined below. These scenarios are
those used by the Bank and NESDB for the 1987 strategic planning studies of the
impact of low and uncertain oil prices on energy sector investments; they are
used here for sensitivity analyses. Under the TOM scenario, oil prices would
recover their 1985 level by 1995, and energy demand would slow down, whereas
under the SQ scenario, oil prices would remain flat until 1995 and energy
demand would grow at a faster pace.
3.        The base case PDP can adapt smoothly to TOM conditions as early as
1992 by omitting gas turbine additions and postponing Srinagarind Unit No. 5
(180 MW). When faced with flat oil prices, this PDP catches up by 1997 with
the coal-based expansion program that would be best if the SQ scenario was
certain to occur. The best response to demand surges as early as 1992-93
consists in additional gas turbine capacity which can be accommodated best
under the base case PDP since it consists of several combined cycle plants.
Economic Costs
4.        All costs are expressed at 1986 prices.  Economic costs exclude taxes
and royalties and are calculated at the official exchange rate of B 27 per
US$. Border prices were used for traded goods such as electromechanical
equipment, fuel oil and coal. Unskilled labor, shadow priced at 701 of the
real wage rate, corresponds to less than 1Z of total outlays. Physical and
price contingencies are excluded. Natural gas prices at well head were assumed
to follow the adjustment principles embodied in the existing arrangements with
Union Oil (40X of the price indexed on fuel oil and the rest indexed on local
and international inflation). Lignite is priced at the long run average
incremental cost. The Base Case price profiles and the range of assumptions
under the SQ and TOM scenarios are presented in Table 1 below.

Benefits
5.        The benefits were projected on the basis of EGAT's incremental ene'gy
sales for the period 1987-96 under the base case load forecast. Average unit
prices are adjusted in real terms to comply with financial covenants (25% self-
financing ratio) under the above base case fuel cost assumptions. Sensitivity
analyses were carried out under the SQ and TOM fuel cost/assumptions.
Economic Rate of Return
6.        The internal economic rate of return (IEER) is the discount rate
which equalizes the present value of economic costs and benefits. The results
are as follows:
Base Case:                       20%
High Fuel Price (TOM):           19%
Low Fuel Price (SQ):             22%
