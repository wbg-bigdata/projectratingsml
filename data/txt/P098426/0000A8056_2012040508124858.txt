                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Governance Assistance Project is a multi-component project that has been under implementation since 2007. The major achievements of the project to date are:

                         -- The development of the Computerized Mining Cadastre System (CMCS) which, coupled with relevant training and organizational changes, improved the quality and speed of the
                         license processing, reducing discretionary actions within the cadastre office and eliminating overlaps with other licenses and protected areas.

                         -- The rollout of the government's treasury system the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS), to 325/333 soums by the end of 2011, exceeding the
                         original target of 50 soums. The project financed the first 50 soums, with the rest financed by the state budget, underlining government commitment and the sustainability of the
                         GFMIS. The GFMIS has significantly improved payment processing and budget execution.

                         perception surveys, as well as agency risk assessments. The baseline survey was completed in December 2009. The follow-up survey, financed by the government, was conducted
                         in December 2011, with results expected in May 2012.
                         -- Tax administration reforms, including the introduction of a regular strategic planning process, introducing risk management procedures, improving taxpayer services and
                         information, and strengthening transparency and integrity.
                         -- Capacity building of the Procurement Policy Department (PPD) of the Ministry of Finance, in particular on procurement monitoring.

                         Continued support for public procurement reform and the development of an integrated tax administration information system (TAIS) are the two main remaining activities in the
                         project. The Government made major changes to the Procurement Law in June 2011 which includes the establishment of a central procurement agency and a procurement
                         inspectorate in the MoF; decentralization of procurements from the local budget to local governments; the introduction of framework agreements; support to e-government; and a new
                         role for civil society organizations in bid evaluation and ex post monitoring of contracts. GAP will be used to help implement these provisions in the law. TAIS is currently under
                         implementation, although some delays are anticipated.
