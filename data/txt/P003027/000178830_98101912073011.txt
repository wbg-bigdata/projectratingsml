OIL PALM PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
(i)       In the face of stagnation in the traditional agricultural sector
and reduced production from the modern plantation sector, the Government
of Zaire has recently determined that the highest priority should be given
to the rehabilitation and development of the country's agriculture. The
Government now realizes that major efforts need to be undertaken to reverse
the alarming trends of rapidly increasing agricultural imports and declining
exports. Thus, production of palm oil on commercial estates decreased from
about 240,000 ton in 1959 to about 125,000 ton in 1976, while production from
natural palms is estimated to have decreased from about 55,000 ton to 45,000
ton. Lower production, combined with increasing domestic consumption of palm
oil, have caused Zaire's official exports to decline from about 190,000 ton in
1959 to about 40,000 ton in 1976. If this trend were to continue Zaire would
need to import palm oil in the next few years and prompt action is therefore
necessary to avoid that situation.
(ii)      In the present circumstances the Government of Zaire considers that
the rehabilitation of a number of existing commercial oil palm plantations
offers the best prospects for future production increases at the least cost.
Additional courses of action include the establishment of new, large, in-
dustrial plantations, smallholder schemes and the improvement of production
in the natural palm tree areas. All these alternatives are relatively costly
or risky, and are uncertain to result in substantial production increases
rapidly. Assigning priority to rehabilitation efforts has the clear advan-
tage that full use would be made of the infrastructure and management remain-
ing on the existing commercial estates.
(iii)     At the request of the Government of Zaire and with the assistance
of an IBRD/FAO Cooperative Program team, three companies (representing about
60% of Zaire's commercial oil palm industry) have drawn up investment pro-
posals for the rehabilitation of their existing plantations. The three
companies are: Plantations Lever au Zaire (PLZ), Busira-Lomami (Busira) and
Compagnie de Commerce et de Plantations (CCP). Along with most of Zaire's
commercial and industrial enterprises the companies were de-nationalized in
September 1976 and restored to their original foreign shareholders.
(iv)      The Project would, over five years (1978-1982), provide for the
planting of 12,215 ha oil palm; the renewal of equipment of three oil mills;
the procurement of earth moving equipment, trucks, tractors and staff vehicles
construction or repair of workers and staff houses and social infrastructure;
training; employment of ad.ditional staff; technical assistance, feasibility
studies and pilot programs to develop agricultural production and raise the
standard of living of the rural population in the Project areas. Apart from



- ii -
the technical assistance component, for which the Department of Agriculture
would be responsible, the Project would be implemented by the companies
mentioned in paragraph (iii). A committee of Government and company repre-
sentatives under the chairmanship of the Director General of the Department of
Agriculture would assess the Project's progress, review annual work programs
and budgets and coordinate Project related matters.
(v)       The overall cost of the Project including physical and price con-
tingencies, is estimated at US$47.4 million of which about 74% would be
invested in PLZ.   About 56% of Project cost (US$26.4 million) requires
external financing while the balance would be financed by the companies
themselves. In addition to an IDA Credit of US$9.0 million, the African
Development Fund (ADF) is expected to contribute about US$6.1 million, the
Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) about US$4.4 million
and the Caisse Centrale (CCCE) about US$4.2 million. US$0.7 million worth
of land clearing equipment, which PLZ ordered in 1977, is being financed out
of a US$16.6 million US commodity import loan to the Government.
(vi)      IDA and ADF would lend to the Government, CCCE would lend its funds
to SOFIDE and BADEA would lend directly to PLZ and Government. The onlending
terms for IDA, ADF and CCCE funds would be identical with a repayment period
of 15 years, including five years of grace, and an interest rate of 10% per
annum. The companies would take the foreign exchange risk on all off-shore
expenditures and the Government would bear this risk on expenditures in local
currency to the extent that these are financed with external funds. SOFIDE
would administer loans to be made to the companies, as an intermediary for
CCCE's funds (on which SOFIDE would receive a 3% margin) and as an agent o
Government for IDA funds to be onlent to the 2 small companies (for which
SOFIDE would receive a fee).
(vii)     Vehicles, trucks, tractors, tools, fertilizers and pesticides would
be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. About one-half of the oil mill equipment would also be
procured through ICB; for the other half standardization with existing equip-
ment is essential and direct procurement would therefore be accepted. Because
of the isolated location of the plantations the construction of houses and
other buildings and the civil works and erection of equipment for the oil
mills would be undertaken on force account by the oil palm companies them-
selves.
(viii)    The new plantings to be made under the Project would produce about
33,000 ton palm ail and about 8,000 ton palm kernels at full maturity in
1995. In that year the Project's output, with a value of about US$18 million,
is expected to represent about 18% of Zaire's total palm oil production
(186,000 ton). Without the Project, Zaire's deficit of palm oil would reach
about 30,000 ton in 1990 and 80,000 ton in 1995.
(ix)      The Project's internal economic rate of return is estimated at
16%; the internal financial rate of return for each of the companies' parts
of the Project ranges between 16% (CCP) and 21% (Busira). The major risk



- iii -
facing the Project is that the planting program would need to be reduced if
the companies were unable to recruit sufficient numbers of plantation workers.
Another risk is the uncertain river transport situation which could impair the
delivery of essential supplies and the shipment of the companies' palm oil and
palm kernels. Delays in the planting program and transport delays would
possibly result in higher overhead costs per ton of oil produced and probably
also in lower revenues. Both the IER and the IFR would decrease by about two
percentage points if for the above (or any other) reasons the costs were to
increase by 10%; a further reduction by another two percentage points would
occur if simultaneously the Project's benefits were to decrease by 10%. The
Project provides for better housing and social services to reduce the risk of
labor shortages. The level of the needed increase in the wages of plantation
workers is now being discussed between the Government and the companies while
in the future the Project coordinating committee would regularly review this
aspect. Recent measures to strengthen ONATRA's management and operational
staff are expected to reduce the river transport risk for the Project.
(x)       About 3,500 plantation laborers' jobs would become available as
a result of the '>roject. Besides net earnings (at present about US$200 per
year for a full-time worker) they would also benefit from company housing
and social services under the Project. The net income of the participating
companies on Project investments is expected to reach a level of about US$3
million per year during the period 1987-1997. Of this, 52% would be payable
to the Government in the form of company taxes while the balance would partly
be retained by the companies and partly distributed to the shareholders.
(xi)      Since 1967 Zaire has received 13 IDA Credits totalling US$192.5
million, and one IBRD Loan of US$100 million (Gecamines). Of the IDA Credits
three have been for the agricultural sector. A 1973 Livestock Project had a
slow start and experienced management and technical difficulties as well as
cost overruns. Some adjustments in expenditures may be necessary in order to
achieve the Project's main objectives by 1979. The two other Credits were
recently extended for a Cotton Development Project (1976) and for a second
Livestock Project (1977).
(xii)     The Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$9.0 million to the
Government of Zaire.

OIL PALM PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
1.01      In the face of stagnation in the traditional agricultural sector and
reduced production from the modern plantation sector, the Government of Zaire
has recently determined that the highest priority should be given to the
rehabilitation and development of the country's agriculture. The Government
now realizes that major efforts need to be undertaken to reverse the alarming
trends of rapidly increasing imports of food stuffs and declining agricultural
exports. Thus, production of palm oil on commercial estates decreased from
about 240,000 ton in 1959 to about 125,000 ton in 1976 and production from
natural palm groves is estimated to have decreased from about 55,000 ton to
45,000 ton over the sane period. Lower production, combined with increasing
domestic consumption of palm oil, have caused Zaire's official exports
to decline from about 190,000 ton in 1959 to about 40,000 ton in 1976. If
this trend were to continue Zaire would need to start importing palm oil in
the next few years and prompt action is therefore necessary to avoid that
situation.
1.02      The Government also realizes that the rehabilitation of existing
commercial oil palm estates, rather than establishing new plantations or
supporting the small traditional oil palm sector (paragraph 2.06), offers the
best prospects for increasing, within a reasonable time period, the production
of oil. Along with the other foreign-owned businesses in Zaire, the oil palm
estates were either Zairianized in 1973-74 or nationalized in 1974-75. The
abrupt implementation of these measures has further disrupted normal operations
of the oil palm companies whose financial positions had already been weakened
as a result of inadequate official price policies for oil sold locally and
because of heavy taxes on exports. Since September 1976 most of the oil palm
companies are again owned by their former foreign shareholders.
1.03      The proposed Oil Palm Project would support Government's overall
strategy for the agricultural sector. It would provide assistance mainly
for replanting of old or abandoned plantations, for renewing of their oil
mills, transport fleets and equipment and it would finance feasibility studies
and pilot smallholder programs. Three companies would benefit from the
Project:  Plantations Lever au Zaire (PLZ), which is owned by Unilever
(British-Dutch) and Busira-Lomami (Busira) and Compagnie de Commerce et de
Plantations (CCP), which are owned by Belgian parent companies.
1.04      The Project proposals for PLZ and Busira were formulated by the
companies themselves, in consultation with the Government and an IBRD/FAO
Cooperative Program mission which visited Zaire in May 1976. The proposals



-2-
for CCP vere prepared by the company following an IDA pre-appraisal mission
in October 1976. The CCP proposals were substantially reduced during the
appraisal of the Project since they were found to be overambitious.
1.05      Since 1967 Zaire has received 13 IDA Credits totalling US$192.5
million, and one IBRD Loan of US$100 million (Gecamines). Of the IDA Credits,
three have been for the agricultural sector. A 1973 Livestock Project had a
slov start and experienced management and technical difficulties and cost
overruns because of inflation. Some adjustments in expenditures may be
necessary in order to achieve the project's main objectives by 1979. Priority
vould be given to the purchase of more heifers and the provision of ranch
infrastructure, transport facilities, and essential minerals and drugs. The
tvo other Credits were recently extended for a Cotton Development Project
(1976) and for a second Livestock Project (1977).
1.06      The Oil Palm Project was appraised in January 1977 by an IDA team
in collaboration with representatives of the African Development Fund (ADF)
and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) which are expected
to co-finance the Project with IDA. The IDA team consisted of Messrs. H.
van Voorthuizen, S. Gafsi and P.R. du Mee.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Republic of Zaire covers 2.3 million square kilometers and is
the third largest country in Africa. Its population in 1975 was about
25 million, and is growing at a rate of about 2.7% per annum. Most of the
country has a vet tropical climate, but the plateau areas of the southeast and
the mountainous areas along the eastern border have cooler and more temperate
regimes. A vide variety of crops can be grown and the natural grasslands and
forests offer a vide range of development possibilities, including livestock.
The lakes and rivera are vell stocked with fish and provide nearly 15,000
kilometers of navigable waterways and considerable hydroelectric potential.
There are significant deposits of copper, zinc, manganese and cobalt. In 1975
minerals accounted for about 80% of Zaire's export earnings and agricultural
producte for about 15%.
2.02      Between 1970 and 1974 Zaire's GDP grew at an average annual rate
of 5% per year, but in 1975 GDP fell by 4.6% due to a shortage of essential
import goods, a sharp drop in copper prices and the disruptive effects of
the Zairianization measures. All sectors of Zaire's economy have been
adversely affected by uncontrolled Government spending and high inflation,
causing the decline in economic growth and serious budgetary and balance of
payments problems. A first stabilization program was adopted by Government
in 1976 in consultation with the IMF and a second program was adopted in
April 1977. Per capita income in 1974-76 is estimated to be about US$140,
for the country as a whole, but cash income is considerably less in rural
areas.

B. Agricultural Sector
2.03      Only 1% of Zaire's total area is cultivated; 45% is covered by equa-
torial forests and the balance comprises savanna, mountains, lakes, rivers and
marshes. About three quarters of Zaire's population derives its livelihood
from agriculture and much of the remainder is indirectly dependent on it for
employment. In 1975 agriculture's contribution to GDF was about 15%. About
one half of agricultural production is marketed and the other half consumed
directly by producer families. These proportions reflect the dual nature of
the agricultural sector. On the one hand there are between three and four
million traditional small family farms, whose combined production accounts for
about 57% of total agricultural output. Those families grow food crops for
subsistence, mainly cassava, maize, plantain and rice, and small amounts of
cash crops, usually coffee or cotton. On the other hand, there are the com-
mercial farm organizations, ranging from small and often poorly managed plan-
tations, working at low levels of efficiency to large, corporation-operated
plantations which include ranches extending over large land areas. The first
commercial plantations date back to the beginning of the century and were
designed primarily for industrial scale export crops, mainly oil palm, coffee
and rubber, and to a lesser extent cacao and tea. The plantation sector re-
mains of great importance for the Zairian economy, because it contributes to
the country's foreign exchange earnings and provides substantial employment.
Many adverse conditions in Zaire, starting with the political turmoil of the
1960s and followed by the nationalization policies, the lack of spare parts
and other essential imports and the deterioration of transport facilities,
compounded by unfavorable price policies and inadequate wages and social
services for plantation workers, have discouraged the upkeep of existing
plantations, the replanting of old plantations and the renewal of factory and
other equipment. The result has been a pronounced decline in all export crops
except coffee.
2.04      Agriculture has also suffered from the low level of public expendi-
tures in the sector. From 1970-1974 agriculture's share of the recurrent budget
fluctuated between 2% and 3% while its share of the public investment budget
varied between 2% and 4%. Since 1976 Government has expressed its intention
to give a higher priority to agricultural development. The main objectives of
its new agricultural policy are to increase agricultural production in order
to (i) satisfy national needs for basic food stuffs; (ii) provide raw materials
for domestic agro-industries; (iii) increase exports; and (iv) increase farmer
income and improve living standards of farm families.  A number of policy
changes and projects which would help meet these objectives are now being
implemented or are under preparation. The Government prepared a 3 year plan
(1978-1980) for the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector; the first meet-
ing of the Agriculture Working Group which was created under the auspices of
the Consultative Group for Zaire met in Kinshasa in mid March, 1978, chaired
by the Bank, to discuss Government proposals and coordinate donor assistance.
C. The Oil Palm Sector (Annex 1)
Natural Palm Groves
2.05      Harvesting and processing of fruits of the wild oil palms (Elaeis
Guineensis) has traditionally been practiced in three major.areas (Map 12834).



Firstly Mayumbe, in the extreme western part of the country, which is well
located from the marketing point of view.  The average annual rainfall of
1,200 mm in the area, however, is too low for modern industrial plantations
of high yielding varieties and the dry season of five to six months per year
is too long. Secondly, Kikwit, in Bandundu Region, which has a slightly
higher rainfall - 1,650 mm per year - but a pronounced dry season of three
months and generally mediocre soils for oil palm. Some industrial plantations
were started here during the initial period of the plantation industry,
but the area is not regarded as promising for the future development of modern
oil palm plantations. Thirdly, Equateur and the western part of Haut Zaire
in northern Zaire, which have an average annual rainfall of 1,800-2,000 mm,
without a marked dry season, and are therefore better suited for the cultiva-
tion of oil palm. Most of the industrial plantations are located in that part
of the country.
2.06      Fruits from the natural trees are either processed in a traditional
manner by the villagers themselves or sold to oil palm companies and processed
in their mills. The production of village-processed oil bas probably only
slightly decreased since 1970, if at all; for 1976 this production is esti-
mated at above 45,000 ton. Most of this oil is consumed locally, but an
unknown proportion is sold to local traders at prices which are believed to
exceed substantially the official prices determined by the Government.
Delivery of palm fruits to the oil palm companies, however, has sharply
declined in Bandundu and Mayumbe. For the two areas combined, the production
of the companies decreased by about 30% from 74,000 ton in 1970 to about
53,000 ton in 1976. Major reasons given for this are the low official prices
paid for the fruits, an increasing reluctance by cutters to climb the trees
and the bad state of maintenance of the roads. A 100% increase of the fruit
prices from one makuta to two makuta per kg, announced in mid-1976, did not,
however, increase delivery of fruits to the companies. This situation,
combined with the unfavorable climatic conditions, effectively rules out the
Mayumbe and Bandundu areas as potential contributors to an increase in Zaire's
palm oil production.
Industrial Plantations
2.07      In the northern Equateur and Haut Zaire Regions almost the entire
production of palm oil comes from industrial plantations. At most of these
plantations, the collection of natural fruits has been discontinued, possibly
because of inadequate incentives, by the local population. Some villagers
still collect and process the fruits themselves, but the quantities involved
are believed to be small. The production of the companies declined by about
20% from 85,000 ton in 1970 to 69,000 ton in 1976 (para 2.03). The reduction
of investments in new plantations, particularly during the 1960's is reflected
in both the total area under palms and in the skewed age distribution of
the trees. At the end of 1976, the total area of oil palms was estimated at
about 71,900 ha (this includes about 11,000 ha planted before 1960 in Bandundu
but still in production) against 93,000 ha in 1973. The age distribution of
the trees was, at the end of 1976, as follows:



Age in Years          More than 20  15-20   10-15   5-10   less than 5   Total
Area - in Ha.              22,800    20,500  6,500   8,900    13,200         71,900

More than 40% of the recent plantings were made on a new Government owned
scheme (CAE) and the CELZA company but PLZ's annual plantings remained at
less than half the level achieved during the 1950's.
2.08      The distribution of the oil palm plantation areas by company is as
follows (end 1976):

PLZ (Annex 2) is the largest company and accounts for nearly half of Zaire's
industrial palm oil production. The company has four oil palm plantations
in Equateur and Haut Zaire and three in Bandundu. PLZ wishes to turn its
southern plantations over to Government for growing alternative cash crops in
Bandundu instead of oil palms. PLZ's other activities include 7,500 ha rubber
and 3,800 ha cacao on two plantations in Equateur and a tea estate in Kivu.
Busira (Annex 3) has one oil palm plantation (Bembelota) and a number of
scattered small rubber and coffee plantations, all in the western part of Haut
Zaire. The company is experiencing serious transport problems with its rubber
production and does not plan any investments in that sector. CCP (Annex 4)
has two oil palm plantations in Equateur and operates four small oil mills in
the natural palm tree areas of Bandundu. The company has no other crops. The
other major companies, which are not included in the Project, are Hevea
Cequa, "Cultures et elevage au Zaire" (CELZA), "Commission agricole pour
l'Equateur (CAE), and "Societe de cultures au Mayumbe" (SCAM) (see Annex 1,
para 12). In the framework of Government's CAE scheme in Equateur an effort
was undertaken recently to introduce oil palms on smallholder farms. So far
this project has not made much progress because of lack of financial attractive-
ness to the population of the localities concerned.
Development Priorities
2.09      In early 1976, because of the rapidly deteriorating situation of the
existing oil palm plantations the Government formulated a "Plan d'Urgence".



- 6 -
This plan provides for an accelerated renewal, over ten years, of some 80,000
ha of old or abandoned plantations and a modest extension of 20,000 ha, also
on existing plantations. Where necessary, oil mills, roads, social infra-
structure, means of transport and other equipment would be replaced, renewed
or improved. The plan provides a realistic basis for investments in the
immediate future, because full use would be made of the existing management
capacity of companies and the remaining infrastructure on the plantations.
Marketing
2.10      Both internal and external marketing of oil palm products is entire-
ly in the hands of the private sector, while the Government regulates internal
market prices and determines export quotas. Total domestic consumption of
palm oil produced by the industrial companies increased from about 47,000 ton
in 1970 to about 73,000 ton in 1975. Some 47,000 ton of the 1975 consumption
were sold to the manufacturing industry, mainly for making soap and margarine,
while the other 25,000 ton were sold to licensed private traders. In addi-
tion, about one half of the 45,000 ton of village palm oil produced in 1975 is
believed to have been sold to traders outside the producing areas. An unknown
part of the oil marketed through traders is believed to have been sold
illegally through informal channels to neighbouring countries, while the
balance was sold for household usage within Zaire. According to some esti-
mates, illegal exports were about 25,000 ton in 1975. This practice, which
deprives Zaire of export duties, is believed to have increased significantly
in recent years because of the low official domestic prices for palm oil (para
2.13) which prevailed during the last 8 years.
2.11      Official exports of palm oil, palm kernel oil and palm kernel cake,
are handled by the producing companies themselves, in most cases through
European agents. Official exports of palm oil declined from 123,000 ton in
1970 to less than 40,000 ton in 1976. Palm kernel oil exports decreased
from 50,000 ton in 1970 to 29,000 ton in 1975 and palm cake exports from
45,000 ton in 1972 to 31,000 ton in 1975. In the past Government determined
fixed proportions of palm oil for sale on the local market and for export, but
since 1976 exports are authorized only on ad-hoc basis, depending on the needs
of the domestic market.
Prices
2.12      Export prices for Zairian palm oil closely follow world market
trends; they reached an average low of US$230 per ton in 1972 and an
average high of US$640 per ton in 1974. In 1977 the price increased from
about US$470 per ton in January to about US$600 per ton in June. All oil
is sold in the European Economic Community countries where it commands a
4% premium under the Lome convention. The current price of about US$600 per
ton cif Europe is equivalent to about US$525 or Z 455 per ton fob Matadi.
Kinshasa-Matadi transport and handling costs are about Z 20 per ton and export
duties and other taxes about Z 90 per ton; the export price ex-Kinshasa was
thus about Z 345 per ton in mid 1977.



- 7 -
2.13      Since 1967 Government has fixed producer prices and wholesale and
retail prices for palm oil sold on the domestic market. The official prices
were consistently far below the world market prices, even when these were at
the very low 1972 levels (Annex 1 para 21 and Table 13).  This policy, de-
signed to protect the consumer, was not effective because at the retail level
the oil was unofficially sold at prices far exceeding the official price.
At the producer level, however, and also at the wholesale level ex-Kinshasa,
the low official prices were enforced, which seriously discouraged producers
from making necessary new investments. In 1976 Government corrected the
situation by increasing the wholesale price ex-Kinshasa from Z 190 per ton
to Z 350 per ton. This price is now almost equal to the corresponding world
market price ex-Kinshasa, net of export duties and other taxes.
D. Agricultural Services
Department of Agriculture
2.14      The Department is responsible for formulating agricultural policy,
providing extension services and assisting the parastatal bodies under its
control, including the National Institute for Agricultural Studies and Research
(INERA). Its involvement with the industrial oil palm sector is restricted
to policy making.
Oil Palm Research
2.15      The once important Yangambi research station, near Kisangani, came
to a virtual standstill during the upheavals of the mid-1960s. Over the last
ten years several attempts have been made to revitalize the station, including
its oil palm research section. Chronic staff and other shortages have, how-
ever, seriously handicapped these efforts. The situation would have been
disastrous for the oil palm industry, had not PLZ in 1969, in cooperation with
the former Societe des cultures (now CELZA), established its own research sta-
tion on CELZA's Binga plantation in Equateur. The station has five expatriate
and three Zairian researchers and concentrates its research on agronomic trials
and on the selection of high yielding and disease resistant material. About
350 ha have so far been planted at Binga and the station, together with PLZ's
existing multiplication center at Yaligimba, now meets the foreseeable needs
of the oil palm sector, particularly for seeds. The seeds have consistently
been of good quality and an increasing proportion has proven resistance against
wilt disease. For the implementation of the Project, present arrangements
for the multiplication of high quality seeds are therefore adequate. Staff
and facilities of the Binga center would, however, be expanded under the
Project (Annex 5) to increase the station's capacity to train Zairian research
staff (para 4.12) and to supply good seeds to the sector as a whole.
SOFIDE
2.16      The Societe Financiere de Development (SOFIDE) was established in
early 1970 to support the development of enterprises in Zaire. The Bank



-8-
played an important role in SOFIDE's creation and has been its main source of
funds through four lines of credit totalling US$35 million. IFC and several
local and international institutions participate in SOFIDE's share capital
and/or have made loans to the company. One of the oil palm companies, CCP,
received a SOFIDE loan of Z 350,000 in 1973 and a second loan of Z 150,000 in
1977. An Agriculture Department within SOFIDE started operations in May 1976
with the assistance of a three man FAO team. By the end of 1976 the Depart-
ment had received more than 150 requests for loans of which 12, totalling
about Z 2 million, were under active consideration. It is expected that
SOFIDE's Agricultural Department will play an increasingly important role in
assisting agricultural enterprises (para 5.05).
III. THE PROJECT AREAS
Climate
3.01      The Project would be implemented by three companies:  PLZ, Busira
and CCP, on their estates in Zaire's northern Equateur and Haut Zaire Re-
gions. Soils in the equatorial Zaire river basin area are generally well
suited for the cultivation of tree crops and the climate is favorable for
oil palm. Annual rainfall averages 1,800 to 2,000 mm in most of the area
and is well spread over the year with a dry season of less than two months.
Temperatures average 24  to 25 C and fluctuate very little; minimum tempera-
tures are never lower than 19 0C.  The sun shines a high 2,000 hours per year
on average in the region. Growing conditions do not differ much throughout
the basin, although Busira's Bembelota plantation is more productive than
others.
Communications
3.02      All the plantations were established on the Zaire river or its
navigable tributaries, since transport in the areas depends almost entirely
on river transport (see Map 12834). All plantations are served by river
boats of the state-owned National Office of Transport (ONATRA). The quality
of ONATRA's services varies considerably. On the Zaire river itself and
on the lower parts of its principal tributaries ONATRA's performance meets
reasonable standards, but in the upstream sections of the tributaries services
suffer often from poor management and staff indiscipline. Transport of
supplies from Kinshasa to the plantations is often irregular and time con-
suming and the companies frequently complain about pilferage. In the frame-
work of a US$26 million IDA Credit (1975) the Bank discussed in 1976 the
deteriorating situation of ONATRA and agreed with Government on a rescue plan
embodying measures to reduce costs, increase revenues and tighten controls.
An agreement between Zaire and Belgium, in 1977, provided for the recruitment
of expatriate management and operational staff to improve the efficiency of
ONATRA's operations.



-9-
Population
3.03      The sub-regions of the Equate r and Haut Zaire Regions are sparsely
populated, with only 3-5 persons per km on average. The population density
in specific areas has, in the past, always been an important factor for
determining the location of new plantations. But for a variety of reasons
(see para 4.14) the recruiting of workers has become increasingly difficult
in recent years.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The Project would, over five years (1978-1982), support the rehabil-
itation of existing oil palm plantations through investments for replanting
and new plantings, the renewal of oil mill and transport equipment, the
improvement and expansion of social infrastructure, the employment of
additional staff and training of staff. The Project would specifically
include:
(i) planting of 12,215 ha, of which 9,585 ha would
be replanting and 2,630 ha new plantings;
(ii)  complete renewal of the equipment of one oil
mill and partial renewal of two mills
(PLZ only);
(iii) procurement of land clearing equipment (PLZ only),
trucks, tractors and staff vehicles;
(iv)  construction or repair of workers' and staff
houses, schools, health clinics and stores;
(v) procurement of fertilizers for existing young, but not
yet productive, plantations (Busira and CCP);
(vi)  employment of additional internationally and locally
recruited staff;
(vii) logistics support for a mechanics' school and one
year training courses for plantation staff (PLZ only);
(viii) feasibility studies and pilot programs for smallholder
and plantation employees' cultivation schemes; and
(ix)  technical assistance for the Department of Agriculture.



- 10 -
Parts (i)-(viii) of the Project would be implemented by the companies (PLZ,
Busira, and CCP) under the supervision of a Government coordinating committee,
assisted by SOFIDE (para 5.05). The Department of Agriculture would have
overall responsibility for the Project and will itself execute part (ix).
B. Detailed Features
New Plantings
4.02      The planting program of the three companies for the five year period
1978-82 is as follows (ha):
PLZ     Busira    CPP       Total
Replanting        9,320    -         265      9,585
New Planting        580    900   14150        2,630
Total          9,900    900    1,415    12,215
PLZ would plant 4,770 ha at its Lokutu plantation, 4,200 ha at Yaligimba and
930 ha at Boteka. Except for 580 ha new plantings in virgin soils at Boteka,
all plantings would be made on presently abandoned or old plantations.
Busira's 900 ha and CCP's 1,150 ha new plantings would be made in virgin
forest soils. Seeds for all new plantings would be procured from the Binga
research station and the Yaligimba multiplication center (para. 2.15). In
view of the importance of the regular supply of good seeds for the Project
progress of the operations as well as the annual work programs and budgets of
the joint PLZ-CELZA research and multiplication scheme would be reviewed by
the Project coordinating committee (para 5.04). If one of the parties were to
withdraw its support for the center, Government would, in consultation with
IDA, take appropriate measures to assure the uninterrupted supply of good
quality seeds to meet the demand of the oil palm sector (see also para 4.12).
The Project would also provide for the purchase of incremental fertilizers,
insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, tools and other necessary inputs for the
planting program.
Oil Mills
4.03      Two existing oil mills at PLZ's Lokutu plantation would be over-
hauled under the Project and a new steam boiler would be provided for PLZ's
Yaligimba mill. No investments in oil mills are needed in the foreseeable
future at PLZ's Boteka plantation or at any of the plantations of the two
small companies. At the Lokutu plantation PLZ presently operates three
old mills with a combined capacity of 80,000 ton fresh fruit bunches (ffb)
per year. In the long run PLZ would concentrate oil production at the Lokutu
and Lukumete mills because of their convenient location on the Zaire river.
The third mill, Mosite, is located about 30 km inland and would be phased out
after completion of a first phase renewal of equipment at the two other mills



- il -
(about 1982). The annual production of the Lokutu plantation is estimated to
increase from about 75,000 ton ffb in 1976 to about 90,000 ton ffb in 1982 and
about 160,000 ton ffb in 1990. The combined annual capacity of the Lukumete
and Lokutu mills would be about 120,000 ton ffb after completion of the first
phase works in 1982. Through further investments the capacity of the Lokutu
mill would be doubled by 1988 and that of Lukumete by 1990.
Machinery and Vehicles
4.04      The mechanization of land clearing for plantations, construction
sites and roads is necessary for the timely completion of the works at PLZ's
two largest plantations, Lokutu and Yaligimba. The Project would therefore
provide the necessary bulldozers, graders and front loaders. Elsewhere, the
smaller planting programs would use labor for land clearing but the Project
would provide one small grader to facilitate road construction and maintenance
at the CCP plantations. For all three companies the Project would provide
trucks, tractors and trailers to transport fruits, seedlings and inputs, and
vehicles and motorcycles for the plantation staff.
Construction
4.05      The Project would provide 1,400 new houses for plantation laborers
and 25 social facilities, including 7 schools, 8 dispensaries and 7 supply
stores, for the new plantations and in some cases also for existing productive
plantations. In a few localities, e.g. PLZ's Yaligimba plantation and the CCP
plantations, the Project would also rehabilitate 1700 existing workers houses
which were abandoned in the 1960's. The Project would also provide for the
construction of 60 staff houses, storage sheds and offices where needed.
An assurance would be given by the companies that they would adequately
staff and operate their social services, on both existing and new planta-
tions.
Fertilizers for Existing Young Plantations
4.06      Existing plantations have in recent years suffered because of poor
maintenance and lack of fertilizers, insecticides and herbicides. In parti-
cular the immature plantations of the small companies are in a poor condition
and normal development has often been hampered. The Project would therefore
provide fertilizers for the young plantations of the small companies until
those plantations come into production. PLZ's young plantations are generally
in better condition than those of the small companies. Therefore, and also
because PLZ is in a stronger financial position, no financing under the
Project is envisaged in its case.
Staff
4.07      The Project would provide funds for some additional local and
internationally recruited staff to complement existing staff during the
implementation of the planting program. This staff would be incremental and
for the duration of the Project. An assurance was given by the companies at
negotiations that they would retain the present numbers of qualified staff,



- 12 -
in addition to the staff to be provided for under the Project 1/, and that
they would train Zairian staff in accordance with the agreed program (para
4.09). Government has given an assurance that it would permit the inter-
nationally recruited staff to remit an adequate proportion of their salaries
to their respective home countries.
Training (Annex 10)
4.08      As a result of deliberate training efforts and in part arising
from the Zairianization, the companies have substantially reduced their
expatriate staff in recent years and now employ only one half of those
employed in 1973. Some success has been achieved in training plantation and
accounting staff. Efforts to train and retain local engineers and skilled
artisans have been less successful, while generally broader experience is
lacking among senior Zairian management staff.
4.09      The Project would extend past efforts, in part to improve the
performance of Zairians recently promoted and in part to develop an increasing
cadre of skilled personnel which can progressively take over the remaining
senior management and technical positions. To this end tile Project would
provide for three training programs over a 5 year period. The first would
provide formalized one-year practical training courses for about 40 plantation
sector and division chiefs. Housing and transport means would be provided.
Secondly the Project would expand an existing secondary school near PLZ's
Lokutu plantation for a two year course in mechanics for about 60 students
through the provision of a dormitory, a classroom, a teacher and equipment.
In both of the above cases, PLZ would be responsible for executing the pro-
grams and graduates would be available to all the companies. Thirdly the
Project would provide study trips for about 60 senior management staff,
accounting and technical staff to other palm oil producing countries. Candi-
dates would be selected by Government in consultation with the companies and
could include some of Government's own staff; the program of these studies
would be agreed upon beforehand with IDA.
Technical Assistance
4.10      In order to strengthen the Department of Agriculture's capacity
to respond more effectively to the demands of the oil palm sector (formulation
of policies, preparation and supervision of projects) the Project would
provide funds (US$500,000) which would be used for (i) recruitment of an
expert; and/or (ii) ad-hoc consultancies; and (iii) training of Government
staff, either by the expert mentioned under (i) and/or through study trips
abroad (para 4.09). The submission of detailed plans, acceptable to the
Association would be a condition of disbursement under this component.
1/   A total of 7 technical experts would be recruited internationally:
3 agronomists, 2 diesel specialists, 1 building specialist and 1 train-
ing specialist.



- 13 -
4.11      The Project would also provide funds (US$200,000) for the Depart-
ment of Agriculture to pay SOFIDE's costs in respect of the first 2 years of
the project (see para 5.05).
4.12      The Project would provide for two additional expr.-riate oil palm
researchers and for housing, transport, scientific instruments and other
facilities (including salaries) at the Binga station to train eight Zairian
researchers over the five year period of the Project. A condition of dis-
bursements against this component is an agreement signed by the Government,
PLZ and CELZA (joint owners of the Binga research station) which would
specifically cover the integration of the Government's oil palm research
program with those of PLZ and CELZA, at Binga as well as detailed arrange-
ments regarding the selection of and the training program for the eight
Zairian researchers.
Labor Needs and Rural Development
4.13      Arising out of the Project, two particular matters call for special
collaboration between the Government and the companies. First, is the com-
panies' need to retain existing and recruit additional plantation labor
to carry through their development programs; the second is the opportunity
which the companies' presence in Zaire provides to help promote a smallholder
development effort either within or adjacent to the plantation areas. These
matters are interrelated.
4.14      For some time the companies have experienced difficulties in re-
cruiting and retaining sufficient labor. There have been many reasons for
this: the erosion in real terms of labor wages, in part due to the severe
domestic inflation; the companies' decreased ability to pay more when domestic
oil palm prices were low; the deterioration of labor amenities and social
services partly as a result of the companies' uncertain ownership status.
Moreover, low population density in certain areas has compelled some of the
companies to recruit labor from up to 200 km distant. The labor force was
approximately halved from 1960 to 1970, but the fall off has been less signifi-
cant in the past six years. For example PLZ employed only 23,000 workers in
1970 compared with over 40,000 in 1960. The current work force numbers about
22,000. PLZ would need to recruit an additional 2,500 workers during the
Project period (about 10-15% of the present number).  The small companies
combined would need to recruit about 1,000 additional workers over the next
five years, or about 15 - 20% of their present number.
4.15      It is expected that a series of measures would improve the labor
supply situation. The restoration or provision of adequate housing and
social services should provide a significant inducement in Zaire's
rural areas where such services are generally lacking, but it is widely
acknowledged that a substantial increase in labor wage rates is justified
and necessary. The companies are anxious and in a position to increase
wages and are primarily concerned that this be consistent with Government's



- 14 -
policies. This is now under discussion between the Government and the com-
panies. During negotiations it was agreed that in the future the Project
coordinating committee (para 5.04) would annually review the adequacy of the
wages to attract sufficient labor and recommend changes when necessary; the
companies would implement such changes as are deemed necessary to maintain
this labor force at the required level provided that Government has satisfied
itself that the recommended changes are in accordance with its overall wage
policies; in the event that the committee fails to agree on the recommenda-
tions or that its recommendations are found to be not in accordance with
Government's overall wage policies, the Government would consult with the
Association. The Government would also agree to facilitate, through its local
administration, the companies' efforts to recruit sufficient numbers of
workers.
4.16      Another measure which could help attract and retain labor would
be a program to develop food crops and small livestock, etc. on labor family
small holdings either within or adjacent to the plantations. Such schemes
would n.eed to be planned with care to ensure that they would reinforce the
availability of labor to the plantations in addition to increasing agricultural
production and raising living standards. The companies' support would be
provided in a manner which supplements rather than dilutes the considerable
efforts required in the early years to carry through the plantation development
program.
4.17      In a closely related respect, the companies are well placed to
offer Zaire considerable assistance in drawing up a program of smallholder
crops, using their experience in Zaire and elsewhere. The companies would
be called upon to provide assistance to the Government by identifying and
preparing smallholders schemes for oil palms and other crops, including the
operation of pilot projects where appropriate. The full scale development of
such schemes would depend on the outcome of feasibility studies and pilot
programs, the results of which cannot be predicted at this stage, and would be
the subject of separate financing at a later stage.
4.18      The Project thus provides US$2.5 million for feasibility studies
and pilot schemes for the two activities detailed above, notionally US$0.5
million for studies (five man-years of consultancy services) and US$2.0 mil-
lion for field trials and pilot schemes.  Such funds would be made available
to Government and, as may be agreed, would in fact reimburse the cost of
services provided by the companies. The submission of detailed proposals,
acceptable to IDA, is a condition of disbursements against expenditures under
this component.
Operation and Maintenance of Existing Oil Palm Plantations
4.19      The shortage of foreign exchange in recent years has seriously
hampered the procurement of essential supplies (fertilizers, vehicles, spare
parts, consumer goods for the workers, etc.) for the normal operation and
maintenance of existing plantations and oil mills. Government has therefore
given an assurance that, during the investment period, all participating



- 15 -
companies would be permitted to retain an adequate proportion of their
foreign exchange receipts ta cover the foreign exchange needs for the effi-
cient operation of their existing oil palm plantations and installations,
including company supply stores and other social services. The annual
amounts reeded by each company are estimated as follows (1977 constant
prices): PLZ US$3.0 million; Busira and CCP US$0.6 million each. Of these
amounts about 30% would be for the purchase of fertilizers and chemicals,
25% for oil mill equipment and transport needs, 32% for expatriate staff
and 13% for the operation of the social services.
Enviromental Effects
4.20      The Project would not affect the environment to any significant
extent, as the rehabilitation and upgrading of PLZ's oil mills at Lokutu and
Yaligimba will still leave PLZ oil output below the 1960 level. The mills
are equipped with oil traps, which recover most of the solids for recyling.
Moreover, the Zaire river, at the point where untrapped effluents are dis-
charged is broad and fast flowing, so that the comparatively tiny amount of
effluent from the oil mills hardly affects oxygenisation.
C. Cost Estimates (Annex 6)
4.21      Total Project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at Z 41.1
million (US$47.4 million), and the foreign exchange component is estimated
at 48%. Detailed cost estimates are as follows:

4.22       Costs have been estimated at mid 1977 prices and include capital
costs only.  A physical contingency of 10% has been allowed on all Project
costs except for the technical assistance and smallholders' components.
Price contingencies have been calculated at the following rates (percentages):
1978       1979      1980-82
Foreign Exchange Expenditures,              7.5         7.5        7.0
Local Expenditures                         30.0        15.0       10.0
The high contingencies for local expenditures in 1978 and 1979 are necessary
to allow for the inflation rate in Zaire which is higher than elsewhere
in the world. The cost estimates are net of import duties on imported
equipment and vehicles. An assurance was given by Government that Zaire's
Investment Code, which provides for the exemption of import duties on
new investments, would be fully applied to all investments made under



- 17 -
the Project. Other taxes and duties, e.g. taxes on salaries of expatriate
personnel, import duties and sales taxes on fuels and spare parts, etc.
are included in the Project cost. The amount of other taxes and duties
is estimated at Z 1.5 million (US$1.7 million), excluding contingencies.
D. Financing
4.23       The financing of the Project's cost would be shared in the follo'ing
amounts and proportions.

The Government is expected to receive about US$1.7 million of taxes and duties
on Project investments (para 4.22) and to contribute US$2.7 million towards
the Project's financing, US$0.7 million of which would come from a US commodity
import loan of US$16.6 million.
4.24       External and domestic financing for the parts of the Project to be
implemented by each company would be as follows:

- 18 -
Details on the financial projections of the companies are given in Annex 7,
Tables 1-3. All companies would make additional, non-project, investments
for routine replacements for oil palms and other crops.
4.25      The IDA Credit and the loans to be made by the co-financing agen-
cies would finance the Project's foreign exchange expenditures (48% of Proj-
ect costs) and about 14% of local costs. The IDA Credit would be made to
the Governnent on standard terms and the funds, except for the technical
assistance and smallholder components, would be on-lent by Government to the
companies. A repayment period of 15 years, including a grace period of five
years, and an interest rate of 10% are recommended for IDA funds to be on-
lent by Government. The on-lending terms for CCCE and ADF funds would be
the same as for IDA funds. CCCE would channel its funds through SOFIDE
at an interest rate of 7%, which would leave SOFIDE with a margin of 3%.
ADF would lend to Government at terms identical to IDA's standard terms and
BADEA would also lend on similar terms. The oil palm companies would take
the foreign exchange risk on direct foreign exchange expenditures (off-shore
costs) to be financed with IDA, CCCE, BADEA and ADF funds while Government
would take this risk on local currency expenditures. ADF funds would be
used to finance on a parallel basis PLZ's expenditures for fertilizers and
chemicals, equipment, vehicles, buildings and training. IDA and CCCE would
jointly, on a 65/35 basis, finance PLZ's expenditures for oil mills and for
expatriate staff and all eligible expenditures of Busira, and CCP. BADEA
would also finance a portion of PLZ's oil mills. Part of a US commodity
loan would finance earthmoving equipment for PLZ.  Its terms to Government
are 50 years at 3%, with the first 10 years at 2%.
E. Procurement
4.26      For the parts of the Project to be financed jointly by IDA and
CCCE or by IDA alone the following procurement arrangements would apply:
(a) Vehicles, trucks, tractors, tools, fertilizers, and
pesticides, valued at about US$1.2 million, in orders
exceeding US$50,000 would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank guidelines; orders would be bulked whenever
possible. Local procurement procedures, acceptable to
the Association, would be followed for orders under
US$50,000 (Busira, CCP);
(b) The oil mill equipment, valued at about US$5.7 million,
would be procured through ICB;
(c) Construction of houses and social buildings, valued at
US$1.6 million (Busira, CCP), would be undertaken on force
account by the oil palm companies themselves; and



- 19 -
(d) Expatriate staff (35 man-years), with a foreign exchange
cost of US$1.1 million (PLZ, CCP), would be recruited
directly by the companies themselves.
The remaining items to be financed by IDA and CCCE would be for plantation
costs. None of these items would be suitable for any form of competitive
bidding and would therefore be procured by the companies themselves. Tech-
nical assistance, research training and the smallholders studies and pilot
programs, valued at US$2.2 million, are not expected to involve any procure-
ment suitable for ICB; all goods and services for these components would
therefore be procured by Government in accordance with its normal procedures,
satisfactory to the Association.
F. Disbursement
4.27       IDA and CCCE would disburse pari-passu in the ratio 65/35 against
Project expenditures to be incurred by the oil palm companies. IDA's part
would be as under:
(a)  PLZ: (i)  65% of foreign cost of oil mill equipment,
including civil works and engineering cost
(US$3.5 million);
(ii) 65% of the foreign exchange cost of expert
staff (US$0.6 million);
(b) Busira and CCP:
(i) 65% of foreign cost of fertilizers, chemicals,
and transport equipment (US$0.3 million);
(ii) 65% of the foreign exchange cost of expert
staff (US$0.1 million);
(iii) Z 390 (US$450) for each ha planted under the
Project (US$1.0 million);
(iv)  Z 1,300 (US$1,500) for each new worker or
staff house, school, clinic, store, workshop
and office to be built under the Project
(US$0.5 million); and
(v) Z 650 (US$750) for each worker's house re-
habilitated under the Project (US$0.5 mil-
lion).
In addition, IDA would disburse 60% of total costs against expenditures to
be incurred under research training (US$900,000), 50% of the SOFIDE fees



- 20 -
(US$100,000) and 40% of the smallholder studies and pilot program (US$1.0
million). Project costs and the number of buildings to be constructed or
rehabilitated by the small companies are detailed in Annex 6; the areas
to be planted by the companies are given in paragraph 4.02. Disbursement
against foreign exchange expenditures would be fully documented. Disburse-
ment against plantings and constructions would be made on presentation of
evidence, certified by SOFIDE, that the particular stage of the works are
completed. Reimbursement claims would be countersigned by SOFIDE. Any
funds remaining in the Credit account at the end of the Project would be
reallocated at the discretion of the Association. The estimated schedule of
disbursement of the IDA credit is at Annex 11.
G. Accounts and Audits
4.28       The companies will keep separate accounts, reflecting the cost of
their parts of the Project; Government would keep separate accounts for the
technical assistance and smallholder cultivation components. These accounts,
as well as the full accounts of the companies, would be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association and would be submitted to IDA within
six months of the end of each fiscal year.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Companies
5.01      All three companies have head offices in Kinshasa and local manage-
ment units on the plantations. PLZ's central administration at Kinshasa is
well structured and includes a number of specialized departments such as
plantations, finance and accounting, personnel, technical and marketing. The
Kinshasa offices of the two other companies have simpler organizational
structures and have fewer staff in accordance with their size. Busira's
central administration, including its accounts, were merged with those
of Heavea Cequa between 1974 and 1976, when both companies were part of
"Entreprises industrielles, agricoles et commerciales" (ENTRIAC). After the
1976 retrocession measures the administrations of the two companies were,
once again, separated.
5.02      Management units vary by plantation depending mainly on size.
Typical large plantations, like PLZ's Yaligimba and Lokutu, have a director
responsible for five departments - technical, plantations, accounting, person-
nel, and medical - each headed by a specialist department head. An agronomist
heads the plantation department, assisted by sector chiefs (for each 4,000-
6,000 ha), division chiefs (1,500-2,000 ha), section chiefs (400-800 ha) and
block chiefs (100-200 ha). On smaller plantations, such as PLZ's Boteka and
the plantations of the other companies, management units are smaller and the



- 21 -
auwber of separate departments may be fewer. CCP has one local management
unit at Lisafa for two oil palm plantations on the Maringa river.
5.03      Although all the companies have in recent years reduced their
expatriate staff (by 50% or more since 1973) and have had difficulties in
filling the vacancies with qualified Zairian staff, the ei:sting management
is still adequate, particularly that of PLZ. The wide experience and high
degree of technical competence and dedication among the higher level staff
of the companies, whether expatriates or Zairian nationals, is one of the
strongest assets of the companies and, because of this, there should be
few major organizational and management problems. The companies have given
assurances that they would carry out the planting program set out in the
Project.
Coordination and Supervision
5.04      A committee of Government and company representatives has been
created to discuss and coordinate Project-related matters. This coordinating
committee, which is to meet at least four times per year, will be chaired by
the Director-General of Agriculture and will have as its permanent members
senior representatives of the Departments of Finance, Portfolio, Planning,
Central Bank, Office of Public Debt Management, Rural Development, Transport,
and National Economy, the managing directors of the three companies, and
SOFIDE (paragraph 5.05). Government officials responsible for labor rela-
tions, health and other social affairs and local administration would be
invited to the committee's meetings on an ad-hoc basis as required. The
Chairman will appoint an official of the Department of Agriculture to act
as the committee's secretary and to maintain relations with the companies
on a day-to-day basis. The committee's tasks would specifically include
reviews of (i) the Project's progress and problems; (ii) annual work pro-
grams and investment budgets of the companies and Binga research station;
and (iii) the adequacy of wages to attract sufficient labor and of palm oil
prices on the domestic market, making recommendations on changes when neces-
sary.
5.05      SOFIDE would be responsible for the administration of part of the
external lending to the companies, namely: as the intermediary for the CCCE
loan and as an agent of the Government for the IDA credit in respect of the
two small companies. As explained in para 2.16, SOFIDE has become increas-
ingly involved in the financing of Zaire's agricultural development, partic-
ularly since its Agricultural Department was established in 1976. SOFIDE's
tasks would include the following:
(a) inspection of the physical execution of the Project
through field visits of the companies' plantations,
at least twice a year;
(b) verification of all tender documents, disbursement
claims and the annual costs of Project components
implemented by the companies;
(c) assistance to the companies on procurement and dis-
bursement matters; and



- 22 -
(d) participation in meetings of the coordinating com-
mittee (para 5.04).
SOFIDE would report to the Director General of the Department of Agriculture
in his capacity of chairman of the coordinating committee. SOFIDE would
designate a senior member of its staff to maintain day-to-day contacts with
the companies. As an intermediary of CCCE funds SOFIDE would be entitled to a
margin to cover its expenditures and risks. For its services in administering
the on-lent funds SOFIDE would receive an annual fee from Government to cover
its costs plus a small margin. IDA.and CCCE are each providing US$100,000 to
the Department of Agriculture to cover SOFIDE's fees in this respect until the
interest differential on the CCCE loan is adequate to cover its costs. An
agreement between Government and SOFIDE, acceptable to IDA, with regard to the
administration of the on-lent IDA funds, will be signed before the IDA Credit
becomes effective. A draft of this document was agreed upon at negotiations.
Evaluation and Monitoring
5.06      The Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for monitoring
and evaluating the Project's progress during its implementation in accordance
with agreed standards and would write a completion report at the end of the
Project.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES, AND CASH FLOWS
Yields and Production (Annex 1)
6.01      The new plantations are expected to start producing in the fourth
year after planting and remain in production for about 25 years. The yields
in fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per ha of PLZ's and Busira's plantations are
expected to increase from 7 ton in year 4 to 15 ton in year 9. From year
13 onwards yields are expected to decline slightly; for the final 5 years the
yields are estimated at 12 ton per ha. For CCP's plantations, which have a
somewhat lower yield potential, peak yields of 13 ton per ha are expected.
The ail extraction rate is estimated at 20% of ffb and the weight of the
kernels at 5% of ffb. These estimates in line with those experienced with
equivalent planting material under similar conditions in West Africa.
6.02      At full maturity in 1995 the plantings made under the Project would
produce annually about 33,000 ton palm oil and 8,000 ton kernels. In that
year the Project's output is expected to represent about 18% of Zaire's total
palm oil production (186,000 ton).
Markets and Prices
6.03      The Project is expected to produce palm oil primarily for the
domestic market. International prices of palm oil in constant 1977 terms are



- 23 -
expected to decrease to about US$405 per ton, cif Europe, in 1978 and there-
after to increase slightly to US$425 per ton by 1985. Prices for palm oil to
be sold on the domestic market would continue to be regulated by the Govern-
ment. In the first half of 1977 the price of oil sold on the domestic market
(Z 350 p_r ton, ex-Kinshasa) corresponded closely to the equivalent world
market price, net of export duties and other taxes. This price provided an
adequate incentive for the companies to continue production. In the future
the price would be reviewed from time to time and, when necessary, changed in
consultation with IDA to reflect changes in major cost elements and changes in
the world market price of palm oil.
6.04      Palm kernels would continue to be sold locally and crushed in
existing palm kernel mills; all kernel oil and kernel cake would be exported
as at present.
Companies' Cash Flows (Annex 7)
6.05      Tables 1-3 of Annex 7 show the companies' margins, expenditure, net
income and cash flow projections for the years 1977-1987. The tables also
show the amounts available for distribution to shareholders. PLZ, Busira
and CCP would be able to service their debts in full and pay increasing
dividends from 1983.
Government Cash Flow (Annex 9)
6.06      Government's net cash flow resulting from the Project over the
50 years of the IDA Credit would be positive until the year 2002 and reach
a maximum of about US$4.1 million in 1987. From the year 2003 onwards the
net cash flow would be negative since the Project investments would have
ended their productive life cycle and Government would continue to make
repayments to IDA, ADB and USAID until the year 2027. The cumulative net
cash flow over the entire period would be about US$40 million.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION (Annex 8)
7.01      The direct benefits from the Project would be the incremental
production of about 33,000 ton of palm oil and about 8,000 ton of palm
kernels per year, with a value of about US$18 million (1977 prices), at full
maturity in 1995. Project induced palm oil production would substitute for
imports which would otherwise be required by the time the Project reaches
full production.
7.02      The calculations of the financial and economic internal rates of
return are detailed in Annex 8. Import parity prices for palm oil were
used in the economic analysis. The official price of oil, ex-Kinshasa,
which is adequate at present (para 6.03), has been used in the financial
analysis. The rate of inflation in Zaire is expected to be higher than
worldwide inflation, particularly in 1977/78 (para 4.22). Therefore local



- 24 -
cost elements have been adjusted upwards in the financial atid economic eval-
uation as the different rates of inflation will result in additional real
local costs. A similar adjustment has been made in the financial analysis
for palm oil sales on the domestic market.
7.03      The internal financial rate of return (IFR) for PLZ's part of the
Project is estimated at 18%, for Busira's part at 21%, and for CCP's part at
16%.
7.04      The internal economic rate of return (IER) for the whole Project
is estimated at 16%. For the individual companies' parts of the Project
the IER varies between 18% for Busira and 14% for CCP. Foreign exchange
has been shadow-priced at 127% of the official exchange rate to reflect
its economic value.
7.05      The main risk facing the Project is a shortage of plantation
workers. If such a shortage occurred the planting program would be slowed
down and normal maintenance of existing plantations could be impaired as
has happened in recent years. The improvement of social services on the
plantations and payment of adequate wages to the laborers are essential to
reduce this risk (para 4.15). The companies should meet these conditions
provided that the price of oil sold is adequate; a regular review and, if
necessary, adjustment of this price is necessary (para 6.03).
7.06      Another risk is the uncertain river transport situation.  The
Project would be seriously affected if ONATRA's services were to deteriorate
further because the companies depend entirely on river transport for the
delivery of essential supplies and for the shipment of their products. More-
over, the recent measures to strengthen ONATRA's management and operational
staff are expected to reduce the transport risk for the Project (para 3.02).
7.07      Delays in the companies' planting programs because of labor short-
ages would probably affect the relationship between direct Project costs and
direct Project benefits since total costs and revenues would not be delayed by
equal time periods. But the production costs, including the companies' fixed
overhead costs, per ton of palm oil would almost certainly increase (and the
net benefits decrease) in such a situation. Similarly, the companies' costs
would increase if ONATRA's river transport services were to deteriorate since
this could result in late deliveries of essential supplies or the need to rely
on bank overdrafts or other forms of short-term financing if products cannot
be shipped on time. If for one of these (or any other) reasons the costs were
to increase by 10% both the IFR and the IER of the Project investments would
decrease by about two percentage points. If simultaneously the Project's
benefits would decrease by 10% the IFR and IER would decrease by a further
two percentage points.
7.08      The Project would revitalize Zaire's oil palm sector.  Through the
Project, some 3,000 plantation workers and about 20 local staff would be
offered permanent employment. Besides net earning (about US$200 per year
for a full-time laborer) all employees would also benefit from improved
housing and social services to be provided under the Project.



- 25 -
7.09      The net income of the companies is estimated to be about 20% of
gross revenues from the sales of palm oil and kernels. Of this 52% would
be paid to the Government as company taxes; the maximum taxes on income from
Project investments would be about US$1.3 million per year from 1987-97.
The remaining 48% (US$1.2 million per year from 1987-97) wou'ld represent
the companies' net profits which would partly be retained in the companies
and partly distributed to the shareholders.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Zairian Govern-
ment's representatives on the following matters:
(a) progress of the operations as well as the annual work
programs and budgets of the joint PLZ-CELZA research
and seed multiplication scheme would be reviewed by the
Project coordinating committee (see (h) below); if one of
the parties were to withdraw its support for the center,
Government would take appropriate measures to assure the
uninterrupted supply of good quality seeds to meet the
demand of the palm oil sector (para 4.02);
(b) the Government agreed that the companies, if they so require,
retain the present qualified staff; as replacements are
required for these the companies would have the right to
hire qualified replacements through a process of inter-
national search (see Annexes 2-5) during the investment
period and five years thereafter - in addition to the staff
to be provided for under the Project -; the Government would
permit the internationally recruited additional staff to
remit to their respective home countries the proportion
generally allowed at December 1, 1977 (50%) in addition
to any overall ceiling per company (para 4.07);
(c) the Project coordinating committee would annually review
the adequacy of the wages for plantation workers and
recommend changes when necessary; the companies would
implement such changes as are deemed necessary to main-
tain their labor force at the required level provided
that Government has satisfied itself that the recommended
changes are in accordance with its overall wage policies;
in the event that the committee fails to agree on the
recommendations or that its recommendations are not in
accordance with Government's overall wage policies,
the Government would consult with IDA (para 4.15);
(d) the Government, through its local administrators in
the areas where the Project plantations are located,
would facilitate the companies' efforts to recruit suf-
ficient numbers of plantation workers (para 4.15);



- 26 -
(e) all participating companies would be permitted to buy suf-
ficient foreign exchange to cover the foreign exchange
needs for the efficient operation of their existing oil
palm plantations and installations (including company
supply stores and other social services); estimates of
the amounts of foreign exchange required by each company
are specified in paragraph 4.19 and those amounts would be
adjusted annually to take account of changes in the foreign
exchange cost elements, including inflation;
(f) Zaire's Investment Code would be applied in respect of
all investments to be made under the Project (para 4.23);
the code is being reviewed, but as a minimum imported goods
for the Project will be exonerated from import duties.
(g) the Government would bear the foreign exchange risk on all
project expenditures in local currency to be financed by
IDA and the oil palm companies would bear this risk on the
direct foreign exchange expenditures (off-shore costs;
(para 4.25);
(h) a committee of Government and company representatives would
be created before May 15, 1978, and would meet at least
four times per year to discuss and coordinate Project related
matters; the Director General of the Department of Agriculture
would act as the committee's chairman and Government would
appoint an official of the Department to act as the commit-
tee's secretary and to maintain relations with the companies
on a day-to-day basis (para 5.04);
(i)  the Government would appoint SOFIDE as its agent to administer
the loans Government would make to the companies with IDA
funds; SOFIDE would designate a senior member of its staff
to maintain contacts with the companies (para 5.05); and
(j) internal prices of palm oil would be reviewed from time
to time and, when necessary, changed in consultation with
IDA to reflect major cost elements and changes in world
market prices (para 6.03).
8.02      It was also agreed that the companies would give the following
assurances, to be incorporated in subsidiary loan agreements whose signature
is a condition of effectiveness (para 8.04 (a)):
(a) the companies would carry out the planting programs set
out in the Project (para 5.03);
(b) the companies would adequately staff and operate their
social services in a manner satisfactory to IDA, includ-
ing basic health and primary education facilities and



- 27 -
supply stores, on both existing and new plantations to
help attract and retain sufficient numbers of plantation
workers (para 4.05);
(c)  the companies would maintain the present number of
qualified staff (Annexes 2-5), in addition to the staff
to be provided for under the Project, and would train
Zairian staff (para 4.07);
(d) the companies would assist the Government in identifying
and preparing smallholder schemes for oil palms and other
crops and in operating pilot projects for smallholder
cultivation (para 4.17);
(e) the companies would implement changes in the wages
of plantation workers, as recommended by the Project
coordinating committee insofar as the recommended
changes are in accordance with its overall wage pol-
icies (para 4.15);
(f) the companies would bear the foreign exchange risk
an all direct foreign exchange expenditures (off-
shore costs) onlent to them out of the IDA Credit
(para 4.25); and
(g) accounts would be kept and audits would be made as
indicated in para 4.28.
8.03      The following conditions would be fulfilled before the IDA Credit
becomes effective:
(a) onlending agreements for the IDA Credit between
Government and all three companies would have been
signed (para 8.02);
(b) loan agreements between Government and the ADF and
BADEA respectively, and between SOFIDE and the Caisse
Centrale for parts of the Project to be financed by
those institutions would have become effective (para
4.25); and
(c) the Government will have created the Project coordi-
nating committee (para 5.04);
(d) an agreement between Government and SOFIDE with
regard to the administration of the on-lent IDA
funds would have been signed (para 5.05).



- 28 -
8.04      A condition of disbursement on account of expenditures for activi-
ties under the technical assistance, training of researchers and smallholders
components would be the agreement on detailed proposals acceptable to IDA
(paras 4.12 and 4.18).
8.05      Subject to the above assurances the Project would be suitable for
an IDA Credit of US$9.0 million to the Government of Zaire.

ZAIRE
OIL PALM PROJECT
Production, Marketing and Prices of Palm Oil
A. Prospects for the World Palm Oil Market
Production
1.        World production of palm oil was around 2.9 million metric ton
in 1975 and is expected to reach 4.6 million ton in 1980 and 5.9 million ton
in 1985. World output of palm oil grew at 3.1% p.a. during the sixties, at
over 11% p.a. during the first half of the seventies, and is expected to
continue to grow at 9.5% p.a. until the end of the seventies. Thereafter,
palm oil production is likely to expand at a slower rate of around 5.1% p.a.
until the mid-eighties. Palm oil production grew both in absolute and
relative terms to other fats and oils (Table 1). The sharp increase in the
palm oil production in the seventies is the result of plantings of the
sixties in Malaysia and Indonesia which became the world's largest suppliers
of palm oil. During the late fifties, in contrast, about two thirds of the
world's palm oil production came from Africa, mainly from Nigeria and Zaire,
which then supplied more than half of the world's palm oil. Although still
major producers, the combined share of Nigeria and Zaire in the output of
palm oil dropped by 1974 to about 30%, slightly less than the share of
Malaysia alone (Table 2). Although Malaysia is likely to remain the world's
leading producer of palm oil, the decline in Africa's palm oil production
is likely to slow down and probably be reversed, as rising per capita demand
for fats and oils has led to large investments in oil palm in several West
African countries.
Exports
2.        World exports of palm oil followed roughly the expansion pattern of
palm oil production. They grew at an average rate of 2.8% p.a. during the
sixties, slightly below the 3.1% growth rate estimated for palm oil produc-
tion. Towards the end of the sixties, exports began to pick up, reaching
an average annual growth rate of 18.5% between 1970 and 1975. Malaysia,
Indonesia and the Ivory Coast accounted for most of the rapid expansion
of palm oil exports (Table 3). Exports from other African countries have
been dropping since 1955. The drop has been particularly evident in the
case of Nigeria and Zaire. This decline in exports reflects both a short-
fall in production and increasing domestic consumption. Increasing con-
sumption of palm oil in producing countries, mainly in Indonesia and West
African countries, is expected to slow down the expansion of palm oil
exports. World exports of palm oil are projected to grow at an average
rate of 11% p.a. until 1980 (the same rate of growth as output of palm oil)
and at a rate of 9% p.a. (slightly below the rate of growth of production)
between 1980 and 1985. The above factors are likely to result in the share



ANNEX 1
Page 2
of palm oil in world trade of fats and oils increasing from 6% during 1967-69
to a proportion progressively approaching that of soybean, i.e., 17.5% by
1980 and 23% by 1985 (Table 4).
Consumption
3.        Developed countries are, at present, the main market for exports
of palm oil. Per capita consumption in these countries is gradually
approaching a saturation level and no large increase in overall demand is
likely to occur unless new products and end uses are developed. Between 1960
and 1975, about 90% of palm oil exports went to developed countries. Germany,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdon accounted for almost 60% of world palm
oil imports. The shares of these three countries declined slightly during the
past two decades, while that of the U.S. has tripled over the last ten years.
The growing demand for palm oil in the U.S. is largely a result of the
increase in the use of vegetable oils in consumer products at the expense of
animal fats, as the latter's price rose relative to prices of vegetable
oils, in general, and to that of palm oil, in particular.
4.        In the developing world, India, Iraq and Pakistan have been the
major importers of palm oil. Producing countries have consumed half of the
palm oil output between 1960 and 1975. The demand in these countries is
expected to increase substantially in the future, given the responsiveness
of the demand for oils and fats to increases in income within the low income
bracket, where a high proportion of the people in less developed countries
fall.
Prices
5.        Unlike other hard oils, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil,
which have a large distinct market because of their lauric acid content,
palm oil has no physical or chemical properties which give it a qualitative
advantage over other fats and oils in current end-uses. Because of this lack
of specific demand, the price of palm oil depends on the overall situation
for all fats and oils. Palm oil prices in the world market are most highly
correlated with those of other low-priced fats and oils -- fish oil, tallow
and lard -- and the medium-priced oils, mainly soybean oil and sunflower
oil, which are widely used in the manufacture of margarines and shortening.
Palm oil's only effective competitor in the manufacture of "inedible" oil
based products is tallow which is traditionally cheaper than palm oil.
Tallow has a competitive advantage in three major markets: the soap indus-
try, the chemical industry and the animal feed industry (Table 5).
6.        The level of palm oil prices relative to those of other fats and
oils depends on the share of palm oil in total fats and oils exports. As this
share is expected to increase, palm oil relative prices are projected to
follow a declining trend. This is aggravated by the fact that the market for
soft oils (mainly soybean oil) can be expanded faster than the market for hard
oils (palm oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil) as, although it is physically
possible to substitute hard oils for soft oils, the costs of dehydrogenation
are high and presently not economic, while the hydrogenation of soft oils is
economic. Consequently, the growing output of hard oils (particularly palm



ANNEX 1
Page 3
oil) can be marketed only at lower prices relative to those of soft oils
(particularly soybean oil). A price differential of about 20% is expected
by 1985 between palm oil and its main competitor, soybean oil. In constant
1974 US$, the price of soybean oil is expected to be $346 per ton in 1980
and $395 4n 1985 (cif European ports). The corresponding prices of palm
oil are expected to be $310 per ton in 1980 and $320 in 1985.
B. Prospects for Palm Oil in Zaire
Introduction
7.        Palm oil is the major edible oil in Zaire, with regard both to con-
sumption and production. On the consumption side, palm oil represents around
85% of oil and fats consumed in the country. The remaining 15% represents a
number of other oils and fats of which groundnut oil is the predominant
product. Palm oil is expected to continue to keep its relative importance in
the market for oils and fats in Zaire because of the comparative advantage
which the production of palm oil has over other fats and oils in this country
and because of the established preference for palm oil in the consumption
pattern of Zairians.
8.        Commercial production of palm oil in Zaire decreased from 213,000
ton in 1970 to 169,000 ton in 1976. At the same time, the quantity absorbed
by the local market increased from 80,000 to 98,000 ton, while the quantity
destined to outside markets declined from 133,000 ton to slightly over
70,000 ton. The rise in the local market's absorptive capacity is expected
not only to continue, but even to accelerate due to the expected population
growth and higher anticipated incomes. The Project is expected to slow down
and, in the long run, to reverse the decline in the production of palm oil
in Zaire. However, because the requirements of the local market are increas-
ing at a faster rate, exports are expected to continue to decline and even-
tually to cease altogether.
Supply
9.        Zaire was a leading producer and exporter of palm oil in the fifties
and early sixties. This role has been progressively relinquished as other
countries stepped up their production programs while Zaire's production
capacity deteriorated. Zaire has two main palm oil producing areas:
(a) the northern region, mainly the Cuvette Centrale in the Haut
Zaire and Equateur Regions, where production is mainly in the
form of industrial plantations, presently covering around
55,000 ha;
(b) the southern region, consisting of the Mayumbe in Bas Zaire Region
and the Bandundu Region, where production centers around natural
palms (around 200,000 ha in the Mayumbe and around 400,000 ha in
Bandundu). In addition, Bandundu still has about 20,000 ha
of old industrial plantations.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
10.       The decline in palm oil output has taken place simultaneously
in the northern and in the southern regions. The decline was due mainly
to an unfavorable price policy and to the political uncertainties that
brought investment to a virtual standstill on the plantations in both regions
and also caused a serious interruption in the maintenance of natural palm
groves and of the infrastructure associated with them in the southern region.
11.       Without the Project, palm oil production in Zaire would continue
to decline at an even faster rate than it has in the past, since the present
producers could at best be expected to continue exploiting the remainder of
their productive capital and gradually withdraw from the oil palm sector. It
is impossible in the event to predict how low the output might be, since one
cannot predict the level of technology (hence the yield) that palm oil. pro-
ducers would be using under such circumstances. Under the most favorable
conditions, however, it is estimated that palm oil production from existing
plantations and natural palms would continue to decline reaching 167,000 ton
by 1980, around 154,000 ton by 1985, and up again to around 160,000 ton by
1990. The decline from the present production level would be, to a major
extent, due to the expected decline in production in the southern area, where
the present output of around 100,000 ton is expected to go down to 88,000 ton
by 1980, 75,000 ton by 1985 and 69,000 ton by 1990. Output from existing
plantations in the northern region is expected to remain at around 80,000 ton
until 1985, and then go up to over 90,000 ton by 1990 (Tables 6 and 7).
12.       The proposed Project is expected to start contributing to the oil
output by 1982. This contribution, estimated at about 1,900 ton of palm oil
in 1982, would progressively grow to about 17,000 ton by 1990, would reach
a maximum of about 36,000 ton by 1992, and would continue at a rate of about
30,000 ton of palm oil p.a. until the year 2,000 (Tables 8 and 9). The
Project would, therefore, result in the reversal of the present declining
trend in production, and by 1985 Zaire's oil production would once more
almost reach its 1975 level of 175,000 ton and by 1990 it would not quite
have reached its 1970 level of 200,000 ton.
13.       Detailed descriptions on each of the companies that would par-
ticipate in the Project (PLZ, Buzira and CCP) are given in Annexes 2-4.
In addition they are a number of other major palm oil companies in Zaire.
They are "Cultures et elevage au Zaire" (CELZA), "Commission agricole pour
l'Equateur" (CAE), and "Societe de Cultures au Mayumbe" (SCAM). CELZA is
the second largest palm oil producer after PLZ. Its oil is produced on two
plantations, Binga and Bosondjo in Equateur, formerly owned by "Societe des
cultures", which was taken over by CELZA, along with about 20 other companies,
the assets of CELZA have not been returned to their former owners. The
company experienced a sharp decline in the production of palm oil from
28,000 ton in 1974 to 21,000 ton in 1976 and there are indications that
management is deteriorating. CAE is a parastatal organization created for
the establishment of Zaire's only new plantation since 1960. With financial
assistance from the Eurepean Development Fund, an industrial block of 2,000 ha
was planted between 1972 and 1976 at Dongo in Equateur. An outgrowers scheme
planned at the same location failed, as only 400 ha of the projected 1,500 ha



ANNEX 1
Page 5
were planted. Moreover, the 400 ha were not planted by smallholders in 4 ha
lots, as envisaged, but in much larger blocs by a few traders. Apparently
only small number of farmers live in the area, and the project did not
provide adequate incentives to encourage them to take up the cultivation
of oil palms. SCAM has three oil mills in the natural palm area of Mayumbe,
but has no industrial plantations. There also exist an unknown number of
small oil palm companies in various parts of the country; no details are
available but their production is believed to represent an insignificant part
of Zaire's total production.
Demand
14.       Zairians use palm oil within the household for cooking, and in-
dustrially, mainly for soap manufacturing. In addition, palm fruit is used as
a basic ingredient in certain national dishes. As consumption of oils in the
low income bracket is largely responsive to increases in income, consumption
of palm oil in Zaire would be expected to increase substantially as a result
of a rising per capita income and an expanding population.  The present
analysis is based on the assumption that population would grow at the rate of
2.6% p.a. until 1985, at 2.5% p.a. between 1985 and 1990, and at 2.4% there-
after. Per capita GNP is assumed to grow in real terms at a rate of 2% p.a.
between 1977 and 1985 and at 3% p.a. thereafter. The income elasticity of
demand for fats and oils in Zaire is presently estimated at 0.88 and is
expected to decline to 0.81 by 1985 and to 0.75 by 1995.
15.       Given the above assumptions, part capita consumption of palm oil in
Zaire, presently estimated at 3.9 kg, is expected to reach 4.3 kg in 1980,.
4.8 kg in 1985, 5.3 kg in 1990 and 5.8 kg in 1995. This would correspond to a
local consumption of palm oil of 98,000 ton in 1976, increasing to 120,000 ton
1980, 152,000 ton by 1985, 190,000 ton by 1990, and 235,000 ton by 1995.
Local consumption includes household use and industrial use (Table 10).
16.       Household use in the past six years varied between 56,000 and 48,000
ton a year with no identifiable upward or downward trend. This lack of
trend is thought to be a result of the fact that a sizable proportion of the
households produce their own oil or obtain their supply outside of the orga-
nized market, hence being subjected to year by year fluctuations in their
own production or in the supplies available on the informal market. As the
market gets better organized, these fluctuations would not only disappear,
but a definite and more clearly identifiable upward trend in household
consumption of palm oil in Zaire would emerge (Table 11).
17.       Industrial use of palm oil increased from 31,000 ton in 1970 to
50,000 ton in 1975 (Table 11). The major part of this oil went to soap
factories, which absorbed around 20,000 ton in 1970 and around 33,000 ton
in 1975. The second largest industrial use for palm oil in Zaire has been
in the manufacture of margarine and refined salad oils, with the former
absorbing about 3,000 ton p.a., and the latter absorbing about 7,000 ton
in 1975. A recent but potentially important use for palm oil is in the
treatment of copper, where around 6,000 ton of oil were used in 1975. The



ANNEX 1
Page 6
local demand for palm oil for industrial use is expected to continue its
present upward trend as the demand for the major end product, soap, is re-
sponsive to rises in income and in the rate of urbanization, both expected
to grow.
Exportable Surplus
18.       As total output declined and domestic consumption increased, the
surplus of palm oil in Zaire decreased progressively from 133,000 ton in
1970 to 77,000 ton in 1975. Most of this surplus has been exported through
the formal channels, the remainder having found its way to neighboring coun-
tries through leakages. Official exports declined from 123,000 ton in 1970
to 52,000 ton in 1975, and an estimated 40,000 ton in 1976. Expected official
exports for 1977 are estimated at less than 30,000 ton and are expected to con-
tinue declining and to probably cease within the next few years. Illegal ex-
ports., on the other hand, is thought to have increased since 1973 and there
are indications that it might continue to increase, especially if the real
price of palm oil in Zaire is not kept in line with the world market prices
and the local marketing system is not strengthened to make efficient pricing
and adequate regional distribution of supplies feasible.
19.       Based on the mission's estimates of the future needs of the local
market, Zaire will cease to have a surplus of palm oil sometime in the mid-
eighties without the Project, and with the Project sometime in the early
nineties (Table 12). The country would, by then, have to import oil. This
timing is based on the assumption that the Government would find ways to
bring unofficial exports of palm oil under control; this is likely to be
difficult if not impossible in view of existing pricing and marketing poli-
cies. If unofficial exports continue at the present rate, Zaire may have
to start importing oil in the early eighties, and would certainly have no
surplus for official export by 1983. In either case, the output due to
the proposed Project would definitely be a substitute for potential imports,
maybe as early as 1983, and at the latest in the early nineties.
Marketing Arrangements and Price Policy
20.       Palm oil is presently sold directly by producers to wholesalers
and manufacturers on the local market or directly exported by producers
licensed to do so by the Ministry of National Economy. The local marketing
system is greatly handicapped by the inadequacy of the transport system and
by the inefficiency of the pricing mechanism, which presently deprives legi-
timate middlemen of the incentives that would make them perform their func-
tions properly, and encourages the entry into the market of speculators as
well as cumulation of unnecessary middlemen at various stages of the market-
ing system.
21.       The price of palm oil in Zaire is fixed by the Government for
local sales and subject to world market forces for exports. The export



ANNEX 1
Page 7
prices obtained for Zairian palm oil have been comparable to average
prices obtained for palm oil from other sources, which shows that Zaire
meets the quality standards of importers (Table 13).
22.       Prior to 1960, palm oil was sold on the local market at the export
parity price. This encouraged the development of two groups of producers,
the large ones with important marketing facilities specialized in export and
small producers, less equipped for export, but specialized in supplying the
local market. After the monetary readjustment of 1967, and in an attempt
to control rising prices, the Government fixed the domestic price of palm
oil at 75% of the then prevailing world market price. This price, equivalent
to Z. 62 per ton ex-factory, was not changed until 1974 when it was increased
to Z. 92 per ton. During the same period the world market price (in current
US$) increased from $224 per ton in 1967 to $378 per ton in 1973 and $669 per
ton in 1974. The 1974 price increase was, therefore, far from sufficient to
account for the inflation that had taken place between 1967 and 1974. The
price.was adjusted again in 1975 to Z. 145 per ton exfactory and in 1976 it
was set at Z. 290 ex-factory (Decree No. BCE/ENI/ 0047, of July 10, 1976).
23.       The price of oil is fixed by the Government at the wholesale as well
as at the retail levels. Nevertheless, although the price of all ex-factory
sales is well controlled, the price at the retail level is not. Oil has
been sold to domestic consumers at five or six times its official price.
These distortions are caused by the fact that the retail price of oil
has been fixed in such a way that it does not reflect the retailer costs
of transportation, storage or stock carrying, and of general inflationary
pressures within the economy. The unofficial price also reflects a shortage
of oil at the retail level, including Kinshasa, presumably because traders
are able to get a better price when they sell the oil across the border.

ZAIRE
OIL PALM PROJECT
Plantations Lever au Zaire (PLZ)
Introduction
1.        PLZ, originally called Huileries du Congo Belge (HCB), started
its operations in Zaire in 1911 and has been the largest plantation company
ever since. The company is owned by UNILEVER Ltd, which also owns the
largest soap factory in Kinshasa, Marsavco, as a separate company inde-
pendent from PLZ. Prior to the Zairianization of the industrial and com-
mercial sector, UNILEVER also owned a trading company, SEDEC.
2.        PLZ was nationalized in 1974, but never Zairianized.  In September
1976 the company was returned to its former owners who are at present nego-
tiating a 40% participation in the company by the Government. The Govern-
ment has already agreed in principle to such an arrangement. The production
of palm oil is by far PLZ's main activity, but the company also owns rubber,
cacao and tea estates. The areas and volumes of production for 1976 were
as follows:
Area          Production
(ha)            (ton)
Palm Oil               34,400            52,600
Rubber                  7,500             5,900
Cacao                   3,800             1,700
Tea                       400             1,200
Palm Oil Production
3.        In 1958, PLZ produced 52,000 ton palm oil, almost equal to the
1976 production given above. But PLZ's share of Zaire's total industrial
palm oil production increased from 23% in 1958 to about 42% in 1976 because
of the decline in production of other companies. It should be noted, however,
that PLZ's production did not remain stable between 1958 and 1976 either.
A low production of 28,000 ton was recorded in 1965 and a high of 63,000 ton
in 1971. Since 1971 the production declined gradually to the 1976 level of
53,000 ton and it is expected that the production will go down by a further
5,000-6,000 ton over the next five years until the first new Project plantings
come into production.
4.        The source of the throughput of PLZ's palm oil production has also
changed over the last 20 years. During the 1950's almost half of the produc-
tion came from fruits collected in the natural palm areas but that proportion



ANNEX 2
Page 2
has declined to less than one quarter at present. It is expected that this
trend will continue in the future and that the natural palm areas may cease
art"ogether as a source of fruits for PLZ and also for other industrial com-
panies. In the case of PLZ this will probably be accompanied by the winding
up of the company's operations in the Bandundu Region since it has become
evident that the Region is not well suited for commercial oil palm planta-
tions.
Palm Oil Plantations
5.        PLZ has at present four oil palm plantations in the northern Equateur
and Haut Zaire Regions and three in the Bandundu Region. The areas of each
plantation were as follows on January 1, 1977 (in ha):
North      Lokutu               8,865
Yaligimba           8,005
Boteka              2,974
Ebonda              3,733
Sub-total          23,577
South      Bongimba               820
Lusanga             6,914
Mapangu             3,094
Sub-total          10,828
Total              34,405
These areas do not include some 6,500 ha at the Lokutu and Yaligimba planta-
tions which were abandoned in the last decade and which would be rehabilitated
under the Project.
6.        There are big differences in age distribution of the plantations
between the north and south, as shown below (in percentages):
Planting Period   Before 1952  1952-56  1957-61  1962-66  1967-71 1972-76  Total

Plantations           68          12       16         4        -       -       100



ANNEX 2
Page 3
More than two-thirds of the southern plantations were planted before 1952 and
have surpassed what is usually regarded as their productive lifespan. But
the age distribution of the northern plantations is also very skewed since
no less than 72% of all plantations is more than 15 years old. Very little
was planted during the mid 1960s. Only during the last five years, particu-
larly in 1973 and 1974, were significant new plantings made, although only
at one-third of the scale of the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Yields
7.        Average annual production of fresh fruits bunches for the four
northern plantations was as follows during the last five years (ton):
1972     1973      1974     1975    1976
Lokutu                      11.1       9.7      10.4     10.6      9.8
Yaligimba                     8.5      7.5       8.4      7.8      7.1
Boteka                      10.3       8.8       9.8     10.1      8.8
Ebonda                       8.2       7.5       8.1      7.7      6.5
These tonnages are mostly on the low side and there has been some decline over
the last five years. Aging of the plantations, combined with labor shortages
(reflected in sub-standard maintenance), and lack of fertilizers in recent
years have probably all contributed to a falling off in the yield. Labor
shortages were most pronounced at Ebonda and Yaligimba while both plantations,
particularly Ebonda, suffered also from theft of fruits.  For this reason, and
also because PLZ wants to concentrate its activities in a few large estates,
no further plantings are currently planned for the Ebonda plantation. The
above production figures indicate that in recent years the best results
were achieved at the Lokutu plantation. In particular the young plantings
have been doing well. The production of the 1970 plantings exceeded 15 ton
ffb per ha in 1976, while the 1971 and 1972 plantings have already produced
8 and 7 ton respectively. For the reasons given above the 1969-71 plantings
at Yaligimba have been doing less well and produced only 7 to 8 ton per ha.
Planting Program
8.        During the five-year Project period (1978-1982) 9,900 ha would be
planted at Lokutu, Yaligimba and Boteka in accordance with the following
schedule (ha):

Total         1,270   1,980   2,200   2,260   2,190        9,900
Mechanization of land-clearing and road construction is necessary for a
program this size. At Yaligimba the land undulates gently and mechanization
is possible in the entire plantation. But in Lokutu about 40% of the land
consists of rather steep hills where clearing can only be done by hand.
9.        The necessary seeds for PLZ and the other companies' planting
programs will be produced by the Binga research station (jointly owned and
operated by PLZ and CELZA) and PLZ's own multiplication center at Yaligimba.
The combined production of the two centers over the coming years is expected
to be as follows (in '000 seeds):

Wilt resistant seeds are necessary for Boteka and Yaligimba and some parts
of Lokutu. About 3 ha can be planted with 1,000 seeds. The estimated seed
production would thus permit an increase in plantings from about 5,500-6,000
ha in 1978 to about 15,000 in 1982, of which 3,000 ha wilt resistant. This
is largely sufficient to cover the Projects needs and would even permit large
scale plantings outside the Project.

Extraction Rates
10.       The oil extraction rate at the four northern plantations varied in
1976 between 19.1% in Yaligimba and 20.2% of fresh fruit bunches at Boteka;
at Lokutu the rate was 19.6%. At all plantations the extraction rates were
better in 1976 than in previous years. In the southern areas the extraction
rate was about 12.5% - 15%, due to the high proportion of unimproved natural
varieties which contain larger kernels but less oil than the improved
varieties. The extraction rate of palm kernels varies normally between 4.5%
and 5.5% of fresh fruit bunches in the north and between 6.5% and 7.5% in the
south.
Oil Mills
11.       The oil mills at Yaligimba, Boteka and also Ebonda, are equipped
with modern screw presses but the three Lokutu mills still have the old
hydraulic presses installed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Yaligimba
mill has two Wecker presses with a combined capacity of about 25 tons ffb per
hour and one Colin press with a capacity of 12.5 ton as a stand-by. Under the
Project a new boiler plant would be installed to replace two old ones. The
Boteka mill has one 12.5 ton Wecker press and does not require new investments
during the Project period. Of the three mills at the Lokutu plantation, two,
namely Lukumete and Lokutu, are located on the Zaire river and the third one,
Mosite, some 60 km inland. All three mills are equipped with four hydraulic
Stork presses with a combined capacity of 8.5 ton ffb for each mill. Under
the Project two new 12.5 ton Wecker type presses would be installed in
Lukumete in 1978/79 and another three in Lokutu in 1981/82. The Mosite mill
would be closed down in 1982 after the completion of the works at Lokutu.
Modernization of Lokutu would in fact virtually amount to the construction of
a new mill. In Lukumete an important part of the equipment is still in
good working condition and would not be replaced.
Management
12.       The staffing situation of PLZ has changed drastically during the
last 20 years. In 1958 there were still about 260 expatriate staff in the
company's senior positions and only a few Zairians. By the end of 1973 the
number of expatriates was down to about 80 and by the end of 1976 only 44
were left, of whom 19 in Kinshasa and 25 on the plantations. The number
of senior Zairian staff increased to 116 by the end of 1976, of whom 30 in
Kinshasa and the other 86 in the field. Key management and technical
positions are still filled by expatriates and their continued presence is
essential for the success of the Project.  In fact an additional five
expatriate positions are necessary to carry out the next five years plant-
ing program. The rapid pace at which Zairian nationals have been nominated
to senior positions has been accompanied by some adjustment problems, both
on the part of the remaining expatriates and the Zairian staff. But on the
whole collaboration between expatriate and Zairian staff has been excellent



ANNEX 2
Page 6
throughout the last two decades and the company has continuously been managed
in a very responsible manner. The company's management position, both in
Kinshasa and in the field is indeed its strongest assat and should guarantee
an orderly implementation of the Project.
Labor Situation
13.       The company employed about 22,000 workers in 1975, about 3,000 less
than in 1968. It has become increasingly difficult to recruit and retain
laborers during the last decade. The problem exists for all plantation
companies and it seems difficult to state the precise reasons for this.
Insufficient wages is one part of the problem.  In real terms wages have
definitely failed to keep up with the sharply increased prices (and often
non-availability) of basic necessities. Unofficial PLZ estimates indicate
that real wages have gone down by as much as 75% since 1960. A decline in
the level of social services, i.e. schools, hospitals and stores, is cited
as another, equally important, part of the problem. In some places the
local population would probably be better off if it grows its own cash
crops, for example rice in the Yaligimba area, since this generates a higher
cash income than the companies are able to provide. It is difficult to
believe that the people will not work anymore, as some old hands suggest, but
it rather seems that the wholly inadequate price policies of the last decade
are at the root of the problem. The very low official prices for oil sold
on the domestic market, combined with heavy export taxes seem to have
deprived the companies of the possibility to pay adequate wages, provide
reasonable social services and make the necessary re-investments. The
problem was obviously compounded by uncertainty regarding ownership during
the last three years. It seems, therefore, that restoration of adequate
conditions which would attract the required number of workers is vital for
the rehabilitation of the oil palm sector. The recent substantial increase
in the price of oil sold on the domestic market, followed by a 20% increase
in wages should be regarded as important first steps in the right direction.
But it is almost certain that further steps to improve the situation are
necessary.
Financial Situation
14.       PLZ is the company that was the least affected by the various
changes imposed on the oil palm industry. It did lose a number of expatriates
during the transition, but the caliber of the Zairians who replaced them is
relatively high. Thus, apart from control of operations, the close liaison
with London on such matters as the appropriate application of fertilizers,
the procurement of spare parts, the maintenance and extension of installa-
tions and nurseries and general financial guidance was maintained throughout
the period, and the current assets of PLZ were not dissipated.
15.       Although PLZ continued to export about one third of its palm oil
production, which was sold through Unilever in Belgium, foreign exchange
for the purchase of fertilizers, spare parts, tractors, etc., was insuffi-
cient to cover the company's needs. The export price was almost twice as



ANNEX 2
Page 7
high as the former local market (controlled) price, and because of this,
PLZ managed to break even on its palm oil operations. PLZ's other assets,
e.g. kernel crushing plant, warehouses, offices, etc. were not taken away from
them, and the revenue from these activities, at a time when the local market
price for palm oil was pegged below production costs, allowed the company
to maintain its financial stability. PLZ also has the advantage of having
its own storage tanks and "beaches", and, being on the main river, transport
of its products to Kinshasa and delivery of its equipment, fertilizers,
materials and supplies presented fewer problems to PLZ than to most of the
industry.
16.       Nevertheless the tight financial situation during this transition
prompted Unilever to examine closely its Zairian investments. As a result
it was decided to divest PLZ of its southern properties and installations
at the earliest opportunity, and to treat them as a separate company from
1.1.77 until their divestiture. It was also decided to concentrate future
development at Lokutu, Yaligimba and Boteka, gradually phasing out the
Ebonda plantation.

ZAIRE
OIL PALM PROJECT
Busira - Lomami
Introduction
1.        The Busira-Lomami company is owned by a Belgian group, AGRICOM.
The company was Zairianized in 1973, nationalized in 1974 and handed back
to AGRICOM in September 1976. During the Zairianization and nationalization
Busira was amalgamated with several other companies into "Entreprises
industrielles, agricoles et commerciales" (ENTRIAC). The merger of the
companies included both their management and their accounts. This caused
considerable difficulties when the companies had to be disentangled again
after the retrocession was announced.
2.        Busira's main activity is the production of palm oil, but its rubber
operations are also important, and the company produces some coffee as well.
Areas and production volumes were as follows in 1976:
Area             Production
(ha)               (ton)
Palm Oil                              3,750              4,250
Rubber                                4,300              3,950
Coffee                                  400                250
Rubber production is scattered on a large number of isolated small estates and
transport of rubber sheets has become an increasingly difficult problem. The
company does not plan any re-investments in rubber. Coffee is grown on a few
small estates; the company also buys coffee from the surrounding villages.
Oil Palm Areas and Production
3.        Busira's oil palms are concentrated on one plantation at Bembelota
in the downstream section of the Lomami river, near Kisangani. Prior to the
political upheavals of the early 1960s Busira had about 12,000 ha. oil palms
and produced some 16,000 - 17,000 ton palm oil per year. The plantations
were virtually abandoned in 1964 and the production in 1965 was only 1,400
ton oil. A few years later operations were resumed on a limited scale and
by 1969 production had increased again to almost 8,000 ton. Thereafter
production declined gradually to the present level of just over 4,000 ton,
mainly because of aging of the plantations and, during the last few years,
reduced maintenance.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.        At present Busira has about 3,750 ha; the age distribution of the
trees is as follows:
Planting Period      1952-56   1957-61   1962-66    1967-71    1972-76   Total
Percentages            20         33          -           8           39       100
No new plantings were made between 1961 and 1970, because of the adverse
political and economic conditions. No plantings were made in 1975 either,
because of the poor quality of seeds supplied the previous year by the
Yangambi Station. In 1976, however, a record 636 ha were planted with seeds
from PLZ's Yaligimba multiplication center.
Yields
5.        Production figures per ha were as follows during recent years
(ton):
1969-71    1972-74      1975      1976
Fresh Fruit Bunches             8.4          8.4        7.5      7.1
Palm Oil                        2.0          1.9        1.6       1.5
There was a significant decline in the yields during the last two years.  The
oil extraction rate has always been among the highest in the country and
fluctuated between 23% and 23.7% of ffb during the period 1968-1972. Lately
there has been some decline to about 21.1% in 1976. Palm kernel extraction
rates have fluctuated between 4.1% and 4.8% of ffb over the last nine years
without showing a clear upward or downward trend. The productive capacity
of the Bembelota area is generally regarded as very good, perhaps the best
in Zaire.
Planting Program
6.        Busira plans to replant another 350 ha in 1977 and 120 ha in 1978
from its own resources. During the Project period 1978-1982 Busira would
develop a 900 ha extension bloc at Lugo which would allow the company to make
better use of its nearby Bembelota mill. The planting program provides for
100 ha in 1978 and 200 ha in each of the following four years. The replant-
ing program would be resumed in 1983. The company has tentative plans for
the development of a second plantation in the area, provided the economic
and political environment are favorable.
Oil Mill
7.        The Bembelota oil mill was built in 1959 and has a capacity of 18
ton ffb per hour. The mill has two Colin screw presses while most of the
other equipment was procured from Stork. Lack of spare parts seriously



ANNEX 3
Page 3
impaired normal operations during recent years but the necessary replace-
ments will be made in 1977 under the terms of the special credit made by
the EEC to the Government of Zaire. No major investments are necessary
during the Project period.
Management
8.        The number of expatriate staff of the company has gone down from
18 in 1972 to 10 in 1976. Four of them are based in the Kinshasa office
and the other six are in the field, of whom three are concerned with the
company's oil palm operations. The number of senior Zairian staff involved
in Busira's oil palm activities increased from 13 in 1972 to 16 in 1976.
An additional senior Zairian plantation officer would be provided under
the Project. The company's management situation, both in Kinshasa and in
the field, is satisfactory on the whole.
Labor Situation
9.        Busira at present employs about 1500 workers in its oil palm
operations as against 1,250 in 1972. All the laborers are hired from
villages in the vicinity of the plantations and so far no special recruit-
ment efforts were needed. Recently, however, the company has been increas-
ingly faced with difficulties to maintain the plantations properly, partly
because chemicals for weed control were unavailable and partly because of
increased absenteeism amongst the laborers. As with all other companies, the
improvement of both the social conditions on the plantations and the earn-
ings of the workers appear to be essential requirements for the Project's
success.
Financial Situation
10.       Busira Lomami was one of the companies most affected by the
Zairianization of the oil palm industry. Its plantations were severely
affected by non-supply of fertilizers. Its working capital was merged with
that of Hevea - Cequa into ENTRIAC, where most of realizable assets were
allegedly applied to the purchase of an office building and a tug-boat,
which have since remained the property of ENTRIAC. After the retrocession
Busira was invoiced by ENTRIAC for rent of the limited space it occupied
in ENTRIAC's office building, and since it no longer had any cash, Busira
had to obtain an overdraft to finance its operations. At 12.31.76 Busira
had outstanding bank loans (agricultural credits) amounting to Z 830,000,
but these are intended to be repaid in the course of 1977, when Busira's
excess inventories of rubber and palm oil are expected to be sold off.
Busira has also obtained access to Z 600,000 in foreign exchange from the
EEC, which will be drawn down in 1977, to provide urgent machinery replace-
ments and spares. This is to be repaid by 1980.
11.       Busira's balance sheets and trading results for 1972, 1973 and
1976, are shown below. No separate accounts were kept in 1974 and 1975,
and it is not possible to calculate or estimate for these years.

OIL PALM PROJECT
Compagnie de Commerce et de Plantations (CCP)
Introduction
1.        CCP is owned by a Belgian parent company, OLFICA.  Along with most
other foreign owned companies CCP was Zairianized in 1973, nationaized in
1974 and given back to the Belgian owners in September 1976. Unlike Busira-
Lomami and Hevea-Cequa, CCP was not amalgamated with other companies during
the interim but, as many others, it did suffer from bad management as sub-
stantial numbers of incompetent people were hired. After the retrocession
measures were announced these people were all dismissed.
2.        CCP has no interest in plantations other than oil palms.  The
company has its plantations in the Equateur Region, near the town of
Basankusu and also operates four oil mills in the southern Bandundu Region,
where the company still collects fruits in the natural palm tree areas.
In the early 1970s the Bandundu section of CCP produced about 6,000 ton of
oil per year. Since that time production declined gradually to about 3,500
ton in 1976 and is expected to decline further to about 2,000 ton by 1986.
Oil Palm Areas and Production
3.        In the Basankusu area, CCP has plantations at five different
locations and the company operates two oil mills, Lisafa and Ndeke, both
located on the downstream section of the Maringa river, 40 km apart. At
the end of 1976, the area planted was as follows:
Oil Mill                  Plantation                  Area (ha.)
Lisafa                    Lisafa                       2,427
Bokakata                         73
Balangala                      155
Sub-total                    2,655
Ndeke                     Ndeke                        1,182
Waka                           475
Sub-total                    1,657
Total CCP                                              4,312
The Lisafa and Ndeke plantations are the two largest and are both located
around the two oil mills. The Waka plantation is 43 km from Ndeke and
the Bokakata plantation (planted in 1974 and 1975) 34 km from Lisafa.
The Balangala plantation (planted in 1971 and 1973) is no less than 120
km from Lisafa, which makes transport of the fruits extremely costly. The



ANNEX 4
Page 2
three smaller plantations were all set up near existing population pockets,
with the intention of recruiting workers locally. The distances from Waka
and Bokakata to the mills are manageable, but lt was c 2lis-ake to locate a
plantation at Balangala as sufficient workers are not available there to make
it a separate unit with its own mill. Presently no further plantings are
planned for Balangala.
4.        CCP has a higher proportion of young plantations than any of the
other companies included in the Project, as shown below:
Planting Period    1952-56   1957-61    1962-66    1967-71    1972-76  Total
Percentages            7          19         3          36          35       100
More than 70% of all plantings are less than ten years old and their main
contribution to the company's production is still to come, provided the
plantations can be properly maintained. Lack of maintenance, mainly because
of a shortage of workers, was the main problem in recent years particularly
with regard to the new plantings. In fact, in 1976, CCP grossly overestimated
its capacity to plant and maintain its plantations. Of the 458 ha of new
plantings, 265 ha were planted under existing old trees without prior clearance
of the fields, because both the necessary labor and the poison to kill the old
trees were unavailable at that time. Those 265 ha, which are not included in
the areas given above, have to be written off and replanted again.
5.        CCP's plantations produced about 3,800 ton of oil in 1976 against
3,550 ton in 1970. The yield per ha was a rather low, 6 ton ffb, due to the
large proportion of young plantations, as well as the lack of fertilizers
during the last three or four years. With proper maintenance CCP's new plan-
tations should certainly be capable of producing 12 to 14 ton ffb per ha at
full maturity. The oil extraction in the two mills fluctuated in recent years
between 19% and 20% and the production of kernels has been about 4% of ffb.
Planting Program
6.        CCP's first priority would be to improve the state of maintenance
of its plantations, particularly the young ones which are not yet in produc-
tion. This would include replacements of trees in the young plantations,
where necessary, and is estimated to be completed by the end of 1978. In the
course of 1978 CCP's nursery would be reestablished (it had been temporarily
abandoned) and the first new plantings, i.e. replanting of 265 ha mentioned in
paragraph 4, would take place in 1979. From 1980 onwards a modest extension
program would be implemented, i.e. 250 ha in 1980, 400 ha in 1981 and 500 ha
in 1982. No replantings would be made until 1983 since all existing planta-
tions can be kept in production until that time.
Oil Mills
7.        The mill at Ndeke was built in 1968 and is equipped with Kerckhoven
machinery, including four centrifuges. The capacity of the mill is 4 ton ffb



ANNEX 4
Page 3
per hour of which only about 50% is utilized at present. CCP has ordered
a 13 ton ffb per hour Wecker press for Ndeke, to be financed from CCP's
allocation of the special credit made available to Zaire by the European
Economic Community. This would make the excess capacity of Ndeke even
greater. The mill at Lisafa was built in 1971 and is the most modern oil
mill in Zaire. It has one 13 ton ffb per hour Wecker screw press (but no
stand-by). The present sterilizing facilities limit the mill's capacity
to about 10 ton ffb per hour, of which only 30% is utilized. Lack of
spare parts prevented satisfactory maintenance of the Lisafa mill in 1976
and the oil extraction rate has fallen below 19%. CCP has ordered the
necessary spare parts for Ndeke along with the new Wecker press. In fact
CCP may find it wiser to install the new Wecker press in Lisafa as a
stand-by, rather than in Ndeke, where the four existing centrifuges conti-
nue to provide satisfactory extraction rates of close to 20%.
Management
8.        Early 1977 CCP employed eight expatriates, of whom three were
in the Kinshasa headquarters, three in the northern Maringa sector and two
in the Bandundu region. No details are available regarding senior Zairian
staff in the Maringa sector, except that the company employs two senior
plantation managers - one at Lisafa and the other at Ndeke. CCP's manage-
ment is the weakest of the four companies. The situation in the field
was particularly difficult since the position of expatriate agronomist
had been vacant for at least three years. The situation has now
improved with the arrival of an agronomist in December 1976; a second
expatriate agronomist will be provided for under the Project.
Labor Situation
9.        CCP has been seriously constrained in its activities because of
insufficient numbers of workers. The problem is a general one for the
whole industry but CCP, together with Hevea-Cequa, seems to be in a worse
than average position. Deteriorating real wages and social services are the
main reasons for lack of interest on the part of the local population to
take up employment at the nearby plantations.  The company's recent policies
with regard to the social services have had an adverse effect; in particular,
the sale of the company's supply stores to a local trader was a mistake.
CCP tried to alleviate the problem by airlifting 60 workers from Bandundu in
mid 1976. This was not successful since about 40 of them have already gone
back. A serious recruitment effort need to be undertaken in the Basankusu
area itself. According to both the Government's chief representative in
Basankusu and the company's plantation management, the local population is
large enough to provide the necessary labor. However, wage increases and
particularly the improvement of social services are essential. Wages were
increased by a first 20% in January 1977 and CCP would improve the social
facilities under the Project, particularly housing, schools and stores.
Financial Situation
10.       CCP incurred operating losses in 1974 and 1975, mainly due to the
low price for palm oil. By December 31, 1975, its accumulated losses of



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Z 708,000 were more than twice its capital and statutory reserves (Z 323,000).
Since, according to the taxation code, losses cannot be offset against income
for longer than two years, and since the losses were due to prices which
were deliberately kept low by Government policy (and which would have
wrecked the industry if they had not been raised in 1976), the two year limit
should be removed in the case of all three small oil palm companies in the
context of the effort to rehabilitate the industry.
11.       CCP, at the end of 1976, had outstanding loans of Z 315,000 from
SOFIDE (10.5%) and Z 664,000 (5.25%) from BCZ 1/. A second SOFIDE loan of
Z 150,000 (14%) and an EDF loan of Z 350,000 (10%) for rehabilitation were
drawn down in 1977. All of these loans are repayable by 1983. Thus CCP is
highly geared, with a 1.5:1 debt equity ratio at 12.31.76 In order to justify
including CCP in the Project, its operating prospects and assets should
be carefully monitored.

OIL PALM PROJECT
OIL PALM RESEARCH IN ZAIRE
Background
1.        There is a long history of successful oil palm research in Zaire.
The first experimental oil palm plantings were started in the early 1920s.
It was soon determined that organized oil palm plantations were more profit-
able than the exploitation of palm groves and the first plantation was estab-
lished at Yangambi in 1922. From 1924 onwards commercial plantations were
established using open/pollinated selected tenera seed, which was an advanced
practice for that time.
2.        The scope of research in Zaire over the years has been wide ranging
nevertheless several major research questions have been investigated in con-
siderable depth. Commencing with the breeding and selection work of the
1920s, research workers went on to investigate questions such as land clearing
and replanting techniques, oil palm nutrition with emphasis upon foliar
analysis and comprehensive fertilizer trials, the economics of fertilizer,
pests and diseases, criteria for harvesting, intercropping with cocoa and
coffee and other intercrops, and palm oil processing in all its aspects.
3.        Most of the oil palm research was located at Yangambi (the major
INERA oil palm research station) and at Yaligimba and Binga, the research
stations of PLZ.
4.        These research stations were well equipped and had adequate funding
for their applied research programs.  The success of research is evidenced by
the fact that by 1958 large oil palm plantations covered about 147,000 ha
whereas small estates and small holders owned by Zairians amounted to almost
100,000 ha.
5.        Unfortunately the events following independence created conditions
unfavorable to research and for several years research work was at a virtual
standstill. Recently, however, PLZ and Celza have resumed a limited research
program based at Binga. This research program is directed largely by a group
of four expatriates--two agronomists, one plant breeder/seed production
specialist, and one pathologist.
Research Priorities
6.        Research priorities would include the following elements:

Research Proposals
7.        The proposed expansion and rehabilitation program for the oil palm
subsector requires a similar expansion of research work commensurate with the
proposed program. It is essential that Zairian research personnel be trained
in applied oil palm research as a basis for the long-term research program
required to service the industry. Accordingly, it is proposed to recruit
two additional expatriate research workers with long experience in the oil
palm research field to strengthen the present research team and to assist
in providing appropriate training for selected Zairian graduates. The cost
of this operation is broken down in the table below:

ANNEX 7
ZAIRE
OIL PALM PROJECT
Financial Projections of the Companies
1.        Financial projections were prepared by the mission on the basis
of available information. Production tonnage and acreage estimates of
palm oil plantations from 1977 to 1987 are those agreed by the mission and
the companies. Project costs and non-project investments were also calcu-
lated by the mission. The projections are in constant mid-1977 Zaires,
with the exception that the Project costs take into account price escala-
tion (Tables 1-4 of this Annex).
2.        PLZ provided complete financial projections and cost statistics,
including the 1976 financial statements and balance sheet. Busira Lomami
which had been merged upon Zairianization with Hevea Cequa, did not have
separate accounts for 1975. Projections for the three smaller companies
were prepared`-by the mission and agreed to by the parent companies.
3.        The financial situation at the beginning of 1977 was quite reason-
able for PLZ, which has no loans outstanding and whose plantations and instal-
lations have been well maintained; PLZ also had some 4 million Zaires in its
treasury. Busira Lomami had its working capital and treasury depleted while
part of ENTRIAC and were not given back the assets which ENTRIAC acquired with
these funds. It therefore had recourse to short- and medium-term bank loans.
Busira's overdraft should be cleared up in the course of 1977. For CPP, with
accumulated operating losses of 0.5 million Zaires and a debt equity ratio of
about 60:40 1/ the financial situation at the beginning of 1976 is not good.
However, in view of high coffee prices and of the recent increase of the local
price of palm oil, prospects for three of the companies are encouraging.
4.        The two smaller companies have obtained bank loans in foreign
exchange (provided by EDF) in order to purchase spare parts, vehicles and
equipment to restore their installations to reasonable working condition.
These borrowings are shown in the 1977 column of the tables for the respective
companies.
5.        The companies are expected to self-finance about 50% of their over-
all 1977-82 investments (including non-Project investment), with the exception
CCP which is expected to finance about 40% of its investments. This appears
to be a reasonable proportion in view of the considerable amount of rehabili-
tation involved.
1/   Before taking into account a second SOFIDE loan which CCP obtained in
1977.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
6.        Given the companies' need to finance some immediate rehabilitation
as well as continuing capital expenditure, including plantations not yet in
production, and other commercial and agricultural activities not covered
by the Prnject, it is estimated that the companies' contributions to Project
costs could not exceed the following shares: PLZ - 53%, Busira - 33%, CCP -
40%.
7.        External financing would cover up to 47% of PLZ's Project costs and
since the foreign exchange proportion of PLZ's Project cost is estimated at
49%, no local costs would be financed from external sources. In the case of
the smaller companies, it is proposed that up to 66% of Project cost would
be financed by external funds; the foreign exchange proportion of Project
cost is 31%, thus about half of the local costs would be financed by external
funds.

ANNEX 8
ZAIRE
OIL PALM PROJECT
Financial and Economic Analysis
Basic Assumptions
1.        Official Exchange Rate.  The value of the Zaire is fixed in relation
to the SDR (SDR 1 = Z 1) and is floating against the US dollar in a rather
narrow range. In January 1977, the official exchange rate was Z 1 = US$1.153
and this has been assumed in the projections.
2.        Local and International Inflation.  The analysis is based on the
premise that the rate of inflation in Zaire would be higher than that prevail-
ing internationally and that the difference, although becoming smaller,
would persist until 1985 (para 4.17). Given the earlier assumption of a fixed
official exchange rate, the different rates of inflation will result in
additional real local costs to the palm oil producers in as far as local
inflation exceeds international inflation. Similarly, on the benefits side,
the different rates of inflation would result in additional benefits to the
palm oil producers, assuming that increases in the cost of producing oil would
be fully reflected in Government's official prices for oil to be sold in the
domestic market (para 6.03).
3.        Price of Palm Oil.  For the financial evaluation, the present price
of palm oil of Z 350 per ton ex-Kinshasa was used as the base price for 1977,
and for subsequent years this price was adjusted for the differences between
local and international inflation (para 2). For the economic evaluation,
import parity prices of palm oil were used (constant 1977 prices). Future
prices of palm oil cif Matadi are assumed to be equal to the prices cif
Europe, as projected by IBRD. Estimated transport and handling costs between
Matadi and Kinshasa have been added to calculate import parity prices of oil,
delivered at Kinshasa (Table 1). For palm kernels the price of Z 100 per ton
has been used in both the financial and economie evaluation.
4.        Costs.  Plantation costs include both investment and maintenance
costs; unit costs per ha are given in Annex 6, Appendices 1 and 2. The cost
of fertilizer for existing young plantations, representing about 1% of overall
Project cost, has not been included in the evaluation since the resulting
benefits are difficult to estimate and in any case represent only a small
fraction of total Project benefits. The costs of processing include invest-
ments in new oil mill equipment, but not depreciation of existing mills. The
variable processing costs are estimated at Z 20 per ton of palm oil for PLZ,
Z 23 per ton for Busira, and Z 25 per ton for Hevea and CCP. Transport of
palm oil between the plantations and Kinshasa has been estimated at Z 14 per
ton for PLZ, Busira and CCP. For the investment period overhead costs are



ANNEX 8
Page 2
assumed to be included in the planting costs but from 1983 onwards separate
overheads have been included at the following rates: PLZ Z 110 per ha; Busira
Z 100 per ha; and CCP Z 95 per ha. Although these are fixed costs (in
contrast to all other costs and benefits which are incremental) their inclu-
sion is justified since in the "without Project" situation the companies
would certainly reduce their overhead costs. Labor was priced at Z 1 per
man-day. It is assumed that this rate reflects the opportunity cost of labor
in the plantation areas, hence labor has not been shadow priced in the economic
analysis. All costs are in 1977 constant prices.
5.        Taxes.  All taxes payable by the companies, with the exception of
company taxes on profits, have been included as costs in the financial
analysis but have been excluded from the economic analysis.
6.        Foreign Exchange.  The foreign exchange component of the costs has
been shadow priced in the economic analysis at Z 1.1 per US$1 (the official
rate is Z 0.867 per US$1) to reflect its economic value. The value of
Project-produced palm oil is treated as foreign exchange savings and has
therefore also been shadow priced in the economic analysis.
7.        Foreign Participation.  There is no reason to adjust the Project's
cost and benefit streams in the economic evaluation for the fact that the
oil palm companies are majority foreign owned. None of the companies is
expected to bring in fresh funds from abroad because of the Project.  The
companies' financial contribution would entirely consist of locally available
funds which in the "without Project" situation would most likely be used to
finance alternative investments in Zaire, either in plantations or in other
activities. In other words, the companies' own contributions should not be
regarded as "tied funds" which without the Project would not have been
available to Zaire. If the opposite had been true the internal economic
rate of return of the Project would have been higher.
8.        Production.  Estimated yields in fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per ha
for subsequent years are given by company in Annex 1, Table 8. Total produc-
tion figures for both palm oil and palm kernels, by company and by year, are
in Table 9 of the same Annex.
9.        Cost and benefit streams under the various assumptions are detailed
for all three companies in Tables 2-5. The internal financial and economic
rates of return are at Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

ZAIRf
OIL PALM PROJECT
Training
1.        Over the last two decades all companies have made considerable
and systematic efforts to train Zairian nationals and have steadily reduced
their expatriate staff. During the Zairianization period of the last four
years, however, the companies were forced to reduce their expatriate staff at
a faster rate than desirable and many were replaced by Zairians who were not
fvillv ci,alified for their new responsibilities. As a consequence, the failure
rate has been high and the remaining expatriate management and technical staff
was often forced to work under great stress to operate the plantations and
installations in a normal, efficient manner. In this situation the resources,
particularly in terms of experienced manpower, but also financially, were
often lacking for the continuation of comprehensive training activities.
Whatever training was done in recent years was more the result of incidental
efforts than of a systematic approach.
2.        In the past the companies had more success with the training of
agricultural and accounting staff than with that of technical and senior
management staff. With regard to qualified and experienced technical staff
the oil palm companies have to compete with enterprises in Kinshasa and
the mining areas and prospective senior Zairian managers often lack the
broad experience to become fully effective.
3.        Since the companies were de-nationalized the prospects for training
of Zairian staff have certainly improved and the Project would provide support
to strengthen the training activities of the companies and thus, in the
long-run, to reduce the need for expatriates. Training activities would in
part focus on existing staff to improve their skills which would permit them
to do a better job in their present assignments or to prepare them for higher
positions. Efforts would also be undertaken to train new staff, often young
school graduates, to develop an increasing cadre of skilled personnel.
4.        The Project would support the following activities:
(i) Training of Plantation Managers. Young school graduates or
promising individuals amongst the existing staff would need to work for an
extended period under the supervision and guidance of experienced staff to
become fully effective as chief of a plantation sector (400-800 ha) or of a
division (1,500-2,000 ha). PLZ would therefore organize a series of one-year
practical training sessions on its two largest plantations, Yaligimba and
Lokutu. The number of trainees would be about ten per year, which the is
the maximum PLZ can handle and which is likely to be sufficient to meet the
annual needs of PLZ (about four or five) and the other companies. Under the
Project PLZ would construct housing for the trainees and would provide them
with motorcycles and cost of living allowances.

(ii) Course in Mechanics. To ease the shortage of qualified mechanics
for the maintenance of oil mills and transport fleets the program of an
existing secondary school at Lokutu would be expanded to include a course
in mechanics. The school is located near the headquarters of PLZ's Lokutu
plantation and is operated by a Catholic mission. At the same locality
PLZ owns a workshop for apprentices which has not been used since 1965,
and which would be reactivated. PLZ would, under the Project, be responsible
for the construction of a dormitory and a classroom for about 30 students and
for the procurement of necessary instruction equipment. PLZ would also
employ a qualified teacher, specialized in mechanics, who would be attached
to the school's regular staff. Graduates of the school who have taken the
mechanics course would be availble for employment by PLZ or any other company,
as needed.
(iii) Study Trips. Existing senior Zairian management, accounting and
technical staff would be given the opportunity to broaden their experience
through short visits (one to two months) to other palm oil producing countries.
Some six candidates would be selected each year by Government in consultation
with the companies but nominations could include, if Government so desires,
some of its own staff or staff of companies not included in the Project.
In contast wth the two other training activities, for which PLZ would be
responsible, Government would make arrangements for the study trips and the
costs would be financed from IDA's contribution for technical assistance to
Government under this Project.
