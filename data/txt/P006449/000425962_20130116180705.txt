F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
(a) Increase the sustainable water supply for multiple uses, improve the efficiency of
Ceará's integrated water resources management system and decrease vulnerability of poor
populations to cyclical drought through: (i) improvements in the institutional, legal and
administrative managerial frameworks with emphasis on participatory management
mechanisms; (ii) the rehabilitation and new construction of the hydraulic infrastructure
aimed at the integrated management of river basins; (iii) the development and
consolidation of sustainable cost recovery, management, operation and maintenance
systems for the hydraulic infrastructure; and (iv) the integration of environmental policies
with water management policies. The main performance indicators are: (i) the percentage
increase in the volume of bulk water supplied by COGERH, the states water resources
management company; (ii) the increased reliability of water supply and resistance against
droughts; (iii) the implementation of new and/or improved water resources management,
operation and maintenance tools; (iv) increase in the number of users with enhanced
reliable access to quality water; and (v) the percentage of recovery for fixed and variable
costs of providing water.

  b. Stimulate multiple use, efficient and shared management of Ceará's water resources.
The project would support the following actions: (i) organization and strengthening of
river basin committees and water user associations; (ii) implementation and propagation
of more effective water use and management technologies; and (iii) education,
information and training of the general public and water users aimed at efficient water
use, demand management and the reduction of waste. The main performance indicators
are: (i) the increase in the number of river basin committees and water user associations,
including the number of people participating in these entities; (ii) the decrease of the
physical waste of water and the increased productivity in the economic sectors which use
water as a production input; (iii) the percentage of billed water services v/s collections of
bills.

  c. Promote the improved management of soil and vegetation in tributary watersheds to
enhance water conservation, minimize erosion and maximize natural water storage

                                              iii
mechanisms, through the adequate management of critical micro-basins and groundwater
resources. The project would foster the hydro-environmental recovery of selected micro-
basins in the state by increasing the vegetated area, controlling run-off, minimizing
erosion, increasing water retention times, increasing groundwater recharge, developing
aquifer management plans and recharge zone protection plans, improving the local
infrastructure and production methods; and by evaluating new technologies. The main
performance indicators are: (i) hectares of rehabilitated watershed vegetation, (ii) number
of micro-basins stabilized, (iii) measured runoff hydrographs as a function of time and
volume for specific microbasins, (iv) measurement of volumetric erosion in key
microbasins and sedimentation change in key catchments, (v) number of recharge
protection zones established, (vi) number of aquifer and groundwater management plans
developed.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1   Context at Appraisal
1. This Implementation Completion and Results report (ICR) evaluates the performance
of the Ceará Integrated Water Resources Management Project (PROGERIRH),
implemented with a first loan approved Jan. 6, 2000 (Ln. 45310-BR) in the amount of
US$136.0 million and with Additional Financing (AF, Ln. 76300-BR) in the amount of
US$103.0 million for the same project objectives, approved on Dec. 18, 2008. The AF
loan was closed on December 31, 2011. A six-month extension of the ICR was approved
on June 19, 2012 to allow for completion of pending construction of water works and
compliance with social and environmental safeguards obligations under the Project.
2. Climate and Water. More than 90% of the area of the State of Ceará (148,920 km2)
and population of about 8.5 million (2010), is located in a tropical semi-arid zone (sertão).
The remaining 10% stretches along the more humid Atlantic coast, including the capital
city Fortaleza and its metropolitan region with 3.6 million inhabitants. Mean rainfall in
the sertão is less than 800 mm p.a. and highly irregular; in the coastal region, it is greater
than 1,000 mm, and up to 1600 mm in Fortaleza. Variability of rainfall in Ceará is among
the highest in the world. Rain falls mostly in the first half of the year; the second half is
generally dry. Without storage, all rivers are dry for parts of the year. Periodic droughts
affect not only the semi-arid interior but also the coastal region and Fortaleza.
Groundwater of good quality is limited due to the crystalline rock geology underlying
most of the state.
3. Climate and Development. Ceará has been among the poorest states of Brazil, as the
semi-arid climate and its recurrent droughts traditionally allowed only precarious
subsistence farming and extensive animal grazing. Climatic uncertainties did not favor
investments. Recurrent droughts led to major migration to the large cities of the Northeast,
the Amazon, or Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Those that remained were supplied with
water from trucks. The more vulnerable parts of the population stayed behind and faced
severe problems such as educational neglect of generations of rural children and youths.
The rapid growth of the Fortaleza Metropolitan Region (FMR) during the last 70 years
was due in large part to the rural exodus triggered by recurrent droughts. Providing water
to the increasing population of the FMR was a serious challenge for the State at the time
of project preparation.
4. Water Infrastructure and Management. Reservoirs to store water between seasons
and years were the traditional response of governments to droughts for more than 100
years, but they were built and operated in an ad-hoc, unplanned, uncoordinated and non-
integrated fashion. Until the early 1990s, droughts were considered emergencies, not as
recurring events to be expected and managed. Storage was insufficient and managed
inadequately, without integration within river basins, and facilities for water distribution
(pipelines or canals) were lacking. Planning did not emphasize multiple, competing uses
of water, and data on rainfall and river flows were scarce. Hydraulic infrastructure was
inadequately operated and maintained, dam safety was not assured and water supply to
the fast-growing Fortaleza region was not guaranteed. Water use was uncontrolled and
free, and water users participated little in water management.



                                              1
5. The adoption of new water management policies by the State of Ceará during 1987-
1996, ahead of the National Water Law (1997), made Ceará the pioneer of water
resources management (WRM) in Brazil. In 1993, the Bank financed the PROURB
project 1. It included a specific WRM component to support the implementation of the
1992 state’s new water law. PROURB helped build a number of strategic medium-size
reservoirs in the state, and supported strengthening of WRM to a limited degree, but it
lacked the integration of management, particularly integration of river basins and among
institutions. The PROGERIRH Project discussed here is the third Bank-financed project
to assist the State of Ceará in implementing modern WRM policies, planning and
management tools to overcome the impact of recurrent droughts. The Project was
preceded by the Ceará WRM Pilot Project (Loan 4190-BR, closed in 2002) to provide
planning, methodologies and institutional strengthening for the PROGERIRH project.
6. At project start, Ceará had already achieved the following:
Water Resources Management and Institutions:
• The State Secretariat for Water Resources (SRH) was created in 1987.
• The first State Water Resources Plan had been formulated in 1991.
• The State Water Resources Policy was enshrined in state law (Law 11.996 of 1992),
  and included the definition of a State WRM System.
• A State Water Resources Council had been operational since 1992.
• Three out of the eleven river basins of the state had established committees, and 30
  water users associations had been formed.
• A water rights policy was defined and being implemented (1994), and bulk water
  charges were defined for some uses and collected partially (since 1996).
• A state company (COGERH) was created in 1993 to manage bulk water, alongside an
  agency responsible for construction of hydraulic works (SOHIDRA).
Infrastructure:
• Plans for a large river basin transfer from the Castanhão reservoir (finished in 2002)
   in the Jaguaribe river basin to the Fortaleza Metropolitan Basin and the industrial and
   port region of Pecém had been drawn, but the canal’s final design and alignment had
   not yet been decided.
• Priority investments in reservoirs and conveyance structures had been identified.
• There were 117 strategic reservoirs operated by COGERH in 2000, with a total
   storage of 10.3 billion m3. The state’s largest reservoir – Castanhão – was under
   construction and to be completed in 2002, by the federal agency National Department
   against Droughts (DNOCS).
• The “Worker’s Canal? (Canal do Trabalhador) to supply the Fortaleza Metropolitan
   Region had been built in an emergency in 1993/4 to carry water from the Jaguaribe
   river basin to the FMR, but fell into disrepair a few years after 2.

8. As was common practice for many Bank projects at the time, no baseline or target
values were given in the PAD for most of the indicators. While some indicators are
macro i.e. referring to the WRM system of Ceará as a whole, others are related to specific
results of the hydro-environmental pilot project PRODHAM such as (i) to (v) linked to
the third dimension of the PDO (section C in the table above). It is important to highlight
that Project preparation was assessed and considered “satisfactory? by QAG. A detailed
output matrix using the indicators list from PAD Annex 1 was included in the Project
Implementation Plan, which was part of the preparation package at the time. In addition,
baseline and target values were agreed with the Borrower for most indicators at project
start, monitored throughout implementation and reported in the ISRs. During the
preparation of the Additional Financing (AF), additional indicators were agreed with the
Borrower, monitored during implementation, and reported in the ISRs. The indicator list
in PAD Annex 1 and the new indicators agreed for the AF were taken as basis for the
results presented in this ICR and its data sheet.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification
9. The PDO and key indicators remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project.
During the preparation of the Additional Financing (AF), a few other indicators were
agreed with the Borrower but were not included in the Project Paper because the team
understood it was not required. These indicators were, however, included in the ISRs and
monitored during the implementation of the AF.

1.4   Main Beneficiaries
10. The PAD identifies both the rural and the urban population of the State’s semi-arid
interior as principal beneficiary groups through new and rehabilitated reservoirs and
water conveyance facilities, guaranteeing drinkable water, improved health conditions
and increased agricultural production from irrigation and leading to economic and
demographic decentralization (as opposed to prior centralization in the FMR). The
reservoirs built under the Project benefited an estimated population of about 300,000.
Poor rural communities were also the target of the micro-watershed pilot component
PRODHAM (Component 5). The urban population of the FMR was another principal
beneficiary group, to which the largest of the six components was aimed (Integration of
Key River Basins, Component 3), with expanded and more reliable water supply. The
Integration of River Basins with the construction of the Integration Canal assures water
supply during drought periods to the FMR, with an estimated beneficiary population of
3.6 million, of which an estimated 6-10% are extremely poor people.

1.5   Original Components
11. Component 1: Management and Institutional Component (US$ 25.0 million, 10%
of total estimated cost). Building on progress made in the institutional, legal and
management frameworks of the state, this component sought to enhance the work done
by then, refine the systems and continue the implementation of sustainable practices in
the management of the resources. The component was divided into five sub-components:
(i) Hydro-meteorological Information System; (ii) Sustainable Operation and
Maintenance of Bulk Water System; (iii) Dam Safety and Inspection Program; (iv) Basin
Committee Organization and Training; (v) Water Tariff Evaluation; (vi) Market-Based
Water Transfer Mechanisms; and (vii) Public Information and Education Program.
12. Component 2: Strategic Reservoir Network (US$22.2 million, 9 percent of total
estimated cost). Design and construction of key infrastructure critical to the provision of
water supplies to rural water-short areas and to reduce the vulnerability of the citizens of
the state to cyclical drought in the short to medium term.
13. Component 3: Integration of Key River Basins (US$166.8 million, 67.5 percent of
total estimated cost). Provision of reliable and quality water supply for industrial,
municipal and domestic purposes within the Metropolitan Basin of Fortaleza through a
new river basin transfer from the Jaguaribe river. The component included also an
analysis of the best option for this diversion and its executive designs.
14. Component 4: Restoration of Existing Bulk Water Infrastructure (US$23.2
million, 9.4 percent of total estimated cost). Continue the evaluation process of existing


                                             4
bulk water supply infrastructure and begin implementation of restoration measures for
those systems deemed most critical to ensuring continued supply of bulk water in the
short term.
15. Component 5: Micro Watershed Management Pilot Project – PRODHAM
(US$5.0 million, 2 percent of total estimated cost). Rehabilitation of micro watersheds
(fourth-level tributaries) in four pre-defined areas of the State. The pilot project was to
develop methodologies for a functioning approach for local community involvement,
implementing technically, socially, environmentally and economically sustainable
solutions for improved management of soil and vegetation in the tributary watersheds by
enhancing water conservation, minimizing erosion and maximizing moisture storage.
16. Component 6: Groundwater Management (US$5.0 million, 2 percent of total
estimated cost). Most of the state of Ceará is situated on crystalline rock formations with
scarce good-quality groundwater, requiring water storage in surface reservoirs during the
rainy season (January - May). In two regions of the state, however, there are significant
groundwater resources, and the component focused on these two areas through the Cariri
and Coastal Zone sub-components. In the Cariri region, the Component aimed at
collecting and producing relevant data regarding its groundwater situation; and
developing and implementing an action plan for improved groundwater management.
The activities in the Coastal Zone focused on the development of a groundwater
management plan including identification and preservation of critical recharge zones to
ensure long term sustainability of the resources.

1.6      Revised Components
17. Additional Financing (AF) for this Project of US$ 103.0 million was approved by the
Board on December 17, 2008, with a closing date of December 31, 2011. While project
objectives remained the same, project components were consolidated in two major areas:
(a) WRM, and (b) hydraulic infrastructure 3 . AF was to fund another six strategic
reservoirs and associated water conveyance structures (pipelines).

1.7      Other significant changes
18. Extensions of Closing Date: The original Project had four extensions of Closing
Date, from June 30, 2006 to May 31, 2008, then to December 31, 2008, to February 15,
2009 and finally to April 30, 2009. The closing date was extended in order to allow full
disbursement of the original Loan. With the approval of AF, overall project closing was
extended to December 31, 2011.
19. Amendments to the Loan Agreement: The original project Loan Agreement had
seven amendments. The first four (November 2001, May 2002, September 2002 and
December 2002) raised loan funding for Category 1 – Works from 50% to 95% until
withdrawals had reached US$22.1 million. The last three amendments (October 2003,
June 2006 and October 2006) gradually reduced loan financing for the same category to
compensate for the initial increases. These changes in the Loan Agreement responded to
the Borrower’s needs of financial resources in the initial phases of the construction of the
river basin transfer infrastructure.

20. Additional Financing: The Ceará Integrated WRM Additional Financing Loan was
designed to scale up the activities financed under PROGERIRH mainly through
additional hydraulic infrastructure and consolidation of the institutional framework for
integrated water resources management. The development objectives remained
unchanged, but the components were rearranged and consolidated into two. The Loan in
the amount of US$103 million was approved by the Board on December 17, 2008,
became effective on November 24, 2009, and the Closing Date was December 31, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
21. The Project was generally well prepared but included four key shortcomings: (i)
unrealistic estimates (see paragraph 24); (ii) lack of baseline and target data; (iii) a
couple of irrelevant indicators; and (iv) inadequate risk analysis regarding
availability of counterpart funds. The PAD did not include baseline and target data in
the results matrix for most of the indicators. The Project was solidly based on experience
gained with the water resources sector in Ceará under the Ceará Urban Development &
Water Resource Project (PROURB). The Federal WRM Project PROAGUA had already
started in 1998 on the basis of the new national water resource legislation and was
supporting similar concepts as PROGERIRH across the states of the Brazilian Northeast.
Ceará had already created the most important legal and institutional instruments for water
resource management in the 1990s. Through the loan for PROGERIRH, the Bank
recognized the unique commitment and progressive stance of the Government of Ceará
with regard to water resource management and decided to embark on a longer-run
program in support thereof. As additional support for the institutional and analytical
dimensions of WRM and for the preparation of PROGERIRH, the Ceará WRM Pilot
Project was carried out between 1998 and 2002 (Loan 4190-BR).

2.1.2    Assessment of Project Design
22. The project development objectives (PDOs) were in line with the goals of the
Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil at the time (CAS 1996-99) as documented in
Annex 1 of the PAD. The PDOs were relevant and achievable. However, as it was the
practice at the time, they were not translated into operational outcome indicators, which
were also not quantified in terms of baseline and target values. Several alternatives to
the adopted project strategy were considered and described in the PAD. The Project
strategy combining strengthened water management and institutions and infrastructure
was deemed most sustainable to reach the Project objectives and was reconfirmed at the
design stage of the Additional Financing.
23. The project design by components followed broadly the PDOs. It adequately linked
institutional development and the expansion of physical infrastructure, which was
reflected even more explicitly in the two components of the Additional Financing. The
Project took into account the management capacity of the State’s institutions correctly
and included strengthening for improved implementation of WRM tools and increased
participatory management of river basins. The financial viability of the bulk water



                                            6
provider, COGERH, and adequate water tariffs were stressed as essential for the
sustainability of water resources development.
24. Regarding infrastructure, the basin integration through the Integration Canal was a
major focus of the Project because of the need to secure water supply to FMR through the
largest reservoir in the State, Castanhão, expected to be completed in 2002. However,
given that the study of the optimal solution for the water transfer from the Jaguaribe river
basin to the Metropolitan basin had not been concluded by Appraisal, and the final layout
and design for the Integration Canal had not been decided, cost estimates were very
approximate. Consequently, Project costs were established as the result of the loan
size predetermined by the Federal Government’s external financing committee and
the loan funding percentage prescribed by Bank management. It was envisaged at
Appraisal that real costs could be higher and larger counterpart funding could be
required to conclude the Integration Canal with its three sections, but it was
considered opportune to start the Project and secure additional resources later as
needed, which proved to be a correct approach and well calculated risk eventually.
25. The construction of strategic reservoirs complemented the effort to increase water
storage in the state initiated with PROURB and followed by PROAGUA. In addition, the
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure was a priority to support COGERH in the mandate
of operating and maintaining the state’s bulk water infrastructure. The pilot micro-
watershed component (PRODHAM) to design methodologies to promote watershed
conservation by and for the rural poor was well-conceived although it lacked clarity in
the selection of its monitoring indicators, which made it difficult to evaluate. Soil
degradation and even desertification in the semi-arid region are serious problems not only
for small farmers, but also shorten the life of reservoirs through siltation. The pilot
component added complexity, but also enhanced relevance and innovation to the Project.
26. The economic and financial analyses were carried out with appropriate
methodologies, depth and detail, including an analysis of the fiscal and distributional
impact. The analyses did not include the Institutional Development component, which is
difficult to evaluate in terms of economic benefits. Financial analysis showed the critical
dependence of COGERH as bulk water provider on bulk water sales and appropriate
tariffs, particularly with regard to water supplied to the FMR, and thus underlined the
need for careful analysis of water charges and proposed changes to the tariff structure.
27. The deep involvement of the Bank in Ceará’s water sector, the uncertain overall
funding requirements over the medium term and the need to implement institutional
improvements as well as new infrastructure, suggests that an Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) might have been a more suitable lending instrument than a SIL, with successive
tranches to fund time slices of infrastructure investments conditioned on progress with
policy and institutional adjustments. The issue was raised at the Concept meeting. The
team pointed out the advantage of using a programmatic financing instrument. However,
that would have meant splitting the proposal into a phased approach while the
infrastructure proposed was needed through a single intervention in order to facilitate the
integrated river basin management approach within the State. Besides, given the urgency
of the implementation of the proposed Project in response to the drought situation in the
State at the time, any delays caused by the interjection of an APL at that point would
have offset its advantages.


                                             7
28. Project preparation took adequate account of relevant safeguard policies. The project
was rated as Category A for environmental purposes. The Bank policies on
Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats, Pest Management, Physical Cultural
Resources, Involuntary Resettlement and Dam Safety were triggered. No indigenous
populations existed in Ceará that would be affected. A detailed description on safeguard
activities is included in Annex 10.
29. The Additional Financing (AF) provided continuity to the financing of
PROGERIRH activities consistent with the project’s objectives and components. It
contributed to the financing of scaled-up activities to enhance the impact of the Original
Project. It also contributed to continue the high level dialogue between the Bank and the
Government, strengthened with the inclusion of water resources indicators in the SWAp
operation, carried out in parallel. The AF activities included the: (a) completion of the
Integration Canal; (b) implementation of additional water storage and supply; and (c)
consolidation of institutional and legal reforms of the State’s water resource management
system and the use of instruments for allocating water among it multiple uses. Although
the implementation period of the Additional Financing was limited to three years from
the closing date of the Original Project, the team considered it feasible to implement the
proposed activities under that timeframe. The assessment was made considering that the
new infrastructure design and studies had already been prepared and considered
acceptable by the Bank, and the implementing agencies teams were experienced and
showed good performance under the Original Project. This situation changed after Board
approval of the AF as most of the team left SRH as a result of the changes in State
Administration. Besides, due to delays in the processing of the AF, including delays in
approval by Senate, the actual implementation period was reduced to two years.

2.1.3   Borrower Commitment
30. The Borrower’s commitment to the objectives, strategy and content of the Project was
adequate. The Borrower’s Water Policy Sector Letter, dated August 5, 1999, documented
such commitment before negotiations. The project was ready for implementation at loan
signing. The Bank had already approved four reservoir sub-projects that complied with
requirements of economic viability, resettlement planning, environmental impact
assessments and dam safety. Bidding for these dams was started right away in February
2000. The final design of the Integration Canal, however, had not yet been decided as the
studies were being finalized. For the Additional Financing, the designs and safeguard
studies of the six proposed dams were completed before implementation start. The
counterpart funds considered for the AF included an additional amount of US$76 million
spent by the Government with the construction of the Canal under the Original Project.

2.1.4   Risks and Mitigation Measures
31. Selected major risks identified at appraisal were: (a) financial counterpart funds
are unavailable: modest risk. To the contrary, given the uncertainty about total
project cost, this risk was actually high. No mitigation measures were proposed; (b)
Lack of political and social support for the necessary legal and institutional reforms:
modest risk. Public information and awareness campaigns had been built into the project
design. However, the QAG quality-at-entry assessment rightly raised this risk to



                                            8
high in view of the perceived low public acceptance of increasing bulk water tariffs
sufficiently to guarantee financial sustainability of COGERH; (c) difficulty of Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) to coordinate all foreseen actions: modest risk. In light of the
complexity of the Project, but also of prior Borrower experience with Bank loans and
built-in strengthening of the executing agency (SRH), modest risk was appropriate. The
Project provided for hiring of specialized consultants and training of the PIU.
32. QAG “Quality at Entry?. A Quality at Entry Assessment was carried out by QAG
and rated “satisfactory? in May 2001 (one year after appraisal). All aspects of the Project
were rated either “highly satisfactory? or “satisfactory?, with the exception of Fiduciary
Aspects that were rated “marginal? as the financial management requirements had not
been met before negotiations. The Assessment recognized the sound design of the Project,
which was, however, not adequately reflected in the PAD, especially in the targets and
indicators matrix. In addition, although not pointed out in the Assessment, there were
four key shortcomings in Project design: (i) unrealistic cost estimates (see paragraph 24);
(ii) lack of baseline and target data; (iii) a couple of irrelevant indicators; and (iv)
inadequate risk analysis regarding availability of counterpart funds.

2.2     Implementation
33. The Original Project achieved most of its objectives, but with delays. The Additional
Financing extended the Project scope by including additional reservoirs and conveyance
systems; however, it faced serious difficulties in executing planned activities within its
three-year implementation period.

2.2.1    Factors contributing to successful implementation
34. The Borrower had exceptionally strong interest and ownership in the Project, in the
physical as well as in the institutional components. During the first six years, the
Borrower did not spare efforts to raise the additional counterpart funds required and was
successful in doing so. The Borrower had prior experience with large investments in
WRM, including procurement and financial management skills. Responsibilities were
well-defined and well-distributed among the three principal agencies (SRH, COGERH
and SOHIDRA). Capacity was strengthened with high quality technical experts,
especially during the Original Project.
35. The Bank supervised Project implementation in all aspects (physical, social,
environmental and institutional) continuously, vigorously and with frequent deployment
of specialists. The Bank’s insistence on appropriate resettlement and on environmental
mitigation and compensation measures was crucial for successful implementation and
compliance with safeguard policies. The stronger than usual Bank involvement was
positively recognized by the Borrower and staff concerned. The Bank also provided
technical assistance where necessary, for example, on complex groundwater issues.
36. QAG “Quality of Supervision?. A Quality of Supervision Assessment was carried
out by QAG and gave an overall rating of “satisfactory? in October 2006. The assessment
results included a number of strong elements and a few shortcomings pertaining to the
quality of monitoring and evaluation (which was hampered by the original design
problem with matrix of indicators), leading to Moderately Satisfactory ratings in two
dimensions. These, however, were largely offset by the presence of an experienced and


                                            9
qualified team located in the Country Office, effective supervision of technical aspects,
excellent relations with the borrower, and tireless effort to convince an experienced and
sophisticated borrower to adopt an innovative approach to water resources management.
On balance, QAG judged the strong aspects to overshadow the shortcomings and
therefore rated the overall quality of supervision Satisfactory.

2.2.2    Factors contributing to implementation problems
37. The Original Project suffered from two serious delays: first, the difficulties in
concluding works on one of the six reservoirs (Pesqueiro), including the resettlement
activities; second, the late start of the construction of sections II and III of the Integration
Canal (in 2005, rather than in 2001 or 2002) 4. The Pesqueiro reservoir experienced the
most troubles during construction, including the implementation of its resettlement
component (agrovila) 5, due to problems with the contractor that led to the cancellation of
the contract and rebidding of the works. The bidding process for the contract of the
sections II and III of the Integration Canal also suffered delays caused by lack of
definition from the Borrower on the format of the bidding (two processes or one with two
lots) and by the failure of the prequalification process recommended by the Bank and the
need to initiate a new international bidding process later on.
38. Changes in state government in 2007 interrupted the flow of implementation,
especially during the last six months of tenure of the old Administration, when
government activities and spending are generally reduced, and again during the first six
months of the new government, as political and staff appointments and decision making
on spending are slow to occur. In this context, in 2007, SRH lost some of its capacity
with the loss of many of the staff and consultants that had worked on the Project for
many years and represented part of the institutional memory. This affected project
management and administration and certain functions of the Project, such as coordination
and supervision of the resettlement and environmental activities for each dam/reservoir.
39. The Additional Financing phase also suffered important delays that led to the non-
completion of some Project activities before the closing date. Delays related mostly to the
infrastructure component and were caused by difficulties with the timely completion of
procurement processes by SRH due to the changes in staff and the need for additional
training on Bank’s procurement guidelines; problems with some contractor’s financial
capacity that led to execution delays and one cancellation of contract; and the need of
revision of engineering designs. The AF loan was approved in December 2008, but
signed only in September 2009 and became effective in November 2009, with a closing
date of December 2011, whereby it only had an effective 2-year implementation period.
Delays in getting the AF signed were due to procedures for processing loans between the
Federal Government and the State and the need to obtain Senate approval.

  The Integration Canal consisted of five sections. The first three of them would bring water from
Castanhão reservoir to FMR and were supported by PROGERIRH. Sections IV and V continued bringing
water until Pecem Port industrial area and were completed with Government funds.
5
  The agrovila is the agricultural village that was built by the contractor to resettle the families displaced by
the construction of the reservoir.

40. At the AF Project closing, two of five dams had been completed 6, and the other three
were still under construction, as well as the six conveyance systems planned under the
Project. As of mid-December 2012, the degree of completion of the three remaining dams
was 75% for Gameleira dam, 92% for Mamoeiro dam and 96% for Jatobá dam, and
the degree of completion of the conveyance systems (pipelines) were 33% for
Ipaumirim, 42% for Itapipoca, 90% for Ipueiras, 70% for Antonina do Norte, 80%
for Madalena, and 95% for Amontada. None of the works had supervision contracts
in place as the Government decided to discontinue supervision activities through
external firms (supervision was done through SOHIDRA) although there was an
agreement with the Bank that supervision by an external firm should be carried out
throughout the whole implementation. This decision had impact in the quality of
supervision of works and environmental mitigation activities as SOHIDRA does not have
enough staff to carry out the required close supervision of all works. In addition, the
supervision firms were responsible for preparing the “as-built? reports of the dams and
pipelines, which include the actual final design of each infrastructure, which most times
differ from the original design. In mid-December 2012, the Bank carried out a
supervision mission to the State to verify the status of each work. According to the results
of the mission, it is expected that Gameleira and Jatobá dams will be fairly completed by
end-December 2012; leaving small adjustment works to be carried out in January 2013
while Mamoeiro dam completion is expected by February 2013. With regards to the
conveyance systems, it is expected that Amontada and Ipueiras pipelines will also be
completed by December 2012; leaving small adjustment works to be carried out in
January 2013. The completion of Madalena and Antonina do Norte pipelines is expected
by February 2013. With regards to Itapipoca pipeline, the Borrower has carried a new
procurement process to contract the completion of works as the original contract was
canceled due to financial problems with the contractor. The new contractor is mobilizing
resources to start the services and completion is expected by May 2013. Ipaumirim
pipeline works are paralyzed. The contractor has entered into a judicial dispute with the
implementing agency with a request to cancel the contract that has not been accepted by
the agency. Once the dispute is resolved and works are resumed, it will require an
additional six months for completion. Finally, another pending issue by mid-December
2012 refers to the 35 houses built by the Project in 2011 for the families resettled as a
result of the construction of the Umari dam. Since completion, the houses have been
presenting structural problems and the solution was to demolish and reconstruct all of
them. The original contractor is doing so at no additional cost, in groups of five houses,
and the families are being temporarily relocated into houses rented by the Government.
Due to the pending works and resettlement issues not resolved by December 2012, the
Bank will continue the supervision of these activities until completion in 2013.
41. Cost Overruns. The Original Project costs turned out to be even higher than
expected, and required a prolonged search for additional funds on the part of the
Borrower. While cost overruns may not have affected the achievement of results, they
detracted from smooth implementation of works and institutional improvements. Cost
6
 After further consideration, the Borrower decided to replace the construction of the sixth planned dam
(Trairi) with the preparation of technical, environmental and resettlement studies for another dam that was
considered of higher priority. The construction of Trairi dam was taken out of the Project scope as other
alternatives to provide water supply to the beneficiaries had been implemented.


                                                    11
increases were due in part to the final layout and design of the Integration Canal,
especially of its third reach; increase in the costs of iron used in the Canal pipes; and
overall construction costs rise. In addition, the devaluation of the Brazilian currency led
to significant inflation in the construction sector in Brazil, with price increases of 69%
between 1999 and 2004.
42. The Bank showed flexibility in mitigating cash flow problems of the State. It adjusted
the financing percentage for works for a limited time to 95% in the original Loan, while
the State secured additional funding. The Borrower secured loans from national banks in
2002-2006. In addition, the Bank’s SWAp loan to Ceará in 2004 also contributed funds to
the State’s WRM program. Finally, the State received additional federal funding for other
reservoirs and conveyance systems and for the Integration Canal. The Borrower gave
absolute priority to the Canal, minimizing expenditure that could be postponed.

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
43. The PAD contained a list of outcome and output indicators (many without targets). At
Project startup, the Borrower’s own Project Implementation Plan (PIP, April 2000)
used the PAD list and contained a large and comprehensive number of output
indicators, including baseline and annual target levels up to 2005, but not for
outcomes. The baseline and targets for most indicators included in the PAD were agreed
with the Borrower at Project start, were monitored during implementation and reported in
the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). Although the AF Project Paper did not include
a new results framework, the team agreed with the Borrower and monitored specific AF
related indicators, which were also reported in the ISRs. SRH kept detailed records of
physical and other outputs and reported them regularly to the Bank. Supervision missions
checked these reports, which were also used for this ICR.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
44. Major attention was given to the carrying out of environmental assessments and the
preparation of environmental management plans for reservoir and canal works, the
supervision and implementation of environmental management plans, the resettlement of
people displaced by the construction of reservoirs, and dam safety. SRH maintained
special units to manage resettlement and environment. Safeguard application was
thoroughly addressed and supervised by frequent Bank missions and by targeted visits
concerned with resettlement, environmental mitigation or compensation measures, and
dam safety. Although the Borrower was proactive and succeeded in dealing and
overcoming most safeguards related issues during implementation, a problem persisted in
the resettlement of the Gameleira dam and the 35 families resettled in that area in January
2001 only had access to energy and water by December 2012 despite many
recommendations and alerts given by the Bank in different supervision missions in 2011
and 2012. In addition, the poor quality of construction of the houses in the resettlement
area of Umari dam should have been identified during implementation of works. This
situation is only being resolved in December 2012, more than one year after completion
of works. Therefore, the overall safeguard compliance rated was downgraded to
Moderately Unsatisfactory. The specific aspects are detailed in Annex 10.

45. Procurement and Financial Management. There were no major issues of
compliance with Bank procurement rules and procedures. The project had a large number
of procurement processes and 3 agencies, SRH, SOHIDRA and COGERH were involved
in the preparation and implementation of the procurement activities. SRH had a key role
in the procurement of works, goods, consulting and non-consulting services, with the
responsibility of planning and monitoring the procurement processes, preparation of
documents. All this work was done with the inputs (technical specifications/ terms of
reference) provided from the respective technical departments. SRH rapidly responded to
the Bank recommendation to strengthen its capacity, hiring a procurement specialist for
the overall duration of the project and in 2008 one staff of the State General Attorney
Office (PGE) was relocated to the SRH to help out with the procurement workload.
46. Project financial management was considered to be moderately satisfactory
throughout project implementation. The project had several shortcomings related to the
submission of the quarterly financial monitoring reports (IFRs) during FY11. Errors and
inconsistencies in the IFRs were found during supervision, which together with non-
compliance regarding the use of an automated FMIS (Financial Management Information
System) to monitor and generate the IFRs, led to the temporary downgrade of the
project's FM rating. These issues were eventually addressed properly by the client. The
FMIS was integrated with the state's accounting systems, in accordance with the Bank's
guideline regarding use of country systems. Outcome and financial controls of the project
were not impacted. Annual audit reports for the Project were submitted regularly, with
unqualified opinions by the external auditor on the project's financial statements.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
47. At the closing date (Dec. 2011), six reservoirs built under the first phase and two of
the five reservoirs planned under the AF had been completed, while three reservoirs
remained under construction. In addition, all six pipelines planned under the AF were
under construction. It was agreed between the Borrower and the Bank that the
Government would finance the completion of all pending works during 2012 with the
continued supervision of the Bank team. By mid-December 2012, none of the pending
works had been completed yet but the Government remained committed to
complete part of them by end December 2012 and the remaining ones by May 2013.
48. No follow-up actions are planned by SRH to expand and mainstream the soil and
moisture conservation efforts started under the watershed pilot. However, some lessons
have been incorporated in other Government initiatives in other sectors. As evidenced by
the state-wide mobilization around water through the “Pacto das ?guas? (2009) and
building on the environmental diagnoses of strategic reservoir made by COGERH under
the AF, the state has become more aware of the water quality and sources of pollution in
the reservoirs. Going forward, more attention will need to be given to water quality issues,
including through a more integrated planning of land and water use at the basin level and
broader intersectoral coordination. The closing workshop of PROGERIRH made clear
the state’s awareness of the water quality challenges as reflected in Annex 6. The
proposed new Bank Project 7 for Ceará State includes further funding from the Bank for

7
    Program for Results (PforR) operation being prepared with the State including three different sectors.


                                                       13
the water resources and water supply and sanitation sectors with an integrated plan for
water quality related policies and investment activities.
49. The Ceará Government is now working on the design of one of the largest water
infrastructure projects planned in the State and even in the Northeast: the Ceará Water
Belt (Cinturão das ?guas), conceived as a gravity-fed conveyance system of
approximately 1,300 km length and flow rate of 30 m3/s, which is planned to use water
from the São Francisco River Inter-Basin Transfer Project. The Ceará Water Belt is being
conceived to attend 100% of all water demands for human consumption, industrial,
tourism and irrigation by 2040.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
50. The project development objective remains consistent with the current Country
Partnership Strategy (2012-2015 8) and its strategic objectives, in particular, in view of its
contribution to regional development of the semi-arid Northeast through strategic water
infrastructure investments, expansion of water supply to poor and urban households and
increase climatic resilience. Project objectives are also relevant with regard to current
priorities of the Brazilian Government, such as inclusive growth and reduction of poverty,
with emphasis on the Northeast (semiarid) region. The importance of water for both
economic development and reduction of poverty in Ceará state will grow, even more so
in the light of expected impacts related to increased climate variability.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives
51. Project achievements were crucially important to the development and consolidation
of the water resources sector in the State of Ceará, which is today considered as best
practice in the country. The institutional strengthening achieved and the water resources
management instruments implemented and improved have been remarkable. At the same
time, the construction of the Integration Canal with reliable provision of water to the
Fortaleza Metropolitan Region and to the development of the state’s industrial park at
Pecém Port have had significant positive impact and taken the State to the next level of
development. In that context, some of the achievements were actually “highly
satisfactory?, however, they have been downgraded to “satisfactory? due to the delays in
implementation. If only the Original Project achievements were considered in this ICR,
the Project would be considered Satisfactory. However, due to the non-completion of
works under the Additional Financing by December 2012, the long time it took to address
resettlement issues at Gameleira dam, and the delays in addressing the problems with
resettlement houses in Umari dam area, the overall project outcome has been rated as
“moderately unsatisfactory? (MU). Given the economic, social and political importance
of water issues in Ceará, there is no doubt that all pending works will be successfully
completed and will fulfill their intended development and poverty reduction objectives.
However, for the purposes of this ICR, they have not been fully achieved yet.

52. The achievement of the PDO is evaluated against its three main dimensions: (A)
Increase the sustainable water supply for multiple uses, improve the efficiency of Ceará’s
integrated WRM system and decrease vulnerability of poor populations to cyclical
drought. (B) Stimulate multiple use, efficient and shared management of Ceará’s water
resources. (C) Promote the improved management of soil and vegetation in tributary
watersheds to enhance water conservation, minimize erosion and maximize natural water
storage mechanisms, through the adequate management of critical micro-basins and
groundwater resources. These will be discussed individually below, together with the
pertinent indicators included in the Results Frameworks of the PAD.
A. Increase the sustainable water supply for multiple uses, improve the efficiency of
Ceará’s integrated WRM system and decrease vulnerability of poor populations to
cyclical drought. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
53. This objective refers to the ability of COGERH to supply more water more reliably
from new and rehabilitated reservoirs and pipelines, and, mainly through a new river
basin transfer, from the existing Castanhão reservoir to the FMR through the Integration
Canal. It also refers to the financial sustainability of COGERH’s operations. The
objective was largely achieved in urban areas but not in rural areas because of the
significant delays in the construction of reservoirs and pipelines during the AF
phase. The MU rating is the result of the accumulated delays in the completion of works,
whereby by Project closure (including a six-month extension of the ICR) two dams and
six pipelines had still not been fully completed. While these works will be completed and
the expected benefits will be sustainably materialized, within the context of this ICR,
those outcomes and benefits are not yet achieved.
54. Outcome - Increase in the volume of bulk water distributed by COGERH: As a
result of the Project, the regulated bulk water supply increased 152%, from 6.92 m3/s in
2000 (baseline) to 17.45 m3/s in 2011 9 . The increase contemplates the operation of
sections I, II and III of the Integration Canal, from Castanhão reservoir to FMR. The six
pipelines that had their construction initiated by the AF 10 will represent, when completed,
another 0.25 m3/sec of bulk water distributed by COGERH. About 76% of the total
volume went to urban/human consumption, 18% to irrigation, 4% to fish and shrimp
farming, and 2% to industrial use. Most of this supply was subject to water charges
(except some public irrigation schemes and most irrigators that have not yet been
awarded water rights). The increase also includes the supply to the FMR, guaranteed in
great part through the new Integration Canal. Since the Original Project was prepared, the
FMR population has increased from 2.2 million to 3.4 million. The Canal has permitted
to meet this rapidly growing demand and avoid even worse droughts than in the past.



9
  The total increase was larger, but included contributions from reservoirs not financed under this project.
The medium bulk water release in 2011 from all 136 reservoirs managed by COGERH amounted to 47.3
m3/sec.
10
   Two of them will be completed by December 2012; another two are expected for completion by February
2013 and one by May 2013. The sixth one is 33% completed by mid-December 2012 but the works are
paralyzed as the contractor has entered into a judicial dispute with the implementing agency with a request
to cancel the contract that has not been accepted by the agency. Once the dispute is resolved and works are
resumed, it will require an additional six months for completion.


                                                    15
55. Outcome – Increase in the recovery of fixed/variable costs of the integrated
system. In less than 20 years, COGERH evolved from being highly subsidized to
recovering 100% of its O&M costs as evidenced by 2011 figures. In 2011, COGERH had
operating revenues of US$18.9 million, and operating costs of US$20.1 million, covering
the difference from financial revenues and ending with a pre-tax profit of US$438,600.
The investment cost of the hydraulic infrastructures receives financial support from the
Government treasury. Cost recovery evolved over time and was achieved by COGERH
with the support of studies to define the costs of supplying bulk water by major system
and by user sector, communication campaigns, and central Government support to an
adequate tariff strategy. Compared to other water resources management entities in Brazil
and even at the global level, COGERH’s financial autonomy is remarkable.
56. Outcome – Increase in the level of guarantee of water supply. The water supply
guarantee level was increased through the establishment of additional reservoir capacity
of 370 million m3 with the construction of eight strategic dams and reservoirs (six under
the first phase and two under AF). This increase will be complemented with an additional
70 million m3 after the other three reservoirs being implemented under the AF are
completed by end December 2012. This is taken as the incremental reservoir storage and
incremental regulated release capacity. The incremental reservoir capacity guarantees
water supply during the annual dry seasons and drought periods. The eight new reservoirs
already completed are capable of delivering a regulated discharge of 2.77 m3 per second
to users in the interior of the State, benefitting an estimated population of 250,000.
However, due to the delays in the completion of the six pipelines under the Additional
Financing, an additional 140,000 intended beneficiaries are still waiting for the
completion of the works.
57. In addition, the Integration Canal plays a major role in delivering water supply to the
FMR from the Castanhão reservoir. Water supply to the FMR is thus guaranteed
during drought periods, as evidenced during the 2012 drought, which was the worst
of the last four decades. The water delivered to FMR is currently, on purpose, restricted
by the capacity of one siphon (11 m3/s), but could readily be doubled, when demand
requires, by building an additional siphon.
58. No specific indicator had been included in the PAD directly linked to the objective of
decreasing vulnerability of poor populations to cyclical drought, however, the Project
included activities that led to its achievement. The reservoirs built under the Project
increase the availability of a dependable water supply, across drought periods, to the
population near the reservoir and downstream of each dam, particularly to urban
population in towns of the State’s interior served by pipelines, estimated overall at about
300,000 11 people. Both rural and urban populations in the interior include a significant
segment of extremely poor families (households with monthly per capita income less than
R$70 in 2010), ranging from 15% to 47% 12 . A conservative estimate is now that
vulnerability to cyclical drought has decreased for at least 45,000 extremely poor
people in the interior. The largest component of the project, the Integration Canal,
assures water supply during drought periods to the FMR, with a population
11
  250,000 from the first six reservoirs, 49,600 from two reservoirs and conveyance pipelines under AF.

estimated as 3.6 million, of which an estimated 6-10% are extremely poor people,
resulting in at least 210,000 extremely poor people benefited.
59. Outcome - Increase in the number of users with stable and guaranteed access to
water for multiple uses. COGERH has been able to increase the number of paying bulk
water users from 116 in 2000 to 380 in 2011, and total invoicing of water charges from
R$8 million in 2000 to R$42.0 million in 2011. Such users include the largest client, the
urban water company CAGECE. The sectoral coverage of water users was increased in
2010 to include also irrigation, fish and shrimp farming and bottling of water. At least
one large public irrigation system has already become a paying user of bulk water
(Tabuleiro das Russas).
60. The Project achieved the implementation of new and improved water resources
management tools through strengthened WRM institutions. Under the Project, the State
Cadaster of Water Users laid the foundations for higher efficiency, achieved with more
consistent implementation of water permits and charges. Management tools were not
necessarily new, but they had not been implemented widely before the Project. Apart
from the strengthening of the principal WRM institutions (SRH and COGERH), the
project was instrumental in proposing and implementing water tariffs for all sectors, in
collecting water charges, in making available real-time data for reservoir management, in
effective operation and maintenance of a larger network of reservoirs and conveyance
structures, in implementing a dam safety policy and procedures, screening and ranking of
new hydraulic projects for their technical, economic and environmental viability, and in
monitoring groundwater resources and starting to control their use.
61. SRH, jointly with COGERH, has registered about 15,500 water users in the State
Cadastre of Water Users under this Project, up from about 4,600 in 2003. Within that
universe, about 6,200 water right awards had been issued by SRH by March 2010 13 .
Registration of users and uses is a first condition for efficient allocation and for charging
for water. Some 47% of the estimated actual water use by large irrigators is reported to
have been made under water rights awarded by SRH (but not necessarily charged for).
Charging for water use in Ceará had begun in 1996, but only for urban water supply and
industrial use. The coverage of charges was expanded in 2010 to other sectors, such as
irrigation, fish and shrimp culture. Through the Project, new proposals for the structure of
water tariffs were developed, and adopted after extensive discussions and negotiations
with user representatives and basin committees, and through a work group of the State
Water Resources Council. The proposals were based on an analysis of the capacity to pay
of typical users, but also on the need to cover the O&M cost of COGERH. Only users
consuming more than 1.44 m3/month are subject to water charges. By 2011, there were
about 380 paying users, including all large clients, such as the Ceará Water and Sewerage
Company, CAGECE. Users are invoiced by COGERH and all revenue stays within
COGERH.
62. Under the current tariff structure, the price of water varies among sectors. Industry is
charged most heavily (from R$0.432 to R$1.485/m3), followed by the water supply
company CAGECE that provides water to the FMR (R$0.099) and fish and shrimp
culture (from R$0.003 to R$0.036). Charges for irrigation use are the lowest, varying

     COGERH prepares the issue of water rights for issue by SRH.


                                                    17
from R$0.001 to R$0.013/m3. Until 2016, irrigation water tariffs are further reduced by
rebates. This reflects a political and cultural reality in the state, in which water for
irrigation has traditionally been considered a free good and where irrigation users carry a
large political weight.
63. The Loan Agreement called for a pilot to try market-based allocation of water rights.
Such pilot was not implemented due to legal impediments in the Brazilian law. Water
rights in Brazil, and thus also in Ceará, are not allocated to the highest bidder and cannot
be transferred by the designated right holder to another user.
64. The Project created a network of 70 automated data collection and transmission
platforms for hydro-meteorological data over the entire State and installed remote
monitoring of water levels in 125 of 136 strategic reservoirs, allowing more efficient
reservoir operation. This includes management for flood mitigation in the large Jaguaribe
basin. These platforms were transferred for operation by the Ceará Meteorological
Foundation (FUNCEME). COGERH publishes on its website current data for reservoir
levels and rainfall in the state, thanks to a very strong collaboration with FUNCEME.
65. The State Secretariat for Water Resources (SRH) was strengthened as key entity
responsible for water resources policy and management. SRH developed the capacity to
oversee and coordinate the executing parts of the WRM system (COGERH and
SOHIDRA), to create an effective interface to basin water committees, to lead water
resources planning and to fulfill its functions in allocating water rights to bulk users.
However, this capacity has diminished to a certain extent since 2007, when many staff
and consultants left SRH. Since then, SRH was able to hire a few temporary staff but no
permanent hiring has been authorized by the State Government. The State Water
Resources Plan was updated in 2005, but not thereafter. In 2009, the “Pacto das ?guas?
(Water Pact) was prepared under the leadership of the State Assembly with participation
of different sectors, institutions and civil society. This document presents an updated
State approach to dealing with water related issues.
66. The most significant institutional success of the Project has been the strengthening of
COGERH, the state agency responsible for bulk water operation. COGERH expanded
and trained its staff and improved its operational instruments and decision support
systems, with the support and collaboration of other entities like the Ceará
Meteorological Foundation (FUNCEME), which also benefited from the Project. It also
increased the real-time data available for reservoir and canal operations, generated
internal rules and guidelines for operation and maintenance of water infrastructure, and
increased dam safety. The agency has also become financially autonomous with the
growing income from water charges.
67. COGERH monitors and operates 136 strategic reservoirs built by both the State
and the Federal Government, with about 18.3 billion m3 of storage, up from 117
reservoirs and 10.5 billion m3 of storage in 2001. The Project has increased dam safety
in the state as a permanent feature of design, operation and maintenance of hydraulic
structures, not only because of Bank safeguard requirements. In addition, COGERH has
produced and is implementing effective operation and maintenance plans for its large
hydraulic systems (reservoirs and canals), including the Integration Canal.




                                            18
68. The selection of new hydraulic structures to be built is part of efficient water
management. The Project has applied careful screening of new dam projects with regard
to economic viability, environmental impacts and resettlement requirements and costs,
and this practice has become routine in water resource investment planning in the state.
B. Stimulate multiple use, efficient and shared management of Ceará’s water
resources. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
69. Shared, decentralized water management is a feature of both the Brazilian water
resource legislation and that of Ceará. It has been pioneered effectively and
comprehensively in Ceará, in large part under this Project, as a key element of the State
Integrated WRM System (SIGERH).
70. Outcome - Increase in the number of people participating in river basin
committees and water user associations. The Project has promoted the installation of
nine, with 494 member institutions with 2 representatives each, out of the twelve Water
Basin Committees, covering now all of the state of Ceará. Furthermore, since 2007, the
State replaced the previously existing Water Users Associations into the new form of
Water Management Commissions, each linked to a major reservoir. There are now 44
formal Commissions, in addition to 34 informal local commissions that will over time be
converted to formal Commissions. Members in Committees and Commissions represent
water users, organized civil society, and local, state and federal government. The Project
has given strong support for the mobilization, organization, training and logistics of the
committees.
71. Basin committees and Management Commissions play an active role in the annual
allocation of water, and in related decisions regarding maximum and minimum discharge
from a basin’s reservoir. The deliberations are informed by data and forecasts provided
by COGERH and FUNCEME. The committees and commissions participate in conflict
resolution and in disseminating their decisions. The commissions also have
responsibilities in terms of environmental surveillance, water quality control, reporting of
illegal activities in the reservoir (such as illegal fishing, or illegal logging in the river
beds). Shared management of water at the basin and reservoir level is expected to have
contributed to a more socially efficient (equitable) allocation and use of water. It has also
broken the de-facto monopoly use of water of certain large users in some basins.
72. Outcome - decrease in the physical waste of water: The Project did not have any
intervention specifically related to reducing bulk water losses and their measurement.
However, water loss was measured at 6% (compared to 30% at baseline) in one industrial
supply system of the FMR, where COGERH implemented metering system in 2011. At
the same time, CAGECE has shown reduction of potable water losses rates significantly
higher than originally expected. CAGECE actual water losses in 2011 for four systems,
Catu, Carmina, Malcozinhado, and FMR, were measured at 12%, 10%, 11%, 20%,
respectively; well below the expected losses rate of 25%, 25%, 25%, 65%.
73. Outcome - Increase in use efficiency through new technologies and increase in
productivity of water by sectors that use water as raw material. The Project did not
have any intervention providing new technologies to specific sectors (e.g. irrigation) to
increase water use efficiency or water productivity. Accordingly, efficiency of water use
as sectoral output per unit of water was not measured. However, use efficiency is


                                             19
expected to have increased as a consequence of user registry, issuing of water rights and
charging for bulk water use.
C. Improved management of soils in watersheds. Rating: Satisfactory (S)
74. Outcome – Decrease in erosion and increase in vegetated soil. This component
and its associated indicators are related to four specific pilot projects, through which
the Project would develop intervention methodologies for subsequent ex-project
replication and scale-up. The Project successfully implemented the four pilot projects to
introduce and test soil and moisture conservation, by building underground dams, terrace
systems, and recovery of riverine vegetation by local communities, in four micro-
watersheds.
75. Overall, the four pilots were successful in preventing a scenario of further soil and
water loss from inappropriate land use practices, at least in parts of the watersheds. The
essential outcome of the pilots were the lessons learned from their implementation, in
terms of viable technologies, need for public sector support, community mobilization and
participation, and costs. Successful, replicable practices have been amply documented
in seven concise primers, and the findings of scientific monitoring have been
published in six papers and six books, including an evaluation of the socio-economic
process and its results. The replication and scale-up of the methodologies developed
will contribute to decreasing erosion and increasing vegetation state-wide. However, the
results could only be monitored and reported in numbers for one of the pilot areas. The
other micro-watersheds were rolled out later and given the time needed for those physical
processes (erosion reduction, vegetated soil increase), these results could not be
monitored quantitatively but the process by which the pilots were implemented has been
validated by the Project team and beneficiaries. The results produced by the pilots are the
following:
                              Actions                                        Results
Number of successive sediment retaining dams constructed                           3.332
Number of underground dams constructed                                                 27

Recovery of degraded areas                                                  5,23 hectares

76. The Project has strengthened cooperation among institutions and stakeholders on
groundwater management within the State and also between Ceará and the neighboring
State of Rio Grande do Norte. It has generated knowledge about important groundwater



                                            20
aquifers in the state, in the coastal region (particularly in the FMR), in the Cariri region
(important for urban water supply), and for the Apodi aquifer (important for irrigation)
located at the boundary with Rio Grande Norte. Knowing the characteristics of these
aquifers in terms of quantity, quality, recharge and safe yield, monitoring their behavior,
having registered existing wells and involvement of groundwater users in the process
permits more effective, efficient and participatory management of the aquifers, including
future conjunctive use. It also helps to preserve the aquifers’ buffering capacity, thus
increasing resilience during prolonged drought. The development of effective
groundwater management plans based on increased knowledge and continuous
monitoring is a challenge ahead.

3.3 Project Efficiency
77. Most Project activities have been completed and achieved the desired outcomes
overall by December 2012. Part of the outcomes will be achieved with some delay as a
result of the delays in the completion of the dams and pipelines under the AF diminishing
Project efficiency accordingly.
78. Economic analysis ex-post. The economic analysis of selected new reservoirs and of
the hydraulic works for the water supply to the FMR was repeated with actual data,
following the same methodology used as at appraisal. Costs included capital costs, O&M
costs, resettlement, environmental compensation, and water treatment costs for urban
water supply. Benefits were estimated based on two types of use: human/urban water
supply and industrial water supply 14 . The economic rates of return (ERR) on three
strategic reservoirs in the PAD ranged from 13% to 15%, and for the same reservoirs
ranged ex-post from 7% to 15%. The investments in the Fortaleza Metropolitan Region
(FMR), including the Integration Canal, the Aracoiaba Reservoir, the Worker’s Canal,
and rehabilitation works, show an ERR of 13%, compared to the appraisal estimate of
16%. For the project as a whole (94% of project cost), excluding the investments in
institutional strengthening and policy reform, the ex-post ERR is 11%, compared to the
appraisal estimate of 14%. The reason for the differences between appraisal and the ex-
post analysis is mainly due to the higher than anticipated costs, both investment and
O&M costs. Details of the analysis are given in Annex 3.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
79. Overall outcome rating of the Project is “moderately unsatisfactory?, in line with the
ratings for the achievement of the three main dimensions of the PDO discussed above.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
80. All of the outcomes of the project were actually intended. The poverty impact could
not be ascertained with precision, but is expected to have been highly significant for at
least a quarter million of poor and extremely poor people by sparing them from the
impacts of severe periodic droughts. It is expected that this might reduce migration from
rural to metropolitan urban areas, and stimulate population growth of medium-size urban


14
     Irrigation was not included as it was not relevant at the three reservoirs analyzed.


                                                         21
centers in the interior.   All of the institutional strengthening under the Project was
included in the design.
81. The outcome and lessons learned from the watershed management pilots could be
quite significant as a basis for poverty reduction on a larger scale in rural areas of the
entire Brazilian Northeast. That would require new institutional channels for replication
and scale-up of the methodologies adopted and “lessons learned?.
82. The construction of sections I, II and III of the Integration Canal was intended to
provide reliable water supply to Fortaleza Metropolitan Region, which was achieved. At
the same time, it allowed for the completion of the infrastructure by the State with the
construction of sections IV and V until Pecém Port and its industrial area. The Integration
Canal has become one of the main vectors for the economic development of the State
providing guaranteed water from Castanhão reservoir. It is also the main infrastructure of
the State that will allow for the adequate and immediate use of the additional water being
transferred from the São Francisco river basin that is expected to reach the State in 2013.

3.6   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
83. A workshop called by the State Government to assess and discuss the outcomes of the
PROGERIRH project was held in March 2012 in Fortaleza. Participants included
government officials involved in the water sector, current and former project staff,
university professors, and representatives of river basin committees. The meeting was
helpful in highlighting the achievements of the Project, as well as the historical context
and precedents. All participants were highly appreciative of Project results and impacts,
and deplored the end of a period considered as extremely positive for WRM development
in Ceará. The rather intensive role of the Bank in the Project was mentioned as an
important factor of success. The workshop was also useful in defining the challenges the
State now faces, such as guaranteeing the quality of reservoir water though integration
and coordination with other State policies, the need to promote watershed soil and water
conservation more broadly, and the need to serve dispersed rural inhabitants not yet
served by medium and large reservoirs.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate (M)
84. The key elements of water management that were strengthened under the Project –
user registration, allocation of water rights, charging for bulk water and participatory
basin and reservoir management – are not under any significant threat. Collection of
water charges has shown a vigorous upward trend, and is increasingly accepted by the
stakeholders as a necessary means of managing scarce water resources. At the same time,
the strengthening of the river basin committees will have to be taken over by COGERH
after twelve years of continued support by the Project. This will represent a new
challenge to incorporate the costs and ensure adequate assistance to the committees. In
addition, the operation and maintenance of the hydro-meteorological network currently
under the responsibility of FUNCEME is not guaranteed. Coordination efforts between
COGERH and FUNCEME should be made to ensure the adequate funding of the network.




                                            22
85. The risk of poor maintenance of the new reservoirs and conveyance systems is
deemed low. Maintenance of hydraulic structures is one of the main functions of
COGERH and for which it collects adequate revenue. Maintenance is not dependent on
Government budget allocations. Failure of maintenance, particularly of the reservoirs
and the Integration Canal, would quickly trigger complaints from basin committees and
management commissions, creating extreme political pressure on COGERH to perform
well.
86. There is, however, a new important risk to the strategic reservoirs (not only to those
built under the Project): deterioration of water quality through eutrophication as a
result of human activity is becoming an increasing threat. Eutrophication is a
consequence of untreated waste water effluents released into rivers and reservoirs, runoff
of fertilizers used in agriculture, of cattle dung washed into reservoirs, and also of fish
culture. It is compounded by the fact the water turnover rate of reservoirs is relatively low
in the semi-arid climate. Recognizing these new challenges, the Government has
approached the Bank to formulate and implement water quality related policies and
investment activities, through a closer coordination of sector policies (urban development,
sanitation, agriculture and water resources) in the State 15.
87. Although the construction of three dams and six pipelines was not completed by mid-
December 2012, the risk of non-completion by the Government in 2013 is very low.
These are priority infrastructure works to the State, and their completion is particularly
urgent in the context of the current very dry season and the expectation of increased
droughts related to climate change. The adequate and reliable availability of water in the
State is an unquestioned and absolute economic, social and political priority.
88. A further threat is the sedimentation of reservoirs from erosive processes in the
watersheds, which will eventually reduce live storage and thus the useful life of
reservoirs. However, awareness of this threat still appears to be low. The PRODHAM
watershed conservation pilot has been crucial in demonstrating feasibility of erosion
control and soil moisture conservation by small farmers, but there is as yet no apparent
program or a capable agency to mainstream the pilot results widely. This requires some
new Government initiative.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1      Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Satisfactory (S)
89. The Project was consistent with the Government and the Bank priorities because of
the importance of sound management and safe access to water in the State of Ceará. At
the same time, it built on an existing and evolving program for development of the state
water sector. QAG rated quality at entry as satisfactory. The background work for
preparation was sound and the lessons learned from earlier Bank financed projects
supporting Ceará’s water sector were adequately taken into consideration. Criticism on
the design was related to: (i) the lack of operational outcome indicators which were not
quantified in terms of baseline and target values (although this was common practice at

15
     Program for Results (PforR) operation being prepared with the State including three different sectors.


                                                       23
the time as evidenced by QAG’s quality of entry satisfactory rating), and (ii) the overall
cost estimate. Otherwise, all relevant aspects were adequately covered: technical, social/
resettlement, environmental, procurement, financial management and economic and
financial viability.
(b) Quality of Supervision. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
90. Bank supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank team supported effective
implementation through regular and appropriate supervision missions towards the
achievement of development outcomes. The supervision effort of the Bank over about
twelve years was strong, continuous and comprehensive. There were at least forty-five
full supervision missions and technical visits to cover specific components. Each full
supervision mission went through all pertinent technical, fiduciary, social and
environment aspects and recorded needs for action by the Borrower and implementing
agencies in the Aide Memoire. The Bank team could have been more proactive in
restructuring the Project to revise its results framework and formally include the correct
and agreed baseline and target information. However, baselines and targets were
promptly agreed with the Borrower at implementation start and monitored throughout the
Project life, including reporting in ISRs.
91. During the original Project, when funding difficulties threatened to impact
performance, the Bank was flexible in adjusting financing percentages and reallocating
the loan proceeds, and helped mitigate the fund shortage through SWAp loans to the state
and to a certain extent also through the PROAGUA loan. In addition, the Bank provided
substantial Additional Financing to increase the scope of the Project. With the delays in
the AF, several works remained incomplete at closing date; the Bank then obtained an
agreement from the Borrower that all unfinished work would be concluded with State
funds by 2012, and the Bank continued to supervise that implementation throughout 2012
and will continue supervising the implementation until completion of all works as some
of these works will only be completed in 2013.
92. Despite the strong and continued supervision support provided by the Bank team,
which would justify a “satisfactory? rating, the Quality of Supervision is being rated as
“moderately satisfactory? for two main reasons: (i) the Bank’s assumption (based on the
client’s good track record both in the implementation of water projects and in other Bank
operations) that the Borrower would complete the works relatively early after Project
closure, proved unjustified, in view of the fact that several works are still unfinished one
year after closing date, and (ii) the last ISR prepared before the closing date in December
2011 too optimistically rated the achievement of the PDO as “moderately satisfactory?
even though only two dams, out of five, and none of the six pipelines had been completed
by then.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory (MS)
93. The overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory, in line with the
same ratings for quality at entry and supervision.

5.2   Borrower Performance



                                            24
(a) Government Performance. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
94. The performance of the Government of the State of Ceará is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. It strongly supported the Project during preparation phase and most of the
implementation. During implementation, it gave priority to the completion of major
infrastructure works under the Original Project, notably the Integration Canal, and
provided the necessary support to a continuous strengthening of Ceará’s institutional
framework for WRM (especially COGERH), which is now considered as one of the best
institutional set-ups for WRM in Brazil.
95. However, the State Government has shown a lack of pro-active handling of several
non-performing works contracts of dams and pipelines, especially during the AF phase of
the Project. This led to severe delays in construction and compliance with both social and
environmental safeguards. This is partly related to the fact that from 2007 onwards, the
Government was not able to retain many experienced and dedicated technical staff and
consultants, mainly in SRH and SOHIDRA as most of them left to the heated private
sector or other Government institutions, thus causing a decline in the technical follow-up
of the Project by the Implementing Agency. Also, the Government did not open new job
vacancies and adequately staff SRH and SOHIDRA with permanent personnel, which
was only achieved for COGERH. Finally, the State Government was not always effective
in guaranteeing the timely collaboration of other state agencies, such as the
Environmental Secretariat or the Land Institute, although eventually these agencies
performed their part in environmental compensation and mitigation, as well as in land
titling to the resettled population.
96. In addition, under the Additional Financing phase, the Government was not able to
achieve the results agreed with the Bank for completion of all works during 2012.
Although delays in the execution of works are partially related to financial problems with
contractors, several delays in contract execution relate to inadequate allocation of funds
to these contracts after the closing date. In addition, the Government has also decided to
stop the external supervision of works activities by a contracted firm. Instead, it decided
to continue supervision of works via the State superintendence responsible for
surveillance of contractors’ performance (SOHIDRA), which is not adequately staffed to
perform the necessary supervision required by the Project. Finally, the long delay in
providing a permanent solution to the energy and water supply of the resettlement area of
Gameleira dam could have been avoided by a stronger action from the Government side
to resolve the problem. In that area, 35 resettled families only in December 2012 received
access to energy and water despite many recommendations and alerts given by the Bank
in different supervision missions in 2011 and 2012.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. Rating: Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU)
97. The main Implementing Agency was SRH. COGERH and SOHIDRA executed
specific parts of the Project as delegated by SRH. FUNCEME was responsible for few
activities during the first years of the original Project. The implementing agency overall
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU). On the one hand, SRH carried out
its planning, implementation and policy functions adequately, especially in the first phase
of the Project. It established and maintained special units to implement the watershed


                                            25
conservation pilot, to coordinate the environmental mitigation and compensation
activities and to carry out resettlement. The effort of SRH to implement resettlement in
accordance with Bank rules within the Brazilian legal context (which does not have a
resettlement law) is commendable.
98. On the other hand, especially during the AF, its action was characterized by several
deficiencies, such as insufficient action on delays in construction work, and inadequate
attention to resettlement and environmental mitigation works. This occurred because the
supervision capacity of the SRH was not strong enough (particularly in the later years)
and SOHIDRA was not adequately staffed or its staff were not well trained in supervising
environmental and social aspects in contractors’ work. As a result, the effectiveness of
SRH and SOHIDRA in supervising and enforcing environmental safeguards and contract
clauses vis-à-vis the contractors was not satisfactory and has contributed to the non-
achievement of most AF infrastructure related results.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU)
99. The overall Borrower performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory, in line with
the ratings for Government and Implementing Agency performance discussed above.

6. Lessons Learned
100. The Government of Ceará has continuously expanded and reinforced its water
system over the last decade, in great part through the Project. This involved not only
expansion of infrastructure but also improvements in management and user participation.
By doing so, it has connected more people and more uses to the system and increased
their level of guarantee of water supply. This tendency will continue with the arrival of
the water from the São Francisco River Inter-Basin Transfer Project to the state of Ceará.
101. Ceará’s institutional model separating planning and policy formulation from
implementation of water resources instruments with financial sustainability is
relevant for other states of northeast Brazil that are faced with similar WRM
challenges and could be adapted to their specific contexts. The state of Ceará has put
very significant efforts over the last decade to consolidate and strengthen its institutional
set-up for water resources planning and operation and maintenance of its key water
infrastructure. By implementing improved policy and management tools, such as permit
and tariff policies, it achieved the objective of financial sustainability of COGERH.
Therefore, Ceará is arguably the best prepared state of the Northeast to receive the water
of the São Francisco River Inter-Basin Transfer Project and address its associated
financial and operational challenges.
102. A strong political will is needed to integrate institutions around water
resources management. Ceará still has a lot to achieve in this area, as evidenced by the
case of the PRODHAM pilot, which brings together different aspects of water
management. This pilot, although widely recognized as a success story in terms of
environmental management, farmers’ participation and income generation, has hitherto
not been scaled up for lack of institutionalization of its model. More broadly, the state
needs to further develop institutional capacity to formulate and implement water
resources policies in conjunction with different entities (e.g. agriculture, tourism, urban


                                             26
development, industry etc.), especially to address the critical water quality challenges, but
also to address challenges related to dam safety, which require strong inter-sectoral
collaboration mechanisms.
103. Participatory, decentralized WRM at the river basin level is key for
achievement of improved management of resources. Firstly, the decentralized support
by COGERH, through its eight regional offices, undoubtedly contributed to consolidating
and strengthening the water allocation process by the River Basin Committees. Secondly,
the strong collaboration between Ceará’s Meteorological Foundation (FUNCEME) and
COGERH greatly facilitated the use of climate and hydrology forecasts into this
allocation process. Looking forward, and considering the expected changes in
precipitation and temperature from climate variability and change, these processes will
likely be challenged by changes in terms of water availability and water demand. It is,
therefore, important that the state considers those possible impacts at different time scales,
and explores options to increase the flexibility and adaptive capacity of its institutional
and legal framework, and infrastructure, to address them.
104. More attention needs to be given early on to water quality issues; water volume
and quality are inextricably linked. In Ceará, reservoirs have been constructed
historically to deal with recurrent droughts and assure adequate water quantity, with little
or no water quality management objectives. Likewise, the design of Bank financed
projects in the water sector did not include specific water quality related objectives. Yet,
increased influxes of pollutants, combined with fluctuations in water volume, have
contributed to a degradation of the water quality in key reservoirs throughout the state.
As water levels fall particularly during droughts, conditions may reach a highly eutrophic
state and water becomes unusable precisely when it is most needed. It is recommended
that future interventions in Ceará and similar states in the semi-arid northeast consider
water quality improvement objectives and interventions to be adopted among sector
agencies (e.g. water supply and sanitation, urban development, agriculture, among others)
combined with local participatory strategies at the watershed level.
105. In the context of Ceará, it was the right choice to incorporate environmental (e.g.
clearing of reservoir areas) and resettlement actions (e.g. construction of agrovilas for
people displaced by the construction of reservoirs) in the work contracts. However,
effective compliance with these safeguards requires: (i) intensive training of
implementing agencies staff on Bank’s safeguard policies, on the content of
environmental management plans and on the equivalency of these to local, state and
federal requirements, (ii) a well-trained, specialized professional team for planning and
supervising environmental mitigation actions, (iii) training of contractor staff in the
requirements of environmental action plans before the start of construction and (iv) an
effective communication strategy that shares the benefits of the Project with the local
affected population and the importance of complying with environmental requirements
with the contractors.
106. Resettlement should provide more than one option for rehabilitation of
families (as was the case with irrigated plots in agrovilas) and involve them in the
choice of the most suitable alternative. Also, to ensure that agrovilas are sustainable
after the end of the Project and the departure of the Implementing Agency, it is important



                                             27
that the state establishes clear institutional arrangements, including with the local
governments, regarding access to basic social and infrastructure services.
107. Intensive Bank involvement in supervision of resettlement and environmental
safeguards is indispensable, as effective Borrower attention to these aspects is often
limited, particularly where civil society organizations are scarce or absent in representing
or safeguarding the interests of displaced persons and of the environment. While Ceará
has made considerable improvements incorporating social and environmental safeguards
in the planning of projects, it is important to further strengthen civil society and stimulate
its demand for compliance with such safeguards, as a matter of good governance and
sustainability of these institutional achievements.
108. Innovation processes like the ones achieved in Ceará’s water sector, require
long term vision and political commitment, financial stability and institutional
strength. To support a state like Ceará in those long-term processes and for such large
combined infrastructure and institutions focused-projects, the Bank needs to invest in a
long term vision and take risks, which it has been able to do with this Project, leading to
very important development outcomes.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
109. The draft ICR was submitted to the counterparts for comments on December 9,
2012. The Borrower’s implementing agency, SRH presented their comments to the draft
report through the letter OF. GS. N°2087/2012 dated December 26, 2012 and received by
the Bank on the same date. The full content of the letter is presented in Annex 7.
110. In the letter, the Borrower expressed its satisfaction with the recognition of the
significant benefits of the Project and the achievement of main objectives, which has
allowed for the development and consolidation of the State water resources sector,
considered one of the best implemented in the country. It also stressed in the letter that
out of the 23 intermediate indicators, only 7 were not achieved in full; considered by the
implementing agency as a demonstration of the high degree of Project success, achieving
the main objective of increasing the State’s capacity to deal with water resources scarcity
issues through structural measures and actions aimed at strengthening the management
system, creating a new culture and consolidating a new model for dealing with the water
resources in Ceará.
111. In this sense, the Borrower expressed its disagreement with the overall outcome
rating of moderately unsatisfactory. In its point of view, this rating does not reflect
Project overall performance. The Borrower’s understand that this rating relates to the fact
that four dams were and the pipelines have not been completed yet. In that regard, the
Borrower mentions the report from the Bank’s mission carried out from December 10 to
14, 2012, which states that the dams will be fairly completed by end-December 2012,
leaving small adjustment works to be carried out in January 2013. Amontada, Antonina
do Norte and Ipueiras pipelines are 95% completed and Madalena pipeline is 80%
completed, all of them expected for completion in January 2013. Itapipoca pipeline
completion has been delayed due to the bankruptcy of the original contractor, which has



                                             28
already been replaced and the works have resumed, with completion expected by May
2013. The construction of Ipaumirim dam is paralyzed for judicial reasons.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1. The detailed project components and their outputs are described as follows.

Component 1: Management and Institutional Component (US$ 25 million, 10
percent of total estimated cost).
2. Description. Even though tremendous progress had been made in the institutional,
legal and management frameworks of the state, this component sought to enhance the
work by then, refine the systems where needed and continue the implementation of
sustainable practices in the management of the resources. The component was divided
into the following specific sub-components:
Hydro-meteorological Information System:
3. Inventory and prioritization of the information gathering activities within the state,
classification of activities as collector-user potentialities. Identification of areas where
information was not being collected and areas of redundancy. Electronic data collection,
assimilation, distribution and archiving to be designed to optimize the availability of all
natural resources information within the state to all users without compromising the need
for real time availability to information originators. Based upon this refined design,
system components were to be acquired and installed to provide a comprehensive and
accessible data base of natural resources information to both the public and the private
sector.
Sustainable Operation and Maintenance of Bulk Water System:
4. Assistance to COGERH in the development of a sustainable and comprehensive Plan
of Operation and Maintenance (POM) for the State. Development of sustainable
preventative maintenance practices, establishment of depreciation reserves for
extraordinary maintenance and equipment replacement, maintenance training programs,
and emergency response strategies for the bulk water system.
Dam Safety and Inspection Program:
Development of a comprehensive program of inventorying, risk classification, inspection
and rehabilitation prioritization for the over 5,000 dams and reservoirs within the State.
Basin Committee Organization and Training:
5. Enhancement of the existing program of formation and development of capacity
within River Basin Committees to participate in the management of water resources
within the river basins of the State.
Water Tariff Evaluation:
6. Continue the program of evaluation of bulk water tariffs and the development of an
acceptable strategy of setting tariffs that reflects the real cost of providing the service and
also provides a socially viable system of tariffs and cross-subsidies, where necessary, to
guarantee water availability to all segments of society and, at the same time, assure the
sustainability of the bulk water systems.




                                              32
Market-Based Water Transfer Mechanisms:
7. Design and implement, on a pilot basis, a market-based transfer system for water use
rights that enhances adjustment of water supplies to meet changing demands reflective of
values determined in the market place.
Public Information and Education Program:
8. Design and implement a public information and education program within the State
with the objective of educating the general public, the political leaders and the media
regarding the value of water resources and the necessity for conserving and maintaining
the quality of those resources.

Component 2: Strategic Reservoir Network (US$22.2 million, 9 percent of total
estimated cost).
9. Description. Design and construction of key infrastructure critical to the provision of
water supplies to rural water-short areas and to reduce the vulnerability of the citizens of
the state to cyclical drought in the short to medium term. Delineation of the infrastructure
was said to be provided in a hierarchization study of dams included in project files.

Component 3: Integration of Key River Basins (US$166.8 million, 67.5 percent of
total estimated cost).
10. Description. Provision of reliable and quality water supply for industrial, municipal
and domestic purposes within the Metropolitan Basin of Fortaleza for the short, medium
and long term. This included:
   (a) a detailed analysis of the inter-basin water resources transfer proposals of the
       PROGERIRH Plan to evaluate environmental, social, technical and economic
       feasibility of such proposals and to develop a long-range schedules for
       implementation of feasible options. The analysis was to include hydrological
       modeling, supply and demand projections, environmental and social evaluation,
       analysis of alternatives, sensitivity analysis, and consideration of regional
       planning goals for both the originating and the receiving river basin.
   (b) preparation of final designs and construction of key inter-basin transfer systems
       found to be of high priority, feasible and necessary, including the development of
       operation and maintenance plans for these facilities;
   (c) construction of priority infrastructure necessary to assure an adequate water
       supply for industrial, municipal and domestic purposes to the Metropolitan Basin
       of Fortaleza.

Component 4: Restoration of Existing Bulk Water Infrastructure (US$23.2 million,
9.4 percent of total estimated cost).
11. Description. The state water company COGERH had taken over the operation and
maintenance responsibilities of the bulk water supply facilities of the state including the
facilities formerly operated and maintained by CAGECE and the Federal Government
(DNOCS). These facilities were suffering from a lack of sustainable operation
maintenance over several decades. COGERH had inspected and inventoried the condition
of these facilities and prioritized the need for restoration. The component continued the


                                            33
evaluation process of existing bulk water supply infrastructure and begin implementation
of restoration measures for those systems deemed most critical to the assurance of
continued supply of bulk water in the short term.

Component 5: Micro Watershed Management Pilot Project – PRODHAM (US$5
million, 2 percent of total estimated cost).
12. Description. Rehabilitation of micro watersheds (fourth-level tributaries) in four pre-
defined areas of the State. Conceived as a pilot project, it was to develop methodologies
on how to build a functioning approach for local community involvement, implementing
technically, socially, environmentally and economically sustainable solutions that help
promote the improved management of soil and vegetation in the tributary watersheds by
enhancing water conservation, minimizing erosion and maximizing natural water storage
mechanisms.
13. This component was developed as a complimentary aspect of the global
PROGERIRH. While the global PROGERIRH focused on areas close to the primary
water courses in the state, the PRODAHM focused on fourth-level tributaries in micro
watersheds. In these rural areas, the population typically is very poor and dependent on
water availability during the rainy season. With the onset of the dry season, water scarcity
impedes development of economic activities such as irrigation or intensive animal
husbandry. In addition, local vegetation along these small tributaries suffers due to its
uncontrolled use. The loss of this vegetation cover in turn has a negative impact on soil
moisture, wind retention and the micro climate, thus creating a downward spiral of
environmental and livelihood degradation.
14. The main objective of this component was the rehabilitation of micro watersheds in
four areas of the state of Ceara. Conceived as a pilot project it developed methodologies
on how to build up a functioning approach for local community involvement,
implementing technically, socially, environmentally and economically sustainable
solutions that help promote the improved management of soil and vegetation in the
tributary watersheds by enhancing water conservation, minimizing erosion and
maximizing natural water storage mechanisms. The ultimate purpose was to improve the
livelihood of the inhabitants of these areas increasingly threatened by environmental
degradation and recurring droughts.
15. The expected results of the pilot were: (a) a methodology for rehabilitation and
prevention of degradation effects on the vegetation; (b) development of simple
techniques of soil and water conservation using local human and natural resources; (c) re-
establishment and conservation of local biodiversity; and (d) increased inter-seasonal
water availability for animal consumption. Depending on the results, the approach might
be extended to other areas.

Component 6: Groundwater Management (US$5 million, 2 percent of total estimated
cots).
16. The main area of the state of Ceara is situated on chrystalline rock formations with
relatively little good-quality groundwater. For this reason the principal water source is
surface water which is stored in reservoirs during the rainy season lasting from January


                                            34
through May. In two regions of the state, however, there are significant groundwater
resources: the coast and in the Cariri region. This component focused on these areas
through two sub-components.
A. Cariri Sub-component:
17. The Cariri region in the Southeast of the State has relatively abundant rainfall and
groundwater, which is crucial to the economic and social stability of that region.
However, evidence had accumulated that groundwater resources were diminishing. This
sub-component was to produce relevant data and analyses regarding the groundwater
situation in the Cariri region, especially regarding the Chapada do Araripe highlands and
their link to the Cariri plain, and develop and implement an action plan for better
groundwater management, involving the local communities, possibly including
reforestation, groundwater monitoring, registry of water users, training water managers in
the region and educating the public.
B. Coastal and Littoral Zone Sub-component:
18. Groundwater in the coastal zone and the related coastal freshwater lakes are important
for the State´s tourism industry, both from a recreational and from a drinking-water
viewpoint, as well as for much of the current water supply to Fortaleza. Groundwater
resources are vulnerable to pollution from residential and industrial development, to
intrusion of salt water and to over-exploitation. The sub-component was to continue
analysis and the implementation of recommendations developed under the Ceará Water
Pilot Project for the development of a coastal and littoral zone groundwater management
plan, to include a program for the identification and preservation of the critical recharge
zone to assure the long term sustainability of this valuable resource.

Additional Financing
19. An Additional Financing (AF) for this Project of US$ 103.0 million was approved by
the Board on December 17, 2008. While project objectives remained the same, project
components were re-organized into two major areas: (a) WRM, including groundwater
management, formerly under Component 6, and a new water quality monitoring system,
and (b) hydraulic infrastructure, containing the following elements:

Component 1 - Water Resources Management
20. Description. This Component will comprise the following groups of activities:
Institutional Strengthening:
21. Development and strengthening of human resources for the State WRM entities and
the public communication system to facilitate the social change for a new water culture.
Water Rights, Licensing and Control System, Bulk Water Tariff Program:
22. Updating and expansion of the technical and information basis for allocating and
managing water rights, enforcing water rights and bulk water charges, and re-evaluating
the bulk water tariff and tariff collection system.
Water Basins Committees and Water Users Associations:



                                            35
23. Supporting the creation of additional water basin committees and water user
associations, dissemination of lessons learned and best practices through the watershed
pilot (PRODHAM), and development of environmental education programs for bulk
water conservation.
Operation and Maintenance of Hydraulic Infrastructure:
24. Preparation of studies for rehabilitation and enhancement of water infrastructure, and
implementation of automated O&M for priority infrastructure.
Water Quality Management and Groundwater Management:
25. Implementation of a water quality monitoring system and expansion and
strengthening of the groundwater management system.

Component 2 - Hydraulic Infrastructure
26. This revised component represented the bulk of additional funding and included the
preparation and implementation of additional water storage and supply facilities that had
been analyzed in the preparation of the original PROGERIRH but not included in the
project scope earlier due to funding limitations. The component included three groups of
activities:
Strategic Reservoirs Network:
27. Six reservoirs (Umari, Gameleira, Trairi, Jenipapeiro, Jatoba and Mamoeiro) were
selected following a prioritization methodology developed earlier, that are to be primarily
used to provide municipal/domestic water supply to critical rural areas that lacked
adequate and reliable treated water, particularly during the periodic droughts.
Water Transfer Axis:
28. The completion of Section III of the Integration Canal initially funded under
PROGERIRH was included in the scope of the AF, but was to be entirely financed with
counterpart funds. The sub-component also included the water conveyance systems
(Madalena, Itapipoca, Fortim, Ipaumirim, Ipueiras and Antonina do Norte pipelines) to
distribute water from the above-mentioned six strategic reservoirs, to be funded in part
with AF loan funds.
Studies and Engineering Designs to support State infrastructure investment planning.
The annex follows the component structure adopted under the Additional Financing, but
includes also the components “Restoration of Bulk Water Infrastructure? and “Micro-
watershed management?, which were part of the original project scope only.

   The originally planned Fortim pipeline would capture water at Trairi dam. Therefore, it was taken out of

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1. Conclusion: Internal economic rates of return (IERR) on the three, pre-defined
strategic reservoirs described in the PAD were expected to range from 13% to 15%.
Analysis shows actual IERRs for these same strategic reservoirs ranging from 7% to
15%. The reasons for the differences between appraisal and the ex-post analysis are
explained in Section A below. Of the three strategic reservoirs analyzed, one is
economically profitable, exceeding their appraisal estimate, while the others are below
appraisal estimate and marginally economically viable. The investments in the Fortaleza
Metropolitan Region (FMR), which included investments in the Transbasin Link
Castanhão-Fortaleza, the Aracoiaba Reservoir, the Worker’s Canal, and rehabilitation
works, shows an IERR of 13%, compared to the appraisal estimate of 16%. The project
IERR is 11% compared to the appraisal estimate of 14%.
2. The economic and financial analyses of the Project were conducted at two levels.
First, using traditional cost-benefit analysis, detailed economic and financial assessments
were undertaken for the main infrastructure components, namely (a) increased and
reliable supply to the FMR, and (b) a sample of three completed strategic reservoirs. The
evaluated infrastructure components account for 94% of the total project costs estimated
at appraisal (excluding the Additional Financing). We have excluded the original
financing investments in the ex-post economic analysis because those investments have
not yet produced benefits and/or data was not available.
3. The analysis followed the same methodology and cost-benefit calculations done at
appraisal in order to compare the projected net benefits with the actual economic and
financial returns. Nevertheless, the institutional development component has been pivotal
to the achievement of the overall project benefits, however it has not been quantified in
this analysis. Therefore, for the Project as a whole, the linkages of the different
components, i.e. the investment costs of the above-mentioned investments were
considered. These were compared to the benefit streams derived from incremental water
supply.
4. The ex post economic analysis followed the same methodology as the appraisal
assessment. The cash flows were calculated up to the year 2028 (30 years from
appraisal), discounted using a discount rate of 12 percent which is assumed to be a proxy
of Brazil's opportunity cost of capital. Benefits were estimated based on the type of use.
Three different types of use were included in the quantitative analysis: human water
supply, industrial water supply, and irrigation. However, for the sample of projects
evaluated, irrigation benefits were not included in the base scenario given that there was
no expected area with specific irrigation activities planned. Thus, given that irrigation
activities had been undertaken, the approach used was conservative by not including
irrigation within the benefit stream.
5. Cost information was provided by Project Unit, as well as O&M costs by COGERH
and CAGECE. These costs include capital costs, operation and maintenance costs,
rehabilitation, and resettlement. Although the project did not finance water treatment
plants, distribution networks for municipal water supply, or irrigation infrastructure, such



                                            41
          investments were undertaken with own Government funds. We included these additional
          costs in order to be able to arrive at the real net return to all investments.

          A. Analysis of Strategic Reservoirs
          6. From Map 1, we observe the location of all reservoirs financed by PROGERIRH, and
          MAP 2 shows the clear growth in the number of households between 2000 and 2010 with
          adequate water supply. Table 1 below shows the comparison between the appraisal
          estimates and the ex-post economic analysis of the 3 strategic reservoirs: Malcozinhado,
          Carmina, and Catu. The reason for the differences between the appraisal estimates and
          the ex post analysis are the following:
          a. For Catu and Carmina Reservoirs, although the actual volume of water supplied to
             end user was lower than originally estimated, given the better than estimated
             reduction in losses throughout the system and the larger than expected population
             growth, economic benefits were maintained. The big difference leading to a negative
             NPV, is due to the higher than anticipated costs, both investment and O&M costs.
             Catu and Carmina had an increase in costs of 42% and 37% with respect to the
             appraisal estimate.
          b. For Malcozinhado overall costs were 17% less than the appraisal estimate. Actual
             investment costs were higher, but O&M costs were much lower, leading to net
             savings. Furthermore, given that it was the largest Reservoirs in the sample, this kept
             the overall costs of these 3 reservoirs at only 11% above the appraisal estimate.
          c. In addition, increases in costs related mostly to rises in fuel prices and overall
             construction costs partially caused by the devaluation of the Real in 1999.
             Construction costs have also increased as a result of the heating of the construction
             market in Brazil with the launch of a large infrastructure program by the Federal
             Government in 2007.

          B. Analysis of Infrastructure Investments for the Fortaleza Metropolitan Region
             (FMR) and overall Project Returns
          7. Population in the FMR has grown as estimated in appraisal, but potable water
          consumption and system efficiencies have been higher than originally expected (see
          Table 2 below). In particular CAGECE reports a great improvement in the reduction of
          system losses in the past few years, as well as an increase in water consumed. Although
          a desegregated ex post analysis by type of water user group was not possible, there has
          been a clear increase in incomes in the past decade, as well as a proliferation of

 underground water sources, so it has been challenging to quantify the current level of
 overall benefits from project investments for the FMR.

 8. Overall costs in the FMR infrastructure have been 12% higher than originally
 estimated at appraisal. Investment costs for the Transbasin Link (Tranches 1 and 2), were
 higher than expected, but O&M costs have been lower. With respect to the Aracoiaba
 Reservoir, it shows both higher than estimated investment and O&M costs. Given the
 lack of disaggregated cost data by item, we are not able to identify the source of the cost-
 differential, however staff at COGERH and CAGECE attribute the increase to the large
 and sustained level of international oil prices. But even with the increase in costs, the
 overall project investments still show a positive NPV with an IERR within the limits of
 the appraisal sensibility analysis.

 9. Benefits for human water supply include increase of service coverage, reduction of
 intermittent water supplies, water quality improvement and resource savings caused by
 switching from alternative sources at a higher cost to the consumer to a piped water
 network at a lower cost per cubic meter. Since all incremental treated water provided
 through this project was (and is) distributed by CAGECE (Ceará's water and sanitation
 company), we have used CAGECE's tariffs. With the project, an incremental 2.7 million
 inhabitants will be served by the water from this Project. In addition, the Project has
 provide drought security to both current and future inhabitants of the Fortaleza
 Metropolitan Region, as evidenced by the reduction in the need to request the population

 to save water and eliminating the need of shutting off the water supply for specific
 periods of time.
 10. The tariff used for calculation of the value of this incremental water is based on
 CAGECE's tariff schedule, with weights applied to different consumer groups. At
 appraisal tariffs varied between US$ 0.52/m3 and US$ 1.18/m3 for residential,
 commercial and industrial consumers respectively, and have been increasing steadily.
 2010 tariffs were at US$ 0.71/m3, US$ 1.15/m3 and US$ 2.22/m3 for residential,
 commercial and industrial consumers (lowest category) respectively (see Table 4 below).

 11. Irrigation benefits could be estimated based on the expected incremental irrigated
 area, its associated water use and incremental crop production. The strategic reservoirs
 are mainly located in the interior where poverty of the population is greatest and
 education levels are low; however in recent years there has been an increase in state
 assistance programs for agriculture and irrigation, so it has been difficult to isolated the
 impact of a more reliable water source with other public sector farmer supports. No
 primary data were available to quantify the incremental benefits from irrigation, so the
 approach used was conservative by not including irrigation in the base case scenarios and
 irrigation benefits were thus underestimated. Nevertheless, a recent study 21 has shown
 that per hectare profitability due to irrigation (and diversification into value added
 products) could go from 10% to 35% on average. This not only has increased rural, but
 probably also has had a positive social impact by reducing migration to Fortaleza in the
 recurring drought periods, which force people to look for alternative livelihoods and
 which can cause considerable negative social impacts.
 12. Overall current water charges by COGERH are still below actual O&M costs
 (R$0.003 per m3) for bulk water delivered to CAGECE for municipal use, which is less
 than at appraisal (R$0.01 per m3); and no charges yet to the agricultural sector. Although
 the overall charges are not yet sufficient to cover O&M, Ceará is one of the few Brazilian
 states charging for bulk water. With this project, the institutional reforms have been
 under way and a new and improved tariff structure has been introduced. Results from
 the ex-post analysis show that the proposed investments for the Fortaleza Metropolitan
 Region component were economically viable. However, the financial analysis illustrates
 that at current prices, consumption and tariff levels, the investment in this, and other
 components, continue to require capital subsidies from the government since the FIRR
 only reaches 4%. The results of the strategic reservoirs show low financial rates of return,
 due to their multipurpose use. The reservoirs are for human and industrial consumption

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1. The State Government of Ceará, through its Secretariat of Water Resources,
convened a Seminar on evaluation of the actions carried out through the PROGERIRH
Project, which was held on March 29 and 30 in Fortaleza, Ceará. While evaluation was
the principal objective, the seminar also served to celebrate the successes of the project as
a keystone of Ceará’s water resource management policies and programs.

2. The participants included staff of the Secretary of Water Resources and staff of his
Secretariat, current and former staff of COGERH and SOHIDRA, concerned scientists of
the Federal University of Ceará, the National Water Agency (ANA) and representatives
of several river basin committees and reservoir management commissions as principal
stakeholder representatives, including the Forum of River Basin Committees in the State.
World Bank staff and consultants also attended the seminar.

3. The presentations and lively ensuing discussions covered the following topics:
   • Context and significance of PROGERIRH within the history of water resource
      management in Ceará, with emphasis on the new integrated approach
   • Expansion of public participation and awareness-raising on water resource issues
      among the population
   • Inclusion of soil and vegetation in water resource and watershed management
   • Improved hydrological monitoring in the State as a result of PROGERIRH
   • Water resource infrastructure planning in Ceará under PROGERIRH
   • The development of State water resource institutions under PROGERIRH
   • Challenges and advances concerning expropriation, resettlement, rehabilitation
      and environmental management under the project
   • Challenges and advances concerning dam safety in the State

4. The seminar was successful in highlighting the principal advances under the project
in terms of approach, coverage and expansion of capacity in the State.

5. Significant aspects of progress recognized by all present were:
   • The integration of soil and watershed management, of environmental impacts and
      mitigation, of institutions, of stakeholders and productive sectors in water
      resource policy and management in the State
   • The build-up of effective stakeholder participation through river basin committees
      and reservoir management commissions (which were not originally foreseen), the
      increase in transparency in water release decisions, and the acceptance of
      participatory management as an integrated part of water management, not an add-
      on



                                             51
   •   The effective takeover of water resource management in the State from federal
       agencies
   •   Vastly improved information systems and data bases for decision making in water
       allocations and releases
   •   Implementation and enforcement of water rights as a means of democratization of
       access to water and of social equity, and to reduce conflicts
   •   Demonstration of successful watershed (soil and vegetation) management
       techniques
   •   Improved flood and drought alert (early warning) systems
   •   Improved reservoir and canal operation and maintenance rules and procedures
   •   Water quality measurement expanded and improved
   •   Improved cost accounting for bulk water supply
   •   Environmental inventory as part of infrastructure planning
   •   COGERH materially and institutionally strengthened by project, including human
       resources
   •   The adaptation of laws and procedures for resettlement to Bank safeguard
       standards
   •   The continuity afforded by the Bank loan through changes of state government

6. On the other hand, the following challenges ahead were identified and discussed:
   • Quality of water as increasingly binding concern
   • Integration of state policies with a bearing on water quality, principally urban
      sanitation
   • Collaboration among state institutions that are not under the same Secretariat
   • Interlocution of RBCs with community, society
   • Integration with other state policies
   • Many inhabitants of rural areas not yet served by quality water – challenge is
      water supply through smaller systems (40% of rural population?)
   • Role of RBCs and of reservoir management commissions
   • Funding of participatory activity in RBCs, RMCs, as part of O&M costs
   • Lack of institutions to carry on, to mainstream watershed management
      improvements with small farmers
   • Inclusion of local government, academia and extension agencies in promotion of
      soil and water conservation
   • Prolonging the life of reservoirs
   • Effective management and control of groundwater extraction, in the FMR,
      Araripe and Apodí aquifers
   • Effective implementation of basin plans

Annex 10. Safeguards

A. Environment
1. During preparation of the Original Project, a Regional Environmental Assessment
was carried out for five river basins, including recommendations for compensatory
measures, mitigation of impacts of induced regional development and institutional
strengthening, and criteria for selection of sub-projects (reservoirs) under the project.
Environmental assessments and management plans were carried out and approved by the
Bank for the large hydraulic works before appraisal (1999) and for the approval of the AF
(2008). Substantial efforts were dedicated to formulate appropriate resettlement
frameworks to comply with Bank’s policy. Bank review and approval were required for
any other proposed sub-project with regard to an appropriate resettlement plan, adequate
environmental impact assessment and management plan. In order to increase the
probability of compliance with Bank’s safeguards, it was decided that works contracts
had to include the contractor’s obligation to clear the vegetation within the inundation
area, to mark and/or fence the permanent protection on the reservoir margin to safeguard
structures and artifacts of cultural, historical, archeological or paleontological
significance. In addition, an environmental construction manual was produced to guide
supervision and execution of hydraulic works. The supervision of works by private
consultant firms was to include contractor’s compliance with environmental safeguards
and management plans.
2. The following Bank environmental and social safeguards were triggered by the
Project: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Pest
Management (OP 4.09), Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11), Involuntary
Resettlement (OP 4.12) and Dam Safety (OP 4.37).
3. The Project was classified as Environmental Category "A". Besides meeting overall
criteria and procedures pertaining to the Bank’s environmental and social safeguards,
environmental management in the water resources sector was strengthened and specific
measures were carried out:
•   Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) – Besides drafting the Project Global EAs
    required to secure Bank funding, all interventions were subject to specific
    environmental assessments in order to comply with Brazilian environmental
    legislation. Environmental Impact Assessments - EIA / RIMA and their respective
    public hearings were held for interventions related to dams, Integration and Water
    Transport Systems. The mitigation measures prescribed in these studies were
    included in the environmental permits and tender documents regarding civil works.
•   Environmental Management Plans (EMP) for PROGERIRH – Phase 1 and 2 were
    designed with a view to ensuring adequate compliance with the Bank’s environmental
    and social safeguards, coupled with the strengthening of environmental management
    within the Secretariat of Water Resources, including activities aimed at: (i)
    strengthening of protected areas, (ii) assessment and monitoring of estuarine and
    mangrove areas, (iii) monitoring of water quality, (iv) training and capacity building
    of environmental Water Resources Secretariat and related agencies, (vi) protection of
    reservoirs, (vii) studies of environmental inventories of reservoir watersheds, etc..


                                           59
An activity worth underscoring was support for monitoring of water quality at
existing reservoirs, which generated knowledge on possible threats to water quality
stemming from salinization and/or eutrophication. Moreover, Environmental
Inventories of Reservoir Basins have enabled a current analysis of nutrient intake at
reservoirs and thus laid the foundations for future actions aimed at preserving and/or
recovering water quality in reservoirs.
With regard to implementation of civil works, the Environmental Construction
Manual was adopted and included in the process of tendering and building works on
reservoirs and water transport systems.
There were specific issues with regard to implementation of environmental actions
during reservoir construction, including: (i) failure to plan for or implement
topographic landmarks and/or fences as protection around strips of preservation areas
along reservoirs; (ii) filling of two reservoirs– Aracoiaba and Catu Cinzenta – with
only partial deforestation of the reservoir basin; (iii) failure to implement
environmental supervision and enforcement procedures at works; (iv) failure to
implement Program for Identifying and Recovering the Archeaological,
Paleantological, and Cultural Heritage, as planned under the EMP.
In this regard, during preparation for Additional Funding in Phase 2, the aim was to
improve on the design and implementation of environmental actions during the
implementation of works, with a focus on the following measures:
•   Drafting a Socio-environmental Procedures Manual aimed at integrating stages
    of project design, environmental licensing and construction.
•   Program for Protecting reservoirs by recovering degraded areas and fencing off
    100-meter strips (Permanent Preservation Areas - APPs)
•   Drafting Environmental Management Plans – EMPs specific to each dam.
•   Development and implementation of programs aimed at Identification and
    Recovery of Archaeological, Cultural and Paleontological Heritage, in the case
    of Dams and Water Transport Systems.
Planned to be drafted during the 1st year of implementation under the Additional
Financing, the Socio-Environmental Manual mentioned above, which would lay out
the series of environmental measures to be taken vis-à-vis dam construction, has not
been drafted or commissioned.
The environmental management plans - EMPs specific to each dam were drafted,
including: a) sound deforestation of reservoir basins; b) management and protection
of fauna; c) removal/relocation of existing infrastructure in the area of the reservoir
basin d) protection and revegetation of Permanent Preservation Areas - APPs along
reservoirs and e) recovery of areas degraded by mining and construction, etc.
Implementation of the actions during construction, as mentioned above, would be
carried out by the contractors, who were supposed to have staff with an
environmental background, and environmental supervision was to be conducted by
companies specializing in supervising construction with SRH monitoring.




                                        60
    With regard to adequate environmental preparation, the construction was carried out
    differently from what had been originally planned in the EMPs and Operating
    Manuals. The SRH preferred to adopt another system for environmental supervision
    of works, both in phase 1 and 2. Thus, the implementation of environmental actions
    as per the Management Plans specific to each dam were under the responsibility of
    the construction companies and construction supervision companies (environmental
    education and program for identifying the cultural heritage), and SRH took charge of
    the environmental supervision of works, although it does not have adequate technical
    and logistical resources to do so.
    The construction and supervision company teams did not have professionals with
    environmental backgrounds with experience in this type of project. They also failed
    to adopt environmental planning procedures for works as planned in the
    PROGERIRH Operating Manual.
    Despite the efforts of the SRH team, this system did not achieve the expected
    environmental performance. Situations of inappropriate practices and non-
    compliance were observed during technical inspections conducted by the Bank team.
    Here, we should also underscore the lack of environmental capacity among
    construction companies and SOHIDRA.
    Upon analysis of Environmental Installation Licenses issued for the Progerirh –
    Phase 2 works, the following observations were made: (i) two installation licenses
    were issued (for the Jenipapeiro and Umari dams) by SEMACE with the caveat that
    they refer to “Regularization?, which might mean that construction began without
    the appropriate installation license; (ii) Construction of four water transport systems
    began without their respective installation licenses by SEMACE. This issue was later
    resolved once the Operation License – LO 265/2012 (10/07/2012) was issued as a
    joint license for several water systems – integration axes, dams and transport systems
    that comprise the state-level Water Resources Management system – SIGERH. The
    inclusion of the water transport systems for Phase 2 of Progerirh in this operating
    license, on the one hand, legalizes the status of these systems under the
    environmental legislation. Yet, on the other hand, it comes across as quite strange
    since the Ipueiras, Antonina do Norte and Itapipoca systems were still being
    concluded when the license was issued, and the Itapipoca works were stopped due to
    “abandonment? by the construction company.
•   Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) – All of the environmental management programs
    within the Environmental Management Plans - EMPs under PROGERIRH
    (Strengthening of Conservation Units; Assessment and Proposal for Monitoring
    Estuarine and Mangrove Areas; implementation of Strips for Protecting Reservoir
    Banks – Permanent Protection Areas – APPs, etc.) pertaining to preservation and
    conservation of natural habitats were implemented.
    The plan to recover Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs), a 100-meter strip around
    reservoirs, was implemented in some cases but not in others, since for some dams the
    APP was not fenced off and areas borrowed were not recovered. In other dams these
    actions were adequately performed.



                                           61
•   Pest Management (OP 4.09) – In Phase 2, Additional Funding, the Pesticide
    Management Manual was drafted with the aim of ensuring adequate procedures be
    adopted for controlling ants during re-vegetation of APPs along reservoir banks and
    recovery of degraded lands.
•   Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) – During Phase 1, the Program for
    Identification and Recovery of Archaeological, Paleantological and Cultural
    Heritage, as planned in the EMP, was not implemented. The reasons provided by
    the Water Resources Secretariat were the lack of such procedures in the EIA/RIMAs
    drafted at the time (1998-2001), in the environmental licenses issued by the
    SEMACE and in the Program Operating Manual, which was compounded by the
    fact that the Bank Supervision did not hold them accountable for such measures
    during Project implementation.
    During phase 2, the situation changed, since programs aimed at identification and
    recovery of the archaeological and paleontological heritage were planned in the
    EMPs, included in the contracts and duly implemented by the supervising
    companies.
•   Dam Safety (OP 4.37) – The interventions related to dam construction (dams) or
    recovery of existing dams underwent evaluations by the Safety Panel set up
    specifically for this purpose by the PROGERIRH.

Environmental Safeguards Compliance
4. Safeguards compliance during implementation was mixed. While actions related to
conservation units, estuary/mangrove monitoring, water quality monitoring, and
watershed environmental inventories were carried out as planned, albeit with delays,
problems arose with the performance of contractors in full clearing of some of the
reservoir areas, in fencing off protected areas on the reservoir margin, restoration of
borrow pits, and preserving physical cultural resources. Inadequate environmental
mitigation also occurred because the supervision capacity of the SRH was weak
(particularly in the later years), SOHIDRA staff and contractors’ staff were not well
trained in environmental aspects, contractors employed no environmental specialists, and
consultants contracted to supervise work execution often neglected the environmental
aspects in their field checks, leaving this task to SRH. Compliance improved to some
degree during the AF phase (particularly with regard to physical cultural resources), but
deficiencies remained. Protection of land along the reservoir margins was implemented
for some but not all reservoirs. None of the four pipelines under construction under the
AF had received the environmental license required for installation in a timely fashion.
Subsequent to a Bank mission in April of 2012, and a follow-up mission in May, in
which these failures to comply with Brazilian legislation were pointed out to the State
Government, measures were taken to expedite compliance. The required licenses were
granted.
5. Bank’s dam safety safeguards were properly implemented under the project. A dam
safety panel was created and maintained throughout the implementation of both phases of
the Project. In fact, the Project has substantially strengthened attention to dam safety in
the state as a permanent feature of design, operation and maintenance of hydraulic


                                            62
structures, not only because of Bank safeguard requirements. Ceará was already a pioneer
in developing dam safety guidelines and considered a reference by other states and the
federal government. The Project supported the implementation of the guidelines by
requiring and funding an inventory of dams and safety issues, training, instrumentation of
dams, periodic inspections by specialists, and reviews of dam designs by the dam safety
panel. The panel also made important recommendations to improve the safety guidelines.
6. The environmental planning during project preparation for both Phase 1 and 2 (AF),
proved adequate, but its implementation during the different phases of project
implementation was found to be non-compliant since it failed to adequately implement
environmental actions during construction works.
7. Especially during Phase 2 (AF), the following situation arose: (i) failure to draft and
thus implement the Socio-Environmental Procedures Manual; (ii) failure to commission
environmental supervision of construction works; and (iii) the lack of a requirement for
staff with an environmental background in the construction company; besides the evident
lack of environmental training of SOHIDRA. In addition, one of the issues observed was
the failure, on some construction sites, to comply with legal requirements regarding
workplace safety and health.
8. Despite these non-compliances in some works, the PROGERIRH enabled significant
advances with regard to environmental management, as outlined above.
9. Therefore, considering: (i) the progress made under the PROGERIRH – Phases 1 and
2, and the fact that most of the environmental measures were taken; (ii) the non-
compliances reported above, especially those related to the Construction stage, in some
projects; Project implementation could be classified as “moderately satisfactory? vis-à-
vis compliance with the Bank’s environmental safeguards.

Lessons Learned
10. Adequate Environmental Planning is essential but does not ensure that actions
will be implemented during the construction phase. In addition to adequate
environmental planning, special attention must be paid in the first and second years of
Project implementation so as to ensure that the various environmental actions planned
and included in the Project EMP and in the Operating Manual are effectively carried from
the very onset of the project implementation phase. Moreover, procurement documents
for large-size works such as dams must include minimal requirements regarding
environmental management.
11. Need for more capacity-building on World Bank environmental safeguards and
federal and state laws, especially during the Implementation of Works phase.
Ensuring compliance with these safeguards will only be possible when the Project teams,
especially in construction and operation phases, are able to identity and mitigate issues
pertaining to them. The Project should promote dissemination of knowledge on the Bank
safeguards and relevant environmental legislation, for all teams at all levels. Programs
aimed at strengthening environmental management should be designed and implemented
adequately. Environmental and social actions should be associated with construction
works so as to ensure their implementation. In this regard, the institutions in charge of



                                           63
carrying out the works must have staff trained in performing and/or supervising
associated environmental actions.
12. The Project Management must include an adequately trained and equipped
technical environmental team. The technical environmental team in charge of
implementing the Project’s environmental actions (implementation and supervision of
works) must be comprised of enough qualified professionals to perform the duties,
including logistics and equipment needed for their activities. The institutions in charge of
carrying out the works and operating them must also have a technical team trained in
environmental management of works.
13. The Bank Supervision should pay attention to environmental and social
safeguards and be based on independent audits. The Bank team’s supervision of
Project implementation should constantly monitor the implementation of programs
included in the Environmental Management Plan – Overall EMP, as well as the specific
programs laid out in the EMPs for each Work, compliance with environmental
requirements under federal and local Brazilian laws and environmental and social
safeguards. Whenever possible, in the case of category “A? Projects, supervision should
be based on an independent environmental audit, at least prior to the Mid Term Review.

B. Resettlement
14. There were 1394 families to be resettled under the first phase of PROGERIRH (six
dams), and 780 families under the AF (five dams). Landholders were compensated for
the land lost, and all families were given the opportunity either to resettle themselves to a
place of their choice with a resettlement grant, or to be resettled in new settlements
(“agrovilas?) with agricultural plots. The latter option was chosen by 261 families.
15. The choices offered can be defined as follows:
   •   Resettlement in Agrovilas (261 families) – Houses built, with infrastructure
       (electric power, running water, sewage disposal) and an agricultural plot. This is
       the preferential option for residents/families who do not own land.
   •   Resettlement in Remaining Areas (377 families) – Families who chose to be
       resettled on unaffected areas of the farm; + compensation for the affected area.
   •   Self-Resettlement (491 families) – Purchase of new homes monitored in
       accordance with the choices made by the affected families.
   •   Resettlement in Urban Areas (12 families) – Purchase of homes in urban areas
       (cities near the original residence). This is the preferential option of
       families/elderly couples seeking proximity to health services and unable to
       perform farm work, nearly all of whom rely on social security or income-transfer
       programs.
   •   Cash compensation (1,033 families) – The option chosen by the vast majority of
       land owners.
16. Table 1 describes the options implemented in each phase and the outcome for each
dam built. This table shows that there are still 14 cases with pending issues. These
outstanding cases involve land owners who chose compensation, most of whom have
already had funds deposited as court bonds (80% of the amount), but who are still
disputing the assessment of the land’s full value.

Positive Points
17. The resettlement program implementation brought major social progress and
overcame obstacles typical of rural resettlement programs, in which people lose both
their homes and livelihoods.
18. Progress was achieved in the following major areas:
a. Improved housing – 261 houses, most of which made of mud walls and no
   infrastructure, were replaced by masonry houses with infrastructure (electric power,
   running water and sewage disposal) and an agricultural plot. Preferential option of
   residents/families who did not own land.
b. Increased assets – When they receive a home with an agricultural plot, families who
   did not previously own land come to own an asset of significant value given the local
   and regional context. In addition to gaining an asset, this property boosts peoples’
   self-esteem, as they are recognized as full members of the local society.
c. Promotion of collective organization – With the construction of each dam, a
   Resettlement and Environmental Preservation Support Committee (CARPA, in the
   Portuguese acronym) is set up with the role of monitoring works involving the dam
   and other construction activities, such as agrovilas adjacent to the reservoir, as well
   as PROGERIRH AF-related services, resettlement of the population in the reservoir
   basin and expropriation of and compensation for land, while also voicing the needs of
   the civil society affected by the dam construction and following up on - and
   accounting for - their demands with regard to local social promotion and
   development. The legal footing for the CARPAs – Ceará State Decree #24,336
   (January 9, 1997) – requires that they be comprised of 12 members, three of whom
   are chosen by the Mayor and City Council [Municipal level] where the dam is being
   built, three chosen by and representing community organizations active in the
   municipality, three residents who do not own land in the reservoir basin, and three
   representing the Water Resource Secretariat (SRH) and its two agencies, COGERH
   and SOHIDRA. Each standing member has an alternate who replaces that member
   whenever he/she is absent or otherwise unable to participate, and all members are
   officially designated by the State Secretary of Water Resources. Their mandate lasts
   as long as the dam is being built and affected families are being resettled.
d. Local economic growth – Cash compensations help the local economy grow, as
   families spend to buy other real estate, injecting money into and thus bolstering the
   local economy. Other positive impacts on the local economy include: (i) rental of
   housing for temporary resettlement purposes, as needed on a case-by-case basis; and
   (ii) expansion of the local service sector (restaurants, lodging, fuel stations, etc.).
e. Recognition of an active citizenry – The Program helped the affected population to
   obtain personal documents and to regularize land titles and documents. This in turn
   enhanced their self-esteem and feeling of recognition as citizens, in addition to
   providing them access to official programs such as farm loans.
f. Access to schooling – The vast majority of newly-built agrovilas have elementary
   schools. The only ones that do not are located near an existing school that will be able
   to take in students from the agrovila.


                                            66
g. Sharing socio-environmental and public-health information – The program called a
   number of meetings to publicize social-environmental and sanitation-related
   information prior to the first public works (on removal of plant cover, quality of
   water, disposal of sewage and garbage, etc.) in order to ensure raising the
   population’s awareness on these issues. Plant cover removal, for example, drives out
   wild animals, a risk the population should be aware of for various reasons, including
   the need to avoid accidents such as snake bites.

Constraints
19. During implementation, the Program dealt with recurring problems, which may be
analyzed individually but were interwoven throughout the process. Involuntary
resettlement programs in rural areas are always very complex, since they must mitigate
the impact of lost homes and the breakdown of livelihoods. This demands countless
activities to rehabilitate people’s livelihoods to a standard at least as high as prior to the
Project, and hopefully to improve the quality of life of the affected people. The greatest
obstacles arising throughout the process, however, were related to the wide diversity of
actions required, ranging from engineering to social work and legal issues. Managing and
carrying out these activities on schedule while networking with all the stakeholders stood
as the greatest challenge faced by the PROGERIRH Resettlement Program.
20. The key constraints in this regard can be grouped into five major aspects listed below.
In order to establish a process, the Ceará State Government prepared a Resettlement
Framework (Additional Funding) and Resettlement Plans (PRIs) for each of the projects
to be carried out, in compliance with OP 4.12. Throughout the implementation of the
PRIs, however, recurrent issues nearly always arose, for example:
a. Identification/control and management of all actions and relationships involved in
   resettlement processes – The surprises that always came up during resettlement
   processes caused delays and thus aggravated the scale of impacts or diminished the
   potential for mitigation. The following examples illustrate this:
   •   Difficulties in Managing Actions – In 2011, the Jenipapeiro dam was filled before
       any relocation of the power grid that passed through the reservoir basin, and the
       agrovila’s access to electrical power required reaching an agreement for that
       relocation. This situation led to two separate burdens: (i) the immediate burden
       borne by families settled in the agrovila, who were left without power, and thus
       without water, since their water supply relies on electric pumps; and (ii) the
       potential burden of electrical power for the city of Umari being cut off. The
       solution finally came in early 2012 following intense efforts by the Bank
       missions, meetings and correspondence with the State government.
   •   Gameleira Agrovila – The population resettled into homes in the Gameleira
       agrovila in January 2011 only had access to water and electric power supply in
       December 2012. The handover of agricultural plots (unfinished demarcation
       process), land titles or even the fencing of the agrovila had not been resolved by
       December 2012 yet.
   Recommendation: Strengthen the early operational planning of resettlement actions
   by using management tools designed for medium-to-high complexity programs


                                             67
   involving several different activities, as well as more frequent monitoring of
   safeguards.
b. Timetable for implementing resettlements vs. timetable for building the dams –
   Whenever resettlement – in any form, regardless of the option – is not in sync with
   dam construction, this places a burden on the Program and, even more so, on affected
   families, although the impact on families was reversible and temporary. Two
   emblematic cases occurred at different moments in the Program:
   •    Change in the Resettlement Solution – Faé Dam – In October 2003, the dam was
        ready to be filled, although 21 families living in the affected area that had opted
        for resettlement had not been relocated and works on the agrovila had not even
        begun. The solution was self-resettlement, concluded in 2004 with delivery of
        land titles.
   •    Mismatch in Timing of Activities – Pesqueiro Dam – Work on the dam was
        suspended in October 2003 and the contracts were cancelled, causing major
        delays in construction. The timing of the social aspects also failed due to a gap
        between resettlement and construction activities. Part of the families had to be
        moved into unfinished housing in the agrovila, while the rest remained in the
        reservoir basin (in the dam’s protection strip),with no infrastructure due to the
        works performed while families were still living in the basin, including removal
        of power lines and uprooting of trees, which damaged existing roads and isolated
        the remaining families. These major disruptions were caused by the lack of
        integration between construction and resettlement activities. Lastly, while the
        dam was concluded in March 2007, the agrovila only managed to distribute
        agricultural plots in January 2008. A provisional solution for the water supply
        was a desalinization unit for the well, installed in July 2007, until water was
        finally piped in February 2008. There was a delay in building the 50-unit
        agrovila due to poor planning of the whole chain of activities, which brought a
        social burden on the families. Even so, despite the setbacks towards the end of
        the process, families expressed their satisfaction and considered it to have been
        positive.
   Recommendation: Improve operational planning for the resettlement process, since
   just drafting the documents (PRI) has not sufficed to ensure adoption of best practices.
c. Networking between the PIU/Secretariat and the Government Structure – The
   Program also faced constraints when scheduled activities depended on other public
   agencies such as Legal Affairs and IDACE (the Ceará Agrarian Development
   Institute). Two examples of these constraints are:
   •   Change in Methodology for Payment of Compensations – During its September
       2008 Mission, the Bank was told that the State Attorney General’s Office (PGE)
       had changed procedures for paying compensations. It had decided that all
       compensation payments would be made through court bonds, thus ceasing
       expropriation through the administrative track, which was considered easier and
       had been adopted by the Program up until then.




                                           68
       This decision came at the expense of the affected population since, in order to
       withdraw the money, the land-holder would have to hire a lawyer, making the
       process more expensive and lengthy. The fact that many circuit courts do not have
       resident judges or public defenders also makes the affected population more
       vulnerable.
       As soon as the Bank was told about this change, it contacted the Government to
       explain its impacts and find solutions for the cases where court bonds had already
       been deposited. The Government understood the issues raised by the Bank team
       and resumed the original methodology used for compensation payments under the
       Program, i.e. administrative expropriations, and only resorted to courts when the
       parties were unable to settle or ownership was in doubt.
       It is worth noting that administrative compensation is allowed by Brazilian law
       for expropriations. Even so, there are still some cases pending where court bonds
       were deposited but a settlement was not reached due to constraints the Water
       Resources Secretariat and Government were not able overcome, such as the
       absence of a judge at a circuit court, for example.
   •   Land Tenure in Agrovilas – Land titles have not been issued for all the agrovilas
       delivered, which means that resettled farmers in these settlements will not be
       eligible for farm loans.
       At a meeting at the Gameleira agrovila in April 2012, for example, settlers asked
       for information on land titling procedures because they need the title to gain
       access to rural credit. SRH explained that IDACE, which is in charge of titling,
       had changed its operational procedures and the SRH has not managed to adopt
       these new procedures, thus leading to major delays.
   Recommendation: (i) All actors involved in the Program must participate effectively
   from planning to conclusion, since this is a Government-wide program and not just
   hosted under a single Secretariat. (ii) Since the State Government and the Bank are
   now negotiating a new Program for the State, it would be timely to include land
   tenure for agrovila settlers as part of the Program so as to reduce this social liability.
d. Networking within institutions – In some cases, the Program changed the scope of the
   interventions without, however, ensuring that engineers discussed socio-economic
   impacts with social and legal staff, as seen in the following example:
   • The Mamoeiro dam design was altered when, during the construction process, an
     access road that would run along its left bank was excluded, since the topography
     made it too costly.
       As a result, several affected families who own land in the remaining areas on that
       side of the dam lost access to their land since other neighbors would not allow
       them to pass through their farms.
       The Program did not take measures to make up for the loss, either by building the
       access road or by fully expropriating the affected areas. The loss was therefore not
       duly compensated, which amounts to non-compliance with OP 4.12 policies.




                                            69
   Recommendation: Seek to compensate the losses incurred. Promote greater
   integration among teams through frequent meetings of the entire technical staff.
e. Choice of resettlement areas vs. Sustainability (destination of resettled families) –
   This may be the most sensitive topic to be discussed in this Resettlement Program and
   deserves in-depth reflection by experts. While this document cannot exhaust the
   subject, the issue should be duly analyzed on an impact chart and discussed at length
   with the affected population as part of future, similar Programs in semi-arid regions.
   By following the policy of relocation to sites near the population’s original site, the
   Program tried to identify resettlement sites with the most favorable soil characteristics
   and located as close as possible to their place of residence. Even so, some agrovilas
   and agricultural plots have been placed in areas unsuitable for occupation that do not
   meet minimal requirements for human settlements or agricultural production.
   There are two main reasons for this: (i) the semiarid region has soils unsuitable for
   farming, (ii) the choice made by the Community.
   Even though the scarcity of soils “adequate? for farming makes it hard to identify
   areas with the best production capacity, the technical team carried out surveys and
   searches for “high-yield? lands. Yet the population sometimes chose other areas,
   despite lengthy explanations by the Program team.
   From the standpoint of the resettled population, they are pleased with the location and
   the quality of construction in the agrovilas, since they had moved out of mud houses,
   with no infrastructure and no land of their own, and now mostly live in larger houses
   made of masonry, with infrastructure and titles to agricultural plots. At first glance,
   this is the situation they had desired, but when one assesses the sustainability of
   families in such environments, the fragility of their choice becomes clear. All the
   major efforts and investments have not emancipated these families, which remain
   dependent on income-transfer programs - although they are young - or might
   ultimately end up migrating.
   Currently, the State government can only offer entrepreneurial or capacity-building
   activities to train people who do not depend on the land they live on in order to help
   them achieve financial independence. Fortunately, this is not the situation of all the
   agrovilas built by the Program.

Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard Compliance
21. Under the first phase (six dams), resettlement, particularly the construction of
agrovilas, including housing as well as water and electricity supply, was assigned to the
construction firms. However, given their lack of experience with such requirements, the
construction of agrovilas did not receive the first priority and were substantially delayed.
Also, weak supervision and enforcement of contractual clauses by SRH and lack of
coordination within the state government (such as on providing electric power
connections) contributed to those delays. The emission of new land titles for agrovila lots
by the State Land Institute (IDACE) suffered also long delays. In addition, during the last
years of the first phase, the Borrower changed the procedures for compensation of
expropriated land previously agreed with the Bank, taking away the responsibility from
SRH back to the State’s Public Attorney and causing long delays for landholders to


                                            70
receive fair compensation. This change was corrected at the strong insistence of the
Bank. In the end, however, all resettlement under the first phase was eventually
concluded satisfactorily.
22. Difficulties persist, however, with the resettlement under the AF. Resettlement in two
completed reservoirs (Umari and Jenipapeiro) had been concluded satisfactorily in 2011
and other two (Jatoba and Mamoeiro) were being satisfactorily finalized in December
2012. The agrovila of the Gameleira reservoir suffered long delays. The families were
resettled in January 2011 but only had access to water and energy in December 2012
despite many recommendations and alerts given by the Bank in different supervision
missions in 2011 and 2012. Delays were due to financial problems of some contractors
and to lack of coordination between SRH and the Electricity Company. The titling of lots
had not been done in any of the agrovilas financed by the Project under its two phases
due to the difficult coordination between SRH and IDACE for awarding land titles. In
addition, by December 2012, the Bank was informed that the houses built for the
resettlement in the Umari area were being demolished and rebuilt due to problems with
the quality of construction, which should have been identified during implementation of
works. Therefore, the resettlement safeguard compliance is being rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.
Lessons Learned
23. Government Policy vs Sectoral Program – A program as big as PROGERIR, even
with its well-defined focus on investments in water resources, will invariably have to deal
with social-environmental and other cross-cutting issues. In light of these challenges, the
Program must also be as broad as government policies and not just remain a sectoral
program. As a government policy, it is hoped that problems involving coordinating with
other institutions – which gave rise to so many difficulties during Program
implementation – will be minimized or even eliminated. Another expected outcome
would be to improve results while requiring less work for the Program staff in handling
activities beyond the remit of the SRH, such as business plans and training courses
(which, despite intense efforts, were generally not satisfactory).
24. Preparation of Resettlement Plans (PRIs) is not always enough to ensure a good
relocation process. PRIs were prepared for every dam built, but this did not ensure
suitable resettlement. Resettlement requires adopting specific solutions, monitoring and
oversight.
25. Bidding of Works – The terms of the public bidding provided for the dam and
agrovila to be built by the same company, in order to ensure improved management of
the construction timetable, since earlier projects had run into timing conflicts during
construction. The new, single contract brought improvements, although still below what
was needed. Experience shows that the tender must clearly express the need to have the
houses built, with infrastructure, months before the dam’s spillways are closed and that,
when the agrovila and agricultural lots are subcontracted, contractors must prove they
have the structure and capacity to do the job, thus avoiding disruptions that were
observed during the Program.
26. Closing of floodgates and filling of the reservoir – The service order for these two
activities must only be issued after the complete demolition of buildings on expropriated


                                            71
land, clearing of the area to be flooded and the complete relocation of residents and of the
previous infrastructure (such as power lines, for example).
27. Promotion of Organization – The creation of the CARPA proved to be very
effective and this model should be replicated in similar Programs.
28. Environmental Education – Environmental education under the program should be
extended to cover environmental and health education, so that the new scope will cover
sanitation facilities to be used by resettled residents.
29. The specificity of Agrovila Projects – The Program has shown that agrovilas should
not be designed according to a single, readymade model; rather, each situation must be
approached in light of its specificities and adjustments must be made accordingly, such as
in the layout of sewage piping depending on local soil conditions.
