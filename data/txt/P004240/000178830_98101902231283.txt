}EPORI' AN'D RECOIDhENDATIO; OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO MALAYSIA
FOR TIIE KERATONG LANiD SETTLEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$36.0 million to help finance The
Keratong Land Settlement Project. The loan would have a term of 23 years,
including 8 years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum.
PART I - THlE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report "Development Problems and Prospects of
Malaysia" (No. 217-MA) was distributed in August, 1973. An economic mission
visited Malaysia in January/February 1974, and its report will be circulated
shortly. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GNP of US$477 (1973), Malaysia is one of the
most prosperous developing countries in Southeast Asia. The Malaysian
economy has maintained fairly high rates of growth of GNP in constant
market prices, averaging about 6 percent per annum during the last decade,
notwithstanding rather sharp fluctuations in the prices of major exports,
uncertainties created by political developments, and a relatively slow
growth in investment. At the same time, progress has been made in re-
ducing the dependence on rubber exports through diversification to palm
oil, rapid development of timber resources and growth of manufactured
goods exports. With a ratio of exports to GNP that has remained around
45-50 percent, the balance of payments position is strong. There are few
foreign exchange controls, and external reserves (totalling over US$1.5
billion at the current exchange rate) are equal to about six months' im-
port payments. Malaysia's conservative fiscal and monetary management
has considerably enhanced the country's financial standing. Public sector
revenues have been growing rapidly, mainly as a result of vigorous taxation
efforts; the ratio of total government revenue to GNP is now over 25 percent.
Conservative financial policies are also reflected in the relatively low lev-
el of external public debt and the very low ratio of debt service payments to
foreign exchange receipts (2.5 percent in 1973).
4.        Recent economic developments in Malaysia have been very favorable
from the view point not only of growth but also of income distribution and
employment.  Malaysia's economy boomed in 1973.   GNP in real terms grew by
more than 8 percent. Export earnings increased by more than 50 percent.
Almost all of Malaysia's primary exports benefited substantially from rising
prices brought about by the general world-wide shortage of primary goods.
Rubber prices soared to their highest level since 1962, and with the help
of a 12 percent increase in volume, rubber export earnings - which make up
about 14 percent of the country's GDP - almost doubled over the previous
year. Timber, now Malaysia's second largest export earner, also benefited
from strong demand. In addition to the boom in primary exports, in 1973



-2-
Malaysia's manufacturing exports increased by 46 percent, accounting for
11 percent of total commodity exports.
5.        The major beneficiary of the improvement in the terms of trade
was the agricultural sector. At the same time, the real value added in
agriculture rose at a record rate of 13.5 percent. It is significant that
output and incomes in the smallholder sector rose even faster than the ex-
pansion in the overall agricultural sector.   Much of the increase in rubber
output (18 percent) during 1973 was contributed by the smallholders who now
account for 55 percent of rubber production. Paddy farmers also benefited
from a sharp rise in rice prices and a further increase of 8 percent in rice
output. The sustained increase in smallholder agriculture is the result of
(a) large new land developments in rubber and oil palm earmarked for the
landless laborers or the very small holders, (b) substantial rubber replant-
ings, and (c) increased irrigation in rice growing areas. What distinguished
1973 from earlier years was that the gains in output were translated for the
first time into substantial increments in incomes for the great bulk of the
rural population (during 1962 - 1972 overall growth in real income was not
much higher than 4 percent per annum). If the prices of rubber, palm oil
and rice remain strong in the foreseeable future, a substantial reduction
in rural poverty should be possible in Mlalaysia, provided the momentum of
the Government's agricultural programs is maintained.
6.        Inflation has emerged as Malaysia's primary economic concern
during the last year and a half. After a decade of remarkable price sta-
bility (with consumer prices rising on average only 1 percent per annum),
two years ago domestic prices began to show a noticeable upward trend.
Average consumer prices in 1972 were 3.2 percent higher than in 1971 and
they jumped 10.5 percent in 1973. An even steeper rate is of inflation is
expected for 1974. Price pressures have been the result of both imported
inflation and demand factors.   Nothwithstanding the upward revaluation of the
Malavsian dollar vis-a-vis the currencies of all major trading partners,
import prices hlave been rising sharply.  Demand pressures resulting largely
from rapid export expansion accompanied by a dramatic improvement in the
terns of trade were evidenced by the growth in real national income of
over 16 percent during 1973 compared with less than 2 percent per annum
during 1971-72. This dramatic rise is explained mainly by the movement in
the terms of trade; tihe loss from terms of trade deterioration amounting to
8 percent of GNP during 1971-72 was entirely recouped during 1973. Considering
that the growth in demand during the last year was unprecedented, and that
strong cost pressures were operating from the import side, the extent of in--
flation in Malaysia is not at all surprising.   Other East Asian countries,
notably Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines, are currently experi-
encing higher rates of domestic inflation than Ralaysia.
7.        Malaysia has not been adversely affected by the high rcc     ut
petroleum and in "he longer term should benefit from it.   In '973 Maiay-las
production of crude petroleum was about 100,000 barrels per day, or 4.5 mil-
lion long tons a year. In about four years time, production is expected to



-3-
increase five-fold. In 1973 Malaysia was still a net importer of petroleum
products, at a net cost of about US$40 million; however, by 1977 Malaysia
is expected to become a net exporter of petroleum products. Substantial
reserves of natural gas are also available and in the next few years lique-
fied natural gas will become an important foreign exchange earner, further
strengthening the country's balance of payments position.
8.        During the last several years the Government's long-term planning
has concentrated on the problem of reducing the economic disparity between
the Malays, who account for a little over half the population, and non-
Malays of whom about 71% are Chinese. Over the next 20 years the Government
aims to eradicate poverty and to restructure society so that the present
identification of race with economic activity will be eliminated. These
objectives are spelled out in the New Economic Policy which was announced in
June 1971. The basic outlines of the Policy are sound and allow for continued
growth for each of the principal ethnic groups while at the same time enlarging
economic opportunities for Malays. This policy is expected to be carried out
by the second Malaysian plan (1971-75).
9.        The Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75) indicates the Government's
willingness to step up the public sector's development effort. The public
sector's planning and implementation capacity has been expanded although
several planning and operating agencies still suffer from substantial man-
power shortages. The improvement in the Government's capacity to prepare
and execute projects resulted in expenditures during the first three years
of the Plan period that already exceeded the original plan allocation of
US$2 billion. The revised Plan level of US$4 billion anticipates a further
strengthening of project identification and implementation in the public
sector. Most of the increased allocation is earmarked to support the New
Economic Policy, including among other items (i) the expansion of the land
settlement programs to provide employment opportunities and help raise rural
income, (ii) increased support to the manufacturing sector to diversify the
economy and to provide increased employment in higher income jobs, and
(iii) the provision of training and education to upgrade the skills of the
low-income groups.
10.       During the first three years of the Second Malaysia Plan, 1971-73,
total public sector development expenditures amounted to about US$2.2 bil-
lion, of which 50 percent was financed by net domestic borrowing and 16 per-
cent by net foreign borrowing. The balance was financed largely by current
surpluses. The Bank has provided a little under 40 percent of the foreign
loan commitments; bilateral aid, mainly from the United Kingdom, other Com-
monwealth countries, The Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, and loans from
the Asian Development Bank, provided the rest. Domestic financing is con-
sidered adequate. In addition to a satisfactory level of revenues, the
Government can readily borrow substantial amounts from domestic resources,
notably the Government Employees' Provident Fund. For the next 5 years annual
disbursements of about US$170 million of public medium and long term loans
from abroad will be required. To support this inflow, new foreign loan
commitments of approximately US$1.8 billion will be required over the 5 year
period. Commitments are expected to come from the same sources as in the



-4-
past with an increase in Japanese lending, and there are prospects of assist-
ance from the Middle East. Commitments from the Bank wili drop from about
40 percent to about one-third of the total.   The number of projects to which
Bank financing will contribute will increase. The Bank will continue to
cover a portion of local costs in agriculture and in such other sectors where
the foreign exchange content of projects is small. But in these cases Bank
financing will be limited to about 35 percent of the total project costs,
compared with 50 percent in the past.
11.       The expected level of foreign borrowing is well within Malaysia's
debt servicing capacity. Debt service obligations at present are about 2.5
percent of exports of goods and non-factor services and are estimated to rise
to only about 3 percent during the late 1970's. The Bank's share in Malaysia's
debt service payments is 22 percent and is expected to be about 23 percent by
the end of 1978.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
12.       The Bank has made 27 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport. Although
in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of these projects has
generally been satisfactory. As of July 31, 1974 the loans to Malaysia held
by the Bank amounted to US$496.4 million. In addition, the Bank made a loan
in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Loan 405-MA), guaranteed
by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project. The amount held by the
Bank under that loan is US$5.0 million, Eight loans are fully disbursed.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as
of July 31, 1974 and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
13.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is intended to support the Govern-
ment's efforts within the framework of the New Economic Policy to redress
imbalances in rural and urban incomes, to create employment for the urban
unemployed, and to reduce rural underemployment. Since Malaysia's agricul-
tural development programs, including land development, irrigation and ag-
ricultural credit, provide the most effective Government instruments for
tackling unemployment and income imbalances, the Bank will continue to give
financial support to these programs. So far, the Bank has made three loans
for land settlement projects in the Jengka Triangle area where about 100,000
acres of land are being developed and about 10,000 smallholders are being
settled and one loan for land settlement in the State of Johore where about
4,500 families will be settled. The Bank has also made two loans for irri-
gation, one for the Miuda Irrigation Project (Loan 434-14A) and another for
the Kemubu Irrigation Project (Loan 500-MA) both projects assisting low
income rice growers, and a loan for the improvement of drainage in Western
Johore to improve existing smallholders productivity. In addition, the Bank
will continue to assist Malaysia in the critical field of education to in-
crease educational opportunities for the rural poor. Also, the Bank will
continue to assist in the financing of infrastructure development that will



-5-
improve conditions in the urban areas and help support manufacturing. The
Bank has helped the Government to prepare projects either in the course of
its lending operations or by acting as Executing Agency for NiDP-financed
studies. The Bank has also helped to strengthen public agencies responsi-
ble for carrying out important parts of Malaysia's investment program. We
will continue this policy, which will be reflected in the loans to be pre-
sented to the Executive Directors in the next year or so. These loans would
be for projects involving agricultural development, agricultural credit, ag-
ricultural research, land settlement, public utilities and infrastructure
development.
14.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made five
investments totalling US$8.7 million (Annex II). The total commitments
under those investments neld by IFC as of July 31, 1974 amounted to
US$3.1 million.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN MALAYSIA
General
15.       The agricultural sector holds an important position in the Malaysian
economy. In 1972 it generated around 30 percent of gross domestic product,
provided employment for over 50 percent of the economically active population,
and accounted for about 60 percent of Malaysia's foreign exchange earnings.
Expansion of rubber exports in the 1960's, in the face of declining prices,
was achieved by large gains in productivity. At the same time, crop diver-
sification, mainly to oil palm, was vigorously encouraged and has resulted
in Malaysia becoming the world's largest producer of palm oil. Rice produc-
tion has been increased by half through the provision of irrigation, and
tialaysia is now nearing self-sufficiency. Malaysia is second only to Taiwan
as an exporter of pineapple but is finding it increasingly difficult to main-
tain her share of the market. Other major crops, such as coconut, coffee,
fruits and vegetables, are grown mainly for internal consumption.
16.       While Malaysia is relatively prosperous, some sections of its
population are economically depressed. Whereas the per capita income for
Malaysia in 1971 was about US$400, for agriculture it was only about half
of that amount. Limited data are available on the size of rural income
distribution by type of activities, but it would appear that the smaller
paddy and rubber producers in particular had incomes of only about US$70-90
per capita.
17.       The main emphases of agricultural policy are, on the one hand, to
resettle landless rural unemployed and marginal smallholders on viable hold-
ings planted with oil palm, rubber and other crops and, on the other hand,
to raise the incomes of existing potentially viable smallholdings by pro-
viding infrastructure and agricultural services. As mentioned in paragraph
12 the Bank is helping finance four land settlement projects which are pro-
ceeding very satisfactorily. In support of the Government's second objective,



- 6 -
the Bank has also helped to finance two irrigation projects to increase paddy
production. Disbursements have been completed and agricuitural production
increases exceed estimates made at appraisal.   A nmajor study, undertaken by
the FAOiIBRD Cooperative Program, is presently analysing the impact of che
projects on the local economy and income ltevels. The results of the study,
expected shortly, sliould assist the Government in tackling the land tenure
problem in the area. The Bank has also made a loan, as stated in paragraph
13 for drainage and agricultural development to improve the existinig small-
holders' productivity.
Agricultural Institutions
18.       Over the last ten years Government has substantially strengthened
and restructured the institutions dealing withi agriculture.  Tle major illsti-
tution responsible for land settlement is the Federal Land Development Author-
ity (FELDA) whiich is currently engaged in a program of developing about
-100,000 acres of land and settling some 70O00 families annually. Other land
settlenment programs are being undertalcen by the individual states and by the
Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA) which, in addi-
tion, is responsible for replanting assistance to rubber smallholders, Agri-
cultural researclh has recently been consolidated in tne Malaysian Agricul--
tural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) aad the Bank is considering
helping- finance a comprehensive research program covering most of the exist-
ing s-allholders' crops. The Department of Agriculture is responSible for
all extension services but Farmers Organizations (FO's) are being established
to assist development in all smallholder areas throughout Malaysia. A Farmers
Organization Authority (FOA) was recently created to supervise the manage-
ment of the FO's.   All the FO's are Government-financed and the finance is
channelled througlh the FOA. The nain source of rural credit is the Ba:ak
Pertanian Malaysia (BP11) with loan processinlg and disbursements beinc handled
by the FO's for a small fee.  This system has worked well in the cvio BRall_-
assisted irrigation projects.
.and Deelopment and Settlement
9),       Since the early !960s, Government has given high priority to land
development and settlement, to provide economically viable farm uni.s to
families farming at close to subsistence level and to relieve urban and
rural unemployment.  The maajor public sector programs have been carried out
by FELDA and by State Governments. The target for new land developr-nt under
the SMP is i million acres of whlici 750,000 acres will be developec X'i Pel;l-
sular Malaysia.
20.       Thie Government prepared several comprelhensive region;al La,sd d.,ve -
opment. plans. 'Thie first of these was for the Jengha Triangl-e i- l;e i
of Palhang, where FELDA is developing about 100,000 acres of oil palin
rubber, partly financed by three Bank loans (MA 533,672,885).    <. e saco,id
is the 730,000 acres Johore 'Ienggara region, where the Bank as    p-ng to
finance another FELDA project developing about 65,000 acres o ol I



-7-
A third plan is the development of 2.5 million acres in Pahang Tenggara,
where the proposed project is situated. Similar planning studies are cur-
rently being carried out in Kelantan and Sarawak.
Z1.       The settlement schemes have achieved varied success depending
largely on the effectiveness of the project identification and planning
process and the efficiency of management. State organized schemes have
generally not been as good as the much better organized and managed FELDA
schemes. The average size of smallholdings outside organized development
schemes is currently around 4 acres, although there is a wide diversity
between regions, due to differences in local land availability, population
pressure and other factors. Without income from other sources, these hold-
ings are too small to be viable at projected palm oil and rubber prices.
The consolidation of fragmented and overly small holdings into viable units
remains of high priority and is the focus of programs under the Federal Land
Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) and the Rubber Industry
Smallholders' Development Authority (RISDA). Their target acreages under
the SMP are 100,000 acres and 150,000 acres respectively. FELDA smallholder
oil palm holdings have increased from 10 acres allotted to settlers in the
1960s to 14 acres since experience has shown that family labor is under-
utilized on smaller holdings. Even this will not meet the employment needs
of the family completely. liowever, it would provide the smallholder with
an income during loan repayment which would be considerably higher than the
wage income of an unskilled laborer in the urban areas.
The Pahang Tenggara Regional Master Plan Study
22.       A comprehensive analysis of the natural resources and land use
in Peninsular Malaysia was undertaken during the First Malaysia Plan period
(1966-70). It led to the identification of several large areas of forested
land with considerable potential for agricultural development -- among them
Pahang Tenggara located in the southeastern part of the State of Pahang and
witlh a total area of about 2.5 million acres. A Master Plan Study was car-
ried out between July 1970 and July 1972 by a consortium of Canadian con-
sultants. It recommended the development up to 1990 of about 530,000 acres
for agriculture, mainly oil palm and rubber. This was in addition to the
approximately 440,000 acres allocated before the commencement of the study,
where development already was progressing. Two integrated logging and
timber processing complexes were also recommended. Feasibility studies
were undertaken by the consultants for specific projects, including the
proposed one. Total public sector costs through 1990 for the development
of Pahang Tenggara were estimated at about US$380 million in 1971 prices,
of which 75% was to be expended during the 1970's. About one third of the
total would be for FELDA development.
23.       A major feature of the Master Plan is the proposed establishment
of a large number of new towns for the approximately 500,000 people who are
to settle in the region before 1990. Thirty of the proposed 38 new settle-
ments would each have a population of more than 5,000 by 1990 and the largest



- 8-
town, Bukil Ridan, would have about 70,000 persons.  The development of the
second largest town, Keratong town, would be initiated under the proposed
project and it would eventually have about 36.000 persons. The concentra-
tion of smaliholders to be settled tnder government land de-velopment schemes
in urban settlements rather than dispersed villages follows the government's
New Economic Policy which has as one of its aims, to urbanize the Malay popu-
lation and to direct urban growth away from a few large cities to medium-
sized towns. Similar new towns are being developed in the Jengka Triangle
and in Johore Tenggara.  While the feasibility of FELDA's land settlement
schemes as agricultural development projects is well tested, the effective-
ness of concentrated FELDA settlements in the establishment of new towns is
yet to be proven. Furtlhermore, the impact of conzentrated urban-type settle-
ment on the agricultural efficiency OE FELDA schemes requlires careful monitor-
ing.  FELDA's participation in the planned developrae-nt of new towns in Pahang
Tenggara thus adds new risks as well as benefits to these land settlement
schemes.  The Pahang Tenggara Development Authority (DARA) which was estab-
lishied in 1972 to implement the master Plan has been. equipped with wide
powers to promote a pattern of regional development including agro-business
and manufacturing which would reinforce the denmand for urban services which
is to be derived from concentrated FELOA schem.es.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The proposed project forms a part of the development proposed
in the Pahang Tenggara Regional Master Plan Study and conisists of:
Part A:   (1)  clearing of about 63QO00 acres of land and planting
and maintenance of about 55,000 acres of oil pal-ns;
(2)  constructioni of two pa:Lm oil mills;
Part B:   Establishment of two urban settlements including
(i) housing for about :3,400 settler families, man-
agement and support staff of FELDA, and admirlistra-
tion buildings, and (ii) schools, community centers
and other communal facilities, and about 77 miles ot
local roads and necessary infrastructure.
Urban Settlement Strategy
25.       FELDA settlers would concentrate in 2 main towns: Cieraccng town
(Town 22)  with 2,556 settler families in ,' residential ieighbothoods (oae
for each agricultural scheme), and Town 21 with 817 settler fasizilies in 2
neiglhborhoods.  The 7 scheme neighborhoods in Keratong town wrTould surrouid
an urbani core where civic and comiercial facilities that would saCrhe tne
southiwest subregion of Pahang Tenggara would be located.  The urban coe of
Keratong town is not included in the Bank project but it is ex)ected that



- 9 -
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will finance it. Project appraisal by ADB
was completed in July. There will be continued close consultation between the
Government and the Bank to ensure the well continued development of Keratong
town (Section 4.07 of draft Loan Agreement).
26.       Due to favorable topographic conditions, the project area is com-
pact and it is feasible to concentrate the settlers in only two settlements
without causing substantially higlher settler transport requirements than in
other recent land settlement projects. A more dispersed settlement pattern
than the proposed one would lead to an increase in infrastructure costs
(access roads and water transmission lines) substantially larger than the
savings in settler transportation costs (larger by a factor of seven if one
village were to be located in the center of each scheme).
27.       The total population by 1990 is projected at about 36,000 for
Keratong town and 7,000 for Town 21. By the time the labor requirements
on the agricultural schemes decrease, which coincides with the time when
the settler children enter the labor force, the town economies should be
able to absorb this additional work force. The unemployment problems and
the out-migration experienced in older and smaller FELDA settlements would
not occur. However, to achieve these targets a strong and active develop-
ment authority with the capacity to closely monitor and initiate develop-
ment is required. Pahang Tenggara Development Authority (DARA), if further
strengthened, would be satisfactory (see paras 36 and 37).
Ecology
28.       Land development within the project area would be carried out in
conformity with the Malaysian Conservation Act which provides an adequate
safeguard against erosion, siltation and excessive flooding. The FELDA
project area is confined entirely to the undulating or low hilly lands
containing soils of proven suitability for tree crop and town site devel-
opment, and excludes the steeper land areas where a multiple land use pol-
icy based on permanent forestry would be retained. Those areas of forest
which have marketable timber potential will be worked on a sustained yield
basis using an assisted regeneration system of forest improvement.   A per-
manent forest reserve area will serve an essential water conservation role
by safeguarding the regularity of run-off required to meet the increasing
internal demand for water supplies within the settled portions of the re-
gion. It will also afford a sanctuary for the wild life which, at least
temporarily, may be driven out of the area cleared for agriculture. Section
3.05 of the draft Loan Agreement provides that the Government shall take all
necessary action to ensure that in carrying out the project appropriate
environmental standards are fully observed.
29.       Processing mills would be sited at appropriate distances away
from residential areas, in proximity to adequate water supplies, to reduce
the consequences of pollution from effluents (a subject which is being
given close attention by MARDI). Natural forest would be retained as



- 10 -
river bank reserves within the areas of agricultural development to avoid
erosion of river banks and the pollution by chemical fertilizers being
washAed into thie river.
Organization and Management
(i) Role of FELDA
30.       The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) would be responsi-
ble for carrying out the land development and settlement part of the pro-
posed project. FELDA, a government-owned corporation under the Ministry
of ilational and Rural Development, was created in 1956 and has steadily
expanded its operations since the early 1960's. By June 1973 it had devel-
oped about 430,000 acres and settled some 27,500 fanlilies. During the Second
Mialaysia Plan (1971-1975), FELDA is expected to develop about 400,000 acres.
31.       FELDA's administrative costs are met by government grants.    So
far, about 90% of development costs have been finanned by government loans,
thie balance through tlhree IBRD loans for tihe Jengka Triangle Projects and
an ADB loan. The spread between the average cost of FELDA's borrowings and
its termis of cost recovery from settlers is sufficient to generate working
capital and reserves for contingencies.
32.       As a result of a study by management consultants during 1971/72,
FELDA's field administration has been decentralized and headquarters manage-
ment has been strengthened and reorganized.   A].so, cormiputerization of ac-
countinig and financial control systems was initiatecl and, after initial dif-
ficulties, is now operating satisfactorily.
33.       The project will be controlled from the FELDA North Johore/Keratong
Office, established in 1973 as FELDA's eighth regional office. The area
controller in charge of this office would advise on the selection of contractors
amd supervise their performance. and would coordiuate infrastructure and
public building construction with the respect;ve Federal or State agencies.
Tlhe office would manage the project, keep accounts, train settlers, and
coordinate harvesting and transportation of oil palm fruits to mills.
34.       The area controller reports directly to the Deputy Director Gen-
eral for Field Administration at headquarters, and maintains close contact
with the Agricultural Services Director on all agricultural matters.    A
manager would be in charge of each 5,000 to 7,000 acres scheme and would
be supported by an assistant manager) about four field supervisors., and
about eight field assistants at full development on each scheme. FEL'DA
experience has shown this staffing plan appropriate and feasible          -
tion to the present recruitment and training programs.
(ii) Role of DARA
35.       The Pahang Tenggara Development Authority (DARA) -- a neviy estab-
lished joint State and Central Government statutory authority    -  '.'l1 b'



responsible for the detailed planning and implementation of the many other
componenits of the Master Plan on which the proposed project depends -- such
as the construction of the access highways and the development of the core
of the Keratong town. DARA's main constraint at present is its shortage of
qualified staff.
36.       As indicated in para 26, the success of the urban development
strategy will depend largely on the ability of DARA to initiate and monitor
thie development plans. Section 3.03 of the Draft Loan Agreement provides,
therefore, that the Mlalaysian Government shall cause DARA to furnish to the
Bank essential information relating to part B (ii) of the project falling
within the responsibility of DARA (see para 24).
37.       At present, DARA has only about 15 management and professional
staff. It is estimated that, by the end of the Third 'Nalaysian Plan (1980),
an additional 60-70 professionals would be required to enable DARA to carry
out its responsibilities. Thus, a strengthening of DARA's staff is essen-
tial to ensure satisfactory project implementation. Section 4.06 of the
Draft Loan Agreement provides that the Malaysian Government insure that
DAtRA takes all necessary action to strengthen its staff including the employ-
ment witiiin six months of the date of the agreement of at least five
specialists who will assist DARA in carrying out its responsibilities,
particularly as tthey relate to regional/urban economics, social planning,
engineering and public finance.  It is expected that the Government would
obLain financing for technical assistance for the above experts from the
Asian Development Bank, as part of a loan for urban infrastructure development
in Pahang Tenggara (see para 25).
Settler Selection and Settlement Procedures
38.       Settlers will be recruited mainly among landless peasants, poor
smalliholders or ex-servicemen who own less than two acres of land to be
eligible. Interviews are carried out in two stages, first at the district
level and thien at the national level; the final selection is based on a
points systenm which takes account of age and family circumstances, experience
and capabilities, land ownership and educational level.
39.       In executing the project, marketable timber in ttie area would be
extracted prior to the land clearing wilich would be done one year in advance
of planting.  Clearing, planting of oil palns and initial upkeep for up to
18 months after planting would be carried out by private contractors, using
mostly manual labor, supervised by FELDA staff. Settlers, who would arrive
18 montlhs after planting, would continue the upkeep under FELDA supervision.
Prior to their arrival, town sites would be cleared and housing, offices,
shops, workshops, and other structures would be built by contractors employed
by FELDA. The appropriate departments of Government would provide water sup-
ply to each village and construct and operate the educational, health and
other communal facilities.  About 77 miles of local roads would be built by
a regional branch of the Federal Public Works Department (PWD) and maintained



- 12 -
by the State PWD. Standards of both are considered adequate. The two palm
oil mills included in the project would be owned and managed by FELDA.
40.       The settlers' homes (unit cost US$735) are constructed by private
contractors, employed by FELDA. The design is relatively simple but accom-
modations are satisfactory. The house plan provides for expansion as set-
tlers' incomes increase. This modified sites and services approach is work-
ing well in older FELDA settlements.
41.       FELDA's approach in executing the land settlement projects as
described in paras 37, 38 and 39 have proven to be very successful in the
past. Detailed planning, dynamic organization and efficient management
ihave consistently produced fruitful results. The rates of return from
chese investments have been very favorable.
tost and Financing of Project
42.       Project costs during the development period from 1974 through
1982 are estimated at US$98.7 million with a foreign exchange component
of about US$26.6 million, equivalent to about 27 percent of project costs.
These estimates include contingencies of about US$33.4 million. The pro-
posed Bank loan of US$36.0 million would meet about US$22.0 mrdllion, in-
cluding contingencies, of the foreign exchange cost and part of the local
currency cost of the project. As in the case of four previous Bank loans
for land settlement projects, the proposed loan would be made to the Gov-
ernment to be on-lent to FELDA on the same terms and conditions as the
Bank loan. Remaining project costs of US$62.1 million, including the re-
maining foreign exchange of US$3.8 million for town infrastructure, public
buildings and management, would be met by: (a) A Government loan to FELDA
of USU39.2 million (at 5-1/2 percent over 25 years, includinig 10 years of
grace); (b) direct Government expenditure of US$15.7 rmillion for roads,
water supply and public buildings; and (c) Government grants to FELDA of
US$7.8 million for administration.
43.       Each settler would be indebted to FELDA for agricultural develop-
ment costs and housing. Loans to settlers would be at 6-1/4 percent per
annum and repayable over 21 years, including 6 years of grace, covering the
development period, during whichi interest would be capitalized.   Investment
in mill construction and equipment would be recovered by a processing fee
sufficient to cover costs and generate a reasonable return on investment.
Management costs, which are similar to extension services, would be recov-
ered by a levy raised when settlers' income exceeds the target of M$ 3,600
(US$1470) per year. At present prices, management costs are fully covered.
The only element of subsidy involved in the project is the lower cost of
interest charged to settlers which is about 3 to 4 percentage points lower
than the commercial rates.  This interest rate subsidy has been consistent
with the Government's income policy in the sniallholder sector and necessary
to offer satisfactory incentives for settlers to contribute their labor to



- 13 -
the task of opening up new land. However, in view of high palm oil prices and
ex-pected hiig  level of settlers' incomes, the Government will review its
policy with respect to settlers subsidies and its proposal will be submitted
for the Bank's comments before December 31, 1975 (Section 4.08 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
44.       Contracts with an aggregate estimated value of US$36.2 million
net of contingencies would be let under international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. These would include land clearing, plant-
ing, houses, office buildings, and upgrading of roads and culverts (US$22.6
million); palm oil mill machinery and construction (US$15.2 million); and
vehicles and equipment (US$0.8 million). Since sufficient contractor capac-
i ty specializing in clearing, planting and construction is available in
lalaysia, these contracts are likely to be awarded to local contractors.
A range of goods required for the project, such as palm oil mill compo-
nents and vehicles, is manufactured in Malaysia; local manufacturers would
be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent, or the actual customs duty,
whiclhever is lower.
45.       As in previous FELDA Projects, fertilizers and pesticides (US$20.2
million) would be procured through competitive bidding based on local adver-
tising. Several international producers are represented in Malaysia, and
FELDA has established an effective fertilizer and pesticides supply system
which services its entire land settlement program. It would, therefore,
not be practical or economical to establish a separate procurement system
for the proposed project. Road construction, water supply systems and
public buildings (US$15.0 million), to be financed by the Government, would
be constructed by the PWD on force account.
46.       The remaining costs of US$24.9 million are direct FELDA expendi-
tures such as on salaries, settlers' wages during the development period
a:nd planting material.
47.       Disbursements would be made against (a) 60 percent of the total
costs of land clearing and planting, upgrading agricultural roads, housing
and house lot development and palm oil mill construction and machinery;
(b) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of imported fertilizers,
pesticides, vehicles and equipment; and (c) 100 percent of the ex-factory
price of these items if manufactured locally and 80 percent of total
expenditures if they are imported but procured locally. To avoid delays in
the implementation of the project some contracts for and land clearing have
been let since August 15. The value of such advance contracts does not
exceed US$2.5 million. No retroactive financing is involved.
Benefits and Justification
48.       The proposed project forms a vital part of the development strategy
for the Pahang Tenggara region. It would support Government plans to achieve



- 14 -
high rates of growth in smallholder agriculture through land development and
settlement thereby reducing unemployment and underemployment and increasing
incomes of the rural population. Settlers' average yearly incomes would rise
from the equivalent of about US$355 before they join the scheme to about
US$2,650 after they finislh loan repayments, based on a price for fresh fruit
bunches of US$88.0 per ton, roughly half the present level.
49.       The project will establish two vital urban growth centers in the
region, the larger of which will be the civic and commercial center for the
southwest subregion.   These growth centers will help redirect the migration
-o a number of medium-sized towns rather than to a few principal cities.
>-e. will bring additional. long term benefits to the settlers and their
.ependents, who will enjoy a broad range of employment opportunities when
the towns reach maturity.   About 3,800 persons will be permanently employed
on the plantation schemes and in the mills; an average of about 5,000 workers
will be directly employed during the development period.    After the devel-
opment period, the growth of production and incomes would generate significant
induced employment, locally and in the region.
50.       Settlement cost of US$16,900 per settler family is economically
justified.  These costs are high in comparison with other Bank projects of
this type.  11owever, this project is geared toward the production of high
value export crops which require relatively high investments.    The estimated
economic rate of return of 23 percent for this project compares favorably
with similar projects financed by the Bank. The growth of the Malaysian
economy and the reduction of unemployment and underemployment depends t:o a
large extent on land development. FELDA with its unique expertise has proven
to be very successful its past schemes while other lower cost schemes in
Malaysia have been less successful. Furthermore, under Malaysian conditions,
oil palm is an ideal crop to open up land because it allows planting and
cultivation on roughly prepared land with little, if any, detriment to the
soil.  Finally, since most of the benefits of the project will accrue to
settlers who are in the lower 40 percent of underprivileged Malaysians, the
distributional impact of the project is clearly favorable.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMEWTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and FELDA, the Report of the Comrmittee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project; US$14.0 Million Loan of
April 17, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Loan No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0 Million
Loan of March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projects consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of
62,000 acres of oil palms and 35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of
10,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA), responsible for the execution of the project,
operates efficiently and its standard of planting and maintenance is high.
The first project (533-MA) has been completed. Cost overruns are estimated
to have been about US$5 million or 20 percent of appraisal cost estimates, of
which about US$3 million is due to the US$ devaluation. The Second Jengka
Project (672-MA) is also mostly completed. But, due to timber shortages, the
housing program is somewhat behind schedule. Cost overruns are estimated at
about US$3.5 million or 10 percent of appraisal cost estimates of which about
US$3 million is due to the US dollar devaluation. In terms of economic via-
bility, improved prospects for palm oil and rubber prices have fully compen-
sated for cost overruns on both projects. The Third Jengka project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily and is somewhat ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 673   Jengka Forestry Project; US$8.5 Million Loan of May 20, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Because of the departure of several members of the projects
managerial staff, this project is facing difficulties. The Government is
now looking into the possibility of a joint ventures as a means of solving
the management problem. A consultant is presently in Malaysia to update
technical coefficients and Bank mission is expected to visit Malaysia in
September to review the situation. In the meantime, the Closing Date of
this loan has been postponed to December 31, 1974 to allow for completion
of disbursements. As of July 31, 1974 about US$297,000, although all
committeed, still remained undisbursed. The original Closing Date was
June 30, 1974.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the un-
derstanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 700   Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 16, 1970; Closing Date: January 31, 1975
Implementation of the project consisting of extensions to existing
thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system were delayed because
of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying structural steel and
turbo-alternators. The Closing Date of this loan will have to be extended.
Loan No. 753   Second Telecommunications Project; US$18.7 Million Loan
of June 21, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The program of expansion has been revised by TDM to accord with
current estimates of their needs. Procurement of goods required for the
project is progressing satisfactorily. About 26,000 lines of local ex-
change and 6,000 lines of long-distance exchange equipment have been in-
stalled. The project is expected to be completed by June 1977, about one
and one half years behind schedule.
Loan No. 561   Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$3.6 Million Loan
of September 27, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project has been completed after initial delays because the
main civil works contract had to be retendered following the death of the
main contractor and the liquidation of his firm. Costs were within the
original estimates. However, the Closing Date had to be postponed for a
third time to December 31, 1 974 to allow for the payment of retention
monies. The original Closing Date was September 1, 1972.
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project consists of the expansion of facilities to provide
piped water supply to parts of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley which do not
have a public supply and to meet increasing demand in the project area. The
facilities will include an earth dam on the Langat River to form a reservoir
to regulate the river flow. When field surveys were made for the detailed
design, the consultant found that the 175 feet height of the dam originally
planned had to be raised by 9 feet. The completion of the dam, but not the
other components of the project, is expected to be delayed by about one year
to late 1978. The project cost is presently estimated at about 30 percent
more than the appraisal estimate due to the increased cost of the dam and
adoption of a higher allowance for inflation, but no difficulties are fore-
seen in raising the additional funds required.

Loan No. 599   Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of
May 23, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Originally scheduled construction has been completed at 20 of 21
project schools and the quality of the completed buildings is good. A new
site was necessary for one remaining agricultural school and has been agreed
by the Bank. Tenders for its construction will be invited shortly but con-
struction is not expected to be completed before mid-1976. The Closing Date
of December 31, 1974 will therefore need to be extended by 2-1/2 years when
about US$0.5 million of the loan may remain uncommitted. Disbursements have
been slow because of administrative delays in the Public Works Department,
Sabah; only one-third of the loan funds expected to be needed have been dis-
bursed to date.
Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Project implementation is about 12 months behind schedule due
to delays in the appointment of consultant architects for the University of
Penang but is now improving. Master, site and sketch plans for the Science
Schools of the Penang University have been agreed; they will be incorporated
in the final drawings which should be ready by mid-May, 1974. The prepara-
tion of contract documents for the remaining project schools and the Curri-
culum Development Center is at an advanced stage and construction has started
in some cases. Due to rapid increases in the cost of building materials,
project costs are likely to exceed appraisal estimates.
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1976
Rises in prices of building materials, fuel and labor are expected
to increase the project cost from the forecast M$ 67 million to M$ 78 mil-
lion. Construction problems and building materials shortages will delay
completion by 7-9 months until July-September 1975, but it is hoped to have
one or two berths available for use at the ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan
by October 1974, thus eliminating the effect of delays on port operations.
Operating efficiency has deteriorated during the latter part of 1973, partic-
ularly at Kota Kinabalu. However, overall traffic increased in 1973 and in
1974 to date. Financial results for 1973 and budgeted and forecast results
for the years 1974-77 are substantially as forecast.   The Authority's present
financial position is good, but rising costs, including customs duties and
sales taxes on materials, and further investment requirements, may impose a
burden over the next two or three years.

Loan No. 799   Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of
February 11, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project includes mainly equipment and works for a dieseliza-
tion program of the Malayan Railways (MR). Implementation is behind sched-
ule by about one year because of the Railways' management problems and its
initial unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement procedures. MR has now
hired consultants to help it in improving its management.
Loan No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$16.0 Million
Loan of July 20, 1972; Closing Date: April 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve access to Kuala Lumpur from
the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. Project implementation is behind sched-
ule mainly because of the management problems of the main contractor. The
Government and the contractor are expected to take remedial measures shortly.
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of
February 9, 1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The project is designed to assist Malaysia in achieving low
birth and population growth rates and thus to contribute to an increase
in per capita income growth and in the long run to ease the unemployment
problem. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is
providing US$4.3 million in the form of a grant to finance certain compo-
nents of the project. Progress is satisfactory after initial difficulties
in coordinating activities of the Government agencies involved, which has
delayed loan dibursement.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of
August 22, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Three of five construction contracts are underway by two Korean
contractors and a joint venture of a Malaysian and a Singapore firm. All
these contracts experienced initial delays, but action has been taken to
remedy the situation. Bids for the fourth contract are expected shortly.
The Government has decided to defer the tendering of the fifth contract
under the project to avoid overheating of the local construction market
and thereby keep construction cost down. In line with worldwide trends,
construction costs have escalated sharply and the Government now antici-
pates actual costs to be about 20 percent higher than the appraisal esti-
mates (including contingencies). The Government and the Bank have agreed
on road sections for detailed engineering under the project and the Govern-
ment has invited consultants to submit proposals. Three urban development
studies have started.
Loan No. 967   Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million
Loan of February 27, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
This loan became effective on April 18 and the project is on
schedulee.

Loan No. 973   Western Johore Agricultural Development Project; US$45.0
Minlion Loan of April 5. 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project consists of construction and improvement of drainage
facilities over about 330,000 acres of land in the Western part of the State
of Johore. The project also includes an extensive agricultural development
program including changes in cropping patterns, introduction of new agro-
nomic techniques and provision of agricultural supporting services. The
loan was signed on April 5, 1974 and on August 14 became effective.
Loan No. 974   Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of
April 5. 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project consists of the following: (i) seven secondary schools,
(ii) four teacher training colleges, (iii) one polytechnic, (iv) one junior
college, and (v) educational television and radio. The loan was signed on
April 5, 1974. It became effective on June 26, 1974.
Loan No. 1031: Sixth Power Project; US$45.0 Million Loan of
JulY 25, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This loan was signed on July 25 and is not yet effective.

Procurement Arrangements:      All items financed under the Bank loan other
than pesticides and fertilizers would be pro-
cured under international competitive bidding
for a total of US$40.2 million excluding con-
tingencies; local equipment manufacturers would
be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent
or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower.
Fertilizers and pesticides amounting to US$21.1
million would be procured through competitive
bidding based on local advertising (foreign
companies are well represented).
Rate of Return:                The economic rate of return of the project is
estimated to be 23 percent. The project would
generate: (a) 3,800 permanent jobs; (b) an
average of 5,000 jobs rduring the development
period; and (c) significant induced employment,
locally and in the region. The incomes of the
settler families are expected to increase from
US$355 per annum before the project to about
US$2,650 after the settlers finish repaying
their loans.
