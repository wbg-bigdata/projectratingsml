        EDUCATION FOR ALL FAST-TRACK INITIATIVE CATALYTIC FUND
                               PHASE III

                                    RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A.      SUMMARY

1.       Due to the crisis in Yemen which led to an increase in prices and delays in implementation
activities, the Republic of Yemen has requested certain changes to the Education for All Fast-Track
Initiative Catalytic Fund (EFA FTI) Phase III (TF095158, P114253). These changes include: (i)
extension of the Closing Date of the Project; (ii) reallocation of the proceeds of Grant TF095158; and (ii)
changes to indicators and targets in the Results Framework.

B.      PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project was performing well and rated satisfactory when the country unrest began in January
2011. On July 28, 2011, in response to a much deteriorated political and security situation, and pursuant
to remedies set out in both the General Conditions and the Standard Conditions, the World Bank
suspended disbursements across the Yemen portfolio, including for the EFA FTI Phase III Project. The
suspension of disbursements was based on the Bank’s assessment that “an extraordinary situation? existed
which made it improbable that Bank-financed projects could be carried out. On January 19, 2012, after
reassessment of the country situation, the Bank lifted the suspension of disbursements. The main outcome
indicators of the Grant were showing steady progress. However, in the latest Implementation Status
Report (ISR) dated March 21, 2012, progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objective
(PDO) was rated moderately satisfactory, having taken into account the effect of the prolonged period of
suspension of disbursements on the project.

3.      During the suspension period, implementation of project activities continued according to the
project implementation plan. However, some activities were delayed due to the failure to obtain the
Bank’s no objection. These included the training activities planned for the period between February and
October 2011, which means it is unlikely that the training will be completed as scheduled by September
2012. It is now projected that training will be completed by February 28, 2013.

4.       The civil works continued during the period of suspension, though these activities have been
critically affected by the escalation in cost of materials, and this in turn has resulted in a proposed
reduction in the targeted number of classrooms to be completed under the project, from 581to 523. The
provision of school kits has also been affected by the price escalation. The allocated funds for school kits
will be sufficient to procure only 756,072 kits instead of the 900,000 originally targeted.

Disbursement Arrangements

5.      As per Bank's records, the total amount of the Grant of US$20 million was fully disbursed in
three (3) tranches advanced to the Designated Account for US$8,432.860, US$10,621,240 and
US$945,900, respectively, in which an amount of US$9,986,352.41 has been documented and the
remaining amount of US$10,013,647.59 remains to be justified/documented before the Closing Date.
However, according to the last quarterly interim financial report (IFR) reviewed by the project’s external
auditor, as of March 31, 2012, the actual disbursement amounted to US$11.5 million (58% of the
                                                     2

allocated funds). The cash balance in the project’s designated accounts totaled US$7.5 million at the end
of March 2012 (US$4.2 million at the Project Administration Unit (PAU) plus US$3.3 million at the
Public Works Project (PWP)).

Audit

6.      There are no outstanding or unsatisfactory project audit reports. All required project annual audit
reports have been submitted to the Bank; the last one was received by the Bank and covers the period
ending December 31, 2011.

C.        PROPOSED CHANGES


         Results/indicators

7.      In order to better measure project results, it is proposed to add two new outcome indictors,
namely: (i) the number of direct project beneficiaries; and (ii) the percentage of female beneficiaries. In
addition, several other indicators are being revised to reflect more accurately the expected outcomes.

8.       Due to the recent increases in prices, the remaining funds for construction for new and
rehabilitated classrooms will cover 189 instead of 247 classrooms. In addition to the revised number of
targeted classrooms, it is proposed to add one output indicator (a core sector indicator) for the
construction activities. This indicator is “the number of additional classrooms built or rehabilitated at the
primary level resulting from project intervention.?

9.      Price increases have also affected the number of school kits that are able to be purchased under
the project. The number of students to receive the school kits will be reduced from 900,000 to 756,072.
There are no changes to the Project Development Objective or to the Project Description.
The above mentioned changes are reflected in Annex 1.

         Financing

10.   The reallocation of funds between expenditure categories will result in funding changes by
component, as shown in the table below.

         o Reallocation


11.     Pursuant to the Borrower’s request for reallocation, the revised Withdrawal Schedule is as
follows:



                                                                                             Percentage of

        Closing date

12.       The Project Closing Date will be extended from September 30, 2012 to March 30, 2013. This is
the first extension of Closing Date.

   (a)       Because of the current country context, the prices of construction material and labor have
             increased significantly. This has caused major differences between the actual and estimated
             cost for the schools that have been contracted. Some contractors have withdrawn from their
             contracts and others have requested to put their contracts on hold until the political situation
             and prices have stabilized. In addition, some bids for construction activities have not been
             finalized due to the high offers. Therefore, many bids have been re-advertised which has
             required additional time and funds and has led to the adjustment of timeframe, cost and
             targets. The civil works are expected to be finalized by December 31, 2012.
                                                   4

   (b)     The inability of the Bank to provide no objections during the period of suspension for training
           activities for the period between February and October 2011 resulted in delaying summer
           training for rural female teachers. Though the rural female teacher training was partially
           implemented according to the available funds, additional time and funds are needed to
           complete the training prior to the end of proposed revised closing date of March 31, 2013.

   (c)     Suspensions of disbursements and increasing prices have affected the distribution of school
           kits. It is planned to distribute the kits to the schools by February 28, 2013.

13.    The project is expected to achieve its objectives if the closing date is extended and Grant
proceeds are reallocated.

14.     Yemen has an effective and well staffed education Project Administration Unit (PAU), which so
far has been funded through donor aid. The PAU team has revised he project’s annual work plan,
procurement plan and disbursement forecast and they were attached to the Government’s letter of May
28, 2012. Only the activities that can reasonably be completed by March 30, 2013 were kept in the plan.
The revised procurement plan will be disclosed as soon as the extension of the Closing Date has been
approved by the Bank.
