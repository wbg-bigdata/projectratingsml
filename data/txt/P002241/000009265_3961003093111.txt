MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTER1ATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTE DECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
1.          I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to the Republic of Rwanda for SDR 18.5 million, the equivalent of US$26 million,
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance an energy 5ector rehabilitation project
in Rwanda. The European Investment Bank (EEB) and the Caisse Centrale de CoopEration Economique
(CCCE) are also providing coordinated financing for US$7.92 million equivalent and for US$2.71
equivalent, respectively. US$13.44 equivalent of the proposed Credit would be onlent to the national
electricity, water and gas company (EL1CTROGAZ) for 25 years including 5 years grace period at the
prevailing IBRD rate plus 1% commission, with the Government bearing the foreign exchange risLk The
Government has proposed to use up to US$1.3 million (or 5% of the total credit) for advance
procurement and retroactive financing of essentia consulting services for preparing the contractual
arrangements for the restruering of ELECTROGAZ.
2.           Cnmka Badkwoun. Rwanda, a small landlocked country with a total population of
about 7.5 million increasing at an annual rate of 3.7%, is the most densely populated country in Africa
(290 people per kn2). GDP per capita, estimated at about US$310 (1991), ranks among the lowest of
the continent. Some 95% of the population lives in nural areas and derives its livelihood from subsistence
agriculture and the cultivation of coffee and tea. From 1970 to the mid-1980, Rwanda experienced
financial stability, low inflation and sustained growth (averaging 4% per annum). Since early 1987, it
has been faced with precipitous declines ia world coffee prices and unfavorable climatic conditions which
had an adverse Impact on agricultural production. As a result, the 1989 real income per capita dropped
by almost 16.5% from its 1986 level. The initial policy response to adverse economic developments was
not appropriate and serious internal and external imbalances and declining per capita income persisted
through the end of 1990.
3.           To correct these economic imbalances, the government embarked in 1990 on a
comprehensive economic reform program, supported by the first adjustmet operation approved in June
1991. The government's program includes a comprehensive package to strengthen macroeconomic
manaement, create an incentive framework to stimulate exports and enha   private sector confidence,
reform Public Enses (PEs), improve public  penditme management, increase the efficiency of the
financial sector, liberalize the labor market and implement well-targeted measures aimed at alleviating
poverty. The project described in this report is an importat element of the gov ene's economic
restructurin program.
4.           Seor Bmkoud. lhe energy situation in Rwanda is dara ized by a high reliance
on three sources of energy: woodfuels, agricultura by-products, and imported petroleum products. A
dominant share of enemr (almost 90%) is supplied from biomass (woodfuels and crop residues) and
households are the main consumers of energy (close to 90%).  Energy (electricity and petroleum
products) absorb about one third of the country's foreign exchange earnings. The potential for
hydroelectric power exists but development is costly because the sites are widely scattered and have low
storage capacity. The best hydro sites are the Kagera and Ruzizi rivers at the border of Rwanda with
Tanzania and Zaire respectively.



-2
5.           The woodfuel resources are subject to depletion resulting In environmental concerns for
certain areas of the country where demand for woodfuels has outweighed sustainable supply. Even at
the ambitious pace of reforestation depicted in the Government's National Forestry Plan, the gap between
demand and sustainable supply will continue to grow. It is estimated that the total deficit by year 2002
would more thin double that of 1987. In addition, charcoal making is inefficient, resulting in wasting
more than 80% of the energy in the process of carbonization. Taxes on petroleum producXt in Rwanda
are amorgst the highest in the region, accounting for more than 50% of the pump price. This level of
taxation has created a strong incentive to smuggle fuel into Rwanda. With the high level of petroleum
product prices, the Government is considering exploration of methane gas. Rwanda has large quantities
(about 60 million Nm3) of this resource, trapped in the deep waters of Lake Kivu. Large-scale
development, however, should take into account environmental consequences. Development of solar
energy requires a strategy for its dissemination, including proper mechanisms to ensure acquisition of the
home solar systems at affordable cost.
6.           in the power subsector, ELECTROGAZ, the national electricity, water and gas company,
is currently facing financial and operational difficulties due to management and tariff policy shortcomings.
The authority of its management team in personnel policy and tariff setting has been undermined by
government intervention. Its involvement in planning and execution of power network investments is
practically limited to distribution. Government arrears, which amounted to 32 months of sales at the end
of 1991, have also contributed to eroding its autonomy and financial viability. On the operations side,
ELECTROGAZ has three sources to satisfy the internal demand of electricity: (a) the domestic plants;
(b) the part of Ruzizi UI's regional power to wl-ich Rwanda is entitled, and (c) any Zairian and Burundian
surpluses. In 1990, 51% of Rwanda's electricity requirements of 174 GWh were satisfied with energy
produced at Ruzizi IL and 4% were imported from Zaire's Ruzizi I.
7.           Ihe Government's response to al these issues, which is reflected in an Energy Sector
Policy Statement places emphasis on: (i) adoption of least cost solutions for investments in the sector; (ii)
regional cooperation; (iii) regeneration and expansion of the potential for fuelwood production; (iv)
improved efficiency in the production of electricity and water, of charcoal and the use of woodfuels; (v)
identification of alternative competitive sources of energy such as peat, biogas; (vi) rehabilitation of key
power infrastructures; and (vii) extension of electricity supplies to rural areas and to cottage industries.
In a key step towards helping achieve these objectives, the government has agreed to contract out with
a private operator the operations of ELECTROGAZ, the utility company. In addition, it has decided to
(i) strengthen the legal framework, investnent planning and coordination and control for sector
institutions; (ii) set tariff policy for electricity, water and gas in a manner consistent with the Long Run
Marginal Cost (LRMC); (iii) implement a major staff reduction plan within ELECTROGAZ; and (iv)
promote rational pricing policies for wood, charcoal and petroleum products while addressing
environmental implications.
B.           Poect Objectives. The overall objective of the proposad project is to help the
Government implement its strategy as described above. Specific objectives are: (i) create an appropriate
enabling legal and regulatory environment; (i) enhance the efficiency of ELECTROGAZ operations; (iii)
provide technical assistance and training to key sector institutions to build up investment planning
capacity, and strengthen government capacity to formulate a coherent sector policy and to monitor sector
activities including those related to petroleum products; (iv) provide least-cost power supply alternatives
for rura areas; and (v) rehabilitate some key power infrastructure. The general rule would be that the
Government establishes the policy environment, but commercial decisions are left to private economic
agents.



-3-
9.           Proect Desiption. The main features of the project are summarized as follows:
(a) Strengthbening of the Institutional Regulatory and Policy Mnvironment through: (i)
restructuring ELECTROGAZ to permit contracting out its operations to a private operator; (ii) conulting
services to: prepare new statutes for the utility and bidding documents for the selection of the private
operator, and to Implement its contracting under a lease' type contract; (iii) implementation of a series of
make-ready" measures in order to attract qualified private operators; (iv) introduction of incentives to
rationalize and improve the efficiency of the charcoal subsector; (v) implementation of environmental and
technical guidelines for future development of Lake Kivu's methane gas by private investors; (vi) studies
to design and implement a strategy for solar home systems as a cost efficient alternative for electricity
in the rural areas; and (v) implementation of a reform of the pricing and taxation of petroleum products;
(b) Rehabilitation and Improvement of Key Power Infrastructure: (i) rehabilitation and
extension of the distribution network for five cities; (ii) improvements in the transmission network
substations; (iii) overhaul of hydro power station, and of the hydraulic structures; (iv) feasibility strtdies
for hydroplants; (v) constitution of a reserve stock of spare parts for plants and substations; and (vi)
capacity building in the area of project management, training through scholarships and strengthening of
the investment planning and monitoring capacity of the utility staff.
10.          Project Imglementation. A Project Coordination and Administration Unit (PCAU) will
be established, as a condition of Credit effectiveness, within the Ministry of Public Works and Energy
as the main counterpart for discussions with the Bank. It will be headed by the Director General of
Energy and incl -de one representative from each implementing agency. It will also be responsible for
the establishmen of a woodfuel consumption database, for the coordination, implementation and
supervision of the solar energy strategy, and for the methane gas activities. Other agencies will be
responsible as foUows: Ministry of Agriculture, for the preparation and execution of the charcoal
component; Ministry of Commerce, for the implementation of the reform of taxation and pricing of the
petroleum products; and ELECTROGAZ, for the rehabilitation and extension of the distribution network
for Kigali, Butare, Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Nyabisindu and the rehabilitation of the power substations and
transmission network.
11.          Proposed Insfftutional Reform and Policy Measures. The new institional framework
for the power sector under the proposed project would include (i) limiting the role of the Government
to formulation of the sectoral policy and strategy and to regulatory oversight; (ii) separating ownership
of assets and sector development planning responsibility from operations and mainenance through the
establishment of two companies; and (iii) enabling legislation and corporate statutes for these companies
to take over these responsibilities respectively, while providing them with freedom to recruit and fire and
set incentive-based salary levels, and (iv) opening the composition of the Board of the asset holding
company to include more private sector agents, and enabling it to be more involved in key policy
decisions including tariff setting.
12.          For staffing and personnel, the proposed project will support the Government's decision
to reduce ELECTROGAZ' staff by 69% before the taking over of the utility operations by the private
operator. The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) has agreed to cover the cost of
severance payments estimated at RWF 261 millio!. A successful i-mplementation of the proposed
operation would also require strong govermnent commitment and cooperation in promptly setdtg its bills
and setting appropriate tanff policy. Under the proposed project, Government would rationalize its
electricity and water consumption, and pay its bills within 60 days and a systematic power cut policy for
all consumers including Government agencies would be implemented. Agreement was reached during



-4-
negotiations on an action plan, including appropriate annual tariff increases to reach the LRMC by June
30, 1995. As a fist step, average tariffs for electricity and water were raised by 15%, effective January
15, 1993, and would be raised by an additional 15% on April, 15 1993.
13.          PWroec Sustalnablllty. Tbe separation of the regulatory function of the State from the
management and administration of the utility is a necessary first step in establishing the basis for efficient
operation of the electricity and water sectors. The Involvement of a private operator as well as the legal
and regulatory refoas complement the capacity building initiatives to improve the management and
operation of ELECTROGAZ and provide an adequate foundation for sustainable activities in the sector.
Ihe financial viability of the utility will be enhanced by a tariff policy aimed at establishing a self-
financing and autonomous sector capable of covering its investment program needs. The rehabilitation
of the distribution and transmission lines included in the project will allow the conveyance of low-cost
hydropower to the main population centers of Rwanda and will increase the quality of electric services
over the medium- and long-run. For the woodfuel component, the proposed project will help the
Government establish a self-financing program through allocation of revenues from the tax on charcoal
transport to improve efficiency in wood use and charcoal production and consumption.
4.          LeSsonS from Previous Projects In the Sector. The proposed project has been designed
t ing into account the lessons from completed regional power projects. Among others, the following
aspects prominendy figure in the project: (1) the autonomy of the utility company, (ii) human resource
development, (iii) involvement of a private operator, (iv) comprehensive procurement packages, (v)
automatic adjustment for electricity, water and gas tariffs, and (vi) coordination of donors' activities. In
addition, lessons from the Power I Project incorporated in the project include: (i) the adoption of a
Sector Policy Letter and of conditionalities not fully met under the previous project as up-front measures,
Qi) establishment of high-quality standards and monitoring arrangements for consultant and contractor
performance, and (iv) reinforcement of the utility's planning capacity.
15.          Bank Groug Strake  and Rationale for )DA 1nyolvement. The proposed operation
fits well the Country Assistance Strategy for Rwanda, which was discussed with the Executive Directors
on June 17, 1992. Through its policy advice, lending, and economic and sector work, the Bank is giving
high priority in Rwanda to: (i) supporting the country's adjustment process; (ii) developing an incentive
structure for private sector investment; (iii) reducLig the role of the state and improving public resource
management; (iv) developing human resources, building local capacity, and alleviating poverty and (v)
fostering improved management of natural resources, while protecting the environment. Reforms in the
energy sector would help expand the role of the private sector through its increased participation in key
sector institutions including ELECT*OGAZ; introduce rational investment and expenditure programming
for the sector, through continued dialogue and support for highest priority investment program; assist in
refrming the taxation and pricing structure for the petroleum products; and help improve the
management of available energy resources and foster environmentally sound economic development and
growth, through adoption of rntional use of existing woodfuel resources, and of small-scale approach for
future development of Lake Kivu's methane gas and of least-cost power supply to rural areas. IDA's
involvement is further needed to assic: in coordinating donors' actions. Finally, IDA would help ensure
that the institutional arrangements and policy measures are the most appropriate to attract the maximm
number of experienced operators and that the interests of the Government and the consumer are also
preserved.
16.          AgMd Actions. The conditions of Credit effectivene  include: (a) execution of the
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and ELECIROGAZ; (b) establishment of the PCAU
and appointment of the key staff; (c) launching of bids for the selection of the professional private



operator; (d) implementation of all necessary measures by customs agents to stop the smuggling of diesel
at border posts; (e) submission by Government of a proposal satlsf3ctory to IDA on a new tariff structuWe
except for customers using up to 40 kWh per month, and its implementation; (f) submission of evidence
of the implementation of the Ministerial Decree establishing the details on charcoal transport taxation
including its collection through the National Forestry Fumd; (g) confirmaion by Goverment of a
satisfactory financing plan for the project and submission of evidence that ELECrROGAZ has taken all
necessary measures to bring and thereafter maintain its staff number at a level not to exceed 1,253
ensployees; and (h) increase in average electricity and water tariffs by 15 percent. The following would
be conditi  of disbursement: (a) for the rehabilitation and extension of the distribution networks:
issuance of the law establishing the regulatory and institutional framework for PEs; signature of the lease
contract with the private operator; enactment of the statutes and functions of the asset holding company,
and appointment of its Board members; (b) for the petroleum products component: transfer of
responsibilities for managing the petroleum stordge depots from a Government majority-owned petroleum
company to a private company to be created and to be jointly owned by all the oil importers; and
implementation of an action plan satisfactory to IDA for price liberalization and simplification of the
taxation structure. Other agreements include: (a) annual preparation and implementation of the energy
secWtor investment program satisfactory to IDA; (b) submission by the PCAU of satisfactory activity
reports; (c) mid-term implementation review; and (d) key milestone dates for the implementation of
ELECrROGAZ' privatization program: selection and staring of negotiations with the successfil
professional private operator-August 31, 1993; and signature of the lease contract- before November
30, 1993.
17.          Environmental Aspc. The Master Plan for charcoal supply is designed to counter
environmental problems such ha deforestation and soil degradation resulting from over-cutting of trees.
With the growing consumption of charcoal and the increasing urbanization, the management of wood
resources as well as the implementation of wood use management plans at the vilage level (to be financed
by proceeds from the tax on charcoal transport) would provide a better grasp on existing wood resources,
help monitor their evolution, and ensure that the production of this major urban fuel is sustainable, while
preventing deforestation. The design and implementation of a strategy for solar home systems involve
no environmental risks. The proposed project would establish the ground rules for future development
of the Lake Kivu methane gas. To this end, it would finance the design and implementation of a set of
technical and environmental specifications. Additional measures include incorporatitn of an examination
by the Government of any potential riparian issues in all terms of reference for sir.-eys and studies on
future development of Lake Kivu's methane gas.
18.          Program Objective Categories. The project will contribute to the fullowing categories:
(i) public sector reform, through greater private sector involvement in the power sector, the new
institutional structure and the capacity building components; (ii) basic infrastructure, through the
rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution networks and the increase in the availability and
reliability of electric power; and (iii) environmental protection through the wood fuel and methane gas
components.
19.          Proiect Benefits. The proposed project would help increase the reliability and cost-
effectiveness of the electricity system and increase efficiency in the use of the country's energy resources.
This would improve living and working conditions for business and household consumers in the major
cities and in rural areas while alleviating deforestation problems, through (a) establishing the basis for
the utility to become autonomous and commercily viable thus providing a more favorable business
climate; (b) restoring an adequate and reliable supply of electricity to meet the unserved demand of the



-6-
country; (c) ensuring adequate supply of energy resources in Rwanda over the medium- and long-term.
lhe economic ratw of return for physical investments is 19 percent.
20.          Proeet Risks. The physical risks are minimAl because rehabilitation of trnsmission and
distribution network Is routine and would be carried out under well-known conditions. The other risks
are mainly of managerial and institutional nature and include: difficulty of finding private operator willing
to take over ELECTROGAZ' operations and government commitment to implementation of a long-term,
stable corporate culture with the private sector piaying a key role in elWctricity and water. Upfront
measuts including tariff increase and major staff reduction, as well as key principles to be embodied in
the utility new statutes and functions, the involvement of a private operator in the management of the
utility operations, and the program for implementation of financial objectives and capacity building
reforms, would substantially reduce these risks. Political instability, and external shocks are other risks
that could force the Government to deviate from the reform path and slow the implementation of
investment projects. The progress so far in the national dialogue and recent peace agreements reduce
these risks.
21.          Reonuendat. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association md recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed credit.

ENERGY -SECO REIHABILIATIO PROlECI
MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT ISSUES
The overriding issue in the portfolio deterioration has been the lack of qualified project
mnagement staff, and the slowdown of the decision process affected by the changing political
environment and the priority given by the transitional Government to a negotiated peace setflement with
the Patriotic Front. The demoralization caused by the recently announced widespread rotation of civil
servants and the ensuing confusion has exacerbated the issue. Perennial problems such as cumbersome
procurement procedures and a systematic reluctance to use technical assistance not financed by gras
have also been responsible for poor project implementation and slow disbursement rates. In addition,
the hostilities had a major disruptive effect on project execution in FY92 (e.g., a mnmber of projects are
located in the war zone and work on them had virtually stopped). The disbursement ratio declined from
21.6 percent in FY89 to 9.9 percent in FY91 and 7.8 percent in FY92.
The Government is taking steps to correct these issues. Under the proposed project, a training
program, particularly for project management staff, designed by the Government and agreed upon at
negotiations, will be implemented as part of the capacity building component. In addition, supervision
efforts will be strengthened and annual Country Implementation Reviews, will provide a framework for
a dialogue on improving project implementation. Special emphasis will be put on procurement
procedures to accelerate the disbursement rate. In this connection, a Country Procurement Assessment
Report will be prepared in FY93.
