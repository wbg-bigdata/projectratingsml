Benefits
and Risks:        The proposed project would help meet Uruguay's power needs
with lover fuel consumption, ioproved system reliability
and a higher degree of operational efficiency of existing
Installed capacity. Should cofinancing be delayed or not
materialize, the ensuing delays in transmission and distri-
bution Investments would reduce the proposed gains In
system reliability. A delay In the execution of these
components, however, would not affect the benefits from
more efficient hydropower generation which would be
supported by the proposed A-loan. The project does not
present major technical risks.

I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Uruguay has been one of the Latin American countries most affected
by the energy crisis. In 1984 oil imports amounted to 23% of export earnings
or about US$235 million. Pricing and taxation policies for oil derivatives
have aimed at reducing consumption. At present the retail prices exceed
international levels (gasoline's are equivalent to about US$2.8/gallon, and
diesel's oil to US$1.7/gallon); lower taxes have been applied to diesel oil
to avoid a negative impact on the competitiveness of industry and transporta-
tation costs; because of these policies, additional conservation efforts and
a slowdown in economic activity, demand for oil products since 1979 has
decreased significantly, whereas electricity use has risen at a pace close to
4% per year.
1.02      The country's energy resources are limited:  it does not have known
oil or gas reserves and only has small reserves of coal (with a high ash
content and low calorific value). There are some oil sbale and peat
deposits, and there is an insignificant amount of fuelvood. Hydropower
resources are few and, by and large, either already utilized or not economi-
cal to develop at present fuel prices. Within the past six years two large
hydroprojects came into operation: Salto Grande and El Palmar. Salto Grande
(1,890 MW) is a binational project shared with Argentina. It is located on
the Uruguay River and started commercial operations in 1979. At present
Uruguay is entitled to 315 MW of Salto Grande's output but it may exercise
options to gradually increase its share to 945 MW by 1995. El Palmar (330
MW), located on the Rio Negro, started operations in late 1982, and has been
in full operation since early 1983. The total present installed capacity in
Uruguay is 1,282 MW, of which 881 MW are provided by hydro resources and 401
14W by thermal resources. Due to very favorable hydrological conditions,
during 1984 UTE was able to meet most of its generation requirements with
hydro generation, keeping its thermal installations as reserve (para. 3.01).
Energy Sector Organization
1.03      Most of Uruguay's energy sector is state controlled.  The electric
power policy is determined by the Government, through the Ministry of
Industry and Energy (MUE). The most important operating entities are the
National Petroleum Company, Administracion Nacional de Cementos, Alcoholes y
Portland (ANCAP) and the power company, Administracion Nacional de Usinas y
Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE). Electricity rates are approved by
Presidential decree, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Planning
and Budgeting Office intervene in their determination, with primary decision-
making powers vested in the latter.
1.04      UTE is organized as an autonojous public entity (its Board of
Directors is appointed by the Government) but is subject to various legal and
administrative constraints on its operations. UTE's budget is approved by
the Planning and Budgeting Office and this budget places a legal ceiling on
investments and expenditures. The Government auditing agency (Tribunal de
Cuentas) is responsible for ensuring that UTE complies with budget and
procurement legislation.



-2-
1.05      The only other entity, in addition to UTE, that now operates in the
power sector is Couision Tecnica Mixta de Salto Grande (CTM). CTDM was
created in 1946, and is an international organization governed by a Board
composed of four Argentine and four Uruguayan members, all appointed by the
respective Governments. CDM has built the Salto Grande hydroplant and is
responsible for its operation. The plant is interconnected to the UTE system
by 500 kV lines which provide a link to Argentina's power network. CTM's
bulk rates for the sale of electricity are determined so as to enable it to
meet its financial requirements, and are expected to decrease starting from
1992. Another entity, Comision Mixta de Palmar (COKIPAL), was created in
1973 to build El Palmar hydroplant; after its completion, El Palmar was
transferred to UTE (para. 5.01) and CO0IPAL was dissolved by Law 15.700 of
January 10, 1985.
Energy Planning
1.06      Formally, the Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE) is responsible
for long-range planning. After the 1973 oil price increase, the Direccion
Nacional de Energia was formed within the HIE to deal with sector policies.
It has not yet been able to play a significant role In shaping sector
policies. So far no systematic energy planning has been carried out, and the
Government has not defined a comprehensive energy policy.
1.07      An energy sector study, which was recently completed, identified
the technical and administrative assistance needs of the MIE, proposed
changes to its organizational structure, and suggested improvements in data
collection to complete the data base required for the preparation of a
National Energy Plan. Under the Power Engineering Project (para. 1.12), the
Government agreed that it would furnish to the Bank a plan of action to
implement the energy sector study's reco mendations, including a timetable
for preparation of a National Energy Plan, and that by December 31, 1985 the
Government would start carrying out the plan of action after taking into
account the Bank's comments. The Italian Government has recently offered a
grant to finance part of the implementation cost of such plan of action.
Power Sector Objectives and Strategy
1.08      Since the oil price increases in the early 1970s, the Government's
key objective has been to reduce Uruguay's dependence on imported fuel. In
the power sector its strategy has been Aimed at the substitution of bydro
generation for thermal generation. The potential for this substitution has
now been substantially achieved with the construction of the Salto Grande and
El Palmar hydroplants. A generation development study through the year 2000
(para. 1.11) made by independent consultants has shown that none of the small
hydro projects that have been identified can compete with conventional ther-
mal plants. Thus, in the future, fuel savings concerns will have to be
addressed by a more efficient operation of UTE's generating plants and dis-
tribution system, loss reductions, system planning and demand management
through pricing policies which take marginal costs into account. The Bank
continues to provide assistance to UTE in ali these areas (para. 1.12).



- 3-
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.09      The Bank has supported Uruguay?s power sector since 1950.  It has
been associated with major sector reforms and improvement programs carried
out over the last five years. The proposed project would serve as a basis
for extending the Bank's policy dialogue with the authorities, and would help
to ensure continued Bank involvement in the action programE that are expected
to evolve from the studies it has he_,  d to finance.  Throulgh the former
Administracion Nacional de Usinas Electricas y Telefonos dcI Estado (now
Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas-UTE) the Bank
made five loans to the sector: in 1950 (Loan 30-UR), 1955 (Loan 132-UR), 1956
(Loan 152-UR), 1970 (Loan 712-UR) and 1979 (Loan 1779-UR) aggregating US$106
million. The first four loans have been fully disbursed and the projects
have been satisfactorily carried out. The project Performance Audit Report
for the Fourth Power Project (SecM78-867 of November 29, 1978) indicates that
progress towards meeting the institutional objectives the Bank had in 1970,
when making the loan, was slow and generally disappointing. It also makes
the point that UTE did not ccmply with some of the loan covenants. It may be
noted, however, that the project's implementation coincided with a period of
severe social conflict and general economic dislocation.
1.10      To provide a focus for discussion of further Bank support of the
power sector, in mid-1976 the Bank carried out a sector review and recommend-
ed various measur- o strengthen the power sector and improve UTE's perform-
ance. This report was discussed with the Government when the Fifth Power
Project was being prepared, and agreement in substance on all major issues
was achieved. To address the problems detected, the Government passed a new
Electricity law (and its corresponding regulations), approved UTE's new
by-laws, and instituted a mechanism to allow tariff increases when input
costs increased. Furthermore, agreement was also reached that UTE would
engage various consultants (para. 1.11) and private external auditors to
assist in improving internal operations, planning consultants to develop a
long-range generation expansion plan, and project consultants to both assist
with the project and set up a planning department and provide training to its
staff.
1.11      Under Loan 1779-UR the Bank financed consultant services for the
following studies: (a) an energy sector study, which reviewed institutional
arrangements of the sector and developed a framework for energy planning
(para. 1.07); (b) a planning study, which resulted in a least cost develop-
ment plan to the year 2000 for electricity generation, and provided training
to UTE's staff in planning techniques (para. 1.08); (c) a management study,
which reviewed UTE's organization and operations and provided recommendations
on means to improve its efficiency (para. 2.02); and (d) a tariff study based
on long run marginal costs, which resulted in recommendations to improve the
tariff structure (para. 1.12). The results achieved by the measures referred
to in para. 1.10 and by the above studies have been very satisfactory and
UTE's operations have measurably improved over the past few years. Project
completion of Loan 1779-UR is expected for December 1985, including 3.5 years
delay.



- 4 -
1.12      In early 1985 the Bank made a Power Engineering Loan (2484-UR)
which follows-up on the previous efforts to improve UTE's operations and
increase its efficiency. Loan 2484-UR includes: (a) the feasibility study
for the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra hydroplant (which has been
already completed) (paras. 4.04 and 4.05(i)); (b) an operation planning
study (this study would be the basis to review the generation development
study - para. 1.08); (c) a distribution syaltem study; and (d) a training
component (all such studies aiming at ensuring a more economic operation
of the generating facilities, reducing distribution losses and promoting
management development). The Bank is also financing the purchase of
electricity meters to implement a tariff structure based upon a satisfac-
tory plan of action to implement the conclusions of the marginal cost study
(para. 1.11).



2. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
2.01      The Borrower of the proposed loan would be the Administration
Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE), a quasi-autonomous entity
of the Uruguayan Government which has the responsibility for pub'ic power
supply in the country. UTE's organization is satisfactory; it is governed by
a full-time, five-member Board of Directors with its President acting as
Chief Executive Officer. The present President is a former UTE Planning
Manager, with more than twenty years experience with the company. The
General Manager and other senior staff are also career executives. The
organizational structure of the company is sound and is shown in Annex 2,
Attachment 1.
2.02      To help UTE have a more flexible and efficient administration,
management consultants carried out a comprehensive organization and
administration study (para. 1.11). This study was successfully completed and
Its recommendations have been,. or are in the process of being, implemented.
One of the main consequences bas been the recognition by UT!'s management of
training needs, thus providing continuity to the institution building
efforts.
Employment
2.03      UTE presently employs about 10,600 people (representing about 84
consimers per employees), which include 225 professional staff, i.e. about 22
of the workforce employees. Though this represents an improvement over the
situation a few years ago, there is still an imbalance between professional
and non-professional staff. Many senior managers are close to retirement,so
there is also a need to develop middle and junior manage ent   To address
this, further steps to attract qualified professionals would be required.
Under the Power Engineering Project, agreement was reached on a training
program for management that will help to address this problem.  Under Loan
1779-UR, UTE engaged Price Waterhouse to conduct a salary survey. The survey
showed that, in 1982, the salaries of professional and management staff would
have had to be increased significantly to be competitive with the private
sector. At that time, some modest corrections were implemented; at present,
the economic conditions in the country have reduced professional turnover and
employment opportunities outside are limited, bence UTE has been able to
main-ain and increase its professional staff. During project supervision
special attention should be paid to ensure that appropiate compensation
policies are followed.
Management Systems
2.04      UTE's commercial systems have been improving in recent years.
Financial planning is an area where staff are still in the process of
developing expertise; improvements achieved in the past few years, however,



- 6 -
are quite significant. Accounting, budgeting and billing systems are
adequate, as well as insurance policies and practices. Under previous loans,
UTE agreed to engage independent external auditors to review its accounts and
assist in developing internal auditing capabilities; the results were
satisfactory. The loan documents for the proposed project would repeat the
covenant of earlier loan agreements that UTE should retain independent
auditors (para. 7.02(a)).
2.05      UTE's inventory management is poor and a program for improvement is
underway. The absence of a well-structured inventory policy and the need to
strengthen inventory management are acknowledged by UTE's Board and staff,
and are emphasized at every opportunity by both internal and external
auditors. Also, there is a general consensus on a significant overstock
position in the last two fiscal years, which is reflected in the projection
of working capital requirements for 1985-1993. To tackle the problem, an
internal group was created to deal with procurement and internal control
matters, but UTE agrees that further improvements are necessary. Under Loan
2484-UR, UTE agreed to submit to the Bank an action plan for improving
inventory management and, after taking into account the 'ank's comments, to
start carrying out such plan of action by October 31, 1985.
Accounts Receivable
2.06      By the end of 1984, UTE had reduced its overall average collection
period to 60 billing days, compared with the collection period of 75 days
covenanted under Loan 1779-UR; the collection period for private consumers
was 45 days. After a period of high public sector arrears in the early
1980s, an improving trend towards reducing public sector overdue accounts
began in 1983. Public sector accounts receivable were further reduced in
late 1984 when, in compliance with a condition of Board presentation of Loan
2484-UR, a compensation exercise between Government agencies and UTE was
carried out and a plan was submitted to reduce the billing period of the
covenanted target. As of December 31, 1984, the collection period for public
sector accounts was about 135 days; this represented a significant improve-
ment compared to the 355 days in 1982, although still short of the 75 days
target agreed upon in Loan 1779-UR. To ensure an adequate financial
performance, during negotiations, UTE agreed to maintain the 75 days target
agreed upon in Loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR (para. 7.02(e)), and the Government
agreed on an action plan to settle its accounts payable to UTE within the
following terms: by December 31, 1985, not more than 120 days; by June 30,
1986, not more than 90 days and by December 31, 1986 and thereafter, not more
than 75 days (para. 7.01 (a)).



3. THE MARKET
Historic Power Market
3.01      UTE's overall historic power data (generation and sales) is shown
in Annex 3, Tables 3.1 and 3.2 and is summarized as follows:
Average Growth (Z)
1979      1981      1984          1979-1984

a/ Public sector sales amounts to about 15X.
The share of industry in the market decreased from 39% in 1979 to 33Z in 1984
while residential supply increased from 43Z in 1979 to 48% in 1984. The
growth pattern of generation by different sources (hydro, thermal and
purchase) has changed significantly from 1979 to 1984. Hydrogeneration
increased its share from 46% in 1979 to 97.6% in 1984 (this latter year due
to very favorable bydrological conditions). This is due to the commissioning
of the Salto Grande and El Palmar hydro plants in late 1979 and 1982
respectively and to the construction of transmission lines (financed under
IBRD Loan 1779-UR) to the interior, where isolated areas of the country were
incorporated to the interconnected system. Load factor has decreased from
61Z in 1979 to 54Z in 1984. This fact indicates that the pricing structure
needs to be used in order to improve load factor. Such improvements in the
load factor, through adjustments in the tariff structure, are expected as a
result of the implementation of the recommendations of the marginal cost
study (para. 1.12).
Future Power Market
3.02      UTE has developed in the past, with the assistance of consultants,
different methodologies to forecast electricity demand and has relied on



-8-
trend analysis and on regression analysis techniques. As a consequence of
the economic recession, the decline in the rate of growth of demand experi-
enced during the last three years has left most of the projections outdated.
The load and energy demand forecasts are shown in Annex 3, Table 3.3 and are
based on the studies prepared by Rydro Quebec International (Canada) in April
1982 and updated by UTE in April 1985. Demand forecast was reduced by UTE tc
conform more closely to the actual economic situation during the appraisal
mission.
3.03      The three principal categories of consumers (Residential,
Non-residential, and Traction and Street Lighting) were analyzed separately
for the period 1965-1984 from which the trend of each category was updated.
The market forecast shows that sales would increase from 3,019 GWh in 1984 to
4,283 in 1993, indicating an average annual increase of about 4Z during the
period of the projections.
3.04      For the cases of Montevideo (para. 4.05 (iii) and (iv)) and the
circuit to the East (para. 4.05 (ii)), a detailed study of electricity
requirements was performed. For Montevideo, requirements for 1984 were first
determined, taking into account the present (5 substations) and the new (9
substations) configurations of the 150 kV distribution system, then the
requirements were projected. These projections show an average energy
increase of 4.3% per year for the period 1985-1993, which is reasonable. For
the circuit to the East, the requirements were projected based on 1984 data
with an average increase of 7% per year. This figure is consistent with the
growth experienced during the past twenty years where demand has doubled
every ten years.
Existing Power Facilities
3.05      Annex 3, Table 3.4 shows details of UTE's power generating
facilities at the beginning of 1985. UTE's total installed generating
capacity was 1,282 MW, of which 68% was hydroelectric (881 MW) and the
balance constitutes oil or gas fired power plants (401 K4W). Hydrogeneration
is supplied through three power plants located on the Rio Negro River (566
MW) and by the Salto Grande Binational hydro plant built jointly with
Argentina (315 MW) on the Uruguay river. Thermal generation is supplied
through several power stations (388 Mw) in the interconnected system and five
diesel stations (13 MW) located in isolated systems.
3.06      The attached maps show UTE's existing and proposed power transmis-
sion and distribution facilities. UTE delivers electricity to its consum-
ers 1/ through a transmission system of 2,809 kms operating at 500 kV, 150
kV, 110 kV, and 60 kV, a primary distribution system of 14,800 kus operating
at 30 kV, 15 kV, and 6 kV, and a secondary 220 V distribution system compris-
ing 10,900 kms. The system includes 32 substations (transmission level) with
a total installed capacity of 1,890 MVA and 158 substations (primary distri-
bution level) with a total installed capacity of 1,206 MVA.
1/ Access to electric service in Uruguay in about 82% of all households.



-9-
Losses
3.07      Currently electricity supply in Uruguay is reliable.  Historically,
UTE has operated and maintained its facilities efficiently. However, the
distribution system, particularly in the area of Montevideo, is old and its
reliability is not as good as in the transmission and subtransmission
system. This problem was partially addressed through improvements and
expansion of the Montevideo system financed by the Bank under Loan 1779-UR.
An important part of UTE's investment plan for the period 1986-1993 provides
for expansion and improvement of the primary and secondary distribution
system.
3.08      Presently total losses are 17%, of which 13% is attributable to the
distribution system. This is technically high but it is not knowa whether
thefts are a substantive part of these losses. It appears unlikely that
thefts are a substantive part of these lossea in view of the fact that losses
have varied little from year to year. Technical inadequacies may be the asin
reasons: Montevideo's intermediate voltages are relatively low at 30 kV and 6
kV, many of the 30 kV and 6 kV underground cables are old and overloaded,
while distribution is at 3 x 220 V, (non-balanced 2-phase 220 V loads cause
heavier losses due to the lack of the neutral conductor). With the Bank
assistance (Engineering Loan 2484-UR), UTE will carry out a comprehensive
distribution study which includes a loss reduction plan in the medium and low
voltage levels.
Energy and Capacity Balance
3.09      Annex 3, Tables 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 show UTE's energy and capacity
balances for the national hydrothermal interconnected system for the period
1982-1993, based on a simulation model of existing generation system.
Average hydrological conditions were determined from a simulation on a
70-year (1908-1978) series. The results of the simulation studies indicated
that additional thermal generating capacity would be needed by 1989 in order
to meet the projected demand so as to comply with reliability criteria.
3.10     Despite the above, expansion of the generating capacity has been
excluded from the present investment program (para. 4.01) subject to the
conclusions of the operation planning study to be carried out by consultants,
to be financed by Loan 2484-UR, as further analysis of hydrological data is
required to assess the risk of not being able to meet demand under dry year
conditions. The study, which in part will conduct a comprehensive review of
UTE's present model and practices, is expected to be completed by the end of
1986. Delay in the execution of a new thermal power plant my require
relying on the interconnection with Argentina (Salto Grande) for about 10%
(reserve capacity) of the total demand by 1989.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      Annex 4, Table 4.1 sets forth details on UTE's development program
for 1985-1993. It is designed to meet the forecast of energy and demand
increases within acceptable levels of reliability. The cost of the proposed
program is expected to amount to about US$804.7 million equivalent (in
current dollars). Of the total investment program 27X would be for genera-
tion, 18% for transmissi3n, 51% for distribution and 4% for miscellaneouc
investments, which is a reasonable breakdown under the present circmstances.
The generation component would consist mainly of the rehabilitation of the
Gabriel Terra hydroplant. The transmission component mainly involves the
works under the proposed project, projects under execution and other
extensions to meet dezand growth in various areas of the country. The
distribution component would involve new connections, rehabilitation and
expansion of networks in Mantevideo and extension of the 60 kV and 30 kV
lines to various productive areas in the interior of the country. As
described below, the proposed project is part of the above expansion program.
The Project
4.02      Annex 4, Table 4.2 sets forth details of the proposed project.
It would include the following major components: (i) rehabilitation of the
Gabriel Terra hydro plant; (ii) extension of the 500 kV and 150 kV
transmission system to the East and to Montevideo; (iii) remodeling and
upgrading of the 30 kV distribution system in Montevideo; and (iv) consulting
services.
Project Objectives
4.03      The main project objectives are:
;) to strengthen Uruguay's hydroelectric generation capacity by
rehabilitating the Gabriel Terra hydro plant and extending its
useful life;
(ii)  to ensure the continued efficient operation of downstream
hydrogenerating capacity served by the Gabriel Terra reservoir;
(iii)  to improve the reliability of service in the country by expanding
the transmission and distribution systems and to connect areas with
growing economic activity to the system grid; and
(iv)  to ensure that UTE continues to operate its facilities in
accordance with sound financial and managerial practices.
More generally, the project would reinforce our policy dialogue on power
sector issues, and would ensure that the studies under execution are



- 11 -
satisfactorily completed, and their findings implemented through appropriate
action plans.
Status of Project Preparation
4.04      The project is well advanced.  For the rehabilitation of the
Gabriel Terra hydroplant, the feasibility study (para. 1.12) prepared by EdF,
under terms of reference agreed with the Bank, was reviewed by the Bank and
found adequate. The study concluded that the rehabilitation of the hydro
plant is technically essential and economically very attractive (para.
6.02). Technical specifications and bidding documents are being prepared by
EdF with UTE's participation. It is expected that a complete set of docu-
ments for review by the Bank will be ready by October 1985 and that shortly
after Bank approval, tendering would begin. For transmission and distribu-
tion the routes of the lines are already defined. UTE has started the
detailed engineering work for the distribution and 150 kV transmission
lines. Revision of the design criteria for the 500 kV transmission lines and
preparation of bidding documents for a 150/30 kV package unit substation
would be carried out by consultants financed by the Bank. Bidding documents
for distribution and 150 kV transmission would be available for tendering by
mid-1986 and by December 1986 for the 500 kV transmission lines. Terms of
reference for consultant services are being drafted by UTE, according to
guidelines provided by the Bank, and were agreed during negotiations. It was
also agreed that some consultants would be engaged by June 1986 (pars.
7.01(b)).
Project Description
4.05      A sumary of the proposed project is given below.
Ci) Rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra hydro plant. This component
consists of: replacement of electromechanical equipment in the
power plant (generators, turbines, voltage and speed regulators,
15r kV circuit breakers, transformers, power and control cables,
protective equipment and station service and auxiliaries);
replacement of mechanical equipment at the dam (gates, grillages
and related accessories); and minor civil works, both in the
powerhouse and dam;
(ii) Extension of the 500 kV transmission system to the East. This
component consists of: 123 km of 500 kV lines from Montevideo to
San Carlos; 17 km of 150 kV line to connect the San Carlos
substation and expansion of the 150 kV Montevideo and San Carlos
substations;
(iii) Extension of the 500 kV system in Montevideo and upgrading of the
150 kV circuit ring. 'This component consists of: 20 km of 500 kV
transmission lines, 11 km of 150 kV lines, 25 kms of 150 kV under-
ground lines, and related 500/150 kV and 150 kV/30 kV substations;



- 12 -
(iv) Remodeling and upgrading of the 30 kV distribution network in
Montevideo. This component consists of 70 km of underground 30 kV
distribution lines, 160 MYVA 30/6 kV substations, and 23 4VA 30/15
kV substations; and
(v) Consultant Services for project management and supervision.
Project Cost Estimate
4.06      Annex 4, Table 4.2 sets forth details on the expected cost of the
Project. The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies,
is expected to amount to about US$120.5 million, of which about US$80.1
million would be the foreign component (direct and indirect)* Total financ-
ing requirements, including US$17.6 million interest during construction,
would be US$138.1 million. The table on the next page summarizes the cost
data set forth in Annex 4, Table 4.2:

4.07      The cost data for the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra hydro
plant component was based on a feasibility study prepared by EdF using priee
levels as of June 1985. Cost data for the transmission and distribution
component of the project estimates was based on a feasibility study prepared
by UTE's planning and construction staff using price levels prevailing in
June 1985. Prices of equipment and materials for the transmission and
distribution component reflected UTE's recent experience with respect to
similar works. Cost includes import duties (10Z) and taxes applicable to
local goods and labor costs (16%). Physical contingencies were calculated on
the basis of 10% and 5% of the base costs for the generation and transmission
and distribution components respectively, which were considered to be reason-
able given the accuracy of the above cost estimates. Price contingencies
were applied using the following annual expected international price
increases: 5% for 1985; 7.5% for 1986; 8% for 1987-1990 and 5% for 1991-1992.
It was assumed that the exchange rate adjustments would reflect the differ-
ence between internal and external inflation.
Project Financing Scheme
4.08      The financing scheme for the proposed project would include a Bank
A-loan to finance the foreign exchange component of the rehabilitation of the
Gabriel Terra hydro plant and a B-loan which would finance the transmission
and distribution components.
The project financing plan would be as follows:
_omponent                          A-Loan     B-Loan      UTE      Total
(Millions of current US$)
Gabriel Terra Rehabilitation                37.1       -         4.4        41.5
Transmission and D_.stribution               -        43.0      36.0        79.0
Interest During Construction                 8.1       9.5        -         17.6
45.2     52.5       40.4      138.1
4.09      Under the loan financing plan described in para. 4.08 above, the
proposed Bank A-loan would be US$45.2 million. This financing would cover
100% of the foreign expenditure for the generation component of the project
including the corresponding interest and other charges during construction
until September 14, 1991. A US$52.5 million B-loan would finance the trans-
mission and distribution component of the project as well as the pertaining
interest during construction. Financing of interest during construction is
justified in view of the heavy financial burden on UTE imposed by the
servicing of the external debt and the Uruguayan difficulties in obtaining
foreign currency at this time.

Project Implementation and Supervision
4.10     The executing unit of the project within UTE's organization (Annex
2, Attachment 1) would be the planning division, and the division manager
would act as project coordinator. This unit would work within the framework
of UTE's organization with the assistance of the procurement, construction,
finances and engineering divisions, to provide the required technical and
project management guidance to ensure that design, procurement and construc-
tion would be executed in a timely and orderly manner. During negotiations
the Bank agreed with UTE to maintain the present project unit (para. 7.02
(b)). A program implementation schedule which would be used to mDnitor the
project is shown in Annex 4, Table 4.3. Project completion is expected by
December 1992.
4.11      Erection of electromechanical equipment for the Gabriel Terra hydro
plant would be carried out by UTJT's force account with the assistance of
specialized personnel provided by the manufacturer and the consultant. UTE
has agreed that supervision of this portion of the project would be done
through consultants (para. 7.01 (c)). Construction of UTE's proposed trans-
mission and distribution works are expected to be contracted under ICB and
the works would be supervised by UTE's construction departments. As UTE's
technical staff is competent and has experience in this kind of work, Bank
staff consider these arrangements adequate.
4.12      Consulting services, procurement, manufacturing, installation and
construction of the works included in the project are expected to be carried

4.14      Procurement of goods to be financed from the proposed loan would be
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines for procurement. The Bank expects that procurement of goods and
services to be financed from the B-loan would also be consistent with said
guidelines. Goods and construction works to be financed by UTE would be
procured through UTE's normal procedures, which require competitive bidding
for both local and international procurement. Local manufacturers will
receive a margin of preference of 15Z or the applicable import duties,
whichever is lower for bid evaluation. The Bank found UTE's procurement
procedures to be consistent with the principles of economy and efficiency.
Applicable regulations and procedures are in the Project File (Annex 7) which
will be used to prepare a "Country Procurement Assessment Report' scheduled
for FY86. Consultant's services for project engineering and mnagement would
be selected from a short list of consulting firms following Bank guidelines
and appointed under terms and conditions approved by the Bank.

Disbursements
1.15      Annex 4, Table 4.5 reflects the expected disbursement schedule of
the proposed loan based on the Bank's experience in similar projects. The
annual investment of the total project cost is shown in Annex 4, Table 4.6.
Proceeds of the Bank A-loan would be used to finance:
(i) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods, and 84% of the
ex-factory cost for local goods for the generation component of the
project;
(ii) 100% of foreign expenditures, and 84% of local expenditures for
consulting services.
(iii) interest and other charges during ccnstruction until June 1991.
Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for imported goods
whose value is less than US$100,000 equivalent. Claims for expenditures of
these lesser amounts would be subject to presentation of a statement of
expenditures for which the supporting documentation would not be sent to the
Bank but would be retained by UTE for periodic inspection by the Bank. A
special account would be established in the Central Bank of Uruguay with
a deposit of US$4 million. Periodic replenishment would be made to this
special account against withdrawal applications received from UTE and
supported by such documents as the Bank would require. The Borrower would be
required to carry out auditing of this special account on an annual basis.
The closing date would be June 30, 1993.
Environmental Aspects
4.16      No environmental problems are expected.  The Gabriel Terra hydro
plant is an existing plant which has not posed environmental problems. The
facilities to be constructed (transmission and distribution) are of standard
design for which the necessary easements are provided. They would be under-
ground and in substation buildings in Montevideo, and of the standard over-
head type in the interior. UTE intend to route their lines and locate their
substations so as to minimize their visual impacts in a manner consistent
with economic and financial considerations.
Project Risks
4.17      The project faces no special risks.  The construction schedule
assumed for the project is reasonable and takes into account normal engineer-
ing, administrative, construction and erection procedures. Despite the
adverse effects of the declining economic activity in the early 1980's, UTE
has had an adequate financial performance and its present situation is sound,
although depending on timely tariff adjustments and debt restructuring. If
the present tariff policy is maintained and a satisfactory arrangement is
achieved with the commercial banks creditors on El Palmar debt, no major
risks are envisaged and a satisfactory financial performance is expected

during project execution. The generation component of the project, which
would be financed under the A-loan, would not be affected by a delay in the
execution of the other components of the project should the B-loan be delayed
or not materialize.

5. FINANCES
Earnings History
5.01      Since 1977, the results of UTE have fluctuated, reflecting changes
in the Government economic and tariff policies, but on balance its financial
performance has been adequate.   The rate of return exceeded the level
covenated under Loan 1779-UR until 1979, and after declining from 1980 to
1982, an improving financial trend began in 1983. In the latter year
COMIPAL's assets (US$600 million: US$546 million El Palmar bydro plant and
transmission lines, and US$54 million current assets) were transferred to
UTE, and US$594 million of debts (most of which mature in the next 5 years)
were added to UTE's liabilities; the remaining US$6 million was a Government
equity contribution (Annex 5.1). Despite this increase in debt, UTE's debt
equity ratio is still at a satisfactory level, 50:50.
5.02      During 1983 and 1984 UTE showed an improvement in its financial
performance, although the rate of return agreed upon under Loan 1779-UR was
not met. A modest increase in sales took place during these years despite a
widespread recession, and tariffs were adjusted in line with inflation.
Operating costs were substantially reduced due to the commissioning of El
Palmar and to very favorable bydrological conditions which allowed UTE to
shut down its thermal plane3 and minimize fuel costs. Furthermore, wages
were increased less than inrernal inflation. Although the rates of return
achieved in 1983 and 1984, 2.8% and 3.8% respectively, were lower than the
minimum 6% covenanted under Loan 1779-UR, the financial performance of UTE
was reasonable given the economic difficulties the country has been facing.
Additionally, it represented significant progress in comparison with the
negative returns of 1981 and 1982, especially taking into account that the
asset revaluation and the transfer of assets of El Palmar resulted in a
significantly higher rate base than expected during the appraisal of Loan
1779-UR (para. 5.10(b)).
Current Financial Situation
5.03      UTE's financial situation is sound; however, it is dependent on
timely tariff adjustments and the restructuring of the El Palmer financing
package. 2/ UTE's operational cash requirements are linked to exchange rate
variations (energy purchases from CTM, fuel costs, maintenance supplies and
debt service) and to a lesser extent to domestic price changes (salaries,
social benefits, local supplies and general expenses). In view of this,
timely adjustments of tariffs to compensate for exchange rate variations and
domestic cost increases are of paramount importance to maintain in real terms
the financial balance which requires an average tariff level of about 6 US
cents/kWh (in mid-1985 prices). Periodic adjustments that are alloved by
current legislation (para. 5.08) were incorporated in Bank agreements ucder
17 Te- "package a-so includes two loans for Salto Grande to finance
transmission facilities.



- 20 -
Loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR and would be repeated in the proposed loan (para
7.02(c)). The new Government has demonstrated its willingness to comply with
both the legislation and agreements with the Bank through two tariff increas-
es of 30% and 18% carried out in last April and July respectively, which took
the average tariff level slightly over 6 US cents/kWh, presenting a 27%
increase in real terms in the period March-July 1985.
5.04      The restructuring of El Palmar debt service (as well as the entire
external debt of Uruguay) is one of the priorities of the new Government,
following an 18 months (July 1985 to December 1986) agreement with the IMF,
tentatively reached in late July.  Although there is not yet agreement o. the
terms of the restructuring, negotiations with the commercial banks are
currently underway in a satisfactory manner. During negotiations the Govern-
ment and UTE agreed that if the El Palmar debt were not satisfactorily
restructured with commercial banks in line with UTE's cash generating capa-
city, then it would be restructured through an agreement satisfactory to the
Bank between the Government and UTE. The end result of such restructuring
would be to provide financial relief to UTE and would be in place thirty days
from loan signing (para. 7.01(d)). The effect of any such agreement may be
for UTE to make payments under what would become a long-term schedule and for
the Government to supplement such payments as required, or UTE would pay only
a portion of contracted debt with Government paying the remainder. As a
consequence, the obligation under Loan 2484-UR on the ratio of funds from
internal sources to capital expenditures is no longer necessary because it
has been superseded by the above agreement.

5.06      TItw financing plan summarized above for the 1985-1993 investment
program (which Licludes the financing scheme for the Power Sector Rehabilita-
tion Project described in para. 4.08) includes a US$45.2 million Bank A-loan
and a US$52.6 million B-loan whose syndication is considered feasible.
Several banks, led by Citibank, have expressed interest in participating in
arranging a B-loan.
5.07      UTE would be the borrower of the proposed A-loan. The Uruguayan
Government is expected to be the borrower of the proposed B-loan. At any
rate, the borrower of the B-loan would onlend its proceeds to MET, if
required, on the same terms and conditions.  UTE would, thus, bear the
exchange and interest rate risk. Since the Govermment faces a foreign
exchange gap during the IMF stand-by period (para. 5.04), while the activi-
ties for the project to be financed with commercial bankst resources are not
supposed to start before late 1986, the Government intends to deposit the
B-loan proceeds into an account in the Central Bank. The funds would only be
used for project execution and the Government has agreed to make these funds
available to UTE as and when needed for purposes of the project. Thus, the
Bank would retain the right to suspend disbursements from the A-loan if there
were any difficulties in use of funds f')r the project components to be
financed under the B-loan.

Tariff Regulations and Rate of Return
5.08      During the preparation of the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1779-UR),
UTE and the Bank agreed on the text of the regulations to the Electricity Law
which defines the tariff regime presently in force in Uruguay. 3/ These
regulations (decrees 339 and 498 of 1979) state that: (a) UTE's tariffs will
be set on the basis of a target rate of return (not lower than 6%) on a rate
base consisting of average revalued net fixed assets in operation plus a
provision for working capital; and (b) from time to time, UTE may request
tariff adjustments to take into account changes in operating costs.
5.09      In accordance with the above, Loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR provide
that UTE shall earn a rate of return of 7.5% (on a rate base defined in the
same manner as in the regulations) provided that if in any one year the rate
of return is below 7.5%, but above 6%, the difference may be made up in the
following year. The loan agreement specifically provides that connection
fees shall not be considered as operating income, since the Electricity Law
had included provisions making these connection fees refundable.
5.10      During negotiations, the Bank, the Government and UTE agreed to
amend the rate of return covenants in the following manner (para. 7.01(e)):
(a)  connection fees would be treated as operating income as long as
they are not refundable. The refundability of the connection fees
has been suspended since such regulations became effective; the
Government has recently passed decree 231 of 1985, extending the
suspension until December 1986;
(b)  the rate base would now be defined as average net fixed assets in
operation, revalued annually in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
The change of the rate base, by excluding the provision for working
capital, would be consistent ulth what the Bank has already accept-
ed in many other countries and would take into account the large
rate base increase that took place in 1980 when assets were
3/ UTE applies a unified tariff structure to all its customers throughout
the country. In compliance with one of the recommendations of the long-
term marginal cost study (para. 1.11), a tariff office was created
within UTE's organization reporting to the General Manager. The
objectives of this new office are to recommend tariff policies and to
advise on the implementation of the new tariff structure based upon the
recommendations of such study (para. 1.12).

revalued to replacement cost. 4/ Asset revaluation in Uruguay has
been extremely thorough, and it is possible that now some assets
may be overvalued; this may also be the case of El Palmar (Annex
5.1, para. 9). Additionally, UTE's fixed assets include several
significant components which are not directly appropriated to
electricity supply such as a wood treating plant and a recreational
center. The Bank expects to receive from UTE by June 30, 1986 a
detailed account of its net fixed assets in operation for rate base
calculation purposes;
(c) the rate of return would be not less than 6Z, provided that if in
any one year the rate of return were below 6% the shortfall would
be made up the following year. Every year, before October 31, UTE
would review whether it would meet the rate of return re-quirement
in the current year and in the next year and would furnish to the
Bank such review with an action plan to meet the requirement.
(Additionally, for monitoring purposes, UTE would submit to the
Bank quarterly financial reports on rate of return and tariffs.)
Acceptance of this rate of return is justified by the following:
(i) average revenues per Kwh resulting from the 6% rate of return
are in the range of the incremental costs for the 1985-1993 invest-
ment program; and (ii) self-generation for the period 1985-1993 is
expected to be about 45%, which is satisfactory.
Future Finances
5.11      The financial agreements discussed above -- timely tariff
adjustments (para. 5.03), satisfactory restructuring of El Palmar and Salto
Grande financing packages (para. 5.04) and rate of return (para. 5.10) -
4/ Up to 1979 gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation were annually
revalued by an index which attached equal weight to the percentage
increases in the cost of living index and in the exchange rate (pesos per
US$) from December 31 of the previous year to December 31 of the current
year. In 1980, UTE's auditors requested an inventory of all fixed assets
and the mark-up of book values to assessed replacement cost. This
resulted in a value of net fixed assets as of December 31, 1980 of
Ur$7,753.9 million. Had the prior revaluation method been applied, this
value would have been Ur$3,409 million, i.e.: the adjusted value was 127%
higher than the value resulting from the former revaluation method.
Subsequently, in accordance with the provisions of section 5.04 (d) of the
Loan 1779-UR loan agreement, UTE's auditors developed a new revaluation
procedure (to keep the replacement cost up-to-date), to be applied from
1981 on, which was accepted by the Bank and approved by the Government
through a decree passed on June 2, 1982. Essentially the new procedure,
which is consistently applied, calls for: (a) revaluing civil works based
on the Uruguyan cost of construction index; and (b) revaluing equipment by
compounding external inflation (as measured by the US wholesale price
index) by the change in the exchange rate over the year.

constitute the basic principles of a sound financing plan that would enable
UTE to carry out the project in a timely fashion. However, to ensure that
the financial performance of UTE would be satisfactory, during negotiations
the Bank agreed with the Government and UTE to repeat, with minor changes,
the following covenants of Loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR: (a) if the future debt
service coverage ratio were less than 1.5, UTE would not incur any long term
debt unless the Bank otherwise agrees; (b) until the completion of the
project, UTE would retatin all its earnings; (c) the collection period of
Government accounts receivable would be maintained within 75 days; and (d)
UTE would maintain its self-insurance fund against the standard risks which
are not insured through external insurance (para. 7.02(d) to (g)).
5.12      To ensure adherence to the proposed financing plan until the
project is completed, during negotiations UTE agreed not to undertake without
prior agreement of the Bank, investments (excluding those for the project)
exceeding in any year 3% of the established value of the company's fully
revalued fixed assets in service (para. 7.01(f)).
5.13      UTE's forecast (Annex 5, Tables 5.1 and 5.3) shows the strengthen-
ing of the finances in the 1985-1993 period. Tariffs have been forecast to
achieve a 6% rate of return during the projection period; starting from 1992
a reduction in tariffs is assumed due to a reduction in the tariff for block
energy purchases from Salto Grande (para. 1.05). Since a restructuring of El
Palmar and Salto Grande debt has been assumed (para. 5.04 and Annex 5, Table
5.2, footnote a/), the self-financing ratio is expected to average 44.62
during the period and the financial structure measured by the debt/equity
ratio would be maintained at satisfactory levels (47/53 in 1985 to 24/76 in
1993) throughout the period. Debt service coverage would not be less than
1.2, which is adequate, although consultation with the Bank would be required
for new borrowings. UTE's financial performance through the main financial
indicators is set forth in Annex 5, Table 5.4.

6. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Least Cost Solution
6.01      UTE's generation, transmission, and distribution expansion plan was
prepared, based on an average annual expected load growth for 1985-1993 of 4X
and in conformity with normal standards of reliability. The assumptions
used, methodology and results have been reviewed and found satisfactory to
the Bank. The plan has been established to be part of UTE's least cost
expansion program.
6.02      Generation:  There is no additional new generation capacity
included in the proposed program. The rehabilitation of the existing Gabriel
Terra hydro plant will guarantee the continued operation of the plant, and of
two run-off river hydropower plants located downstream on the Rio Negro
River. The selected alternative has been chosen among several configurations
with different increases in capacity outputs of generators and turbine
efficiencies.
6.03      In the absence of rehabilitation, the generating units are expected
to be phased out starting in 1987 and through 1991, when the last two units
might have to be retired, causing both a cut in the system's hydropower
availabilities and in the regulation of the downstream hydroplants. The
alternative to rehabilitation - conversion to bydraulic control facilities -
was found to be uneconomical given its larger capital investment requirements
and since it would stop contributing energy to the system of about 700 GWh
per year.
6.04      Of the various designs evaluated for rehabilitation, the least cost
option was estimated to yield a rate of return of over 35Z on the capital
investments. For the purpose of rate of return calculations, the planned
nutput from the rehabilitated plant was valued at its thermal equivalent
cost, given that the energy deficit resulting from the otherwise inevitable
phase-out would have to be -met by thermal power facilities because there are
no identified hydro developments. The impact of rehabilitation on the
downstream plants, however, has not been quantified. In this regard, the
calculated rate of return is a minimum measure of the project's benefit.
6.05      In light of the expected phase-out of the existing units, the
rehabilitation would have to be promptly executed: under the given assump-
tions about the system's energy requirements, a one year delay in the startup
of construction has been estimated to result in revenue losses equivalent to
almost half the project investment costs. And since the plant's rehabilita-
tion schedule of works requires a one year energy stoppage per unit,
construction should start in early 1987 to meet the first retirement.
6.06      This component of the project is self contained and justified on
its own merits and is not dependent on the execution of the transmission and
distribution components.

6.07      Transmission and Distribution:  The selection of the 150 kV and 500
kV transmission lines configuration (voltage level, conductor sizes, routing
and span lengths) was based on economic comparison with other possible
configurations. As regards the 500 kV line to the East, it was compared to a
double 150 kV circuit and to a gas turbine alternative, and found to be the
least cost solution for rates of discount up to 12%. The 500 kV line will be
energized in 150 kV during the first seven years of operation. For voltage
selection it was considered only UTE's normalized voltages for transmission
(500 kV and 150 kV). UTE's distribution expansion plan includes normal
expansion of primary feeders, extension of the 60 kV subtransmission system,
remodeling and upgrading the 30 kV underground system and increasing capacity
in the substations. There were few alternatives for the distribution
expansion, other than considering conductor and transformer sizing and
substation expansion. Primary circuits and substation capacities were
optimized to minimize total investment and operating costs of the system.
Rate of Return
6.08      Since the costs and benefits of the proposed project cannot be
isolated from those of other components of UTE's investment program, the rate
of return was calculated for the 1985-1993 sector investment program.  The
rate of return on the corresponding investments was estimated as being the
discount rate which equates the present values of the costs and benefits
attributed to the investment program. The cost and benefit streams are shown
in Annex 6, Table 6.1.  The underlying assumptions appear as footnotes to the
table. The cost streams include: capital investment on generation, trans-
mission, distribution and general investments, and costs of operation and
maintenance related to the program. All cost streams are net of taxes and
import duties.
6.09      The benefits of the program are related to incremental electricity
sales valued by the current average tariff as a minimum measure of consumer's
willingness to pay. The resulting rate of return is 11.9Z, which is slightly
above the opportunity cost of capital of 11% assumed for Uruguay. This would
indicate that current tariffs are in line with the incremental costs of the
1985-1993 program.
6.10      The above rate of return does not fully measure some of the
benefits to society such as the social benefits of residential and public
uses, or the indirect benefits to industry and commerce, whose production and
employment depend on reliable electricity supply. In this sense, the base
rate of return of 11.9% is deemed to be a minimum measure of the benefits
conferred by the project.
6.11      Standard sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the
impact on the base case rate of return as a result of variations on the key
parameters. The results of these analyses are summarized on the next page:

2. Investments LOZ higher                            10.4
3. Benefits lOZX1ower                                 9.5

5. Investments 1OZ higher and                         8.3
Benefits IOZ lower
6.12      Additionally, the sensitivity of the base case rate of return to a
two year delay in the implementation of the transmission and distribution
component was examined; the estimated impact on the associated beneflts was
calculated to lower the program's base rate of return by less than one
percentage point.

7. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      In addition to the standard clauses in power projects, during
negotiations agreement was reached on the following main points:
(a) The Government would agree on an action plan to settle its accounts
payable to UTE within the following terms: by December 31, 1985,
not more than 120 days; by June 30, 1986, not wore than 90 days and
by December 31, 1986 and thereafter, not more than 75 days.
(b)  UTE would engage consultants for the revision of the design
criteria for the 500 kV transmission line and preparation of
bidding documents for a 150/30 kV substation, by June 1986 (para.
4.04).
(c) UTE would engage consultants to supervise the erection of the
eletromechanical equipment of the Gabriel Terra hydroplant (para.
4.11).
(d) The Government would restructure El Palmar debt in line with UTE's
cash generating capacity if such debt is not restructured with
commercial banks (para. 5.04).
Ce) UTE would achieve a rate of return not lower than 6Z (para. 5.10).
(f)  UTE would not undertake investments exceeding 3% of fixed assets in
service without prior agreement of the Bank (para. 5.12).
7.02      The following main provisions of Loan Agreements 1779-UR and
2484-UR would be maintained:
(a) Auditing and financial statements (para. 2.04)
(b)  Project Unit (para. 4.10)
(c) Tariff adjustwents (para. 5.03)
(d)  Debt service coverage (para. 5.11)
(e)  Electricity bills collection (para. 5.11)
(f)  Self-insurance fund (para. 5.11)
(g)  Retain earnings (para. 5.11)
7.03      With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$45.2 million, to be repaid over a period of 15
years, including three years of grace.

UTE - Power Sector Rehabilitation Project
El Palmar Hydro Plant: Background
1.        El Palmar is a 330 MW hydro plant in full operation since early
1983. It was constructed on schedule, in the period 1976 to 1982, by
'Comision Nixta de El Palmar' (COHIPAL) and subsequently transferred to UTE
in compliance with an agreement under Loan 1779-UR.1/ As of December 31,
1982 CONIPAL's assets (worth US$600 million: US$546 million hydro plant and
transmission lines, and US$54 million current assets -- proceeds of an
external loan deposited in the Central Bank) were transferred to UTE and
US$594 million debts were added to UTE's liabilities; the remaining US$6
million was a Government equity contribution.
2.        El Palmar is a sound power investment in a country that has no
other identified hydro projects. Its justification is technically and
economically attractive, independently of considerations or questions on
prior financing arrangements. In the context and prospects of the present
and estimated level of relative prices, El Palmar is economically justified
and is already producing significant benefits to the Uruguayan economy.
3.        The project was totally financed by external borrowings by
Gove,nment from commercial banks with rather short-term loans which do not
conform to the plant economic life or anticipated cash flow. The Inter-
national Financing Institutions were reluctant to participate in such
financing because in the early 1970's (when the decision was in discussion)
the project was considered economically marginal. The evolution of relative
prices after the oil crisis of the mid-1970's created a different set of
economic conditions, which made El Palmar economic3lly justified despite
investment costs higher than forecast. By then commercial bank financing had
been arranged.
4.        El Palmar was part of the least cost solution for power development
in Uruguay as concluded by the consultants (SOFRELEC-France) in October 1974
under the prevailing economic conditions at that time. At present, although
El Palmar investment cost bas been higher than forecast (paras. 5 to 8
discuss this point), its costs compare favorably with an equivalent thermo-
electric generation alternative.
I/ Law 15.700 of January 10, 1985 terminates the operation of OOMIPAL and
establishes UTE as its legal successor.

5.        El Palmar's average  -eneraticn output (1400 GWh per year) together
with that of Salto Grande have been the main contri.butors to the Uruguayan
diminishing oil imports in the last two years. The oil import savings
resulting from El Palmar are estimated at about US$65s70 million per year.
6.        El Palmar had no significant physical cost overrun; however, the
final total cost was higher than forecast due to two circumstances not
related to the project that took place between 1979 and 1982, which were the
years of peak construction: (a) the monetary approach to the balance of
payments, (which was the Uruguayan external sector policy) kept the rate of
exchange NU$/US$ excessively undervalued; and (b) unusually high interest
rates overburdened the 100l-borrowing-financing-plan, most of It tied to
LIBOR.
7.        Since local contractors were paid with external US$ loans during a
period of US$ undervaluation, the local civil works cost, when measured in
US$, was unusually high. A comparison of the official rate of exchange with
the purchasing power parity rate during the 1979-1982 period (that could have
been the rate of exchange otherwise) is as follows:
Average                    Average                 Estimated US$
Official Rate              Purchasing Power        Undervaluation

1980           9.1                          12.9                   70.5
1981          10.8                          16.5                   65.5
1982          13.9                          19.5                   71.3
8.        Since interest during construction was charged to investment costs,
the unusually high interest rates during the 1979-1982 period also excessive-
ly burdened El Palmar investment cost.
9.        As such extraordinary circumstances negatively impacted El Palmar
investment costs, the following estimate appraises the project cost assuming
it had been constructed under normal circumstances:
