IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
URUGUAY
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Loan 2622-UR)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Sector Rehabilitation
Project in Uruguay for which the A-Loan 2622-UR in the amount of US$45.2 million was
approved on September 19, 1985, signed on September 19, 1986, and made effective on March 6,
1987. The loan was closed on December 31, 1997 after two extensions of the closing date. Last
disbursement occurred on April 6, 1998 and the undisbursed amount of US$2.45 mnillion was
canceled. The project was cofinanced with a, B-Loan of US$45.0 million of which only US$33.7
million was disbursed.
The ICR was prepared by Alvaro J. Covarrubias,; Consultant, under the supervision of
Ricardo Klockner, Senior Financial Analyst. The ICR was reviewed by Asif Faiz (Sector Leader
- LCC7C) and by Maria Victoria Lister (Quality Assurance Support Unit - LCSFP).
The preparation of the ICR began in late October 1997 during a mission carried out by
Mr. Covarrubias (Appendix A: ICR Mission Aide-Memoire). UTE provided the Borrower's
project completion report in late December 1997, additional information in February 1998, and
the last quarterly project progress report (No. 43) in March 1998 (Appendix B: Borrower's
Contribution to the ICR.) The ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement
and the Guarantee and Indemnity Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Government (the Guarantor) and UTE, internal Bank memoranda, and interviews
with Bank staff and Government and UTIE officials and staff involved in project preparation,
appraisal and implementation. UTE concurred with the findings of the ICR. The Government did
not submit comments.

POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Loan 2622-UR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The main objectives of the project were to: (a) strengthen Uruguay's hydroelectric
generation capacity by rehabilitating the Gabriel Terra hydro plant and extending its useful life;
(b) ensure the continued efficient operation of downstream hydrogenerating capacity served by
the Gabriel Terra reservoir; (c) improve the reliability of service in the country by expanding the
transmission and distribution system and to connect areas with growing economic activity to the
system grid; and (d) ensure that the National Power and Transmission Company, UTE
(Administraci6n Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones El&ctricas), continues to operate its facilities
in accordance with sound financial and mnanagerial practices. The project had also the implicit
macroeconomic objective of helping Uruguay reschedule its external debt by including a B-Loan
to cofinance part of the project (paras. 2 and 3).
2.    To achieve the physical objectives, the project included: (a) the rehabilitation of the
Gabriel Terra hydroelectric plant; (b) the extension of the 500 kV transmission system to the
East; (c) the extension of the 500 kV system in Montevideo and upgrade of the 150 kV circuit
ring; (d) the remodeling and upgrading of the 30 kV distribution network in Montevideo; and (e)
consultant services for project management and supervision (para. 4).  To achieve the
institutional objectives, the loan and guarantee agreements established covenants to be complied
with, and specific actions to be taken by the Guarantor and UTE to adjust electricity tariffs,
reduce arrears, and improve the operational performance of UTE and the sector (para. 5).
3.    The objectives were relevant to the power sector of Uruguay and congruent with those
pursued by the Guarantor and the Bank policies for the power sector prevailing at that time.
Conforming to those policies, the project design was mainly oriented to achieve the physical
objective of rehabilitating the hydroelectiic facilities, expanding the power transmission system,
upgrading the distribution facilities and, to a less extent, improving UTE's financial and
operational performance. The cofinancing of the project with a B-Loan was also justified since it
was to help Uruguay to reschedule its external debt and at the same time finance the
transmission and distribution component of the project. The Government is guarantor of UTE for
the Bank A-Loan through a Guarantee Agreement. The Bank is guarantor for up to 50 percent of
the B-Loan through an Indemnity Agreement (paras. 3 and 6).



Implementation Experience and Results
4.    On the macroeconomic side, the main achievement of the Government and UTE was the
successful rescheduling of Uruguay's external debt in 1988, as part of a comprenhesive debt
review exercise.
5.    Project execution was assigned to UTE. The project executing unit was UTE's planning
division whose manager acted as project coordinator. This unit worked within the framework of
UTE's organization with support from the divisions in charge of procurement, construction,
finances and engineering (para. 7).
6.    Physical objectives were substantially achieved. The turbine-generator units and civil
works of the Gabriel Terra hydroelectric were fully rehabilitated, the extension of the 500 kV to
the East was completed, and the improvement of the 150 kV ring network of Montevideo is
being completed. However, the remodeling and improvement of the 30 kV distribution network
of Montevideo was left incomplete but later included as part of the on-going Power Transmission
and Distribution project financed by Loan 3949-UR approved in FY96. In sum, the project met
substantially the objectives of extending the useful life of the Gabriel Terra hydro plant,
expanding the area covered by the power grid and improving the reliability of the service (paras.
8-12)
7.    The rehabilitation of the 50-year old Gabriel Terra plant was the first project of this
nature undertaken in the world. The four turbine generating units were successfully rehabilitated
one at a time without stopping the operation of the remaining generating units. It is estimated that
the rehabilitation works done will extend the useful life of the Gabriel Terra hydroelectric plant
by about 30 years beyond its 50 years of service already delivered (para. 9).
8.    UTE's technical operations. Technical operations of UTE have been fully satisfactory
with respect to electricity production and efficiency of thermal plants. Electricity losses increased
from 17 percent in 1985 to 23 percent in 1990, decreased to about 19 percent in 1993 and have
remained at about 17 percent since 1995. The main culprit is the high level of losses concentrated
in the old distribution network of Montevideo where the 6 kV ungrounded distribution voltage level
is inadequate. Because loss reduction was not a main objective of the project, a loss reduction
program was later included in the follow up Power Transmission and Distribution project financed
by the Bank loan 3949-UR approved in FY96. The latter is designed to bring electricity losses
down to about 13.5 percent by year 2000 (paras. 13-16).
9.   Institutional objectives were partially achieved. UTE's organization and management
performance was only partially improved. As a result of reviews of electricity tariffs and UTE' s
organization, and the pressure on UTE/Government to comply with conditions for further Bank
lending to the power sector, UTE's financial and operational performance improved toward the
end of the project, and can be now considered as satisfactory (para 17-18).



iv
10.   UTE's financial performance was nmixed early in project implementation, but later had an
improving trend. Overall, it can now be considered as satisfactory. Although the rate of return
of the assets in operation did not reach the covenanted value in all the years, self financing had
always a satisfactory level --excepting two dry years that forced UTE to increase thermal
generation, and introduce rationing to comipensate for the shortage of hydroelectric generation.
Debt service coverage ratio has been acceptable since 1993; and debt/equity ratio and operating
ratio have also remained at acceptable values since 1995 (paras. 19-21 and Table 1.1).
11.   UTE's billing and collection procedures are satisfactory. Since 1992 UTE has very well-
developed billing and collection systems. Monthly billing is done through 57 distribution offices
around the country. Data are transmitted electronically to headquarters, bills are sent to
customers four days after metering and given two weeks for payment. In the past, Government
agencies (which in the aggregate represenit about 15 percent of UTE's billing) have had high
level of arrears because of insufficient allocation of budget for paying utility services. This
situation began to improve in 1990 when the Government created a "clearing-house system"
(agreed under Loan 3221-UR) to compensate owed balances among the main public entities
participating in the system. Generally, the system has been working well as reflected in a steady
decrease in the magnitude of UTE's total accounts receivable over the past 5 years, which is
now about 55 days of billing (para. 22 and Table 1.2).
12.   Electricity tariffs.  Substantial achievements were made towards the end of the project.
The tariff categories were rationalized, their structure was improved (consumers pay in
accordance with their impact on the load curve) and demand-side management is now done by
using Time-of-Day-Use tariff (TOD) (para. 23 and Table 1.3). Electricity tariffs evolved over
the years following the recommendations made by a tariff study completed in 1982 by
independent consultant under the Bank loan 1779-UR. This study was updated by competent
UTE's staff, assessed by the Bank in 1995 and found satisfactory, particularly in the
determination of the long-range marginal costs (LRMC) and tariff structure. The present average
tariff of 11 UScents/kWh is slightly higher than the LRMC.
13.   Financial management. UTE's financial management has been improved mainly as a
result of the Power Modernization Project financed by the Bank loan 3221-UR. The current
accounting system was established in 1990 and has a well developed computerized system for
financial records, inventory, budget control, billing, fixed assets and payroll. Financing planning
is done in line with the norms of the national budget, using a computerized long-term financial
planning software model prepared jointly with the Bank. External auditing of UTE's accounts is
done by the Tribunal de Cuentas (TC), an autonomous body reporting directly to the Congress.
In some years, the review of accounts by the TC and the slow approval of UTE's Board of
Directors have caused delays in the delivery of audited financial reports to the Bank (para. 24).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
14.   Project Costs. The project is expected to be completed at a cost of US$183.6 million, or
32.9 percent above the appraisal estimate of US$138.1 million. A major contribution to the cost



v
overrun was the higher than estimated price of the turnkey contract for the rehabilitation of
Gabriel Terra. Moreover, price contingencies estimated at appraisal were not adequate to cover
the significant increase in the cost of foreign goods and services caused by the high international
inflation prevailing during the period 1985-1992 when the rehabilitation and other major
contracts for the project were awarded including transmission and distribution components.
(para. 25 and Part Il, Table 8A: Project Cost).
15.   Project Financing. The project financing structure differs from the appraisal estimate.
The Bank's contribution to project financing was the original loan of US$42.8 million, i.e., 23.3
percent of the actual project financing requirements and certainly much less than the 32.7
percent estimated at project appraisal. The B-Loan funded US$33.76 million only, i.e., 18.4
percent of the project or about two third of the appraisal estimate. UTE financed US$ 74.4
million, i.e., 40.5 percent of the project or much more than the 34.7 percent estimated at
appraisal. The gap of 17.9 percent in the project financing was funded with a French commercial
credit of US$15.2 million equivalent to FF80.0 million (it covered the higher costs of the
contract for the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra which was awarded to French consortium),
and US$17.5 million with money borrowed by UTE from the Banco de la Repuiblica Oriental del
Uruguay, BROU (para. 26 and Part II, Table 8B: Project Financing).
16.   Project Economic Performance. The project's economic returns was recalculated using
the same approach of the SAR, i.e. the internal rate of return of the stream of net incremental
benefits associated with UTE's generation, transmission and distribution investment program.
The cost stream comprises: (a) the capital investment in generation transmission, distribution and
general plant costs; and (b) the incremental operation and maintenance cost of UTE, net of taxes
and custom duties. The benefit stream is the incremental revenue from electricity sales at the
prevailing tariff rates. All costs and benefits were expressed in constant 1996 prices. The
recalculated internal economic rate of return is 12.2 percent i.e., slightly better than the 11.9
percent estimated at appraisal. This case can be explained by the fact that delaying of benefits
has been compensated by postponing of investment which was higher than original estimates. If
the actual investment made in rehabilitating Gabriel Terra plant is separated from the total
project cost, it can be concluded that the extension of the hydroelectric plant life in 30 years was
achieved at a low cost of US$390 per kW --a cost lower than installing industrial gas turbines
(para. 27).
17.   Major Factors Affecting the Project. The main factors affecting the implementation of
project were: (a) the long period which elapsed between loan approval and effectiveness (about
18 months) caused by negotiations between the Government and the international banking
community on the B-Loan linked to the Bank A-Loan; (b) UTE's delay in preparing bidding
documents to contract the complex works required to rehabilitate the Gabriel Terra hydroelectric
plant; (c) the long time taken to negotiate and approve additional French commercial credit
needed to finance the higher than estimated rehabilitation cost of that hydroelectric plant; and (d)
the lack of financial and operational autonomy of UTE from the Government. Although all these
factors combined delayed project start in about three and half years, the actual duration of the
rehabilitation works was similar to the appraisal estimate, i.e., project completion slipped three



vi
and half years from June 1994 to December 1997. At the same time, these factors caused the
Bank to extend the loan effectiveness deadline and loan closing dates, and to reallocate the
proceeds of the Bank A-Loan among the project components (paras. 28-31).
18.   The performance of contractors was satisfactory. The supply of goods and services was
of good quality. The main contractor for the rehabilitation package of the Gabriel Terra plant
had an excellent performance and carried out the works in a very orderly manner. In spite of
some delays incurred in carrying out the rehabilitation works of the first unit of Gabriel Terra
plant --caused by a first of a kind process-- the main contractor gained experience and was able
to later recover from the initial slippage. The main contractor completed the works and
commissioned the last unit on December 3, 1997, i.e., three weeks in advance of the contracted
implementation schedule. The consulting firm (Merz & Mc Lellan) supervised the rehabilitation
of Gabriel Terra plant also had an excellenrt performance (para. 32).
19.   Loan disbursement was very slow compared to the appraisal estimate. This was caused by
the 18 month delay in loan effectiveness compounded with the delay in finalizing the
negotiations and approval of the French credit. The loan closing date had to be extended from
June 30, 1994 to December 31, 1997 in tvo stages. The first extension by one year was granted
in April 1994 knowing that future extensions would be needed to account for the initial delays in
initiating project implementation, but as a prudent measure to monitor how well UTE was
managing the implementation of the entire project, as well as its compliance with loan covenants.
The second extension by two and half additional years was granted in May 1995 once the Bank
was satisfied with project implementation progress and with UTE's compliance with loan
covenants. The disbursement schedule was amended twice. The first amendment, in May 1995,
reallocated US$12.6 million from the Bank A-Loan to the financing of additional costs of the
rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra plant which were not covered by the initial allocation in the Bank
loan and the French credit. The second arnendment, in January 1997, reallocated US$3.9 million
from the Bank A-Loan to the financing of the transmission and distribution components which
were not fully financed by the B-Loan. Loan closing date was December 31, 1997. Last
disbursement occurred on April 6, 1998 at which time the undisbursed amount of US$2.45
million was canceled (paras. 33-34 and Part II, Table 4: Loan Disbursement).
20.   Special account. UTE opened a special account in the Central bank of Uruguay in
accordance with the provisions established in the loan agreement. The special account was
replenished by the Bank at a level of US$4.0 million upon applications made by UTE.
21.   Procurement involved 19 calls for bids for the supply of equipment and construction
services and 3 contracts for consultant services. The contractors performed satisfactorily in the
supply of goods, construction services, and project supervision. The first contract for supervising
the rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra was canceled by mutual agreement between the consulting
firm and UTE. Then, another consulting firm was contracted for that purpose (paras. 31-32 and
Part II, Table 5).



vii
22.   Environmental aspects. No environmental assessment (EA) was done during project
preparation. As a result, UTE experienced delays in procuring land and in obtaining right of
ways for the transmission system. At that time the EAs were not required -- the Bank's policies
on EA were not in effect -- and UTE did not have the capacity to do it. Obviously, it would have
been beneficial for UTE if it had anticipated the social impacts of the transmission system earlier
in the project cycle. The Gabriel Terra rehabilitation did not pose environmental problems
because it was a hydroelectric plant already built (para. 35.)
23.   Bank performance was satisfactory in project identification, preparation and appraisal.
The Bank staff devoted substantial efforts to project preparation. The project objectives were
clearly defined and the physical scope of the project was well justified. Reasonably good project
justification and economic analysis were done in the SAR based on the standard guidelines of the
Bank for this type of projects. Also, the project design reflects the Bank's ingenuity in linking
UTE's investment needs with Uruguayan's needs for fresh financing on macro grounds, which
resulted in a creditable project accomplishment (para. 36).
24.   Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. The Bank carried extensive project
supervision (80.3 staff-weeks costing US$260,000) from May 1986 to October 1997 including
14 supervision missions (para 36. Part II, Table 12: Bank Resources: Staff Inputs; Table 12:
Bank Resources: Missions). The Bank was patient in waiting for the approval of the B-loan and
French commercial credit, which underwent a long negotiation and approval process by the
Uruguayan Congress. The Bank also was flexible but prudent in extending loan closing date
twice, the first extension to watch and see whether the project implementation were to be
expedited, and the second extension once it was clear that project implementation had taken
momentum, particularly in the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra plant. Moreover, the Bank
agreed to amend the amortization schedule of the loan upon the request of UTE. Because of the
delay in starting project implementation, the Bank considered it was an unfair burden on UTE to
repay the loan at the same time it was disbursing it, making the net transfer of loan funds very
small. The revised loan amortization schedule has lower amounts during the early years but
increasing amounts in later years to yield the same present value of the original loan amortization
schedule (para. 37).
25.   Also, the supervision missions allowed the Bank to deepen the dialogue with the
Government and UTE and process two additional lending operation for the power sector (Loan
3221-UR in support of the Power Modernization project and Loan 3949-UR in support of the
Transmission and Distribution project).  These two operations focused on institutional
development and additional investment needed to modernize the Uruguayan power sector --two
aspects which were not the principal objectives of Loan 2622-UR (para. 38).
26.   Borrower Performance. Project preparation by UTE as borrower and executing agency
was satisfactory. Specifically, the feasibility study for the rehabilitation the Gabriel Terra plant and
the expansion of the 500 kV transmission system were initiated in 1984 and completed in mid-1986
as a component of the Power Engineering project financed by the Bank loan 2484-UR. Fichtner
(Germany) designed of the 500 kV line. Electricite de France, EdF (France), and Electroconsult



viii
(Italy) assisted UTE in the rehabilitation, studies of the Gabriel Terra plant and analysis of the
transmission and distribution systems expansion, respectively (para. 39).
27.   Project implementation. Physical implementation was delayed because of the significant
project financing gap created by higher than estimated rehabilitation price of the contract with
the French contractors retained for the rehabilitation works of Gabriel Terra. However, the project
implementation gained momentum and began to progress quickly once the Congress approved the
French commercial credit to UTE in June 1991 to fill the financing gap. In sum, the rehabilitation
of Gabriel Terra plant and the expansion of the 500 kV transmission system were substantially and
successfully completed by UTE with delays which indeed did not affect negatively the overall
technical performance of UTE nor the economic performance of the project (Para. 40, and Part II,
Table 6: Key indicators of Project Implementation).
28.   Compliance with covenants. The compliance with loan covenants by UTE depended
strongly on the Government complying with the covenants of the guarantee agreement.
Consequently, the mixed compliance with covenants by the Government influenced the ability of
UTE to comply with covenants all the iime, particularly during the early years of the project.
Moreover, by the Government deciding the size and scope of UTE's investment program, and
allocating insuficient budget to Municipalities and public agencies for payment of electricity
services, it limited the flow of funds to UTE, impeded UTE to complete the distribution
component, and increased high arrears of the Municipalities to UTE in the late 1980's and early
1990's (para. 41 and Table 1.1, Financial Indicators, and Part II, Table 10: Status of
Covenants).
29.   Considering the importance attached to the physical objectives of the project and the debt
rescheduling of Uruguay, and the relatively low emphasis given to the institutional objectives of
this particular project, the Borrower (UTE and Government combined) performance is considered
satisfactoryfor both project implementation and compliance with covenants (para. 42).
Project Sustainability
30.   Sustainability of the project is liely because: (a) the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra
hydroelectric plant and the physical facilities installed by the project in the transmission and
distribution system meet internationally acceptable levels of quality; (b) UTE has competent staff
with appropriate skills to operate and maintain the new facilities; (c) the finances of UTE are
now sound and expected to improve further in the future, specially because of the Government
policy of shifting investment in the power sector from UTE to private investors; and (e) there is a
credible plan for future project operation (para. 43).
Project Outcome
31.   The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory because: (a) the physical objective of
rehabilitating the Gabriel Terra plant was fully achieved by extending the life of the hydroelectric
plant by 30 years at the low cost of about US$390 per kW; (b) the expansion of the 500 kV



ix
transmission system and the 150 kV network were substantially achieved; (c) the recalculated
economic rate of return of the project (12.2 percent) is slightly better than the appraisal estimate
(11.9 percent), which indicates that the delaying of project benefits was compensated by the
postponing of costs; (d) the B-Loan helped the Government reschedule Uruguay's external debt;
and (e) project sustainability is likely. The partial completion of the distribution component and
the mixed compliance with financial covenants by UTE and the Government in some years, do
not outweigh the positive project accomplishments or affect the project outcome rating (para.
44.) It is also important to note that UTE is monitoring the sector through a set of performance
indicators agreed at project appraisal. Additional indicators agreed during project supervision are
being used to monitor the performance of the turbine generators units of the Gabriel Terra
hydroelectric plant (para. 44, and Part II, Table 6: Key Indicators for Project Operation).
Future Project Operation
32.   Future operation is linked to the achievements of the follow up Power Modernization
Project financed by the Bank loan 3221-UR (to be closed in January 1999), and the objectives of
the on-going Power Transmission and Distribution Project financed by the Bank loan 3949-UR.
T-hese operations emphasize the consolidation of the power sector reform (which enhances the role
of the private sector in power development), the consolidation of UTE's institutional
improvements, the improvement of power distribution reliability, and the promotion of a more
efficient use of energy. All these objectives shape a credible plan which will certainly contribute to
a satisfactory operation of the project and the sector in the future (para. 45).
Key Lessons Learned
33.   Based on the experience gained with this lending operation, the following lessons can be
offered (para. 46):
Lesson 1.    This project has proven that the rehabilitation of an old hydroelectric plant is
feasible and economical. By reinforcing the civil works and mechanical equipment of the
dam, and by replacing equipment the obsolete components of the turbines and generators,
and their auxiliaries and metering and control systems with state-of-the-art, the useful life of
an hydroelectric station can be extended in several decades beyond its original life. In this
case, the useful life of the plant will be extended by about 30 years beyond the 50 years of
service already elapsed, at a low cost of about US$390 per kW.
Lesson 2.    Good planning of engineering, equipment supply, installation and
commissioning and close field supervision by a competent consultant firm are key factors
to succeed in carrying out the rehabilitation of an hydroelectric plant while it is still
operational. Consequently, it is advisable that the design of the works be prepared and
negotiated as a rehabilitation package comprising equipment supply, installation and
commissioning, before loan presentation to the Board. The package approach played a key
role in the rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra plant. The design of the works and the selection



x
of the contractor for the rehabilitation package was a long and complex process and delayed
the start of project implementation. However, once those barriers were passed, the
contractor rehabilitated the four units of the Gabriel Terra plant within a tight schedule, one
unit at a time, without stopping the operation of the remaining generating units.
Lesson 3.    Advance  commitrment of project financing sources is a key factor for
expediting project implementation. In this case, the negotiation, approval and effectiveness
of the additional financing required for the rehabilitation works of Gabriel Terra delayed the
contractor to start field work by about two years.
Lesson 4.    Cofinancing of an investmnent project through a B-loan can help a country
with quick loan disbursement to cope with difficulties in serving external debt, but it
involves complex negotiations and approvals that can impact negatively on the
implementation of an investment lending operation.

IMPLEMENTAT'ION COMPLETION REPORT
URUGUAY
POWER SECTOR, REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Loan 2622-UR)
PART I - IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction
1.    During the period 1950-1995 the Bank made 9 loans to Uruguay's power sector totaling
US$342.7 million. These loans assisted Uruguay in developing thermal and hydroelectric
generation, transmission systems, and power distribution networks. These loans also attempted
to improve the organization and the economical, operational, and financial performance of the
power sector. Loan 2622-UR, the subject of this ICR, followed Loan 2484-UR (Power
Engineering Project) and overlapped with on-going Loans 3221-UR (Power Modernization
Project) and 3949-UR (Power Transmission and Distribution Project).
Project Objectives
2.    The main objectives of the project were to:
(a) strengthen Uruguay's hydroelectric generation capacity by rehabilitating the Gabriel
Terra hydro plant and extending iits useful life;
(b) ensure the continued efficient operation of downstream hydrogenerating capacity
served by the Gabriel Terra reservoir;
(c) improve the reliability of service in the country by expanding the transmission and
distribution system and to connect areas with growing economic activity to the system
grid; and
(d) ensure that the National Power and Transmission Company, UTE (Administracion
Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas), continues to operate its facilities in
accordance with sound financial and managerial practices.
3.    The project was cofinanced by a B-Loan of US$45.0 million granted to the Central Bank
of Uruguay by a group of commercial banks. This was a significant macroeconomic objective of
the project. The cofinancing facility was to help Uruguay reschedule its external debt and finance
the transmission and distribution components of the project. Uruguay's external debt problem in
the early 1980's was caused by the difficulties in obtaining foreign currency when foreign banks



2
stop new lending and many businesses-banks went bankrupt. The Bank is guarantor for up to 50
percent of the B-Loan through an Indemnity Agreement.
4.    To achieve the physical objectives, the project included the following components:
(a) Rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra Hydro plant. This component consists of:
replacement of the electromechanical equipment in the power plant (generators, turbines,
and all the auxiliary services and control) and minor civil works in the power house and
the dam;
(b) Extension of the 500 kV transmission system to the East. This component consists of:
123 km of 500 kV lines from Montevideo to San Carlos; 17 km of 150 kV lines to
connect the San Carlos substation and expansion of the 150 kV Montevideo and San
Carlos substations;
(c) Extension of the 500 kV system in Montevideo and upgrading of the 150 kV circuit
ring. This component consists of: 20 km of 500 kV transmission lines, 1 1 km of 150 kV
lines, 25 km of 150 kV under-ground lines, and 150/30 kV transformer substations;
(d) Remodeling and upgrading of the 30 kV distribution network in Montevideo. This
component consists of 70 km under-ground 30 kV distribution lines, 160 MVA 30/6 kV
substations, and 23 MVA 30/15 kV substations; and
(e) Consultant services for project management and supervision.
5.    To achieve the institutional objectives, covenants in the loan and guarantee agreements
established specific actions to be taken by the Guarantor and UTE to adjust electricity tariffs,
reduce arrears, reorganize UTE, and implement earlier recommendations made by studies to
improve the operational performance of UTE and the power sector.
6.    The project's objectives were clearly stated in the Staff Appraisal Report. The objectives
were relevant to the power sector of Uruguay. They were congruent with those pursued by the
Guarantor and the Bank policies for the power sector prevailing at that time.a Conforming to
those policies, the project design was mainly oriented to achieve the physical objective of
rehabilitating the hydroelectric facilities, expanding the power transmission system and
upgrading the distribution facilities and, to a lesser extent, to improve UTE's financial and
operational performance. Also, the cofinancing of the project with a B-Loan was justified since
it was to help Uruguay reschedule its external debt and at the same time finance the transmission
and distribution component of the project
a  Bank's policy for the electric power sector was detailed in OMS 3.72 dated 1978.

B. Achievement of Objectives
Implementation Organization
7.    Physical components were implemnented by UTE. Project execution was assigned to UTE.
The project executing unit was UTE's planning division whose manager acted as project
coordinator, with support from the divisions in charge of procurement, construction, finances
and engineering. Those divisions provided technical and project management guidance to ensure
that design, procurement and construction were to be executed in a timely and orderly manner.
Consultants assisted in project design and supervision of the rehabilitation works.
Physical Objectives
8.    Physical objectives were substantially achieved. The turbine-generator units and civil
works of the Gabriel Terra hydroelectric were fully rehabilitated, the extension of the 500 kV to
the East was completed, and the improvement of the 150 kV ring network of Montevideo is
being completed. However, the remodeling and improvement of the 30 kV distribution network
of Montevideo was left incomplete due to the reduction of UTE's investment program made by
the Government. Later, this was included as part of the on-going Power Transmission and
Distribution project (Loan 3949-UR) approved in FY96. In sum, the project met substantially the
objectives of extending the useful life of the Gabriel Terra hydro plant, expanding the area
covered by the power grid and improving the reliability of the service.
9.    Rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra hydroelectric plant. The four turbine generators units
and civil works of the dam were successfully rehabilitated. The fixed blades of the distributor
and moveable blades of the rotor of the ]Kaplan turbines were replaced; the stator windings and
the poles of the generators were replaced; state-of-the-art static excitatrices were installed in the
generators; the turbine and generator control systems were totally replaced by automated controls
and modern control and metering equipment is now in service in the control rooms. Also, the
step-up generator power transformers vwere replaced. As a result, the power output of each
generating unit increased by 5.7 MW to 38 MW with a net hydraulic head of 26 meters. The new
output of the hydroelectric plant is now 152 MW with an overall efficiency increased by about
5.6 percent. Additionally, new water discharge gates were installed in the dam and a gliding
gantry crane added to help maintenance work on the dam discharge gates.
10.   The rehabilitation of the 50-year old Gabriel Terra plant was the first project of this
nature undertaken in the world. The four turbine generating units were rehabilitated one at a time
without stopping the operation of the remaining generating units. It is estimated that the
rehabilitation will extend the useful life of the Gabriel Terra hydroelectric plant by about 30
years beyond its 50 years of service already delivered.
11.   Extension of the 500 kV transmission system to the East and extension of the 500 kV
system in Montevideo and upgrading of the 150 kV circuit ring.. The 500 kV lines from
Montevideo to San Carlos were completed with minor changes to the original design. The 150
kV lines to San Carlos substation, the expansion of Montevideo and San Carlos substations, the
additional 150 kV lines, and other 150/30 kV transformer substations are being completed.



4
These new facilities --some of which replaced obsolete equipment-- have prepared the 500 kV
transmission system and the primary distribution 150 kV network for expanding the power
transformer capacity feeding the urban zones. Some of these expansions are already included as
components of the on-going Transmission and Distribution project financed by the Bank loan
3949-UR.
12.   Remodeling and upgrading of the 30 kV distribution network in Montevideo. This
component was only partially completed: the equipment financed by the Bank loan was procured
but the installation works to be financed by UTE have been delayed beyond 1997 because of
both limits to UTE's investment program imposed by the Government and the bankruptcy of one
of the contractors. A part of the distribution component is now also included in the on-going
Transmission and Distribution project financed by the Bank Loan 3949-UR.
13.   UTE's technical operations. Technical operations of UTE have been fully satisfactory
with respect to electricity production and efficiency of thermal plants. Unfortunately, no progress
was made under the project in reducing electricity losses for which a remedial program has been
included in follow up Bank loans to UTE.
14.   Total electricity production increased steadily from 3,880 GWh in 1985 to 6,627 GWh in
1996 (average growth of 5.0 percent per year), including electricity transfer from the bi-national
Uruguay and Argentina Salto Grande hydroelectric plant operated by a Mixed Technical
Commission, CTM. The annual transfer of low cost electricity from Salto Grande grew steadily
from 1,045 GWh in 1985 to 3,686 GWh in 1990 (about 33 percent of total electricity production)
and has remained in the range of 4,000-4200 GWh during the period 1992-1996 (about 64 percent
of total electricity production).
15.   Efficiency of thermal plants has been maintained at acceptable levels in view of the
different ages and conditions of the old Batlle Ordofiez and the new La Tablada power stations.
Battle Ordofiez has two units already retired; two 44 year old oil-fired 50 MW units with a low
efficiency (330 gr. of fuel per kWh), and two 27 years old oil-fired 125 MW units (rehabilitated
in 1994) with a relatively good efficiency (260 grams of fuel per kWh). La Tablada, a brand new
installation under loan 322 1-UR commissioned in 1992, is equipped with two industrial type 114
MW gas turbine units with also a good efficiency (270 gr. of fuel per kWh).
16.   Electricity losses increased from 17 percent in 1985 to 23 percent in 1990, decreased to
about 19 percent in 1993 and have remained at about 17 percent since 1995. The main culprit is
the high level of technical losses concentrated in the old distribution network of Montevideo where
the 6 kV ungrounded distribution voltage level is inadequate. Despite the recommendations of the
loss reduction study carried out under the Power Engineering project financed by the Bank loan
2484-UR, UTE did not have the resources to abate electricity losses (para. 8). Since loss reduction
was not a main objective of the project, a loss reduction program was included in the Transmission
and Distribution project (Loan 3949-UR) which is designed to reduce total electricity losses to
about 13.5 percent by year 2000.



5
Institutional Objectives
16.   On the macroeconomic side, the main achievement of the Government was the successful
rescheduling of Uruguay's external debt in 1988. The B-Loan was instrumental in achieving the
rescheduling.
17.  Institutional objectives were partially achieved. The project accomplished some
improvements in UTE's organization and management performance. Also, as a result of
electricity tariff reviews and the pressutre on UTE/Government to comply with conditions for
further Bank lending to the power sector, UTE's financial and operational performance improved
toward the end of the project, and is now considered as satisfactory.
18.   UTE 's financial performance was mixed early in project implementation, but later had
an improving trend. Overall, it can now be considered as satisfactory. Although the rate of
return of the assets in operation did not reach the covenanted value, self financing had always a
satisfactory level --except two dry years that forced UTE to increase thermal generation, and
introduce rationing to compensate for the shortage of hydroelectric generation. Debt service
coverage ratio has been acceptable since the early 1990's; and debt/equity ratio and operating
ratio have also remained at acceptable values since 1995. (Table 1.1)
19.   UTE's self-financing and rate of return. Self financing has been in the satisfactory range
32-81 percent, excepting years 1985 (-143 percent in the first year of the project), 1989 and 1990
(-144 and 1.0 percent because of two very dry years). During those two very dry years electricity
sales decreased because of electricity rationing and, at the same time, operation costs increased
due to more thermal generation to compensate for the shortage of hydroelectric generation. As a
consequence, the rate of return plummerted to 0.3 percent, but later recovered to about 7 percent
in 1994 and 1995.
20.   UTE's debt service coverage ratio. Until 1992, UTE did not reach the covenanted 1.5
debt service coverage ratio, but did not idefault in its debt (the ratio was as low as 0.3 in 1989, a
critical dry year), but in and after 1993 tis ratio reached the covenanted values.
21.   UTE's debt/equity ratio and a,perating ratio.  These financial indicators have had
satisfactory levels excepting, again, the dry years (in 1989 and 1990 they were about 0.52 for the
debt/equity ratio, and 0.83 for the operating ratio), but decreased to about 0.37 and 0.57
respectively, since 1995. Although UTE's capital structure and cash flow can be now considered
adequate, there is still room to improve sector performance further by allowing more private
participation, and by reducing operating expenses through a rationalization of UTE' s
organization and size.

Note:   SAR figures for the period 1994/97 were taken from the SAR for Loan 3949-UR. Since 1994, accounts
receivable covenant is 30 days for private customers and 60 days for Government agencies.
22.    UTE's billing and collection procedures are satisfactory. Since 1992 UTE has very well-
developed billing and collection systems. Monthly billing is done through 57 distribution offices
around the country. Data are transmitted electronically to headquarters, bills are sent to
customers four days after metering and given two weeks for payment. Private customers pay
their bills either directly in UTE's offices around the country or in supermarkets, Banco de la
Rep6blica, or lottery agencies, which charge a small collection fee. Customers are charged an



7
increasing delay fine for late payment and disconnected from service after 21 days in arrears.
Reconnection of service is done within 24 hours after payment. In the past, Government
agencies who constitute about 15 percent of UTE's billing have had high level of arrears because
it was Government policy to tolerate state utilities to owe each other. This situation began to
improve in 1990 when the Government created a "clearing-house system" (agreed under Loan
3221-UR) to compensate owed balances among the main public entities participating in the
system. Generally, the system has been working well as reflected in a steady decrease in the
magnitude of UTE's total accounts receivable over the past 5 years, which is now about 55 days
of billing (Table 1.2).

23.   Electricity tariffs. Substantial achievements were made towards the end of the project.
The tariff categories were rationalized, their structure was improved (consumers pay in
accordance with their impact on the load curve) and demand-side management is now done by
using Time-of-Day-Use tariff (TOD). Electricity tariffs evolved over the years following the
recommendations by a tariff study completed in 1982 by independent consultant under the Bank
Loan 1779-UR (Fifth Power Project). This study was updated by competent UTE's staff,
assessed by the Bank in 1995 and found satisfactory, particularly in the determination of the
long-range marginal costs (LRMC) ancl tariff structure. The present average tariff of 11
UScents/kWh is slightly higher than the LRMC. (Table 1. 3)
24.   Financial management. The accounting system  is centralized in headquarters.  The
current accounting system was established in 1990 and has a well developed computerized
system for financial records, inventory, budget control, billing, fixed assets and payroll.
Financial planning is done in line with the norms of the national budget, using a computerized
long-term financial planning software model prepared jointly with the Bank. External auditing
of UTE's accounts is done by the Tribunal de Cuentas (TC) which is an autonomous body
reporting directly to the Congress. Auiditing has been done in accordance with acceptable
international standards. During the installation of the new computerized accounting system in
the period 1989-1992, audits reports suffered justified delays of up to 8 months. Later UTE took
measures to provide the Bank with audit reports on time, but frequently requested postponements
because of delays incurred by either review of accounts by the TC's or UTE's Board approval of
the balance sheets.

Project Costs
25.   The project is expected to be completed at a cost of US$183.6 million, or 32.9 percent
above the appraisal estimate of US$138.1 million. Part of the project cost overrun was due to
cost overrun of the Gabriel Terra plant rehabilitation component. This was caused by a change in
the procurement method used to contract the rehabilitation works of the Gabriel Terra plant.
Originally, the split package method was chosen and the rehabilitation cost estimated
accordingly. Later, the turnkey method was chosen as a way to solve coordination problems
foreseen among several suppliers, albeit risking higher cost. It was a very effective solution but
it had a cost much higher than the appraisal estimate. Moreover, the estimate of price
contingencies made at appraisal was not adequate to cover the significant increase in the cost of
foreign goods and services caused by the high international inflation prevailing during the period
1985-1992 when the rehabilitation and other good and services were contracted, including those
for the transmission and distribution components. (Part II, Table 8A: Project Cost.)
Project Financing.
26.   The financing of the project was realized with a different structure than that planned. The
Bank's contribution to project financing was the total original loan of US$42.8 million, i.e., 23.3
percent of the actual project financing requirements and less than the 32.7 percent estimated at
project appraisal. The B-Loan funded US$33.76 million only, i.e., 18.4 percent of the project or
about two third of the appraisal estimate. UTE financed US$ 74.4 million, i.e., 40.5 percent of
the project or much more than the 34.7 percent estimated at appraisal. The gap of 17.9 percent in
the project financing was funded with a French credit of US$15.2 million equivalent to FF80.0
million (it covered the higher costs of the contract for the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra
which was awarded to French consortium) and US$17.5 million with money borrowed by UTE
from the Banco de la Repu'blica Oriental del Uruguay, BROU (Part II, Table 8B: Project
Financing).
Project Economic Performance
27.   The project's economic performance was recalculated using the same approach of the
SAR, i.e. the internal rate of return of the stream of net incremental benefits associated with
UTE's generation, transmission and distribution investmnent program.  The cost stream
comprises: (a) the capital investment in generation transmission, distribution and general plant
costs net of taxes and custom duties; and (b) the incremental operation and maintenance cost of
UTE. The benefit stream is the incremental revenue from electricity sales at the prevailing tariff
rates. All costs and benefits were expressed in 1996 prices using MUV indices to account for
international inflation and rate of exchange variations. The recalculated internal economic rate
of return (12.2 percent) is slightly better than the appraisal estimate (11.9 percent). This case can
be explained by the fact that delaying benefits caused by project implementation slippage has
been compensated by the postponing of investrnent which were higher than original estimates. If
the actual investment made in rehabilitating Gabriel Terra plant is separated from the total
project cost, it can be concluded that the extension of the hydroelectric plant life in 30 years was
achieved at a low cost of US$390 per kW --a cost lower than installing industrial gas turbines.

C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
28.   The main factors affecting the implementation of the project were: (a) the long period
which elapsed between loan approval and effectiveness (about 18 months) caused by
negotiations between the Government and the international banking community on the B-Loan
linked to the Bank A-Loan; (b) UTE's delay in preparing bidding documents due to the complex
works required to rehabilitate the Gabriel Terra hydroelectric plant; (c) the long time taken to
negotiate and approve additional French cofinancing needed to cover the higher than estimated
rehabilitation cost of that hydroelectric plant; and (d) the lack of financial and operational
autonomy of UTE from the Government. Although all these factors combined delayed project
start in about three and half years, the actual duration of the rehabilitation works took a time
similar to the appraisal estimate, i.e., project completion slipped three and half years from June
1994 to December 1997. At the same time, these factors caused the Bank to extend the loan
effectiveness deadline and loan closing dates, and to reallocate the proceeds of Bank A-Loan
among the project components.
29.   The approval and effectiveness of the B-Loan was a complex and lengthy process
involving the commercial banks, the Government, and the Bank. Because of cross conditionality,
the B-Loan delayed the effectiveness of the Bank A-Loan. Since both loans required approval by
the Uruguayan Congress, the whole process delayed the effectiveness of the Bank A-Loan in
about 18 months.
30.   UTE and the Government gave high priority to the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra
hydroelectric plant and the expansion of the 500 kV transmission system once the B-Loan and
the French commercial credit were approved. However, UTE could not implement in full the
improvement program of the Montevideo distribution network because it lacked autonomy in
deciding the size and composition of its annual investment program. Indeed, the Government by
reducing the annual allocation of funds to UTE's investment program because of the severe fiscal
deficit faced at that time, caused UTE to scale down the size and implementation rhythm of the
distribution component.
31.   Procurement of goods and services was significantly delayed because of the time taken to
finalize project financing arrangements. Procurement of equipment and construction services
involved a total of 19 calls for bids. Rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra was contracted as a turnkey
package comprising supply of equipment, installation and commissioning in order to avoid the
coordination problems created among several suppliers if a split package procurement method
had been chosen . It took a long time to arrange the turnkey package due to the complexity of
the works to be carried out. Awarding of contracts for the supply of transmission equipment was
completed in July 1996, and the award:ing of several contracts for distribution works was only
completed in February 1997. Although UTE carried out procurement in accordance with Bank
guidelines, the time elapsed between call for bids and contract awarding and signature has been
extremely long (many examples of two or more years) because of the numerous approvals
required inside UTE and outside in the Government's agencies (mainly the TC). (Part II, Table
5: Indicatorsfor Project Implementation.)



10
32.   The performance of contractors was satisfactory. The supply of goods and services was
of good quality, and UTE's technical staff, with the assistance of consultants, supervised
satisfactorily the quality of the equipment and materials supplied and the quality of the
construction works. It should be noted that the contractor of the package for the rehabilitation of
the Gabriel Terra plant had an excellent performance and carried it out in a very orderly manner.
Moreover, despite some delays incurred in rehabilitating the first unit of Gabriel Terra plant --
caused by a first of a kind process-- the main contractor gained experience and was able to later
recover from the initial slippage. The contractor completed the works and commissioned the last
unit on December 3, 1997, i.e., three weeks in advance of the contracted implementation
schedule. The first contract for the supervision of Gabriel Terra works was canceled by mutual
agreement between UTE and the consulting firm. Individual consultants were hired by UTE
during the process of contracting another consulting firm for the supervision task. This firm
(Merz & Mc Lellan) delivered excellent supervision services.
33.   Loan disbursement was very slow compared to the appraisal estimate. Disbursements
began with a delay of more than 2 years and reached a cumulative level of less than 8 percent of
the appraisal estimate 4 years after loan approval. This was caused by the 18 month delay in
loan effectiveness compounded by the delay in finalizing the negotiations and approval of the
French credit. Consequently, the loan closing date had to be extended from June 30, 1994 to
December 31, 1997 in two stages. The first extension by one year was granted in April 1994
knowing that future extensions would be needed to account for the initial delays in initiating
project implementation, but as a prudent measure to monitor how well UTE was managing the
implementation of the entire project, as well as its compliance with loan covenants. The second
extension by two and half additional years, to December 31, 1997, was granted in May 1995
once the Bank was satisfied with project implementation progress and with UTE's compliance
with loan covenants. To harmonize the utilization of the Bank loan with the needs of the project,
the allocation of funds in the loan disbursement categories were amended twice. The first
amendment, in May 1995, reallocated US$12.6 million from the Bank A-Loan to the financing
of additional costs of the rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra plant which were not covered by the
initial allocation in the Bank A-Loan and the French credit. The second amendment, in January
1997, reallocated US$3.9 million from the Bank A-Loan to the financing of the transmission and
distribution components which were not fully financed by the B-loan and, at the same time, the
amendment made some minor adjustments among the disbursement categories.  Last
disbursement occurred on April 6, 1998 and the undisbursed amount of US$2.45 million was
canceled (Part II, Table 4: Loan Disbursement).
34.   Special account and loan utilization. To facilitate loan disbursements and payments to
suppliers, UTE opened a special account in the Central Bank of Uruguay in accordance with the
provisions established in the Loan Agreement. The special account was replenished by the
Bank at a level of US$4.0 million upon applications made by UTE.
35.   Environmental aspects. No environmental assessment (EA) was done during project
preparation. As a result, UTE experienced delays in procuring land and in obtaining right of
ways for the transmission system. At that time the EAs were not required -- the Bank's policies
on EA were not in effect -- and UTE did not have the capacity to do it. Obviously, it would have
been beneficial for UTE if it had anticipated the social impacts of the transmission system earlier



11
in the project cycle. The Gabriel Terra rehabilitation did not pose environmental problems
because it was a hydroelectric plant already built.
D. Bank Performance
36.   Bank performance was satisfactory in project identification, preparation and appraisal.
The Bank staff devoted substantial efforts to project preparation which is reflected in a SAR of
good quality. The SAR defined sound piroject objectives, clear physical scope of the project and
included a reasonably good project juslification and economic analysis based on the standard
guidelines of the Bank for this type of projects. Also, the project design reflects the Bank's
ingenuity in linking UTE's investment needs with Uruguayan's needs for fresh financing on
macro grounds, which resulted in a creditable project accomplishment.
37.   Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. The Bank carried out extensive
supervision of the project from May 1986 to October 1997 (80 staff-weeks costing US$260,000),
including 14 supervision missions (Part II, Table 12: Bank Resources: Staff Inputs; Table 12:
Bank Resources: Missions). The Bank was patient in waiting for the approval of the B-loan and
French credit, which underwent a long negotiation and approval process by the Uruguayan
Congress. The Bank also was flexible biut prudent in extending loan closing date twice, the first
extension to watch and see whether the project implementation were to be expedited, and the
second extension once it was clear that project implementation had taken momentum,
particularly in the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra plant. Moreover, the Bank agreed to arnend
the amortization schedule of the loan upon request of UTE. Because of the delay in starting
project implementation, the Bank considered it was an unfair burden on UTE to repay the loan at
the same time it was disbursing it, making the net transfer of loan funds very small. The revised
loan amortization schedule has lower amounts during the early years but increasing amounts in
later years to yield the same present value of the original loan amortization schedule
38.   The Bank also availed itself of supervision missions to deepen the dialogue with the
Government and UTE and process two additional lending operation for the power sector (Loan
3221-UR in support of the Power Modernization project and Loan 3949-UR in support of the
Transmission and Distribution project).  These two operations focused on institutional
development and additional investment needed to modernize the Uruguayan power sector --two
aspects which were not the principal objectives of Loan 2622-UR.
E. Borrower Performance
39.   Project preparation by UTE as Borrower and executing agency was satisfactory.
Specifically, the feasibility study for rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra plant and the expansion of
the 500 kV transmission system were initiated in 1984 and completed in mid-1986 as a component
of the Power Engineering project financecd by the Bank loan 2484-UR. Fichtner (Germany) made
the design of the 500 kV lines. Electricite de France, EdF (France) and Electroconsult (Italy)
assisted UTE in the rehabilitation studies of the Gabriel Terra plant and the expansion analysis of
the transmission and distribution systems, respectively.



12
40.   Project implementation.  Until 1990, procurement of goods and services and loan
disbursement was slow (two years' delay) and little progress was achieved in project
implementation. However, the project gained momentum and began to progress quickly once the
Congress approved a French credit to UTE in June 1991 which filled the financing gap created by
the higher than estimated price of the contract with the French contractors retained for the
rehabilitation works of Gabriel Terra. In sum, the rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra plant and the
expansion of the 500 kV transmission system were substantially and successfully completed by
UTE with delays which indeed did not affect negatively the overall technical performance of UTE
nor the economic performance of the project. (Para. 27, and Part II, Table 6: Key indicators of
Project Implementation).
41.   Compliance with covenants. The compliance with loan covenants by UTE depended
strongly on the Government complying with the covenants of the guarantee agreement.
Consequently, the mixed compliance with covenants by the Government influenced the ability of
UTE to comply with covenants all the time, particularly during the early years of the project. In
fact, the Government was not helpful in withholding funds from UTE and in allocating
insufficient budget to Municipalities and public agencies for payment of utility services, although
it faced severe fiscal deficits consistently.  This, limited UTE's means to complete the
distribution component, and moreover increased the arrears to UTE by the Municipalities in the
late 1980's (paras. 19-21 and Table 1.1, Financial Indicators, and Part II, Table 10: Status of
Covenants).
42.   Considering the great importance attached to the physical objectives of the project and the
debt rescheduling of Uruguay and the relatively lower expectation given to the institutional
objectives in this particular project, the Borrower (UTE and Government combined) performance is
considered satisfactoryfor both project implementation and compliance with covenants.
F. Assessment of Project Outcome and Sustainability
Project Sustainability
43.   Sustainability of the project is likely because: (a) the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra
hydroelectric plant and the physical facilities installed by the project in the transmission and
distribution system meet internationally acceptable levels of quality; (b) UTE has competent staff
with appropriate skills to operate and maintain the new facilities; (c) the finances of UTE are
now sound and expected to improve further in the future, specially because of the Government
policy of shifting investment in the power sector from UTE to private investors; and (d) there is a
credible plan for future project operation.
Project Outcome
44.   The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory because: (a) the physical objective of
rehabilitating the Gabriel Terra plant was fully achieved by extending the life of the hydroelectric
plant by 30 years at the low cost of about US$390 per kW (b) the expansion of the 500 kV
transmission system and the 150 kV network were substantially achieved; (c) the recalculated
economic rate of return of the project (12.2 percent) is slightly better than the one estimated at



13
appraisal (11.9 percent), which indicates that the delaying of project benefits was compensated
by the postponing of costs; (d) the project helped rescheduling of the Uruguay's external debt;
and (e) the project sustainability is likely. The partial completion of the distribution component
and the mixed compliance with a few financial covenants by UTE and the Government in some
years is not considered to have enough weigh to influence negatively the project outcome rating.
It is also important to note that UTE has been monitoring the sector through a set of performance
indicators agreed at project appraisal. Additional indicators agreed during project supervision are
being used by UTE to monitor the performance of turbine generators units of the Gabriel Terra
Hydroelectric plant (Part II, Table 6: Key Indicators for Project Operation).
G. Future Project Operation
45.   Future project operation is linked to the achievements of the follow up Power
Modernization Project financed by the Bark loan 3221-UR (to be closed in January 1999), and the
objectives of the on-going Power Transmission and Distribution Project financed by the Bank loan
3949-UR. These operations emphasize the consolidation of the power sector reform (which
enhances the role of the private sector in power development), the consolidation of UTE's
institutional improvements, the improvement of power distribution reliability, and the promotion of
a more efficient use of energy. All these objectives shape a credible plan which will certainly
contribute to a satisfactory operation of the project and the sector in the future.
H. Key Lessons Learned
46.   Based on the experience gained with this lending operation, the following lessons can be
offered:
Lesson 1.   This project has proven that the rehabilitation of an old hydroelectric plant is
feasible and economical. By reinforcing the civil works and mechanical equipment of the
dam, and by replacing the obsolete components of the turbines and generators, and their
auxiliaries and metering and control systems with state-of-the-art equipment, the useful life
of an hydroelectric station can be extended in several decades beyond its original life. In
this case, the useful life of the plant will be extended by about 30 years beyond the 50 years
of service already elapsed, at a low cost of about US$390 per kW.
Lesson 2.    Good planning of engineering, equipment supply, installation and
commissioning and close field supervision by a competent consultant firm are key factors
to succeed in carrying out the rehabilitation of an hydroelectric plant while it is still
operational. Consequently, it is advisable that the design of the works be prepared and
negotiated as a rehabilitation package comprising equipment supply, installation and
commissioning, before loan presentation to the Board. The package approach played a key
role in the rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra plant. The design of the works and the selection
of the contractor for the rehabilitation package was a long and complex process and delayed
the start of project implementation. However, once those barriers were passed, the



14
contractor rehabilitated the four units of the Gabriel Terra plant within a tight schedule, one
unit at a time, without stopping the operation of the remaining generating units.
Lesson 3.    Advance  commitment of project financing sources is a key factor for
expediting project implementation. In this case, the negotiation, approval and effectiveness
of the additional financing required for the rehabilitation works of Gabriel Terra delayed the
contractor to start field work by about two years.
Lesson 4.    Cofinancing of an investment project through a B-Loan can help a country
with quick loan disbursement to cope with difficulties in serving external debt, but it
involves complex negotiations and approvals that can impact negatively in the
implementation of an investment lending operation.

INFORME FINAL
SEXTO PROYECTO
1.-   Introducci6u
El Sexto Proyecto UTE-BIRF fiue parcialmente financiado por el Prestamo BIRF 2622-UR,
firmnado el 19 de setiembre de 1986, por U$S 45.2 rnillones. El Prestamo entr6 en vigencia el 6 de
marzo de 1987 y su fecha de cierre fue 31 de diciembre de 1997, 3 afios y medio despues de la
fecha original (30 de junio de 1994).
Se estima que el Sexto Proyecto seri conmpletado en enero del ano 2000, siete ahios despuel de la
fecha establecida en el Staff Appraisal Report originado principalmente por un atraso inicial de
cuatro a?ios debido entre otras razones a engorrosas actividades de implementaci6n del
financiamiento y por atrasos en los procesos de adquisiciones.

3.-   Implementaci6n del Proyecto
3.1   Definici6n del Provecto
UTE a traves de las Gerencias de Planificaci6n, Generaci6n, Trasmisi6n y Distribuci6n, con
asistencia de consultores y en acuerdo con el Banco prepar6 ei estudio de factibilidad del Sexto
Proyecto. en base al cual se negoci6 el Prestamo BIRF 2622-UR.
Se emplearon consultores para: (a) colaborar en la preparaci6n de los documentos de la licitaci6n
para la estaci6n J, (Estaci6n Blindada en SF6 de 150130kV) en Montevideo, (b) asistir a UTE en
la administraci6n y supervisi6n de las obras de Rehabilitacion de la Central Hidroelectrica de
Gabriel Terra, y (c) para el examnen de los criterios de diseilo para las lineas de trasmisi6n de
5OOkV.
El Proyecto fue asi elaborado con el grado de detalle necesario para definir completamente todas
las obras a ejecutar, las especificaciones tecnicas correspondientes y el alcance de los suministros.
Qued6 a cargo de los contratistas la ingenieria de detalle que no puede normalmente ser definida
antes de conocer los equipos e instalaciones a ser adquiridos. Esta fule incorporada a los
respectivos contratos y ejecutada con la supervision y aprobaci6n de UTE y de los consultores.
Los agentes financiadores del Proyecto fiueron:
* El Banco Internacional de Reconstrucci6n y Fomento, mediante el prdstamo BIRF 2622-UR.
por U5S 45.2 millones
* Grupo de bancos de primera linea, liderados por el City Bank con garantia del Banco Mundial
(B Loan) inicialmente por USS 45.0 millones y que luego se redujo a USS 33.7 nullones.
* Asistencia financiera de FF 80 millones (Prestamo del Credit National por FF 43.2 millones y de
la Compagnie Financiere de CIC et L'Union Europeenne por FF 36.8 millones) para financiar la
compra en Francia de bienes y servicios franceses relativos a la ejecuci6n del Contrato de



- 34 -
Renovacion de la Central Hidroelectrica Dr. Gabriel Terra. Este prestamo entr6 en vigencia el 6 de
febrero de 1992.
* Banco de la Repuablica Oriental del Uruguay, mediante un prestamo promocional por USS 17.5
millones.
En el punto 9.- se presenta el cuadro de financiarniento del Proyecto.
3.2   Adguisiciones y contrataciones
Todos los suministros y obras (obra civil y montaje) contratados, han sido adjudicados segun el
regimen de licitaci6n publica internacional de acuerdo con las Normas para las Adquisiciones con
Prestamos del Banco Mundial y Creditos de la AIF, publicadas por el Banco en agosto de 1984.
Los servicios de consultoria, han sido contratados por lista corta de firmas invitadas, con
excepci6n de la Consultoria para Direcci6n y Supervisi6n de la Rehabilitaci6n de Gabriel Terra
que fie contratada a traves de una licitaci6n intemacional.
3.3   Finalizaci6n
A la fecha de cierre del Prestamo BIRF 2622-UR, ha finalizado la parte A del Proyecto y la linea
de trasmision de 500kV al Este y si bien queda incompleta la componente de trasriisi6n
(estaciones de 150/30kV) y de distribuci6n (subestaciones 30/15 y 30/6kV), todas las licitaciones
estan en ejecuci6n.
4.-   Resultados
4. 1   Renovaci6n de la Central Hidroelectrica Dr. Gabriel Terra
La vida util restante de las instalaciones ciiviles, asi como la importancia del embalse de Gabriel
Terra en la economia energetica nacional, hacian impostergable analizar la conveniencia de
renovar y modernizar las instalaciones electromecanicas de manera de prolongar su vida 6til y
garantizar la continuidad del servicio de la central con una conflabiidad adecuada.
La renovaci6n de la Central Hidroelectrica Dr. Gabriel Terra fiue el primer contrato en el mundo
que involucr6 la renovaci6n y modemizac:i6n de todas las instalaciones electromecinicas de una
central y su presa, que se llev6 a cabo sin interrumpir la producci6n, excepto para la unidad en
renovaci6n.
Las unidades renovadas tienen un mejor rendiniento y mayor capacidad de generaci6n que las
originales. La mejora en el rendimiento global es del orden del 5,6%. En todo el rango de
fuincionamiento de la turbina, la potencia en bornes del generador aumenta en 5,7 MW, alcanzando
el valor de 38 MW para saltos hidriulicos superiores a 26 metros.
Se logro tambien la disminuci6n de los tiempos y costos de mantenimiento: se instalaron
dispositivos que permiten prever posibles defectos antes de que estos se produzcan; se reducen y
se simplifican las operaciones de manteniimiento preventivo y disminuyen las necesidades de
mantenimiento correctivo.



- 35 -
Ademas la operaci6n se volvio mas segura debido a la automatizaci6n del arranque y parada de las
unidades y la supervisi6n computarizada del fincionamiento de las instalaciones.
4.2   La proloneacion hacia el este del sistema de trasmisi6n de 500kV y la mejora de los
circuitos de ani}lo de 150kV de Montevideo
Permitira ampliar el sistema de trasmisi6n y adecuar la red primaria urbana a su nueva
configuraci6n, al mismo tiempo que se reemplazan instalaciones que llegaron al fin de su vida util.
La ampliaci6n del sistema de trasmisi6n proporcionara nuevos caminos de entrada de potencia-a la
zona urbana preparando al mismo tiempo la instalaci6n del tercer transformador EAT/AT (uno de
los objetos del Prestamo BIRF 3949-UR) y aumentara la potencia de transformaci6n instalada
parte de la cual sustituira equipos que han terminado su vida util.
El aumento de potencia instalada se realizari mediante nuevas estaciones de transforrnaci6n
tratando de optirnizar el desarrollo conjunto del sistema de trasmisi6n y de la red primaria urbana.
4.3   La remodelaci6n y mejora de la red de distribuci6n de 30kV en Montevideo
Permitiri mejorar la calidad del servicio y optimizar la distribuci6n de cargas en las redes de
subtrasmisi6n. Se reducirin las perdidas a! descargar lineas actualmente saturadas y se alcanzara
desde el punto de vista operativo importantes mejoras que permniten reducir los tiempos de
interrupci6n de servicios, asegurando su continuidad y mejorando la calidad del nismo al clente.
5.-   Factores que afectaron la implementaci6n del Proyecto
5.1   Atraso inicial
Varias razones contribuyeron a dicho atraso:
* La negociaci6n del Gobierno y la comunidad de
bancos internacionales para la obtenci6n del Cofinanciamiento "B Loan" asociado al
prestamo del Banco Mundial (BIRF 2622-UR) insumi6 18 meses.
* La complejidad de los trabajos a ser llevados a cabo
para la rehabilitaci6n de la Central Gabriel Terra origin6 atrasos debido al cambio en las
guias de adquisiciones del Banco y en la modalidad de adquisici6n (inicialmente se previ6
realizar tres contratos y una vez elaborados los documentos de licitaci6n el Banco propuso
la realizaci6n de un solo contrato llave en mano).
*    Tambien    ocurrieron    atrasos    debido
ftundamentalmente a que fule necesario obtener la aprobaci6n parlamentaria cuando se
realizaron negociaciones para la obtenci6n del cofinanciamiento frances ante la necesidad
de financiamiento adicional.



- 36
5.2   El Prestatario
Iniciada la etapa de implementaci6n se verificaron atrasos debido a miiltiples razones, algunas de
las cuales se enumeran a continuaci6n.
1. El escaso numero de tecnicos proyectistas que tenia la Gerencia de Obras dilato la
elaboraci6n de los terninos de referencia de las obras y las etapas de las licitaciones.
2. En la ejecuci6n del Proyecto se ha detectado la demora en el proceso de contrataci6n de
las licitaciones, principalmente el tiempo incurrido entre la apertura de ofertas y la firma del
contrato correspondiente, asi mientras en el Appraisal se estimaba ocho meses la realidad mostr6
que fueron en su mayoria entre quince y dieciocho meses.
3. La necesidad de adaptarse al cambio de tensi6n a ser llevado a cabo a nivel de
distribuci6n (estudio que se realiz6 entre 1988 y 1993), detuvo concretamente la formulaci6n de
las especificaciones para la adquisici6n de los equipos de estaciones de 150kV.
4. Los tramites necesarios para la gesti6n predial e imposici6n de servidumbres, fiueron
engorrosos.
5. Las inversiones financiadas a vieces no se ejecutaron con prioridad y por lo tanto se
vieron afectadas por los sucesivos recortes presupuestales por decisi6n del Gobiemo.
5.3    Adauisicion de suministros
* Los principales inconverientes estuvieron relacionados con los ensayos de tipo,
los cuales si bien fueron finalmente resueltos demoraron la contrataci6n, y con la detecci6n de
vicios ocultos en los suministros que obligaron al reemplazo de los rnismos.
* En otros casos la falta de un mercado competitivo provoc6 que se presentaran
ofertas con costos altos que llevaron incluso a dejar sin efecto la licitaci6n.
* Se presentaron impugnaciones de los oferentes ante el Banco que dilataron mas
de lo habitual el proceso de contrataci6n.
* Algunos oferentes Ilegaron a la etapa de firma del contrato sin la documentaci6n
correspondiente (en ese momento se comienza a gestionar los poderes) o sin la correcta
documentaci6n, demorandose la firma de los mismo.
5.4   Contratistas
* Con respecto a las obras civiles y montaje de estaciones en general no hubo
aspectos relevantes a resaltar habiendose cumplido los contratos en forma satisfactoria.
* Se presentaron atrasos originados en la necesidad de UTE de dejar sin efecto
algunos contratos debido a la quiebra de uno de los integrantes del consorcio adjudicatario.



- 37 -
* En otro caso se presentaron problemas relacionados con la calidad de algunos de
los trabajos ejecutados.
* De manera similar que en el caso de los suministros, los contratistas presentaron
problemas de documentaci6n a la hora de la firma de los contratos.
5.5   El Banco
* De acuerdo con lo establecido en las normas de adquisiciones la adjudicaci6n del
contrato es responsabilidad del prestatario, y es este quien debe resolver las observaciones que se
presenten a la decision de adjudicaci6n. Sin embargo se presentaron casos puntuales don-&e los
oferentes presentaron observaciones directamente ante el Banco.
La rigidez en la normativa del Banco, en cuanto a adjudicar a la oferta de minimo
costo sin permitir negociar en segunda instancia, ha impedido mejorar las cotizaciones.
5.6   Factores fliera del control de UTE
* UTE ha comprobado en las licitaciones de suministro, que los oferentes sabiendo
que el Banco pretende que se adjudique a la oferta de menor costo, ofertan precios muy bajos e
impugnan las adjudicaciones aun sin cumplir con las condiciones establecidas en los pliegos de la
licitaci6n.
* En varias oportunidades se presentaron reclamaciones de los propietarios, ante la
gesti6n predial e imposici6n de servidumbres, las que atrasaron aun mis la realizacion de las obras.
* Una vez firmado el Cofinanciamiento (B Loan), y teniendo los fondos
depositados en el Banco Central, estos no fueron liberados en primera instancia.
5.7   Medio Ambiente
Cuando se desarrollaron las obras del Sexto Proyecto no existia en Uruguay ni en UTE normas
vinculadas a impactos sobre el medio ambiente. UTE carecia de gesti6n ambiental.
Se produjeron distintos problemas vinculados a esta tematica en la ejecuci6n del montaje de la
linea de 500kV, que provocaron atrasos en los cronogramas. Ellas fueron:
* Reclamaciones a UTE por afectaciones atribuidas a campos electromagneticos
* Reclamaciones a UTE por afectaci6n paisajistica y social
* Reclamaciones a UTE por destrucci6n de la cubierta vegetal
Algunas de estas reclamaciones originaron un aumento en el costo de la obra, del orden de USS
700.000, por concepto de indemnizaciones.
5.8   Consecuencia de los atrasos
Los atrasos en las obras obligaron a UTE a realizar instalaciones provisorias a nivel de trasmisi6n
(en condiciones de baja confiabilidad) en el Sur, Montevideo y Este del pais, para solucionar los



- 38 -
problemas de aumento en la demanda y consiguiente saturacion de los equipos. Se provoc6 por lo
tanto, al duplicarse las obras, un aumento en los costos de UTE.
El atraso en la implementacion del Proyecto provoc6 tambien un aumento en los costos por
concepto de comisi6n de compromiso y la perdida del objetivo del periodo de gracia. Los
primeros desembolsos se realizaron cuando debia empezar a amortizarse el prestamo y se
repagaron basicamente dentro de los seis rneses siguientes.
6.-   Lecciones que se desprenden del Proyecto
* Se detectaron grandes problemas en el proceso licitatorio de UTt- Es
fundamentalmente por esta raz6n que en la actualidad se inici6 un plan para mejorar dicho
proceso.
* Los oferentes que recurren sin raz6n deberia resarcir de alguna manera a UTE
por los costos y demoras en que incurre la Administraci6n.
* Ante la poca competencia para el suministros de estaciones blindadas UTE ha
decidido tratar de adquirir los sumninistros convencionales de dichas estaciones por separado.
7.-   Operaci6n y mantenimiento
7.1    Gabriel Terra
La operacion la realiza el Despacho Nacional de Cargas (DNC) utilizando como referencia un
modelo matemitico de optimizaci6n que determina la politica de operaci6n.
Con el objetivo de elaborar un sistema de gesti6n de mantenimiento, se contrat6 a la consultora
IDITHC. La consultora utiliza el sistema RCM (RELIABILITY CENTER MAINTENANCE) con
patente de ALADON. Se esta trabajando en forna interactiva con el personal de la Central para la
definici6n de los procesos, rutinas y capacitaci6n para el mantenimiento.
7.2   Trasmisi6n
La operaci6n del sistema de trasmisi6n la r ealiza el Despacho Nacional de Cargas (DNC) en fonma
centralizada, mediante un sistema de teleproceso, que en la actualidad esta siendo mejorado en un
proyecto financiado por el BID.
Se establecieron una serie de procedimientos orientados hacia el mantenimiento preventivo que
reflejan las instrucciones de los oferentes, entre las que se destaca:
* El tratamiento de aceite de transformadores mediante miquinas que lo someten a ciclos
de calentamiento, vacio y filtrado. El aceite es analizado controlandose su rigidez dielectrica, su
acidez y los gases disueltos mediante aparatos portatiles o mediante cromatografias realizadas en
laboratorio.
* Inspecciones termogrificas con una cimara de gran definici6n y rendimiento. Se dispone
de pistolas detectoras de infrarrojos que permiten medidas puntuales de temperaturas. Antes de las



39  -
epocas de mayor demanda se recorren las lineas con la camara termogrifica para detectar puntos
calientes.
* Por lo menos dos veces al afio se realizan recorridas de las lineas detectando problemas
de vegetaci6n, servidumbres etc.
Todas las tareas de mantenimiento se realizan con personal propio y el presupuesto anual de las
mismas se ubica en el entomo de un 10% del valor total de la estaci6n o subestaci6n.
7.3    Distribuci6n
Las actividades de mantenimiento que se realizan se subdividen en: correctivas, preventivas y
remodelaciones generales.
Las actividades de mantenimiento correctivo y preventivo se realizan con personal propio y las de
remodelaciones generales con personal contratado.
7.3.1  Mantenimiento Correctivo
El mantenimiento correctivo que se realiza en las redes de distribuci6n se subdivide en dos:
reparaciones menores y reparaciones de mayor envergadura. Las pequehlas reparaciones se
realizan a travis de la Brigada de Operaci6n, la cual opera las redes mediante maniobras cuando se
producen incidencias de fallas. Las operaciones correctivas de mayor importancia como por
ejemplo el cambio de transformadores, de llaves seccionadoras e interruptores, el enderezado de
postes, ei flechado de conductores, etc, son realizadas mediante Brigadas de Mantenimiento, las
cuales requieren recursos humanos y equipos especializados.
Los trabajos de mantenimiento correctivo en media tensi6n se llevan a cabo desenergizando las
redes. El proximo ai!o se realizarin los trabajos de mantenirmiento con tensi6n.
7.3.2 Mantenimiento Preventivo
Entre las tareas de mantenimiento preventivo se encuentra el tratarniento de aceite de
transformadores mediante maquinas que lo someten a ciclos de calentamiento, vacio y filtrado. El
aceite es analizado controlindose su rigidez diel6ctrica, su acidez y los gases disueltos mediante
aparatos portitiles o mediante cromatografias realizadas en laboratorio.
Los disyuntores de pequeno volumen de aceite son revisados peri6dicamente y se procede a!
cambio de aceite cuando su estado o la cantidad de actuaciones as! lo requiere.
Las lineas de media tensi6n son recorridas peri6dicamente de acuerdo a rutinas preestablecidas a
los efectos de realizar inspecciones visuales de su condici6n.
Las podas de irboles pr6ximos a las redes de MT y el volteado de nidos son tareas que se realizan
peri6dicamente y se intensifican en las epocas del afno en que los &rboles se desarrollan con mayor
velocidad y los pijaros construyen sus nidos contra los aisladores de las lineas.



- 40 -
Tambien se realizan visitas frecuentes a las estaciones reductoras de MhTMT, de acuerdo a
procedimientos de mantenimiento preestablecidos.
Permanentemente se realizan inspecciones tennograficas con una camara de gran definici6n y
rendimiento. Ademas se dispone de pistolas detectoras de infrarrojos que permiten medidas
puntuales de temperaturas. En epocas de mayor demanda se recorren las lineas con la cimara
termnografica para detectar puntos calientes.
73.3 Mantenimiento mediante remodelaciones generales
Cuando la incidencia de fallas en un tramo de red indica una frecuencia que se considera
inaceptable, se estudia la conveniencia de realizar una remodelaci6n general-para dejarla en
condiciones 6ptimas de operaci6n.
8.-   Costo del Proyecto
El costo total del Proyecto de acuerdo con lo establecido en el Appraisal era USS 138.1 millones.
El costo actual es de USS 185.5 millones considerando el cofinanciamiento ftances (USS 15.2
millones) y del Banco Republica (U$S 17.5 millones), o sea 34% mayor al costo previsto.

Ref.: Comentarios al informe "IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION
REPORT" (ICR), correspondiente al Prestamo 2622-UR.
Haremos   referiencia   exclusivameinte   a   aquellos
aspectos vinculados a la gesti6n del prdstamo 2622-UR
dado que se trata die realizar una evaluacion tdcnica al
finalizar el periodo de desembolsos.
El   proyecto  que   financia  el   citado  prostamo
comprende:
- Renovaci6n de la Central G.Terra
- Ampliaci6n de las redes de trasmisi6n (500  y
150 KV)
Renovacion de la red Distribuein en
Montevideo
Tal como lo indica el informe del Banco, aunque con
retrasos y sobrecostos, se cumplieron los obJetivos del
proyecto.      Los      sobrecostos      fueron      causados
fundamentalmente por la alta inflaci6n internacional del
oeriodo 1985-92. El retraso mks importante, producido  al
inicio, se debio a las negociaciones con el Gobierno y
la uanca internacional para obtener el cofinanciamiento
y el prestamo francAs. Entre los objetivos alcanzacos  se
destacan:  La remodelacion  con  &xito de  la Cent.Sal  6.
Terra,   obra  extreamadamente   compleja  dado   qQe  fue
necesaric sustituir la mayoria del equipamiento que era
de  una   tecnologia1,  sin  afectar   sustancialmente  el
+uncLonamiento de la, Central.  La extensizn de la  red de
5C0 KV al este. Res,ta por finalizar las estaciones de
150 KV y 30 KV las clue estAn en ejecuc16n.
UTE hizo llecar al Banco las correcciones que
deberian  incluirse a  datos  estadisticos a  lnformacx6n
hlst6rica, no  temiendo otros comentarios  aue a  agregar
relacionados con la gestion de este prAstamo.
