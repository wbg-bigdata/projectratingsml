Project Su"mary
Borrower:         Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones
Electricas (UTE)
Guarantor.        Government of Uruguay
Amount:           US$45.2 million equivalent
Terms:            Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with
interest at the Bank standard variable rate.
Project
Description:    The project consists of the following components:
(a) rehabilitation of the 128 NW Gabriel Terra hydro plant;
(b) extension of the 500 kV transmission system to the
eastern part of the country; (c) extension of the 500 kV
and 150 kV transmission systems in Montevideo; (d)
remodeling and upgrading the 30 kV underground network in
- Montevideo; (e) and consulting services for project
management and supervision.
Benefits
and Risks:      The proposed project would help meet Uruguay's power needs
with lower fuel consumption, improved system reliability
and a higher degree of operational efficiency of the
instaLled capacity. Should cofinancing be delayed, or not
materialize, the ensuing delays in transmission and
distribution investments would reduce the proposed gains in
system reliability. A delay in the execution of these
components, however, would not affect the benefits from
more efficient hydropower generation which would be
supported by the proposed A-Loan. The project does not
present major technical risks.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN OF USS45.2 MILLION TO
ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE USINAS Y TRASMISIONES ELECTRICAS
TO BE GUARANTEED BY
THE REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
.
1. *I submit the following report and recommendatfon on a proposed
loan to the Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasuisiones Electricas
(UTE) with the guarantee of the Uruguayan Republic for the equivalent of
US$45.2 million to help finance a Power Rehabilitation Project. The loan
would have a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the Bank
standard variable interest rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An Economic Memorandum (No. 3652-UR) was distributed to the
Executive Directors in March 1982. An economic mission visited Uruguay in
April/May 1985, and its report is in preparation. The following paragraphs
summarize recent developments. A summary of Country Basic Data is attached
as Annex 1.
Background
3.        Uruguay was one of the most prosperous countries in Latin America
in the first half of the twentieth-century. This achievement initially was
the result of an outward-oriented trade policy based on beef and wool
exports and, later, of import-substitution stimulated by the shortage of
consumer goods during the Second World War and the immediate post-war
period. However, the small domestic market offered only limited
opportunities for import-substitution, which were exhausted by the early
1950s. The industrial sector that developed was not competitive; it was
composed of small and medium-sized, inefficient plants producing under
tariff protection and depending on imported inputs. On the other hand, a
predominantly urban and highly literate population demanded higher wages
and increasing social benefits and expanded public services. Comprehensive
welfare legislation was enacted providing a broad range of benefits. This
required a sustained transfer of income from the livestock sector to the
rest of the economy, which was achieved through fiscal, exchange rate,
price, and trade policies, at a time when the external demand and prices
for wool were declining.  The economic and social environment discouraged



growth, and particularly stifled export-oriented production, leading to a
sharp deterioration in the country's external accounts. Exports in 1960
vere roughly at the 1945 level while iuports had increased sharply.
Consequently, Uruguay's economy deteriorated steadily in the sixties and
early seventies. Political and social unrest were compounded by the
adverse economic effects of the oil price shock in 1973. The ensuing
crisis forced the country into a fundamental reappraisal of its basic
economic strategy.
4.        The inward-looking policies of the preceding half century, and
the loss of fiscal and monetary discipline, were seen by the economic
leadership that took office in 1974 as major contributing factors to the
prolonged economic stagnation and periodic balance-of-payments crises.
During 1974-78, efforts were made to reverse the historic
import-substitution bias of macro-economic policy in favor of greater
integration with world markets. Export growth accelerated under the
impetus of new incentives, including subsidies and state-supported credits
to non-traditional exports, frequent devaluations, liberalized drawback
facilities, and a streamlining of administrative processes. Import
licensing restrictions were discontinued, and tariff rates were somewhat
reduced, with the maximum tariff rate declining from 346% in 1974 to 180%
in 1977. Investment was stimulated by phased reductions in price controls,
expanded fiscal incentives, liberalization of the foreign investment
regime, and decontrol of financial and foreign exchange markets. In spite
of the rise in oil prices and the fall in the dollar prices of beef,
economic performance changed dramatically. Between 1974 and 1980, real
fixed investment and exports of goods grew by 18% and 19% a year,
respectively. Exports to other Latin American countries, particularly
Argentina and Brazil, played a major role in this expansion. Overall
.output increased by nearly 5% annually, the highest average rate in a
quarter of a century. Unemployment fell from over 12% in the mid-1970s to
5.8% in the first half of 1981. The budget deficit was progressively
reduced. Tnflation came down from a historical peak of 107% in 1974 to 46%
in 1978. Nevertheless, the authorities were not satisfied with the
progress made in reducing inflation and raising the technical and
managerial efficiency of domestic industry.
5.        In late 1978, a comprehensive policy package was instituted.
Most price controls were eliminated, including those on live cattle and
beef, to promote expanded production. Financial market deregulation was
accelerated. Interest rate ceilings were eliminated, and restrictions on
financial intermediaries were dismantled. Believing that monetary policy
was ineffective in regulating a small, open economy, the Central Bank also
withdrew from active management of the domestic money supply: open market
operations were halted, and banking reserve requirements eliminated. In
the absence of controls on capital movements, the Government expected that
domestic interest rates would converge quickly with foreign rates adjusted
for depreciation of the peso, assuring a continuous source of credit on
reasonable terms. In addition, labor mobility was increased by the
creation of a unified social security fund, and payroll taxes were reduced
in favor of Government transfers out of general revenues. To improve the



competitiveness of industry, the maximum global import tariff was lowered
to 116% in 1979, and it was announced that this level would be reduced, in
annual stages, to 35Z by January 1, 1985. To curb inflationary
expectations, the US dollar/peso exchange rate, officially-mandated
salaries and public utility tariffs were announced several months in
advance at rates of adjustment well below the prevailing rate of
inflation. The advance announcement of salary and utility rate increases
was discontinued in 1979, but was maintained for the exchange rate until
November 1982. The pre-announced exchange rate schedule continued to be
set at less than the difference between domestic and world inflation.
6.        Although the policy package's initial impact was contrary to
expectations (prices nearly doubled in 1979), inflation subsequently fellt
rapidly. However, the inconsistencies of the policy reform pulled the
economy in opposite directions and led to a major crisis, the consequences
of which are still being felt by Uruguay. The reforms were expected to
raise the profitability of export production vis-a-vis import substitutes
and non-tradeables.  Although inflation eventually fell, however, it
remained substantially above the pre-announced rate of devaluation,
generating a severe cost-price squeeze that eroded the competitiveness of
export production. Financial liberalization, combined with the
legalization of foreign currency deposits, attracted large foreign capital
inflows, which financed high levels of imports and permitted domestic
expenditures to far exceed production. These inflows also contributed to
the appreciation of the real exchange rate and exacerbated the adjustment
difficulties of domestic producers struggling to export and to compete with
imports. The exchange and interest rate policies, together with the
legalization of dollar deposits, also made excessive borrowing and
investing in financial assets and speculative activities attractive, while
discouraging productive investments.
7.        GDP growth fell steadily from 6.01 in 1980 to 1.9% in 1981 and
-8.4% in 1982. Unemployment in Montevideo doubled from the first half of
1981 to the second half of 1982. Nominal dollar merchandise exports slowed
from 34% in 1980 to 15% in 1981, and turned into a decline of 161 in 1982.
The non-financial public sector fiscal balance shifted from a surplus of
0.3% of GDP in 1980 to deficits of 2.3% in 1981 and 10.2% in 1982. The
Central Bank also incurred major quasi-fiscal  losses associated with a
variety of subsidized credit operations, equivalent in 1982 to about 8% of
GDP. The current account balance of payments showed large deficits
totalling over US$1.6 billion for 1980-82, which were financed with the
large inflows of foreign funds. Finally, Uruguay's external accounts
registered an overall deficit of US$800 million during 1982, in spite of
large commercial borrowings abroad.
Stabilization Programs and Recent Economic Developments
8.        It became obvious that these economic policies could not be
sustained, as confidence in the pre-announced devaluation schedule had
eroded and capital flight accelerated. In late November 1982, the
Government abandoned, therefore, its exchange rate strategy, announcing



that the rate would be freely determined by market forces. The 1983
average rate of around UR$34/US$1 implied a nominal peso depreciation on
the order of 60% relative to the US dollar parity quoted just prior to the
float. The Government also introduced sweeping changes in salary, fiscal,
monetary, trade and external debt management policies designed to reduce
rapidly the size of the public sector deficit, to correct distortions in
relative prices, and to halt the dangerously high losses of foreign
exchange. The Government program called for a sharp reduction in the
deficits of the non-financial public sector, a scaling down of official
external borrowing, a deceleration of central bank credit growth, and
improved resource allocation through a freely floating exchange rate,
changes in the trade system, and realistic pricing of public sector goods
and services. The IMF supported the Government's stabilization program
with a stand-by arrangement. Shortly after approval of the stand-by,
Uruguay and its commercial banks creditors agreed to reschedule US$575 in
million principal obligations falling due in 1983 and 1984, and to provide
fresh financing of US$230 million.
9.        During 1983-84, the economic recession continued; real GDP
declined an additional 7%. Nominal dollar exports decreased 10%, and fixed
investment dropped 46Z. Real wages deteriorated sharply, and unemployment
remained high at 13Z. Nevertheless, the deficit of the non-financial
public sector was reduced by more than a half (from 10.2% of GDP in 1982 to
4.6% in 1984), resource allocation was improved via a 442 real depreciation
of the exchange rate (with respect to that of November 1982), the deficit
of the current account balance of payments was reduced (from 8.1% of GDP in
1982 to 2.3% in 1984), and the loss of foreign exchange reserves were
substantially diminished (from US$800 million in 1982 to US$50 million in
1984. Public enterprise tariffs were raised, public sector wages and
social security benefits were scaled-down in real terms, and a new tax
package was adopted in June 1984. In addition, to reduce the Central Bank
losses, which originated mostly from the assistance to the National Housing
Bank and on the service of the external debts associated with purchases of
the non-performing portfolios of commercial banks, the authorities stopped
remunerating legal reserve deposits. Nevertheless, the 1983 program did
not achieve its major stabilization aims. Weaknesses in 'inancial policy
management, uncertainties related to the presidential elections,
lower-than-anticipated levels of economic activity and imports, and
flagging confidence caused by difficult conditions in the region generally,
combined to slow the rate of adjustment. Inflation exceeded the levels
projected in the program. Substantial private capital flight also took
place, which exacerbated the shortage of liquidity.
10.       The combined deficit of the Central Bank and the non-financial
public sector (16% of GDP in 1983 and about 10% in 1984 compared with 18%
in 1982) remained incompatible with reducing inflation, decreasing reliance
on external savings, and promoting economic recovery. Uruguay's inability
to comply with the stand-by program's fiscal targets led to an interruption
of drawings at the end of 1983. Although the outgoing Administration made
serious efforts towards the restoration of external and internal equilibria
during 1984, it did not meet the targets the Fund had set for a new
stand-by. A request for IMF support was postponed until the new
Administration took office on March 1, 1985.



- 5 -
11.       The new Administration took steps to arrest the economic
deterioration in public finances that had taken place duing the transition
period from military to democratic rule. Public enterpr:se tariffs/prices
were hiked 30% in April to recover the ground lost in the first months of
1985, and fuel and taxes were increased sharply. It requested the IMF
support in April for a comprehensive policy package to reduce inflation,
control public finances, and bring about an economic recovery, and it began
work on a program for structural changes designed to provide a stable
policy framework for sustained export and GDP growth over the next five
years.
12.       The Government and the Fund have reached agreement in principle
on a stand-by arrangement. The program, which is expected to be approved
by the IMF Board in September 1985, aims at reducing the rate of inflation
to 60Z during the period July 1985 to June 1986, and at diminishing the
current account balance of payments deficit. The agreement calls for a
reduction of the public sector deficit (including the Central Bank losses)
from an estimated 10.6Z of GDP during July 1984-June 1985 to 5.8% of GDP
dt::ing the July 1985-June 1986 period.  This will require tax measures
equivalent to about 2.5 percentage points of GDP - which already have been
enacted -, public enterprisest tariff increases of about I percentage
point of GDP, and a 10% reduction of public expenditures in real terms.
External financing is expected to cover about two-thirds of the fiscal
deficit. On the basis of the stand-by arrangement, the Government is
negotiating with the commercial banks a multi-year rescheduling of
principal payments falling due in the 1985-89 period, together with the
fresh financing for about US$150 million, including a mediur-term money
facility of USM5O million.
13.       The Government is also working on the main structural changes
needed by the Uruguayan economy. The expected components of a reform
program are: industrial sector reform (including rationalization of the
trade regime and financial restructuring of manufacturing firms), which is
a major challenge to the success of the Administation's policies;
improvements in tariff/price policies of public enterprises as well as in
public investment programming and budgeting; and rationalization of both
the social security and the tax systems.
Medium-Term Prospects
14.       The Uruguayan Government is attempting to establish a basis for
renewed growth in an environment of price stability. The stabilization
program should set the stage for a 2% projected GDP growth in 1986.
Furthermore, the Government fully recognizes that prospects for sustained
economic recovery are closely linked to the effectiveness of policies to
promote export growth and to rationalize the trade regime. In addition to
the measures undertaken to restore internal and external equilibria, the
authorities have indicated their intention to institute a policy and
incentive framework geared to expand exports. This framework includes a
freely-floating exchange rate, strengthened export incentives, and a
renewed commitment to reduce effective protection. It is notable that,
notwithstanding increases in restrictive practices elsewhere and in the



- 6 -
region and a difficult short-term situation, Uruguay has maintained freedom
of exchange transactions on both balance of payments and capital accounts.
The Government is also planning to support a financial restructuring of
firms, which have suffered from past exchange and credit policies, to
reactivate their productive capacity, particularly those that produce for
export. Financial assistance will be provided for equipment modernization,
working capital, and improved product quality. Given the experience with
previous stabilization efforts, further actions to strengthen public
finances and reduce inflationary pressures, including improvements in
tariff/price policies of public enterprises and public investment budgeting
practices, are under consideration. Assuming a moderate sustained growth
in the developed countries, no major increases in international interest
rates, and continued Uruguayan progress toward improved demand management
policies, the country has the potential to grow during 1987-90, at average
rates similar to those of the mid-1970s.
15.       Exports of goods are expected to grow at about 51 a year during
1985-90, with the current account deficit of the balance of payments
declining to less than 1X of GDP in 1990. While export-oriented growth is
not new to Uruguay, the effort to expand exports that is now required must
be considerably more intensive than in the past to ease the severe
constraint on growth imposed by the high external debt service. Servicing
the debt will require a large share of domestic savings. As noted earlier
(para. 12), a stand-by arrangement, a multi-year commercial banks'debt
rescheduling, and the provision of fresh funds are expected to be in place
soon. The anticipated debt rescheduling would reduce the projected 1986
debt service ratio from 551 of exports of goods and services to 37Z. The
ratio is projected to fall further to 29Z by 1989. Given Uruguay's
demonstrated readiness to adopt the policies needed to enable it to service
its external debt, the country is considered creditworthy for the amounts
of external financing proposed.
PART II - BAlK OPERATIONS IN URUGUAY
16.       As of March 31, 1985, the Bank had made 23 loans to Uruguay,
amounting to US$496.0 million, of which 10 are not yet fully disbursed.
The undisbursed amount as of March 31, 1985 was US$193.6 million. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans. At the end of 1984, the Bank
held 5.2% of Uruguay's external public debt outstanding; its share -z the
service on this debt in 1984 was 6.6Z. As of March 31, 1985, IFC had
committed in Uruguay a total of US$27.8 million for five projects, of which
US$22.6 was in loans and US$5.2 million in equity. The total undis~9e
portion (all under the loan category) was US$8.0 million.
17.       Performance of Bank supported projects in Uruguay is generally
satisfactory for repeaters, such as in the highway sector. Despite delays,
it is expected that the Second Highway Project will be fully disbursed



- 7 -
within six years compared to the Bank LAC average of seven years.
Operations in new sectors have experienced initial delays, mostly because
it has taken the Government longer than expected to comply with
institutional covenants and because executing agencies have needed more
time than anticipated to become familiar with Bank procedures. These
factors have adversely affected the execution of operations in the
education, ports, and telecommnications sectors. By and large, these
problems havre been solved with increased supervision, and disbursements
should proceed satisfactorily. Disbursements of the agricultural and the
industrial credit operations have been adversely affected because of the
economic recession in Uruguay. Meanwhile, in the absence of alternative
lines of medium and long term credit, there has been considerable recent
improvement in commitment levels under the industrial credit.
18.      The new Uruguayan Government has embarked upon a comprehensive
stabilization program to reduce inflation, strengthen the balance of
payments, improve public sector finances, and reactivate the economy, which
is supported by a stand-by arrangement for SDR 122.85 million. Apart from
continuing strengthening public finances and controlling inflationary
pressures, Uruguay's highest development priority is to increase exports
and to improve resource allocation. Progress in this area will require
improvements in export incentives and continuing the tariff liberalization
process, followed by reductions of non-tariff barriers, and speeding up of
the restructuring and modernization of production facilities. Bank
lending, through two industrial credit operations, has provided critical
support to the Government's program to lower import barriers and reduce
price controls. The Government has requested Bank assistance to strengthen
Uruguay's export capacity, restructure the finances and modernize
industrial enterprises, improve public investment and budgeting processes,
and rationalize the social security system. The Bank is prepared to
support the Government reform programs in these areas.
19.      Second, Uruguay has not yet achieved the degree of institutional
development required to assure self-sustaining growth. In addition, its
upper and middle management, in both the public and the private sector,
need also to be adapted to the more pragmatic needs of a more open
economy. Some significant progress in these areas has been made, however,
with the help of the Bank. Power, telecommunications, and ports projects
supported by Bar loans are gradually improving operations of three of
Uruguay's oldest and most poorly managed agencies. Longstanding assistance
to the livestock sector has been instrumental in establishing a
high-quality extension service. Two recent industrial credit projects have
led to the establishment of an independent appraisal unit. Bank lending
for highways has enhanced transport planning capability. An ongoing Bank
supported vocational training and technological development project is also
helping to address the country's needs for trained manpower. Nevertheless,
institutional capacity and management training need further strengthening.
Future operations in the energy, water supply, and, possibly, railways
sectors would emphasize strengthening management capabilities and planning
processes, and reducing operating costs.



-8-
20.       Finally, agriculture is and will continue to be the mainstay of
Uruguay's economy. The sector's contribution to GDP and employment is
relatively modest, but it is of crucial importance as a foreign exchange
earner and a supplier of raw materials to domestic industry. The Bank has
hitherto concentrated on the livestock sector, particularly on
strengthening producer incentives, credit availability and ranch
management. The Bank has also been instrumental in setting up a solid
extension/appraisal institution, and, through the recently approved
Agricultural Sector Loan, in supporting increased exports of livestock and
livestock products, reducing price distortions, and improving regulatory
agencies. Future Bank involvement in agriculture will shift towards the
crop subsector, with particular attention to intensified livestock/crop
rotation techniques, more effective export promotion mechanisms, better
crop-oriented research services, and a more comprehensive crop extension
network. Projects under consideration would be geared to helping stabilize
producer incomes, enhancing productivity, and reducing soil erosion.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
21.       Uruguay has been one of the Latin American countries hardest hit
by the energy crisis. In 1984, oil imports amounted to about US$260
million or 28Z of export earnings. Pricing and taxation policies for oil
derivatives have aimed at reducing consumption. Domestic prices exceed
international levels. The price of gasoline is equivalent to about
US$2.8/gallon while the price of diesel oil is equivalent to
US$1.7/gallon. Lower taxes have been levied on diesel oil to avoid a
negative impact on the competitiveness of domestic industry and
agriculture. Because of these policies, additional conservation efforts
and a slowdown in economic activity, demand for oil products has fallen
significantly since 1979, while the use of electricity has risen by nearly
4Z per year.
22.       The countryts energy resources are limited:  it does not have
known oil or gas reserves and only small reserves of coal (with a high ash
content and low calorific value). There are some oil shale and peat
deposits, and there is an insignificant amount of fuelwood.  Hydropower
resources are few and, by and large, either already utilized or not
economical to develop at present fuel prices. Within the past six years
two large hydroprojects have come into operation: Salto Grande and
Palmar. Salto Grande (1,890 MW) is a binational project shared with
Argentina. It is located on the Uruguay River and started commercial
operations in 1979. At present Uruguay is entitled to 315 MW of Salto
Grande's output but it may exercise options to gradually increase its share
to 945 MW by 1995, Palmar (330 MW), located on the Rio Negro, started
operations in late 1982, and has been in full operation since early 1983.
The total present installed capacity in Uruguay is 1,282 MW, of which 881
MW (68Z) are provided by hydro resources and 401 MW (32%) by thermal



- 9 -
resources. Because of very favorable hydrological conditions during 1984,
UTE was able to meet most of the demand for electricity with hydro
generation, keeping its thermal installations as reserve.
Energy Sector Organization
23.       Most of Uruguay's energy sector is state controlled, and electric
power policy is determined by the Government, through the Ministry of
Industry and Energy (MIE). The most important operating entities are the
national petroleum company, Administracion Nacional de Cementos, Alcoholes
y Portland (ANCAP) and the power company, Administracion Nacional de Usinas
Y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE). Electricity rates are approved by
Presidential decree; the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Planning
and Budgeting office help determine their levels, with primary
decision-making powers vested in the latter.
24.       UTE (paras. 45-50) is organized as an autonomous public entity
(its Board of Directors is appointed by the Government) but its operations
are subject to legal and administrative constraints. UTE's budget has to
be approved by the Planning and Budgeting Office, which places legal
ceilings on the company's investments and expenditures. The Government
auditing agency (Tribunal de Cuentas) is responsible for ensuring that UTE
complies with budget and procurement legislation.
25.       The only other entity that now operates in the power sector is
the Ccmision Tecnica Mixta de Salto Grande (CTM). CTM was created in 1946,
and is an international organization governed by a Board composed of four
Argentine and four Uruguayan members, all appointed by their respective
Governments. CTM4 has built the Salto Grande hydroplant (para. 22), and is
responsible for its operation. CTM's bulk rates for the sale of
electricity are expected to decrease starting from 1992. Another entity,
Comision Mixta de Palmar (COMIPAL) was created in 1973 to build the El
Palmar hydroplant; after its completion, El Palmar was transferred to UTE
and COMIPAL was dissolved by Law 15.700 of January 10, 1985.
Energy Planning
26.       Formally, the Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE) is
responsible for long-range planning. After the 1973 oil price increase,
the Direccion Nacional de Energia was formed within the MIE to deal with
sector policies, but has not yet been able to play a significant role. So
far no systematic energy planning has been carried out, and the Government
has not defined a comprehensive energy policy.
27.       A recently completed Energy Sector Study (supported by the Bank,
para. 35) identified the technical and administrative assistance needs of
the MIE, proposed changes to its organizational structure, and made
recommendations to complete the data base required for the preparation of a
National Energy Plan. The Government has agreed (Loan 2484-UR) that it
would furnish to the Bank an action plan to implement the Study's



- 10 -
recommendations, including the timetable for the preparation of a National
Energy Plan, and that it would start carrying out the action plan by
December 31, 1985, after taking into account the Bank's comments.
The Power Market
28.       Over the last five years, power demand has grown at a faster rate
(8.9% p.a.) than energy demand (5.3% p.a.) reflecting a decrease in the
load factor and inefficient use of installed capacity. Implementation of a
revised tariff structure based on marginal costing, the first phase of
which is being financed by the Bank, is expected to reverse this trend and
improve the load factor. During the same period, industry's share in the
market fell from 39% to 33% while supply to residential users increased
from 43Z in 1979 to 48% in 1984. The growth pattern of generation by
different sources (hydro, thermal and purchase) has changed significantly.
The share of hydrogeneration increased from 46% in 1979 to a peak of 97.6%
in 1984, which was a year of unusually favorable hydrological conditions.
This trend is the result of the commissioning of the Salto Grande and
Palmar hydro plants in late 1979 and 1982 respectively, and of new
construction of transmission lines to the interior, where isolated areas of
the country were incorporated to the interconnected system.
29.       UTE delivers electricity to its consumers through a transmission
system of 2,809 kms operating at 500 kV, 150 kV, 110 kV, and 60 kV, a
primary distribution system of 14,800 kms operating at 30 kV, 15 kV, and 6
kV, and a secondary 220 kV distribution system comprising 10,900 kmi. The
system includes 32 substations (transmission level) with a total installed
capacity of 1,890 flVA and 158 substations (primary distribution level) with
a total installed capacity of 1,206 MVA. UTE has operated and maintained
its facilities efficiently.  However, the distribution system, particularly
in the area of Montevideo, is old and its reliability is not as great as
that of the transmission and subtransmission system. UTE's investment plan
therefore provides for expansion and improvement of the primary and
secondary distribution system. Furthermore, with Bank assistance, UTE will
carry out a comprehensive distribution system study including an analysis
of opportunities for loss reduction at medium and low voltage levels.
Energy Capacity Balance
30.       Forecasts based on regression analyses of demand for the
principal consumer categories during 1965-1984, indicate that aggregate
sales would grow from 3,019 GWh in 1984 to 4,283 GWh in 1993. The average
annual increase of slightly below 4% is close to the trend over the last
five years. Montevideo's demand is expected to grow slightly faster than
that of the country as a whole. The results of simulation studies, based
on hydrological conditions over a 70-year period (1908-1978) and very
conservative reliability criteria, indicate that additional thermal
generating capacity would be needed by 1989 in order to meet projected
demand. The present investment program does not provide for additional
generating capacity, however, pending completion of an Operation Planning
Study (para. 36).



- 11 -
31.       Under this Study, a comprehensive review of UTE's present
interconnected system model and practices will be carried out to ensure
effective utilization of existing facilities at a satisfactory level of
reliability under dry year conditions. Should the review establish that
demand would exceed reliable generating capacity during the planning
period, it might be more economical to exercise the option for increasing
Uruguay's share of Salto Grande's output (para. 22)
Power Sector Objectives and Strategy
32.       Since the oil price increases in the early 1970s, the
Government's key objective has been to reduce Uruguay's dependence on
imported fuel. In the power sector, its strategy has been aimed at
substituting hydro for thermal generation. The potential for this
substitution has now been substantially achieved with the construction of
the Salto Grande and El Palmar hydroplants. A generation development study
through the year 2000 made by independent consultants has shown that none
of the small hydro projects that have been identified can compete with
conventional thermal plants. Thus, future fuel savings will have to be
achieved through more efficient operation of UTE's generating plants and
distribution systems, loss reductions, and improved system planning and
demand manaement through pricing policies which take marginal costs into
account.
Bank Participation in the Sector
33.       The Bank has made six loans to Uruguay's power sector for a total
of US$110 million (1950, Loan 30-UR; 1955, Loan 132-UR; 1956, Loan 152-URB
1970, Loan 712-UR; 1979, Loan 1779-UR; and 1984, Loan 2484-UR).  The first
four loans have been fully disbursed. Achievements under the earlier
projects could not be sustained during the 70s, a period of severe social
conflict and dislocation, when the operation and finances of the power
sector deteriorated badly. The Project Performance Audit Report
(SecM78-867 of November 29, 1978) notes that progress towards meeting
institutional objectives under the Fourth Power Project was slow and
generally disappointing and that UTE did not comply with sooe of the loan
covenants.
34.       The Government and the Dank  made a fresh start to rehabilitate
the sector with the Fifth Power Project in 1979. In preparation of a new
project, the Bank Loan carried out a comprehensive review and recommended
various measures to strengthen the sector and improve UTE's performance.
Agreement in substance with the Government on all major issues led to the
Fifth Power Project Loan 1779-UR). The Government passed a new Electricity
Law and its corresponding regulations, approved new by-laws and
institutional arrangements for UTE, and set up a mechanism to allow
automatic tariff increases when input costs increase. Furthermore, under
the project, UTE set up a planning department and engaged consultants to
improve internal operations, to develop a long-range generation expansion
plan, and to provide training for its staff.



- 12 -
35.      Under Loan 1779-3UR the Bank financed consultant services for the
following studies: (a) an Energy Sector Study, which reviewed institutional
arrangements of the sector and developed a framework for energy planning
(para. 27); (b) a planning study, which resulted in a least cost
development plan to the year 2000 for electricity generation (para. 32),
and provided training to UTE's staff in planning techniques; this plan will
be reviewed under the operation planning study financed under Loan 2484-UR;
(c) a management study, which reviewed UTE's organization and operations
and provided recommendations on means to improve its efficiency; this
study has been successfully completed and its recommendations are being
implemented; and (d) a tariff study which resulted in recolmendations to
rationalize the tariff structure based on long-run marginal costs. These
recommendations would be implemented through Loan 2484-UR. Overall, UTE's
operations have measurably improved over the past few years. Project
completion of Loan 1779-UR is expected for December 1985, including 3.5
years delay.
36.      The recent Power Engineering Loan (2484-UR) is designed to
enhance the Bank's policy dialogue with the authorities on further reforms
in the power sector. It includes financing of the feasibility study for
the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra hydroplant (which has been already
completed), an Operation PlannIng Study, a distribution system study
(designed to reduce losses and to promote more economic operation and
expansion of generating facilities), and a training component to promote
management development. The proposed project would serve as a basis for
extending the Bank's cooperation and continued involvement in the action
program that will evolve from the studies the Bank has helped to finance.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37.      The proposed project was identified by Bank staff in Hay/June
1984. It was prepared in March 1985 and appraised in May/June 1985.
Negotiations were held in Washington on August 29, 1985. The Uruguayan
delegation was led by Mr. Rodolfo D'Amado, President of UTE. Special
conditions of the project are included in Annex III.
Development Program
38.      The proposed project is designed to support UTE's 1985-1993
development program for reliably meeting future power demand. The program
is expected to cost US$805 million (in current dollars). Of this total,
27Z would be for generation, 18% for transmission, 51% for distribution and
4% for miscellaneous investments. The generation program would consist
mainly of the respective item in the proposed project. The transmission
program mainly involves the components of the project, projects under
execution and other future extensions to meet demand growth in various
areas of the country. The distribution program would essentially involve
new connections, rehabilitation and expansion of networks in Montevideo and



- 13 -
extension of the 60 kV and 30 kV lines to various productive areas in the
interior of the country. The transmission and distribution components of
the proposed project have been selected for Bank financing on the basis of
their priority and status of preparation.
Project Objectives
39.       The project's main objectives are:
Ca) to reduce Uruguay's fuel consumption by strengthening the
operating efficiency of installed hydroelectric generation
capaci-ty;
(b) to improve the reliability of service in the country and to
connect areas with growing economic activity to the system grid;
(c) to strengthen UTE's financial position and managerial practices;
and
(d) more generally, to reinforce the Bank's policy dialogue on power
sector issues, following up on the recommendations of the studies
under execution (para. 35).
Project Description
40.       The project would include the following components:
(a) Rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra hydroplant. This component
consists of: replacement of electromechanical equipment in the
power plant (generators, turbines, voltage and speed regulators,
150 kV circuit breakers, transformers, power and control cables,
protective equipment and station service and auxiliaries);
replacement of mechanical equipment at the dam (gates, grillages
and related accessories); and minor civil works both in the power
house and dam;
Cb) Extension of the 500kV transmission system to the East. This
component consists of: 123 km of 500 kV lines from Montevideo to
San Carlos; 17 km of 150 kV line to connect the San Carlos
substation; and expansion of the 150 kV Montevideo and San Carlos
substations;
(c)  Extension of the 500 kV system in Montevideo and upgrading the
150 kV circuit ring. This component consists of: 20 km of 500 kV
transmission lines; 11 km of 150 kV lines, 25 km of 150 kV
underground lines, and related 500/150 kV and 150/30 kV
substations;
(d) Remodelling and upgrading of the 30 kV distribution network in
Montevideo. This component consists of: 70 km of underground 30
kV distribution lines; 160 MVA 30/6 kV substations; and 23 MVA
30/15 kV substations; and



- 14 -
(e) Consultant Services for project management and supervision.
Project Cost and Financing
41.       Total project cost including physical and price contingencies has
been estimated at about US$120.5 million, of which about US$80.1 million
would be foreign exchange. Total financing requirements, including US$17.6
million interest during construction, would be US$138.1 million.
42.       The cost data for the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra
hydroplant component are based on a feasibility study prepared by UTE's
consultants, Electricite de France, using prices at levels as of June
1985. Cost data for the transmission and distribution component of the
project estimates are based on a feasibility study prepared by UTE's
planning and construction staff using price levels prevailing in June
1985. Prices of equipment and materials for the transmission and
distribution component reflect UTE's recent experience with respect to
similar works. Costs include import duties (10) and taxes (16%).
Physical contingencies were calculated on the basis of 10% and 5% of the
base costs for the generation and transmission and distribution components
respectively. Price contingencies were applied using the following annual
expected international price increases: 5% for 1985; 7.5% for 1986; 8% for
1987-1990 and 5% for 1991-1992. It was assumed that exchange rate
adjustments would reflect the difference between internal and external
inflation.
43.       The financing scheme for the proposed project would include this
proposed loan of $45.2 million (the A-Loan) to finance the foreign exchange
component of the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra hydroplant and
cofinancing by means of a B-Loan of $52.5 million, to finance the
transmission and distribution components. Commercial banks have expressed
interest in participating in a cofinancing operation. UTE would finance
the remaining US$40.4 million from cash generation. The A-Loan would
finance the foreign exchange requirements of the Gabriel Terra
rehabilitation, equivalent to 33% of total project cost. The B-Loan,
possibly including a Bank a guarantee of principal payments maturing in the
outer years, would cover the foreign exchange requirements of the
transmission and distribution component, or 38% of total project costs.
Interest during construction on both loans would be financed in view of the
heavy financial burden imposed on UTE by the implementation of its ongoing
investment program and servicing of its external debt.
44.       UTE would be the Borrower of the proposed A-Loan.  The Uruguayan
Government is expected to be the Borrower of the proposed B-Loan. The
proceeds of this loan would be onlent to UTE, as required, on the same
terms and conditions; UTE would bear the exchange and interest rate
risks. The Government intends to deposit the B-Loan proceeds into an
account in the Central Bank and make them available as and when needed for
the purposes of the project. Thus, the Bank would retain the right to



- 15 -
withhold funds from the A-Loan if there were any difficulties with the use
or replenishment of funds for the project components financed under the
B-Loan (Section 6.01 (b) of draft Loan Agreement).
The Borrower
45.       The Borrower of the proposed A-Loan would be the Adminiscracion
Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE), a separate legal entity
owned by the Uruguayan Government which is responsible for public power
supply in the country. UTE's organization is satisfactory; it is governed
by a full-time, five-member Board of Directors with its President acting as
Chief Executive Officer. The present President is a former UTE Planning
Manager, with more than twenty years' experience with the company. The
General Manager and other senior staff are also career executives.
46.       To improve UTE's efficiency and flexibility, management
consultants carried out a comprehensive organization and administration
study whose recommendations have been, or are in the process of being,
implemented (para. 35). One of the main consequences has been the
recognition by UTE's management of training needs in order to provide
continuity to institution-building efforts.
47.       UTE presently employs about 10,600 people (representing about 84
consumers per employee), which include 225 professional staff, i.e. about
2Z of the workforce employees. Though this represents an improvement over
the situation a few years ago, there is still an imbalance between
professional and non-professional staff. Many senior managers are close to
retirement age, so there is also a need to develop middle and junior
management. Further steps are needed to attract qualified professionals.
Under the Power Engineering Project, agreement was reached on a training
program for management. Under Loan 1779-UR, UTE engaged Price Waterhouse
to conduct a salary survey. The survey showed that, in 1982, the salaries
of professional and managerial staff would have had to be increased
significantly to be competitive with the private sector. At that time,
some modest corrections were implemented. At present, economic conditions
in the country have reduced professional turnover and external employment
opportunities are limited; UTE has consequently been able to maintain and
increase its professional staff. During project supervision, however,
special attention should be paid to ensuring that appropriate compensation
policies are followed.
48.       UTE's commercial systems have been improving in recent years.
Staff are still in the process of developing expertise in financial
planning; significant improvements have been achieved in the past few
years. Accounting, budgeting and billing systems are adequate, as are
insurance policies and practices. Under previous loans, UTE agreed to
engage independent external auditors to audit its accounts and assist in
developing internal auditing capabilities; the results were satisfactory.
The loan documents for the proposed project would repeat the covenant of
earlier loan agreements that UTE should have its accounts audited by
independent auditors (Section 5.01 (b) of draft Loan Agreement).



- 16 -
49.       UTE's inventory management is poor and a program for improvement
is underway. The absence of a well-structured inventory policy and the
need to strengthen inventory management are acknowledged by UTE's Board and
staff, and are emphasized at every opportunity by both internal and
external auditors. Also, there has been significant overstocking in the
last two fiscal years, which is reflected in the projection of working
capital requirements for 1985-93. To tackle the problem, an internal group
was created to deal with procurement and internal control matters, but UTE
agrees that further improvements are necessary. Under Loan 2484-UR, UTE
agreed to submit to the Bank an action plan for improving inventory
management, and to implement it, after taking into account the Bank's
comments, by October 31, 1985.
50.       By the end of 1984, UTE had reduced its overall average
collection period to 60 billing days, compared with a covenanted 75 days
under Loan 1779-UR; the collection period for private consumers was 45
days. Public sector accounts receivable were further reduced in later
1984, following discussions with the Bank and a plan was submitted to
reduce the billing period to the covenanted 75 days under the loan. As of
December 31, 1984, the collection period for public sector accounts was
about 135 days; this represented a significant improvement compared to the
355 days in 1982, although still short of the 75 days. UTE agreed to
maintain the 75 days target agreed upon in Loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR and
the Government agreed on an action plan to settle its accounts payable to
UTE within the following terms: by December 31, 1985, not more than 120
days; by June 30, 1986, not more than 90 days and by December 31, 1986 and
thereafter, not more than 75 days (Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee
Agreement).
Finances
51.       Since 1977, UTE's financial results have fluctuated in response
to changes in Government economic and tariff policies, but on balance its
financial performance has been adequate. The rate of return exceeded the
level covenanted under loan 1779-UR until 1979; after deteriorating in
1980-82 performance, began to improve again in 1983. In this year
COMIPAL's assets (US$600 million: US$546 million in respect of El Palmar
hydroplant and transmission lines, and US$54 million of current assets)
were transferred to UTE and US$ 594 million of debts (most of which mature
in the next 5 years) were added to UTE's liabilities; the remaining US$6
million was a Government equity contribution. Despite this increase in it:.
debt, UTE's debt equity ratio is still at a satisfactory 50:50 level.
52.       During 1983 and 1984, UTE's financial performance improved
substantially.  Although the rates of return achieved in these years, 2.8B
and 3.8% respectively, were lower than the rates covenanted under Loan
1779-UR, UTE's financial performance was respectable, given the economic



- 17 -
difficulties the country was facing. The recent record also represents
significant progress from the negative returns of 1981 and 1982,
especially since asset revaluation and the transfer of the El Palmar
assets resulted in a significantly higher rate base than expected during
the appraisal of Loan 1779-UR (para. 57(b)).
53.       UTE's operational financial needs are linked to exchange rate
changes (energy purchases from CTN, fuel costs, maintenance supplies and
debt service) and to domestic price changes. Timely adjustments of tariffs
to compensate for exchange rate variations and domestic cost increases are
essential for maintaining in real terms the financial balance which
requires an average tariff level of about 6 US cents/kWh in mid-1985
prices. Periodic adjustments that are allowed by current legislation were
incorporated in agreements with the Bank under Loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR,
and would be repeated in the proposed loan (Section 5.02 of draft Loan
Agreement). The new Government's w.llingness to comply with both the
legislation and agreements with the Bank was demonstrated in two tariff
increases of 301 and 181 carried out in last April and July respectively,
which took the average tariff level slightly over 6 US cents/kWh.
54.       The restructuring of El Palmar debt service is a matter of
priority. The Government and UTE agreed that if the El Palmar debt were
not satisfactorily restructured with commercial banks in line with UTE's
cash generating capacity, then it would be restructured through an
agreement satisfactory to the Bank between the Government and UTE. The end
result of such restructuring would be to provide financial relief to UTE.
The agreement would be in place 30 days after loan signing (Section 6.01(c)
of the draft Loan Agreement). As a consequence, the obligation under Loan
2484-UR on the ratio of funds from internal sources to capital expenditures
is no longer necessary because it has been superseded by the above
agreement (Section 5.06 (ii) of the draft Loan Agreement).
55.       UTE's investment program and financing plan for 1985-1993 period
is summarized below:

56.       During the preparation of the Fifth Power Project, UTE and the
Bank agreed on the regulations to the Electricity Law which state that: (a)
UTE's tariffs will be set on the basis of a target rate of return (not
lower than 6Z) on a rate base consisting of average revalued net fixed
assets in operation and a provision for working capital; and (b) UTE may
request tariff adjustments to take into account changes in operating
costs. The target rate of return under Loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR is 7.5%
provided that if in any one year the rate of return is below 7.5Z, but
above 6Z, the difference may be made up in the following year. Connection
fees are not to be considered as operating income, since provisions of the
Electricity Law stipulated that they would be refundable.
57.       The Bank, the Government and UTE agreed to amend the rate of
return covenants in the following manner:
Ca) connection fees would be treated as operating income as long as
they are not refundable. Under current legislation, this will be
the case until December 1986 (Section 5.02 (a) of the draft Loan
Agreement and para. 2 of Schedule 5 thereto);
(b) the rate base would now be defined as average net fixed assets in
operation revalued in a mnnner satisfactory to the Bank and
excluding provisions for working capital (Section 5.02(a) of the
draft Loan Agreeuent and para. 3 of Schedule 5 thereto).
(c) the rate of return would be not less than 6Z, and any shortfall
would be made up the following year. UTE would review annually,
before October 31, whether it would meet the rate of return
requirement in the current year and in the next year and would
prepare an appropriate action plan. UTE would also submit to the
Bank quarterly financial reports on rate of return and tariffs
(Section 5.02 (b) and (c) of draft Loan Agreement).



- 19 -
The 6% rate is lower than that covenanted under Loan 1779-UR; it is
justified since: (i) average revenues for kWh resulting from the 6% rate of
return are in the range of the incremental cost for the 1985-93 investment
program; and (ii) the company will contribute a very satisfactory 45% from
self-generation of funds to the financing of its 1985-93 investment
program.
5.       To ensure UTE's satisfactory financial performance, the Bank, the
Government and UTE agreed to repeat with minor changes the following
covenants of loans 1779-UR and 2484-UR; (a) if the debt service coverage
ratio were less than 1.5, UTE would not incur any long-term debt unless the
Bank otherwise agreed; (b) until the completion of the project, UTE would
retain all its earnings; {c) the collection period of Government accounts
receivable would be maintained at vithin 75 days; and (d) the Government
would undertake to compensate UTE for losses arising from damages not
covered by UTE's external insurance policies or its self-insurance fund
(Sections 5.06 (i) and 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement, and 3.03 of the
draft Guarantee Agreement).
59.       To ensure adherence to the proposed financing plan until the
project is completed, UTE agreed not to undertake without the Bank's prior
agreement investments (excluding those for the project) that would exceed
in any year 3% of the gross value of the company's fully revalued fixed
assets in service (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
60.       UTE's forecasts show its finances strengthening in the period
1985-1993. The self-financing ratio is expected to average 45% during the
period and the debt/equity ratio would improve from 47/53 in 1985 to 24/76
in 1993.
Implementation and Supervision
61.       UTE's Planning Division would serve as a Project Unit to execute
the project. The Government and UTE have agreed to maintain this Unit
until project completion (Section 3.01tb) of draft Loan Agreement).
Consulting services will be required to assist UTE in the preparation of
bidding documents for a 150/30 kV package unit substation and revision of
design criteria for the 500 kV transmission lines. Consultants for this
purpose should be engaged no later than June 1986. Erection of
electromechanical equipment for the Gabriel Terra hydroplant would be
carried out by UTE's force account with the assistance of specialized
personnel provided by the mnanufacturer and the consultant. Supervision of
this portion of the project would be done through consultants (Section 3.02
of the draft Loan Agreement and Section II of Schedule 4 thereto).
Procuremen: and Disbursement
62.       Procurement of goods to be financed from the proposed loan would
be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Procurement of goods and services to be
financed from the B-Loan are expected to be consistent with the Bank's



- 20 -
guidelines. Goods and construction works to be financed by UTE would be
procured through UTE's normal procedures, which require competitive bidding
for both local and international procurement. The Bank found UTE's
procurement procedures to be consistent with the principles of economy and
efficiency. Consultants' services for project engineering and management
would be selected from a short list of consulting firms following Bank
guidelines and appointed under terms and conditions approved by the Bank.
63.       The proposed loan would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods, or 842 of the
ex-factory cost for local goods for the generation component of
the project;
(b) 1002 of foreign expenditure and 84% of local expenditure for
consulting services; and
(c) interest and other charges during construction.
Disbursements requests would be fully documented. The closing date would
be June 30, 1993, six months after estimated completion of the project.
Environmental Aspects
64.       No environmental problems are expected.  The Gabriel Terra
hydroplant is an existing plant which has not posed environmental
problems. The facilities to be constructed are of standard design for
which the necessary easements are provided. They would be underground and
in substation buildings in Montevideo, and of the standard overhead type in
the interior. UTE intends to route lines and locate substations so as to
minimize their visual impact in a manner consistent with economic and
financial considerations.
Benefits and Risks
65.       The project has no special technical risks.  The justification of
the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra Pant, which would be financed under
the A-Loan, would not be affected by a delay in the execution of the other
components of the project should the proposed B-Loan be delayed or not
materialize. In this sense, while immediate financing would not be
available, the Government and UTE would pursue alternative possibilities of
financing, including the IDB, bilateral credits, and possibly the Bank in
connection with another project.
66.       The estimated rate of return on the project's power generation
component alone (Gabriel Terra Rehabilitation) exceeds 35%. The benefits
of the project as a whole cannot be computed separately from UTE's
investment program; that program is estimated to yield an overall rate of
return of 11.9%. This calculation is based on incremental electricity
sales valued by the current average tariff as a minimum measure of
consumer's willingness to pay. The project's wider socioeconomic benefits
are not captured by the rate of return calculations; these benefits include



- 21 -
social benefits derived from increased residential and community
electricity use and the indirect gains to industry and commerce, whose
output and employment depend on reliable electricity supply. The 11.9Z
rate of return should thus be seen as a minimum measure of the expected
benefits of the project.
67.       Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to determine the effect on
the rate of return calculations of variations in key parameters. The
analyses showed inter alia that a 1OZ increase in investment costs would
lower the rate of return to 10.42, while a 10% reduction in benefits, which
is very unlikely, would lower the rate to 9.52. Additionally, the
sensitivity of the rate of return to a two year delay in the implementation
of the transmission and distribution component was examined; the estimated
impact on the associated benefits was calculated to lower the program's
rate of return by less than one percentage point.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
68.       The draft Loan Agreement between UTE and the Bank, Guarantee
Agreement between the Republic Oriental del Uruguay and the Bank, and the
report of the Committee provided in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Bank's Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section
III of Annex III.
69.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDTIONS
70.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
